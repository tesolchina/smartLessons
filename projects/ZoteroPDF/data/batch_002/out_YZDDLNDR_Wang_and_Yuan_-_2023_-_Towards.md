Higher education

As a growing phenomenon in higher education, English medium instruction (EMI) places high demands on content area teachers regarding linguistic proficiency, content knowledge, and pedagogical strategies. To improve EMI practice and facilitate EMI teachers' continuing development, a focus on teacher expertise thus becomes imperative. Focusing on an intrinsic case, this study investigates the attributes of an EMI teacher's expertise and its influencing factors in the field of law at a Chinese university. Drawing on data from semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and artifacts, the study reveals three critical dimensions of the teacher's expertise: 1) maximizing the power of language, 2) facilitating disciplinary socialization, and 3) empathizing with students in the EMI learning process. Meanwhile, the three atributes functioned in a continuous, reflective, and collaborative manner entangling with the teacher's continuous learning, agentive reflection, and social interactions within the disciplinary community. The paper concludes with practical suggestions in relation to both EMI teaching and teacher development.

# 1. Introduction

In recent years, higher education instutions situated in non-English speaking contexts worldwide have been fervently promoting English medium instruction (EMI), fueled by the trend of internationalization (Lasagabaster, 2022). This phenomenon has motivated an increased research interest in examining the EMI phenomenon from multiple perspectives, from the macro-level of the higher education landscape to the micro-level practices such as EMI teachers' classoom teaching and students learning proceses (e.g, Dafouz et al., 2018; Lo & Lo, 2014). Among the large bulk of studies, many researchers (e.g., O'Dowd, 2018; Yuan et al., 2020) have reported the challenges content-area teachers faced in teaching EMI courses with respect to linguistic, cultural, pedagogical, and professional dimensions. In particular, the difficult of using a second/foreign language to teach disciplinary knowledge and the tension around balancing content and language learning have been constantly reported in the literature (e.g., Macaro & Han, 2020; Manan et al., 2022), partially owing to EMI teachers' lack of rich linguisic knowledge and up-todate disciplin-specific pedagogical competence (Yuan et al., 2020).

Arguably, quality EMI programs should provide sufficient input and support, which can allow students to learn the content and improve language competence in a specific discipline. This puts a great demand on EMI teachers concerning their linguistic competence and disciplinary knowledge as part of their teaching expertise (Dearden & Macaro, 2016; Qiu & Fang, 2022; Zhang, 2018) However, to date, we know ittle about the attribute of EMI teachers' expertise, and limited empirical studies have touched upon this topic. To fill the void, this paper reports on an intrinsic case study that explores the atributes and influencing factors of an EMI teacher's expertise in a Chinese universty. The intrinsic case study approach is often employed when the researcher has a genuine interest in the case with uniqueness and particularization (Stake, 1995) and thus intends to examine and understand the case itself (Creswell et al., 2007). While EMI intruction is generally undertaken by content teachers with restricted English ability (Richards & Pun, 2021) or without expertise in integrating a language focus into their teaching practice (Yuan et l., 2020), the participant of the study - Lan (pseudonym)- has a dual educational background in both language and law. From the frst author's itia communication with Lan before the study, she has been exploring content-language integration in her courses over the past ten years. An investigation of her professonal experiences and expertise, therefore, might reveal unique findings about how EMI teachers handle the complexity and dynamics involved in EMI instruction and see continuing improvement in specific diciplinary contexts. Such findings can further add new insights into EMI teacher expertise as an underexplored topic while providing practical implications for EMI teaching and teacher development in applied linguistics and higher education.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. EMI teaching and teachers

English medium instruction (EMI) is defined as the use of the English language to teach academic subjects (other than English itself i countries or jurisdictions where the firt anguage of the majority of the population is not English" (Macaro et al., 2018, p. 37) Scholars worldwide have responded to the growing EMI phenomenon and expanding the research field through exploring policy implementation, program development, belefs and practices of students and teachers, and so forth (see Macaro et al., 2018 for a comprehensive review).

As the core members of the EMI communit, EMI students and teachers have been widely surveyed and interviewed regarding their perspectives and preferences for effective EMI instruction (Hu & Lei, 2014; Qiu & Fang, 2022; Zhang, 2018). For example, Qiu and Fang (2022) explored 101 Chinese undergraduate tudents perceptions of EMI content teachers and pointed out that students favored interactive teaching approaches with diverse clasroom activities and various modalitie of communication with a primary focus on content. simila study on intenational undergraduates revealed that students preferred learner-oriented interactie approaches with innovative teaching methods, meaningful in-class activities, and practical teaching materials (Zhang, 2018). As for EMI teachers, they were reported to value a suficiently high level of English to teach complex constructs (Dearden & Macaro, 2016) and a diversified use of diffrent strategies (e.g, code-switching and rephrasing) to prevent potential confusion and facilitate efective knowledge communication (Jiang et al., 2019).

Indeed, efective EMI teaching requires a wide range of pedagogical skills and strategies for language content integration. EMI teachers often need to constantly infuse the acquisition of language and content with an awareness of English as a global language and experiment with a variety of learning activities in their specific fields to maximize their students' learning outcomes (Yuan et al., 2020). For instance, Macaro and Han's (2020) study highlighted EMI teachers knowledge of specific disciplines and their abilit to "translate such expertise in teaching through L2 (p. 226). To achieve that, translanguaging, as a powerful tool for meaning-making and content learning (Li, 2018), has been advocated by EMI researchers to help create a dialogic space for students to cognitively and emotionally engage in knowledge co-construction (Itoi & Mizukura, 2023; Williams, 2023). For example, in astudy conducted in a Korean EMI setting, students L1 was used by their intructors to resolve expression challenges and enhance their access o content knowledge (Williams, 2023).

Disciplinary learning is closely intertwined with the proces of socialization, where teachers can employ various semiotic resources (e.g., ifferent languages and discourse acts to familiaize students with specific thinking patterns, cultural values and norms, and to foster their professional identities in acommunity of practice (van Maanen & Schein, 1977). Socialization can take various forms. For example, Goodman and Montgomery (2020) found that EMI students in Kazakhstan were scaffolded with multiple socialization tools such as prior knowledge, teacher feedback, and course activities, through which students internalized communicative styles, professional vales, and identitiesofther disciplines. In another study conductd by Baffy (2017), tw profesors in a U.. universit were found to juggle between legal discourse and language learning discourse to help students develop not only English language proficiency but aso discursive self-positionings as legal professinals (e.g, a lawyer and a prosecutor), with an aim to foster students socialization into the legal academic community. The experience f socialization, however, is not limited to classroom teaching. Some scholars (e.g., Richards et al., 2020) have proposed that teachers can also facilitate students socialization by coordinating field ex periences, where students can develop authentic relationships with professionals in the field, internalize the culture and value in an occupation, and understand the sociopolitical realities of the workplace.

In general, existing iterature has pinpointed English proficiency, disciplinary knowledge, and pedagogical skill as prominent elements f effctive EMI teaching (Macaro & Han, 2020). Such a synthesized understanding serves as a frame of reference in guiding our inquiry into EMI teachers' expertise as an underexplored area in language education and higher education.

# 2.2. Understanding teacher expertise

The traditional approach to studying teacher expertise (e.g., equating expertise with teaching experience) was severely criticized by researchers as some teachers are merely \*experienced non-experts (Tsui 2003, p. 194). Instead of stratifying teachers based on their experience and intitutional evaluation, researchers redirected to a more proces-oriented viewpoint that emphasized teachers constant knowing, acting, and becoming experts (e.g., Tui, 2009). eacher expertise, in this sense, is defined as  highly personalized and domain-specific repertoire of knowledge, beliefs, and values manifested by teachers practices in their stuated contexts (Lee & Yuan, 2021; Smith, 2005).

During the past several decades, there has been a surge of research interest in teacher expertise (see van Dijk et al., 2020 for a systematic review). Due to the elusive nature of this concept, empirical studies focused on teacher expertise mainly as atributes, components, or characteristics that work collaboratively and synergisticall in teachers daily practices. For example, in language education, Tsui (2009) pinpointed several strategies employed by expert teachers in clasroom teaching, such as responding flexibly to students' needs and responses, managing the pace of interactions by improvision, and fully utilizing various resources available to facilitate efective edagogical practies. Siilrly, Farll (2013) as identified fie igficant ariute f EL techer expertise: knowledge f lenrs and erning, engagment i criticl rflection, accessto past expriences, informed leson lnnng, and active student involvement. For example, expert teachers are more likely to promote students \*socializing (Farrll, 2013, p. 147) and anticipate potential acculturation challenges in classroom teaching.

Based on the review, it is clear that teachers strategic actions in classroom teaching are considered a critical externalized index for their expertise (Anderson & Taner, 2023; van Dijk et l., 2020; Yuan & Yang, 2022). For instance, through a synthesi of 106 empirical studies on teacher expertise, Anderson and Taner (2023) built aprototype of expert teachers in which teachers pedagogical practices (e.g., teachers contextualized strategies to engage leaners, convey content, and rais questions) accounted for the largest category of their expertise. Meanwhile, the two teacher educators in Yuan and Yang's (2022) study also adopted diffrent on-site trategies (e.g, emotional regulation) to maneuver their pedagogical innovations within the specific context, constituting a critical component of thir expertise. Therefore, although the specific strategies adopted by teachers in their lassroom teaching and social ineractions are not teacher expertise per s,they undoubtedly can offer rich insights into the nature and composition of teacher expertise as an abstract concept, both practically and methodologically.

Another critical observation derived from the existing literature is the emergent and adaptive nature of teacher expertise (Burns 2022; Hirvela, 2020; Le & Yuan, 2021). An emergent viewpoint, instead of labeling teachers with any definite category (e.g., novice or expert), llows for \*fluctuations" (Burns, 2022) of expertise as teachers accumulate practical experience, engage in professional learning, and adjust their career development in different educational setings. As demonstrated in Yuan and Yang's (2022) study, a teacher educator, Mark, actively engaged in reflctive thinking to enhance his knowledge base of teacher education and innovate his classrom teaching. This testifie to the emergent and evolving feature of teacher expertise entangled with progressie learning and instructional practices in the situated context. Meanwhile, the adaptive nature points to the teachers' "ongoing exploration and expansion of what they know and thus make adjustments in how they teach" (Hirvela, 2020, p. 17) within contextualized exigencies. This viewpoint highlights that teacher expertise seems to be developed as a continuous proces and functions adaptively as teachers engage in daily practices and interact with shifting contexts (Tsui, 2009; Yuan & Yang, 2022).

To our knowledge, to date, there is no empirical research on EMI teachers' expertise as well as the mediating factors that might contribute to their expertise. Given that EMI intruction \*entails MI teachers dual expertise in both content and language instruction" (Jiang et al., 2019, p. 108) and the multiple challenges EMI teachers ften face in instruction, it i of geat importance to explore the prominent atributes of their expertise and the underlying factors at personal and environmental lels. This study aims to investigate an EMI teacher's expertise in a Chinese university, focusing on two research questions.

1) What are the attributes of the participant's expertise in EMI instruction?   
2) What factors influenced the participant's expertise in her situated context?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Research site and participant

The study belongs to alarger project that investigates EMI teacher development in higher education. The study was conducted at a universty in the northern part of China. The university has employed a variety of measures to promote EMI intruction. One of the attempts was to build elective EMI courses for undergraduates ofall major e.g., law, marketing, and business management), such as Demographic Sociology, Business Management Simulation, and Human Rights Protection.

One of the participants in the larger project, Lan, was purposively selected as the focal case of this study. Lan received a B.A. in English and M.A. in translation. She has worked for her current university as an English teacher since 2004. In 2006, she decided to pursue a doctoral degre in international law, with no prior specialized knowledge and successully obtained the degree in 2009. Since then, Lan has taught EMI courses like legal contracts and international arbitration at the university.

An intrinsic case study focuses on the case itself (e.g.,evaluating a program or studying a student having difficulty) because it presents an unusual or unique situation (Creswell et al., 2007). As such, the case of our study can help illustrate matters that are difficult to reveal or overlooked in previous EMI instruction research. Lan was chosen as our focal participant and identified as an intrinsic case for the following reasons. First, insted of identifying Lan as an expert teacher a priori, we eek to trace the appropriate markers' that an expert teacher may posses (Palmer et al., 2005, p. 17). For instance, with respect to social recognition and performance crteria, Lan is highly pried and well-respected in the universty among fculty leaders, colleagues, as well astudents. She scored high in course evaluations and received teaching awards from the school multiple times. Second, due to Lan's educational background in both language and law, she was able to provide unique information (Creswell et a., 2007) relating to EMI expertise that might otherwise be dificult to obtain in typical EMI instructional scenarios. She also belonged to the first cohort of teachers who designed and offered EMI courses at the university. With her over ten year of EMI teaching experience, we consider Lan an appropriate case with the potential to generate rich and valuable insights into EMI teacher expertise.

# 3.2. Data collection

This study, which lasted for one academic semester from March to June 2021, collected data from multiple sources, including semi structured interviews, clasroom observations, and artifacts (teaching matrials, policy documents, observation notes, and reflection notes). With research consent gained from Lan, the first semi-structured interview was conducted at the beginning of the semester. The interview questions centered around Lan's previous larning and teaching experience nd professional background. The following two interviews were scheduled in between the classroom observations. The interview questions were formulated by examining previous literature on teacher expertise (e.g., van Dijk et al., 2020; Yuan & Yang, 2022) and the preliminary observation data. Specifically, Lan was asked about several facts of her I instruction, such as the use f language, course design, material preparation, students need classrom interactions, and so on. Each of the thre interviews lasted for around half an hour and was conducted in Chinese to avoid potential language barrer. During the interviews, the first author assumed the role of a facilitator to probe into details of Lan's experiences and expertise. All the interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed verbatim.

During the academic semester, Lan's EMI courses were observed to understand her expertise in instructional practices. Considering her availabilit, two courses (.., Legl Conract and Intnational Commercil Arbitration) were observed by the first author. The course Legal Contract was built for undergraduate students to familiarize themselves with the esential elements and legal isues involved in drafting, signing, and interpreting a legal contract, while the International Commercial Arbitration focused more on legal documents involved in intenational commercial business. Both courses were ofered to undergraduate students of various majors with adequate English language proficiency, i.., passng the Collge English Test - Band 6 (equal to CFR B2). Through the negotiation with Lan, the observations covered three consecutive sessions in each course, which were audio-recorded with observation notes taken.

Furthermore, artifacts were collcted in order to ensure data triangulation. Policy documents from the universty and the faculty were collcted from the official websites to provide background information about the EMI policy and norms at the research sit. As a vital dimension of Lan's instructional practices, the teaching materials of the two observed courses were collcted with her consent for examining her pedagogical knowledge and practice pertinent to her EMI expertise. Other artifacts, including the reearcher reflection notes and observation notes, were also gathered and cross-checked for data triangulation.

# 3.3. Data analysis

Before analysis, the audio recordings of interviews and classoom observations were transcribed by the first author and sent to the participant to check for accuracy. The transcripts, along with other artifacts such as policy documents, teaching materials, and observation notes, composed the dataset for analysis.

The dataset was analyzed following a reflective thematic approach (Braun & Clarke, 2021). To begin with, the first author familiarized himself with the dataset by reading and re-reading th interview transcrits, listening to the classroom recordings, and making analytic notes when applicable. Meanwhile he also immersed himself in the relevant literature on teacher expertise (e., Farrel, 2013; van Dijk et al., 2020), which helped him to engage with the content of data critically. Then, he coded the dataset thoroughly and systematicall. Specifically, he identified meaningful segments of data that apeared relevant to the two research questions and gave pithy labels to them. For example, Lan stated in interviews, "Both English and law are important instruments like the two ends of a balance, and lacking either of them would be detrimental. This excerpt was coded as Lan's teaching belief of the content and language in EMI.

Following that, the first author collated the clusters of codes and cross-checked them to generate candidate themes that could potentially addressthe research questions. For instance, together with Lan's teaching belief of the content and language in EMI, Lan's explicit focus and explanation of the English language in classrom teaching and her design of language-mediated disciplinary learning in teaching materials were extracted as evidence of her expertise in content-language integration. Finall, th firt author engaged in the process of reviwing and reining theme. ifically, he aessed the releance and fitnssof the canddate thmes to the research questions and made further revisions to organize the themes. For example, the candidate theme \*content-language integration' seemed too generic and was reorganized into \*maximizing the power of language' to better capture the uniqueness of the EMI teacher's expertise. Ulimately, the analysis yielded three atributes of Lan's EMI expertise see the Findings section) and its influ encing factors, i.e., previous learning experience and teaching practices, continuous reflection and learning, and interpersonal in teractions with the community members.

Several measures were taken to improve the trustworthiness of the study. First, multiple data sources - including interview transcripts classroom recordings, and artifact - were cross-checked and compared for data triangulation. Second, the participant was invited to check and comment on the translated transcripts and preliminary codes to ensure the accuracy of interpretation (Stake. 1995, p.115). Third, the two authors engaged in constant discussions with a critical and reflctive stance during data analysis. To enhance inter-coder reliability and reduce potential bias, part of the original data i., one interview, one classoom audio recording, and one file of course material) was also coded by the second author, who engaged i critical discusson with the irt author. When disagreements arose, the original data and existing literature on teacher expertise were revisited, and extensive discussions were conducted until a consensus was reached. For example, several instances of Lan's Chinese translation of legal terminologies were initilly discarded as irrelevant by the first author. The second author pointed out that such translated texts can be viewed as Lan's translanguaging acts, and we later agreed to code them as acrucial strategy that Lan used to facilitate students disciplinary learning.

# 4. Findings

This section presents the major findings generated from the data. First, based on the first research question, the three essential attributes of Lan's EMI instructional expertise were demonstrated. Then, the various personal and contextual factors that influenced her expertise were presented to answer the second question.

4.1. Research question 1: what are the attributes of the participant's expertise in EMI instruction?

# Maximizing the power of language: "from the first letter to the full stop"

Lan's expertise in EMI instruction was irs evident in her continuous fforts to maximize the power of language in instruction. As an EMI teacher of the law, she firmly believed that \*both English and law are important instrument, like the two ends of a balance, and lacking either of them would be detrimental (Interview-1). Therefore, in EMI teaching, Lan paid explicit atention to the words, structres, and sometimes even the punctuation marks in drafting legal ontracts. For instance in one session, Lan devoted much of the class ime to decomposing the words and phrases she had underlined or marked (see Fig. 1) in order to show students the importance of the English language in a legal contract.

According to the classrom observation, Lan's teaching began with her question to elicit students opinions on the crucial sections of a legal contract (\*What are the most important clauses in legal provisions?"). She provided several options, i.e, rights and obligations, but then denied these answers and directed students' atention to the language use (But the real problem lie in those things that don't sem to be partcularly important.) Specificall, she intrprted the unequal tats f the three conjunctions (We could see that this term includes three or' as I underlined, but only the first two of them are important). Then she drew on authentic cases to illustrat the importance of the twoconjunction phrases (.e. uting from" and directly afect) and emphasized that, In 1978 the judge believed that these two phrases indicated a direct causal relationship". She also reminded students that sometimes a minor change of words could exert detrimentaleffects on both partie of acontract and concluded by asking, \*Can you sense the accuracy of the language used in this example and how important it is in a lawsuit?". In this way, students were provided with abundant opportunities and guidance to acquire the necessary legal knowledge while at the same time developing a metalinguistic awareness through appreciating the power of language in legal proceedings.

![](img/a709a5b2d825d0858a537962f897cec44f79cd04f4e5bc3e247ff58bfa613030.jpg)  
Fig. 1. One slide of Lan's classroom teaching materials.

In addition, the slide showcased Lan's expertise in language and content integration. As Fig. 1 exhibits, although clause two was directly adopted from a legal contract, Lan revised it with an enhanced spotlight on language use. Specifically, she used a bolded, underlined format to highlight three parallel structures, intending to guide students to examine the linking word - or. Moreover, she used red and blue colors to explain how plain and ordinary phrases can entail sgificant meanings in a contract. Therefore, through the analysis of a complicated clause and its embedded language details students would be able to deepen their understanding of the language use involved in a legal document.

During her EMI teaching, Lan also related to many down-to-earth events in daily life as well as everyday language to elucidate ambiguous legal relations. Such a strategy in classrom teaching constitutes an important component of her expertise. The classroom observations indicated that she used "buying steamed buns", studying abroad", and "online shopping" as examples to help students understand inspection clauses and carriage contracts involved in international law. For instance, the following episode illustrated how she interpreted scientific concepts (i.e., contractual disputes) based on simple daily examples.

Lan: \*We can have various types of agreements in acontract, including payment and duty of performance. But what f you don't agree on anything? How do you pay in this situation? For example, if I order 50 big, steamed buns for 50 yuan from you. After you cook the buns, you wait for me to send money, and I wait for you to deliver the food. We're both in a deadlock. What to do now? There is actually a disagreement on the content of the contract, called a contractual dispute. How do we interpret the content now? Normally we can refer to the four corners rule ..." (Classroom observation)

As shown above, Lan skilfully drew on the example of "buying steamed buns' to clarify the connotation of acomplex academic concept (i.e., contractual dispute). In this way, Lan attempted to replace academic jargon with everyday discourse as part of her moment-to-moment linguistic practice to foster an easier understanding of the content knowledge.

Meanwhil, Lan also regularly employed students' L1 in her clss to scaffld the students' understanding of opaque theoretica concepts. For instance, in explaining \*disenchantment of law" and the difference between \*Act of God" and "force majeure", Lan switched to Chinese to clarify the answer.

Lan: "... We tend to present these two terms in a way everyone can understand. That's why now we encourage i [the disenchantment of legal language]. Because if the text is too abstruse, itll be difficult for recipients to understand." (Classroom observation)

Thus, shuttling between the two language codes could help Lan foreground the concept (i., disenchantment) and significantly reduce students' cognitive load in this learning scenario.

Generally, as an EMI teacher with a language background, Lan was flly aware of the power of language (e.g., English and Chinese) in facilitating content learning in an EMI course. In retrospection, she shared that for each term of a complex contract, I would lead students with a detaild analys and explanatio, from the first leter to the fullstop Interview-2). By drawing students attention to language use and employing translanguaging (e., using L1 and everyday discourse), Lantried to align material design and classroom teaching in a systematic and synergized fashion. Embedded in her expertise was a meaningful act of helping students to interpret, negotiate, and internalize the content through concrete language use in the legal field.

# Facilitating disciplinary socialization: "Playing the international game"

A vital attribute of Lan's expertise relatesto her efforts to facilitat students' discilinary socialization in law. In the interviews, Lan constantly referred to being alegal professional as a conscience-required jo (Interview-1, Interview-3) and described it as dealing with other people's lives (Interview-2). She thus summarized her EMI instruction as "practice-oriented by always considering students future crer, where they should be able to understand, areciate, and internalize th critical values, abilitie, and expected behaviors in the legal community.

To facilitate disciplinary socialization, Lan incorporated practical design into her EMI classooms and organized extracurricular activities related to legal practice. Occasionall, Lan shared her experience as a part-time legal consultant in companies and gave students practical suggestions about finding a law-related job. One of the episodes showed vividly how she integrated practical content into her EMI teaching:

Lan: \*When you interview for a job in the future the company may just throw you a contract and ask you to explain and analyze it. Let's imagine the customer invented a new software and wanted to go global. He drafted an agency agreement and asked you to be his representative to examine if there was any unfavorable clause. In this situation, you should know that you need to understand not only the language but also it connotation. You also need to anticipate the possible legal problems and help your customers solve them." (Classroom Observation)

Outside the classoom, Lan led students to visit legal firms in the local community. She used her contacts to provide students with opportunities to build connections between legal knowledge in the textbook and real-life ssues. As Lan shared,

"Last week, I took students to Huawei's research intitute, and then we had a five-hour in-depth discussion with their Intel lectual Property Section. Through sharing, we knew some international lawsuits Huawei faced in recent years. I think this kind of communication may spark more ideas and familiarize students with practical issues." (Interview-3)

ndeed, in both in-cas job-hunting cases and extracurricular vits, Lan intended to create an authentic learning environment where students could appreciate, discuss, and analyze real-life situations, which had a far-reaching impact on both knowledge application and disciplinary socialization.

Lan did not neglect the role of language in her endeavors to promote students' disciplinary socialization. She constantly empha sized the importance of language skils and encouraged students to maximize the potential of language-content integration in their future careers. As she stated in interviews:

"I keep telling students that their ability to express sophisticated legal content through English is what other people don't have. It can be an 'ace in the hole' for them to make a living in this society. It is a very impressive skillto combine content and language." (Interview-2)

The language-mediated disciplinary socialization can also be found in Lan's teaching materials. Fig. 2 is an example of students after-class exercise t was designed by summarizing and synthesizing key features commonly involved in intenational sales contracts. By illing in the contrct students were able to familiarize themseles with both essential clauses and the legal procedure involved in international contracts, which were highly relevant to their future careers. It appeared that Lan made efforts to approximate her assesment practices as genuine and authentic as possible. As she stated, the students could \*have a glimpse of the daily affirs of a lawyer (Classroom observation). Furthermore, she highlighted several terminologies and expressions to raise students awareness of precise language use and how choices of words could have a major impact on contract interpretation and implementation.

To pave the way for students' socialization, Lan also made an innovative attempt toco-build a course on international arbitration with legal professionals in the industry. Relying on the resources of the International Arbitration Commission of the district, Lan developed the course to help students get familiar with the rules of intenational games [refering to the intenational law] as soon as possible and make use of students' advantages of content-language integration' (Interview-2). Lan mentioned that inviting legal professionals could compensate for the lack of practical knowledge in universt-based courses. An example given by her was that "non-practitioners wouldn't know that currently over $9 0 \%$ of the international trade contracts specify that arbitration clauses cannot be brought to court (Interview-2). Familiarized with such conventions, students were more likel to perform well in international and global affairs. More importantly, the collaboration might induce a developmental relationship between an experienced legal expert and the students in need of career guidance and academic socialization.

Overall, Lan was able to exploit the potential of EMI instruction for students' career development. As illstrated, she motivated students to acquire professonal values eforethey entered the profession, created authentic socializing experience fr students in the legal communit, and highlighted the practical value of EMI for students skill and long-term caree development. Such efforts moved beyond her classroom instruction to expand the learning community to a broader circle (e.g., legal sectors and companies), which illustrated part of Lan's expertise in promoting the overall effectiveness of EMI education.

# Empathizing with students in the EMI learning process: "Don't worry. Take your time.

The third attribute of Lan's expertise in EMI instruction resides in a dep understanding of students EMI learning process and her ongoing attempts to foster a safe and motivating learning climate in line with students' actual needs and situations. Generall, she demonstrated empathy toward students' EMI learning challenges and paid particular atention to their motivation and emotional states. As she recalld,  know that all y students flt etrmely terrfied when they first ot a legal contract in nglish and fell into hopelessness (Interview-2). Such emotional awareness shaped Lan's EMI intruction as she tried to share personal felings, give positive feedback and comment, and introduce useful EMI learning strategies to students. For example, in Lan's instruction, she revealed her personal feelings (i.e., confusion) toward a conventional clause in international contracts.

Lan: \*The underlined part says, Time being of the essence of this contract. When I frst read this clause many years ago, I thought it was nonsense. What's the point of this statement, right? People only pay you when they think you have fulfilled your Obligations, right? How can I give you money if you don't perform? But later, you wil realize that people can have all kinds of agreements as long as it does not violate the law or interfere with public interests." (Classroom observation)

Fig. 2. An example of an exercise for Lan's course.

Central to the above episode was Lan's openness toward negative emotions as a common obstacle in the EMI learning journey. Faced with students confusion and bafflement, Lan sincerely shared her emotions (i.e, when she first encountered the English clause) and personal feelings as a learner, which echoed students' sentiments empathetically.

Additionall, Lan was attentive to students emotional states in classroom interactions. When a student gave a wrong answer, Lan often explained with patience and then rechecked the student's understanding by asking questions such as "Is i clear for you to understand?" and \*Is it much better now?". One case stood out as a typical scenario, which shows her expertise in giving feedback in EMI classrooms:

Lan: "Bing, can you explain this clause?"

Bing (Pseudonym): It says that all expenses incurred due to the supplier's fault should be borne by the supplier. These errors include the supplier's failure to follow the instructions, incomplete delivery, or failure to comply with the agreement."

Lan: Thank you. Don't worry. Take your time. Let me give you a half minute t take a good look at it, analyze it, and then let's see how to interpret this clause. 'Incurred by us.' Who is this 'us' referring to?"

Bing: "Refers to the supplier's counterpart. Our side."

Lan: \*Right. It's the opposite party, right? Excellent! (Classroom observation)

The scenario above entailed flexible feedback strategies (e.g., praise, question, and consolation). Starting with a question and noticing a minor misunderstanding in Bing's answer, Lan immediately acknowledged Bing's attempts with consolation. Then, Lan explicitly specified the target phrase and narrowed down the focus, leading to a refined understanding of the student. In this way, Lan tried to foster the student's heightened inguistic awareness of the keywords involved in a legal document through meaning negotiation. The diversified feedback techniques, together with her positive and constructive comments and explanations, showcased part of Lan's expertise in monitoring and facilitating the students' learning progress in EMI classrooms.

In assessment, Lan also displayed expertise in adopting flexible asessment practices based on students learning situations and anticipated challenges. Fig. 3 shows one part of the written examination in Lan's course. She required students to complete a contract on intllectual property transfer by drawing on the disciplinary knowledge covered in the course. Despite the predominant focus on content knowledge, Lan did pay attention to the language details by offering language scaffolding for students to express themselves accurately. As Fig. 3 illustrate, she used brackets to indicate proper tense use and offered hints by giving Chinese translations of technical words. This example shows her student-centeredness by acknowledging the dificulty of EMI learning and responding to students' learning needs regarding academic language.

To sum up, one dimension of Lan's expertise was her sensitivity and empathy for students EMI learning processes. An integal loop could be detected, starting from Lan's awareness of students anxiety before EMI learning to her diversified feedback strategies and flexible assessment practces i classoom teaching. In retrospection, Lan shared her observation of students progres with a sense of satisfaction:

"After sixteen weeks, each student can easily understand an English legal contract and would not feel afraid as they did at the beginning. For a student who has never been exposed to specialized legal texts in English, I think it's quite an impressive achievement." (Interview-3)

Such an observation highlighted the efectivenes of Lan's strategies for regulating students emotions in a potentially challenging EMI environment. Looking forward, Lan shared her vision of encouraging students "not to be frightened anymore when entering the career of law" (Interview-2).

4.2. Research question 2: what factors influenced the participant's expertise in her situated context?

First, Lan's prior learning and teaching experience seemed to constitute an important factor in her expertise development. During the interviews, Lan sentimentally recalled her orturous experience in pursuing a Ph.. degee in law. he described i a the kamikaze three years and never wanted to experience it again during the rest of my life\* (Interview-1). Specificall, asa student with a language education background, she practically had no prior knowledge of the law when she entered the Ph.D. program. Back then, she \*tried to compensate for the knowledge shortage by taking undergraduat courses in civil law and commercial law (Interview-1). This learning experience consolidated Lan's awareness of students' difficulties, challenges, and emotional disturbances in EMI learning, as she perceived that \*EMI added an extra burden to students in terms of language proficiency" (Interview-1).

Fig. 3. A part of the examination paper from Lan's course.

When teaching students of low English proficiency, Lan was not overwhelmed by the challenge but tried to promote language. content integration. During interviews, she described it as a valuable opportunity to raise her awareness of EMI students' learning difficulties and potential emotions involved in the learning process and identify possible strategies to help them transition smoothly into EMI (Interview-2). In other words, her aggregated experience added to her expertise in EMI and allowed her to make intuitive judgments based on students' actual needs.

Second, continuous lening and reflective practices also spurred Lan to update and refine her expertise Lan mentioned that se el the imperatie need to examine her EMI instructionto adjust to the students shifting neds and dynamic claroom situations over the years. For example, one day, a student asked Lan about the difference between "arbitrary norms and peremptory norms" involved in classroom teaching (Interview-1). Lan took it as an opportunit to reflect on her own teaching. She engaged i self-interrogation and contemplated her lecturing style and language use in EMI instruction (Interview-1). In general, Lan's reflective engagements involved not only the content of the course but also their appropriate delivery through using language comprehensible to students. Through reflecting on her practice, Lan identified specific areas that required improvement and made reasonable adjustments accordingly (Lasagabaster & Pageze, 2017).

Besides classroom teaching, Lan also sought learning opportunities through boundary-crossing. She worked part-time as an in ternational arbitrator and consultant in several legal firms, voluntarily helping to check compliance, review busines contracts, and offer academic consultations. She then drew on the contract review experiences to inform her EMI instruction.

"Such practice allows me to read new international contracts in the first place. For example, a few months ago, I saw a divorce judgment isued by a British court, which was very new. It may be rather difficult for Chinese lawyers to see such a judgment issued by a foreign court so early. But I can learn the format and wording of this judgment in advance through the review and introduce them timely in my course." (Interview-3)

Such practical engagement semed to powerfully mold Lan's understanding of a sub-field of law and contributed to her EMI expertise. On the one hand, she could use firs-hand cases (e.g., a divorce judgment isued in the UK) to simulate authentic situations and facilitate disciplinary socialization hat might be ifficult for students t accessthewise. On the ther hand, both the format and wording'" of the new cases enriched Lan's repertoire of linguistic resources and strategies she could call upon for language-content integration in EMI classes.

As Lan crossed boundaries as a universt teacher and a legal practitioner, she also modified the EMI learning materials with focused attention on the language in a continuous manner. As she remarked, Although it's ok to use the same materials I ket refining them by pondering on the important words and terms presented to students (Interview-2). Drawing on the legal cases she had reviewed, she could compensate for the lack of up-to-date legal references in the ivory tower and avoid using fixed materials haphazardly.

Third, social interactions and support from the community appeared to play an important rolei Lan's expertise development as an EMI teacher. Interestingly, Lan first recounted her discussins with some graduated students, from whom she could gain new insights into a legal issue:

'I learn a lot from my former students, especially those now doing foreign-related business in law firms. They often asked me questions about contracts and I had todo much law reviewing in this processto answer them. Ithink this discussion process also helped me because the learning process in reaching an interpretation of a legal term is very important for self-development." (Interview-3)

The above excerpt highlighted the importance of disciplinary communication and knowledge exchange within the community, which indeed prompted Lan's sel-improvement as an EMI teacher. Diffrent members of the community (e.g, legal experts, academics, and lawyers brought cognitive support and knowledge enhancement that could further contribute to Lan's teaching expertise because she could draw on "authentic legal issues and practical experiences in course preparation' (Interview-3.

However, Lan also confessed her frustration about being placed in an \*in-between space" (Interview-3), lacking recognition and professional development opportunities. As an EMI teacher affliated with the Faculty of Foreign Languages Lan felt she \*has been in a marginalized position for more than ten years" (Interview-3). Indeed, the school offered learning opportunities targeting mainly Ianguage teachers, leaving littl space for EMI teachers like Lan for professional advancement. As she stated, although she attended some general pedagogical workshops on English language education provided by her chool, they appeared to be basic and may not be suitable" (Interview-3 for Lan's EMI courses. Generall, he did not receive any systematic or focused training on EMI teaching, which might impede her from further developing her expertise. Therefore, she did not have a strong feeling of being supported" and craved more training opportunities concerning EMI instruction in the future (Interview-3).

# 5. Discussion

This intrinsic qualitative case study explored the expertise and its influencing factors of an EMI teacher with a dual educational background in a Chinese university. The findings extend our knowledge of EMI teacher expertise by shedding light on its multiple attributes and its continuous, reflective, and collaborative manner of operation and evolution in complex higher education settings.

The findings show that different teaching strategie, together with other components (e.g., rich pedagogical knowledge about EMI teaching and emotional sensitivity), collctively constituted the participant's expertise as an EMI teacher. These strategies added to Lan's language-focused expertise in EMI teaching, including deploying the facilitative role of language to mediate students' content comprehension, employing translanguaging as an efficient claroom teaching strategy, and exploiting the potential of flexible and tailored-to-need assessment practice (Macaro, 2020; Williams, 2023). Spcificall, through paying heightened atentio to words and phrases, Lan displayed a prominent awarenes of the power of language in helping students understand opaque legal terminologies and clarify complicated jural relations. Meanwhil, she also shifted between academic and everyday discourse to promote students understanding of discipline-specific scientific concepts. A similar finding was also observed in Hu and Lei's (2014) study, where EMI teachers tended to draw on illustrative examples from dail lif. This iluminated a vital atriute of expert EMI teachers who can integrate academic content and appropriate disciplinary language uses in instruction (Dafouz et al., 2018). However, diffrent from previous studies in which EMI teachers were reported to be afraid of using thir frt language (Manan et al., 2022), Lan exhibited a diversified and creative use of linguistic devices and translanguaging strategies to facilitate students content learning. For instance, she switched to the students' L1 to explain the \*Act of God" and compare legal cultures worldwide. While implicit, these teaching strategies reflected an important attribut of the EMI teacher's expertise, i.e. proper language scaffolding in delivering disciplinary knowledge. Meanwhile, thee language-related instructional trategies manifested in Lan's classroom teaching worked collaboratively with other aspects of her knowledge, beliefs, and values to compose a dynamic sum of her adaptive expertise (Yuan & Yang, 2022) in responding to complex situational needs and promoting students' EMI learning.

Interestingly, the findings also revealed the participant's expertise in EMI students' social development and emotional status Concurring with the findings of Farrel (2013), Lan demonstrated eforts in anticipating students learning and career needs and promoting their disciplinary socialization. For instance, she frequentl offered students field experiences to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in real-life environments (Richards e al. 2020). Nevertheles, such efforts were not detached from the role of language. When Lan introduced the practical course and incorporated elements of career development into her assessment practce she designed the course content and materials with a heightened awareness of the facilitative rolef English in accordance with the objectives of EMI education. The linguistic and paralinguistic features embedded in Lan's discourse and written materials further testified to the critical role of language in helping students succeed in their disciplinary socialization (Baff, 2017). With respect to the emotional dimension, Lan devoted much time to both students' emotional disturbances and potential challenges in EMI learning, suchas openly sharing her own leaning difficulties and using flexiblefedback strateies i classrom interactions. This echoes previous studies in which EMI teachers could communicate with students about their learning difficulties by employing a more intlibl instructional design (Qiu & Fang, 2022) and displaying a situational understanding and sensitivity to the context of learning and learners (Manan et al., 2022).

In general, Lan's expertise in EMI functioned and evolved in a continuous, reflective, and collaborative manner. Her prior learning experience served as an invisible compassthat continuously guided her to develop expertise in penetrating the needs and emotions of students in EMI learning, empathizing with students' learning proces, and cultivating a contextualized and personalized approach to EMI instruction. As she undertook EMI teaching, the expertise accumulated as a constant way of being and becoming For instance she continuously refied her knowledge in the field and engaged in agentive reflection that allowed her to adres shortcomings in EMI teaching and adjust her course delivery accordingly. Behind such reflective actions was Lan's "resistance to automaticity" that distinguished her from non-experts (Tsui, 2009, p. 190). Moreover, aligning with previous reearch (Lee & Yuan, 2021), the participant also constantly interacted and communicated with members of the community to enhance her knowledge base, indicating a collaborative nature of teacher expertise formation. In particular, as an EMI teacher, socializing with her former students and crossing boundaries between the universt and law firms allowed Lan to progressvely systematize and theorize practical knowledge of the law and deal with legal isues in practice (Farrll, 2013). This scial dimension contributed largely to Lan's expertise in paving the way for EMI students' disciplinary socialization.

# 6. Implications, limitations, and future research

Considering the noted attributes of EMI teacher expertise, we offered several suggestions that may help EMI teachers examine and improve their classoom instruction and seek continuing development. First since language can be a powerful tool contributing to the success of EMI courses (Macaro, 2020; Zhang, 2018), EMI istructors are suggested to improve their English proficiency and use diversfied language-related teaching trategie. Language and content cannot be taught in an isolated way. In particular, MI teachers can learn to tap the potential of translanguaging and build a repertoire of useful resources to enrich the EMI teaching-learning experience. Admitting that a language background appeared to be an inbuilt advantage for Lan's expertise, it is not our intention to encourage MI tachers to pursue  dgrein language ducation r aplied linguistics. Rater, it s recommended that I teachers can participate in different types of continuous learning programs to enhance their discipline-specific linguistic awareness and its related teaching competence. Additionll, it is crucial to nurture EMI students' social and emotional development. EMI teachers should take the responsibility to create an encouraging and safe learning environment where students can progresstepwise into the disciplinary community and learn to tackle the challenges and difficulties encountered along the way.

Given the influencing factors behind Lan's expertise development, it is suggested that EMI teachers and teacher educators fully recognize the emergent and adaptive nature of teacher expertise (Burns, 2022; Hirvela, 2020). As Lan shuttled between different educational and sociocultural contexts (i.e., educator, arbitrator, and part-time lawyer), she activated her prior experience and positively coordinated various dimensions of knowledge to help her refine clasroom teaching. Therefore, both EMI teachers and teacher educators ndto realize that expertise development i a constant and prolonged processentangled with practices, reflections, and interactions within the situated (multiple) contexts (Yuan & Yang, 2022). Relevant teacher development programs, therefore, need to be designed and planned in a systematic and sustained way to cater to the needs of EMI teachers in specific disciplinary contexts. Meanwhile, EMI teachers are equally advised to take the initiative to develop their expertise by engaging in continuous learning and reflection, collaboratig with practtioner in respective fields, and conducting classoom-based action rearch o inform their own EMI teaching.

The challenges cannot be ignored. The findings indicated a lack f support and recognition for EMI teachers and a downplay of EMI education as an individualized, isolated act in higher education (Yuan et al., 2020). Therefore, university management and relevant stakeholders should take cognizance of the role and expertis of EMI teachers i facilitating effctive EMI education. A viable tratey is to establish professinal communitie for EMI teachers in various disciplines, where they can openly share and discuss pedagogical issues, engage in meaningful interactions to navigate potential challenges, and promote substantial collaborative relationships in higher education.

Given the exploratory and intrinsic nature, the study has several limitations. First, i is acknowledged that a single-case study design may not fuly capture the essence of EMI teacher expertise. Therefore, in line with Sternberg and Horvath's (1995, p.9) view, we caution that the findings did not mean a checklis of necessary and sufficient features of EMI teacher expertise. Instead of aiming for generalization, hs inrinsic case study attempts to \*apreciate the uniquenes and complexity [of the case], its embeddedness and interaction with its contexts (Stake, 199, p. 16) by offering a detailed and potentiall transferable description of the participant's expertise. Second, the emergent and adaptive nature of teacher expertise may not be completely leveraged due to a limited period of data collction. Therefore, longitudinal research is sugested to collect data from multiple participants over an extended period to unravel the components of EMI teacher expertise and trace its development chronologically. Meanwhile, students perspectives could be gathered to explore the relationship between their academic performance and EMI teacher expertise in diverse disciplines.
