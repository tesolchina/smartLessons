# ABSTRACT

Despite the plethora of research on computer-supported collaborative writing, previous studies have failed to provide an adequate analysis of the quality and quantity of multi-authored texts due to the vast amount of unstructured data. This study aims to expand the current research by contributing new perspectives to the understanding of students’ collaborative writing interactions and strategies. Nineteen EFL learners, divided into five groups, were asked to collaboratively write a literature review on a selected research topic using Google Docs. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, supported by text mining using DocuViz, revealed that the groups demonstrated patterns of interactions along the continuum of equality and mutuality. However, due to the nature of the required task, groups with the same collaborative interaction patterns exhibited some writing strategy variations. Text visualization analysis further revealed that the groups adopted more than one writing strategy to complete the task. They tended to start with an outline in which the task was divided, and students worked either in parallel or sequentially. This was followed by cooperative revisions or a synchronous hands-on style before the task’s due date. By using multiple data analyses, this study distinguishes between interaction patterns and writing strategies, two concepts previously used interchangeably. Methodological and pedagogical implications are also presented.

# Introduction

Research on second language writing has been increasing exponentially as researchers realize its complexity, multidisciplinary nature, and pivotal role in language learning (Matsuda, 2003, 2021). In light of the paradigm shift in perspectives of L2 writing from product-oriented to a process approach, writing is now viewed as more of a social than a solitary activity (Ferris & Hedgcock, 2013). Over the last decade, attention has turned to collaborative writing (CW) because it reinforces the social turn in second language research (Block, 2007) and prepares students to work collaboratively in the workplace (Godwin-Jones, 2018). CW allows learners to share resources and generate ideas, which leads them to produce more accurately focused text: students writing collaboratively show greater improvement in some writing aspects, including content, organization, and vocabulary, when compared to individually written texts (Stell, 2018; Storch, 2005, 2011).

The current research on CW has primarily focused on computer-supported collaborative writing (CSCW) and has examined writing processes (e.g. Abrams, 2016; Elola & Oskoz, 2010; Li & Zhu, 2017), the effect of CW on writing products (e.g. Strobl, 2014), and students’ perceptions of CW (e.g. Bikowski & Vithanage, 2016; Fernández-Dobao, 2020). However, despite the breadth of the research on CSCW, it has not provided an adequate analysis of the quality and quantity of multi-authored texts due to the vast amount of unstructured data (Yim & Warschauer, 2017). Further, previous studies have touched on writing strategies by examining the revision edits; however, they were explored within Storch’s peer interaction framework.

The present study addresses this gap by using various data that were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, supported by text visualization analysis, to explore the patterns of group interaction and writing strategies enacted by advanced EFL learners in a research class.

# Literature review

# Computer-supported collaborative writing

Storch (2019) defined CW as ‘an activity that requires the co-authors to be involved in all stages of the writing process, sharing responsibility for and the ownership of the entire text produced’ (p. 40). CW is grounded on the premises of sociocultural theory, that argues that human cognitive development is a mediated process organized by cultural artifacts, activities and concepts (Lantolf et  al., 2015). As a powerful cultural artifact, language is used to mediate other processes, including individual’s relationships with themselves, others, and the world (Lantolf et  al., 2015) In the L2 realm, social interaction plays a pivotal role in language learning: knowledge is built and constructed through engaging in joint activities that involve deliberation about language-related problems (Donato, 1994; Storch, 2002).

CW is also pedagogically beneficial: empirical studies have shown that it affords language learners new opportunities for learning. In a series of studies, Storch et  al. (Storch, 2002, 2005; Storch & Aldosari, 2010; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009) found that during CW tasks, students attend to various aspects of writing, including generating ideas, organizing texts, focusing on proper linguistic accuracy, providing feedback, and engaging in collective scaffolding. Exploring the effect of CW on writing products, Stell (2018) found that students who worked in groups wrote more fluent and complex texts than those written by individuals. Dobao (2012) also found that collaboratively written texts were more accurate than those produced by pairs or individuals.

The advancement of Web 2.0 technologies with their interactivity, participation, and authenticity resonates with the principles of the ‘social turn’ that denounces cognitive emphasis in second language acquisition and account for the ‘complexity and multilayered nature of language’ (Block, 2007, p. 4). These tools have paved the way for new language learning practices as they accentuate collaboration among participants and generate a blend of content and knowledge in what is called ‘the architecture of participation’ (Thorne, 2003). Web-based processor tools like Wiki and Google Docs allow learners to create, transform, and edit their work, while their built-in features (e.g. chats, comments, and additions) provide learners with space to expand their discussions and explanations. For teachers and researchers, these tools are equipped with revision tracking systems that facilitate the tracing of CW processes by highlighting changes, contributors, and times (Arnold et  al., 2012; Aydin & Yildiz, 2014). Such tools have received much attention among second language scholars, with results generally supporting these tools as viable language learning sites (Aydin & Yildiz, 2014; Strobl, 2014).

# Analyzing patterns of collaborative interaction in CSCW

Patterns of collaborative interaction refer to the ways students negotiate tasks and use text construction to convey their negotiated meaning (Li & Zhu, 2013). Writing scholars have adopted different analytical approaches to identify students’ various patterns of engagement in CW. Some researchers (Abrams, 2016; Mak & Coniam, 2008) have focused on the revision history and the editing process, while others (Aufa & Storch, 2021; Cho, 2021; Li & Kim, 2016) have also investigated students’ online chats during the writing process.

In L2 CSCW research, several studies have drawn on Storch’s (2002) model of peer oral interaction. Storch’s (2002, 2005) framework of dyadic interaction includes two parameters: a) equality, which refers to the equal contribution to the text and equal control over the task, and b) mutuality, which refers to a pair’s engagement with each other’s contribution. Four pattern types can be identified stemming from the intersection of the two parameters: collaborative pairs, dominant/dominant pairs, dominant/passive pairs, and expert/novice pairs. Li and Zhu (2013) drew on Storch’s framework to explore patterns of group interaction. Based on their analysis of the language functions (e.g. agreeing, eliciting, etc.) and scaffolding strategies used in students’ online discussion and wiki texts, they identified three distinct patterns: collectively contributing/mutually supportive, authoritative/responsive, and dominant/ withdrawn. They further found that groups that manifested ‘collective scaffolding’ built a harmonious atmosphere that positively contributed to students’ perceived learning. Based on sociocultural orientation, Li and Kim (2016) conducted a case study analyzing the interactions of two groups in two tasks. By providing a quantitative analysis of language functions, writing change functions in students’ online discussion, history, wiki use, and a holistic analysis of scaffolding strategies, they found that the two focal groups enacted different patterns in each task. The first demonstrated a collective pattern during the research proposal assignment but switched to active/withdrawn in the ‘annotated bibliography assignment’. The other group first exhibited the dominant/defensive pattern of interaction then later switched to the collaborative pattern. Building on Li and Kim’s (2016) study, Li and Zhu (2017) explored the factors that lead to certain patterns. They found that changes in the interaction patterns were correlated with different factors including group members’ goals, emotions, and agency. Convergent goals, collective agency, and positive emotions resulted in a collective interaction pattern. In contrast, divergent goals, individual agency, and negative emotions lead to dominant/defensive patterns. Abrams (2016) used Google Docs’ revision history as the primary analytical tool to determine group equality and mutuality. Eight groups of three and four were asked to write an ending for the final 20 minutes of a famous German film. Students were asked to discuss and brainstorm the task in class but later completed it in Google Docs. An analysis of the students’ writing changes and revisions revealed three main patterns: a low contribution, passive/ passive pattern, sequentially additive, and a collaborative pattern, where participants demonstrate a recursive writing style.

More recent studies have focused on identifying mediating factors that influenced groups’ enacted interaction patterns. In a blended context, Aufa and Storch (2021) identified different patterns across six tasks: collaborative, cooperative, facilitative/cooperative, facilitative/cooperative/ cooperative, and cooperative/passive/passive. They found that interaction patterns are influenced by modes of communication. The online mode offered some flexibility, and autonomy encouraged a cooperative approach to writing, while face-to-face interaction encouraged a more collaborative stance. Informed by activity theory, Cho (2021) implemented Google

Docs and Skype in two groups of three participants, finding the main mediating factors to be voice chat, matching of self and others’ perceived roles, peer feedback hesitation, task understanding, and familiarity.

Though all the above-mentioned studies used Storch’s (2002) framework, variations have been identified as they have operationalized it differently because it was originally designed to encompass oral rather than written interactions. Further, researchers have not yet clearly determined what constitutes ‘collaboration’ as they have used various data sources and analytical tools to identify collaborative interaction (Abrams, 2016). By using multiple data sources, the present study sought to examine two main concepts in online CW activity: patterns of interaction and writing strategies.

# Collaborative writing strategies and text mining

The previously reviewed studies used various data sources, including wiki or Google Docs revision histories, students’ chats and online discussions, interviews, and surveys. They have adopted both qualitative and quantitative approaches and provided deep insights into the various CSCW trajectories. However, many researchers have reported limited generalization (e.g. Li & Zhu, 2013) because their research was based on small case studies. The nature of online CW yields complex and iterative data that are challenging to analyze manually. Text mining, that transforms the source text into a shorter, measurable version that maintains the original information and its meaning (Warschauer et  al., 2019; Yim & Warschauer, 2017), has tremendous methodological potential for exploring CSCW as it allows researchers to make meaning out of extensive unstructured data. As such, it facilitates the establishment of a relationship between variables that were once difficult to identify (Yim & Warschauer, 2017). Information visualization, one category of text mining, converts large-scale textual data into a visual representation in the form of a hierarchy, map, or chart. Usually, this visual figure is interactive and enables researchers to focus on a particular segment of the document. The current study used DocuViz, an open-source visualization system specifically designed to extract revision information from Google Docs (Olson et  al., 2017). DocuViz produces a ‘visual history chart across different time points, indicating the authors, their respective portions of writing and the time of editing’ (Warschauer et  al., 2019, p. 101). Text visualization analysis allows the researcher to unravel the developmental sequence process of collaborative knowledge construction (Kanuka & Anderson, 1998) by identifying CW strategies that ‘describe the steps enacted to create the text’ (Posner & Baecker, 1992).

In a longitudinal study over three years, Olson et  al. (2017) investigated how undergraduate students wrote together using text-mining analysis, identifying six CW styles: 1) from scratch, 2) outline, 3) assignment, 4) example, 5) assigning people, and 6) informal discussion. Further, they found that students conducted more simultaneous work than individual, hands-off work. Students undertook a large amount of editing, not only correcting but also adding and deleting content. Interestingly, they rarely used the comment features; instead, they commented within the text itself. Overall, the study found a positive correlation between the balance of participation and evidence of leadership with better writing quality. Olson et  al.’s (2017) study is unique in that it delves into the process of CW, providing statistical data on students’ writing and revision behaviors.

Similarly,Yim et  al. (2017) analyzed students’ CW styles and writing outcomes using text-mining analysis. They found four distinct CW Ssyles1) the main writer or scribe, in which only one or two writers dominated the document, 2) dividing and conquering, which was the most frequently used style and exhibited a parallel division of work with minor edits of others’ text usually taking place at the final stage of writing, 3) the cooperative revision style, which was similar to the parallel division of work but involved more edits throughout the writing stages, and 4) the synchronous hands-on style, in which group members constructed text by ‘creating sentences together by simultaneously building off of each other’s text’ (p. 473). Yim et  al.’s study also demonstrated that the balance of participation manifested in divide and conquer styles, and a significant number of edits undertaken in the cooperative revision style tended to produce better quality writing.

Although previous CW patterns of interaction tapped into the process of text construction by using revision edit data, they fell short in providing adequate analysis of students’ CW behaviors because of the constant intertwining of writing and revising (Strobl, 2014). Further, as noted by Abrams (2019), analyzing Google Docs revision histories was ‘cumbersome in terms of analytical capability’ (p. 34). Additionally, they have been discussed within the peer interaction framework (e.g. Abrams, 2016; Li & Zhu, 2013, 2017). Li and Zhang (2021) noted that research on CW interaction patterns provided valuable insights into the CW process; however, knowledge about text construction and writing strategies is still needed.

Using text mining in online CW is an emerging strand in education research; however, it remains underexplored in the foreign language learning context (Warschauer et  al., 2019).Therefore, the current study builds on the previous work on CSCW (Li & Kim, 2016; Li & Zhu, 2017) and text-mining studies (e.g. Yim et  al., 2017) and triangulates multidata sources along with text-mining data to explore collaborative interaction patterns and the dynamic of CW strategies. It specifically aims to answer the following questions:

1. What patterns of group interaction can be found in an advanced EFL research class?   
2. What are the different writing strategies students adopt when they write collaboratively in Google Docs?

This exploration of CW behaviors is expected to lead to new insights regarding the multilayered nature of students’ CW in the online environment.

# Methods

# Context and participants

This study was conducted at a four-year college where each year is divided into two semesters corresponding to two levels\*. It formed part of a larger semester-long CSCW project that investigated the multilayered nature of CW in an online environment. A nonrandom purposive sampling strategy was used in participant selection: 26 EFL senior students (fourth year/level 7), specializing in English language and literature at a Saudi university, all enrolled in a particular research course. This 2-credit hour-per-week course aimed to provide students with essential knowledge of research methods and qualitative and quantitative approaches. It also focused on enabling students to analyze and evaluate literature. Prior to this, students were required to take courses in linguistics, literature, writing, and translation, as well as an introduction to research course. All participants were at the advanced English level as assigned by the department (which is equivalent to the C1 Level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, CERF) The researcher/instructor introduced the study’s aim and procedures to the participants, reminding them that their participation in the study was voluntary, and they could withdraw at any time without any penalties. They were also informed that their participation would not require any extra work beyond the course requirements. To mitigate the impact of instructor-students relationships, another faculty member collected the consent forms and only gave them to the instructor/researcher at the end of the semester. Nineteen students, divided into five self-selected groups of three to four students based on friendships or familiarity, participated in the study. All participants were female and native Arabic speakers. Their ages ranged from 19–25 years. Table 1 shows all participants’ grade point averages (GPAs); eleven students had an excellent

Note. GP A $=$ grade point average: excellent (A, above average) $=$ 4.50–5.00, very good (B, average) = 3.75–4.49, good $( \mathsf { C } ) = 2 . 7 5 \substack { - 3 . 7 4 }$ , pass $( \mathsf { D } ) = 2 . 7 4 \mathrm { - } 2 . 0$ (C & D are below average).

GPA, five had a very good GPA, and three had a good GPA. Groups were encouraged to choose one leader for each task, since evidence of leadership correlates with the group members’ enhanced writing quality (Lee, 2010). All the participants were given pseudonyms.

# Procedure and data collection

The course in this study required students to write a research paper on a selected topic related to their field of study (see Appendix A). In the first two weeks, students were given two training workshops. The first was titled ‘Unintended Plagiarism’. Since this course was research-based and students were writing from sources, the instructor (researcher) had to raise their awareness of using these resources appropriately. Students were then required to summarize two research articles based on their selected groups’ topics and received feedback from the instructor. Moreover, based on previous research recommendations (e.g. Arnold et  al., 2012; Elola & Oskoz, 2010), students were introduced to Google Docs and its features in Week 2 and trained on using Google Docs for CW. They were also shown how the instructor could trace each group member’s contribution by using the revision history function and the add-on application DocuViz.

The study’s focal task required students to write a four-to-six-page literature review of six-eight scholarly research articles following APA style format. The instructor explained this topic over two weeks (4 hours). First, students were scaffolded by providing good assignment models from previous semesters for class analysis and discussion. Then, students completed the literature review chart (See Appendix B). In the next class, groups started identifying the main themes discussed in their selected articles. Feedback was provided when requested. Groups then completed the task using Google Docs, either synchronously or asynchronously. Students created group chats in WhatsApp, a popular instant messaging application in Saudi Arabia, to negotiate task organization and construction. These group chat discussions lasted from 9 to 12 days. Students were asked to finish the first draft three days prior to the due date so that the instructor could access the documents and provide them with feedback on content and organization.

# Data analysis

The dynamic patterns of group interaction and CW strategies of the five groups were analyzed. I employed Storch’s (2002) framework to examine the interaction patterns regarding equality and mutuality (mutuality was later extended by Li and Zhu (2017) to involve providing scaffolding during task negotiation). Further, informed by Olson et  al. (2017) and Yim et  al. (2017), I analyzed the DocuViz visualizations to identify the different writing strategies and their distinct characteristics. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were undertaken: the primary data sources were the group chats and the collaboratively written text on Google Docs. Table 2 summarizes the data collection and analysis for each construct.

# Group chat

The WhatsApp group chats’ transcripts relevant to the literature review assignment were uploaded into NVivo for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Students’ conversations were segmented into episodes. An episode is a unit of discourse that relates to a specific function (Storch, 2002). Episodes were segmented based on their function and varied in length from one to more than 10 exchanges. Though I analyzed these segments for emerging themes/functions. I referred to previous studies’ categorization schemes (e.g. Storch, 2002). The coding scheme identified task-related episodes, including planning, contributing, monitoring, and seeking input, and non-task-related episodes such as discussing other course assignments and social interactions (Appendix C). Two main pieces of information were extracted from the NVivo analysis: the frequency/count of each function and how dominant each function was (some functions were observed frequently but only contained two to three exchanges). Regarding intercoder reliability, $1 0 \%$ of the chat data coded by a trained researcher using the same schemata resulted in $8 7 \%$ agreement, which is considered acceptable (Belur et  al., 2021. The analysis of group chats provided information about group mutuality and evidence of leadership. According to criteria from Olson et  al. (2017), a leader exists if one student takes control of organizing and dividing the work and delegating it.

Group chats were further analyzed to identify scaffolding strategies, being a factor of mutuality. I adopted Li and Kim’s (2016) taxonomy of scaffolding strategies (Appendix D) to gain a deeper understanding of students’ engagement in task discussion, as mutual scaffolding entails good collaboration (Donato, 1994). Chats were first segmented into episodes, and instead of providing frequency counts of scaffolding strategies for each individual, episodes were recorded based on scaffolding occurrence/non-occurrence (Li & Kim, 2016).

# Collaboratively written text

I used Li and Kim’s (2016) taxonomy of writing change functions (WCFs). This was originally adopted from Mak and Coniam (2008) to analyze collaborative texts. This taxonomy includes adding, deleting, rephrasing, reordering, and correcting. In coding the WCFs, I counted the changes made by each individual and assigned the functions in terms of the other (indication of group’s mutuality) and self (indication of groups’ equal contribution (Appendix E). I holistically and iteratively analyzed the three data sets (WCFs other vs self, chat functions and scaffolding strategies) and made constant comparison to estimate groups’ mutuality.

# DocuViz visualization

Information from DocuViz was analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. DocuViz provides visual history tracking of students’ writing behaviors across timed task slots using colors that indicate the writer and their contribution to the text. I adapted Yim et  al.’s (2017) writing strategy coding schemes, which include the main writer, divide and conquer, sequential, cooperative revision, and synchronous hands-on styles (Appendix F). I also identified other information from Olson et  al. (2017) that enhances the understanding of student writing work to identify work modes in terms of synchronicity (sessions with the solo author and multiple authors). DocuViz also provides statistics related to collaborative revision behaviors. I extracted the balance of participation variables by calculating each individual’s total contribution as a proportion. Then, I followed Olson et  al.’s (2017) equation to compute the participation balance which is 1 - variance of the proportions of the document each student wrote. (i.e., $0 = \mathrm { { a l l } }$ members contribute equally, $0 . 7 5 =$ only one person contributed.). I used statisitics extracted from DocuViz to calculate groups’ balance of participation supported with more details from individual’ WCFs to evaluate group’s equality.

# Findings

The analysis of the five groups’ chat episodes, WCFs, and DocuViz information revealed four interaction patterns (Table 3).

# Collaborative interaction patterns

Groups 2 (member GPAs: 2 excellent, 1 very good, and 1 good) and 4 (member GPAs: 4 excellent) demonstrated the collaborative pattern in which they collectively contributed and mutually supported each other. The students contributed equally to the text with a similar degree of control over the tasks (Storch, 2005) and were mutually engaged in the group discussion and text construction.

Both groups demonstrated the most balanced participation compared to the other groups (Group $2 = 0 . 0 1$ ; Group $4 = 0 . 0 0 9 $ ) (Table 4). Their writing change functions on Google Docs showed that all group members had contributed to the text. Specifically, Groups 2 and 4 exhibited a high-equality level of text construction (Group 2 conducted 60, 27, 87, and 19 instances of WCFs; Group 4 conducted 227, 68, 17, and 88 instances of WCFs (Table 5) .A notable feature of these two groups was that there was no leadership evidence as all group members played the roles of expert and novice interchangeably, although they were encouraged to select a leader. Neither the group chat discussion nor the text co-construction was dominated by one student; for instance, the 13 episodes of content discussion and 13 episodes of feedbackgiving and seeking in Group 2 were produced by all four members (see Table 6).

Though the two groups demonstrated a high level of mutuality, it was reflected differently, and Group 2 produced a high number of task and non-task related episodes (62; Table 6). Their discussion mainly centered around contributions to the text. Group participants shared their resources and ideas and discussed the text structures collectively, viewing WhatsApp as the main platform for planning their task. An interesting feature of this group was the incidence of feedback-seeking (6) and feedback-giving (7): students shared their texts with other members before composing them in Google Docs to get feedback. This explains the low numbers of Other WCFs (38, 5, 9, 0) because students had already commented on each other’s work during the chat discussion. Although SA had contributed to the text and added her part, she had never engaged with her peers’ contributions.

Contrastingly, Group 4 exhibited a low number of episodes in the chat discussion (28); however, they manifested a higher number of Other WCFs (169, 49, 4, 59). The group chat revealed a unique episode, in which the students arranged Zoom calls to discuss the task; the WhatsApp group chat was used merely to ask general questions regarding task requirements or due dates. This group operationalized the task collectively as revealed in their seven synchronous writing sessions in Google Docs (Table 3) that corresponded to their seven Zoom calls.

Intersubjectivity and contingent responsivity were evident in both groups’ chats. Group 2 members, for instance, were in tune with each other as they engaged in dialogue that exhibited collective thought and a shared understanding of the task. Figure 1 illustrates Group 2’s discussion about several task-related issues. First, LA thought that the introduction should be like the one they had written in the previous task, the ‘research proposal’. Both WG and WE shared their different ideas; WG asked her friend in another group, while WE shared her class notes about what the teacher had said. LA appreciated their feedback, then WG offered to write the introduction, and WE said she was going to help her. LA decided to write the introduction sentences for each theme. Toward the end of this episode, LA asked how she could adequately cite three authors. WG shared two sources: an image that exemplified the proper citation method and the main source from the lecture. LA thanked her, and WG posted two hearts (affective involvement). This dialogue indicated that the students shared equal responsibility for the task and displayed high reciprocity.

Similarly, Group 4 demonstrated intersubjectivity and contingent responsivity (Figure 2). DO informed the group members that she had edited the literature review and added more content and two more headings. She also said that the conclusion was missing and that they needed to work on it before the due date. Other group members thanked

[ 5:25:58 PM] wG: how do we write the introduction in the beginning   
[5:26:07 PM] LA: I think it is similar to the ones we wrote in the proposal before   
[5:29:28 PM] WG: Umm I think it is different   
[5:29:55 PM] wG: I asked some one in another group she said the introduction in literature review should include citing studies and resources   
[5:31:25 PM] LA: OK that's make sense   
[5:37:14 PM] WE: intro in literature review should be like the one we wrote in the proposal but longer and include citations.   
[5:41:09 PM] WG: Ok I will start writing it   
[5:42:09 PM] WE: Great  once my finish writing my part I will help you with it.   
[5:42:22 PM] LA: I am going to start writing the introduction for theme "Students' reasons... [5:44:59 PM] LA: girls how do cite article with three authors

[5:45:24 PM] LA: Thanks   
[5:45:56 PM] WG: $\otimes \infty$ 11:20:19 AM] DO: Girls I edited the literature review at night and checked the language. reorganized some part, but I didn't see the conclusion I hope that we don't lose marks for that $\textcircled{6}$   
[11:31:33 AM] HU: $\curvearrowleft$ Thank you a lot DO

[12:18:28 PM] KH: Sorry to be late I am in now

her for her efforts, and KH took responsibility for writing the conclusion. HU suggested that they go online to edit it. DO agreed and asked the others for their opinions, who promptly replied affirmatively.

The time span between exchanges (1–10 minutes) in the above excerpts indicates a high degree of engagement and reciprocity. Both groups utilized appreciation, positive feedback, and effective emojis to maintain a positive group environment that facilitated collaboration.

# Expert/novice pattern

Group 5, which comprised students with an average achievement level, demonstrated an expert/novice interaction pattern with a moderate level of equality and high mutuality. Two group members, AM and MU, assumed the role of experts but without being authoritarian, mentoring novice participants and actively encouraging them to participate. The level of balance participation was relatively moderate (0.02) (Table 5), and AM and MU contributed the most (19 and 28 instances of self-WCFs, respectively). Their mutual engagement was manifested by the high number of language episodes (82) in the group chat. In performing the role of mentors, the two leaders assisted the novices in various ways throughout the discussion. Many content discussion episodes (Table 6) were voice memos explaining and elaborating. Regardless of their unequal contributions, NS and NO shared reciprocal responses and contributed to a positive group rapport. Like Group 2, Group 5 members expressed their involvement and appreciation using different emojis such as the heart, thumbs up, flowers, kisses, and hands praying, reflecting a safe, harmonious group environment. The revision history analysis also revealed that the two active members engaged in others’ contributions, as demonstrated by the high number of Other WCFs (57, 19 instances), while the other two novice students had not engaged with others’ contributions (Other WCFs 0, 1 instance).

Group 5’s chat discussion was characterized by contingent responsivity and intersubjectivity, as manifested in their responses to feedback and actively seeking and providing help. Figure 3 depicts how AM took a mentor role: she asked NS and NO whether they had started working on the introduction, and stated that they could post their attempts so that they could work on it as a group. NS and NO shared their introductions. AM thanked them for each contribution and asked them to post them to Google Docs for editing by taking the best of each. Here, AM attempted to engage her group members in text construction by providing a safe and welcoming environment that promoted problem solving and experimentation.

# Authoritative/passive pattern

Group 1, comprising three high-achieving students and one below average, displayed an authoritative/passive interaction pattern with a moderate level of equality (balance of participation $= 0 . 0 2 \AA$ and low mutuality since they were not fully engaged in the chat discussion or with each other’s text. All participants initiated Self -WCFs with varying frequencies (14, 30, 5, 27) that fulfilled task requirements (Table 5). However, the WhatsApp chat showed that this group did not have equal control of the task. NF assumed the leader role, as suggested by the instructor, but she instructed other students authoritatively. Dividing the task (5), giving instruction (5), and most of the advocating effort (6) were

conducted by NF. However, despite NF’s authority, MA made most of the self-text contributions (30) (Table 5).

The low engagement was indicated in both the text construction and group discussion. Students in this group were unable to fully engage with each other’s contributions. Other-initiated WCFs (30, 13, 4, 1) were relatively low except for those of NF; a high number of her WCFs involved correcting, rather than adding to or paraphrasing, others’ texts (see Appendix G for more details of the WCFs).

![](img/6323eab71fb5381a57d23eee9a00db3ec31d7c341435f573d9b9e2d56edf82f8.jpg)  
Figure 5. G roup 1 excerpt.

Furthermore, scaffolding strategies were not activated: a lack of responsivity, instruction with an authoritative tone, and negative involvement characterized this group chat. In dividing the task, the negotiation was unidirectional, from NF to other group members (Figure 4), and MA’s attempts to engage in the task negotiation were ignored. MA expressed her confusion about the task and needed help, but NF did not respond and instead focused on her plans by calling on other members, who were unresponsive, to assign them their tasks.

Throughout the task discussion, NF also provided feedback to her group members; however, instead of providing a safe, respectful environment, she gave commands that had a negative impact, using words such as ‘I am sick and tired’ or using the red sign emoji to highlight their mistakes. Due to her authoritative tone and negative attitude, other group members disengaged from the discussion and rarely responded to her promptly (Figure 5a and b).

# Dominant/withdrawn pattern

Group 3, comprising two high achievers and one below the average, demonstrated a dominant/withdrawn interaction pattern involving unequal contributions (balance of participation $= 0 . 1 \mathrm { \dot { 2 } }$ ) and a lack of reciprocity (low mutuality) as they had the lowest language functions across all categories (38 episodes; except for Group 4 who used Zoom as an alternative platform for discussion). RE was the most active student in text contribution (111 instances of WCFs) compared to the other two members (10 and 14). Though RE took control of

the task, she seemed unwilling to engage her partners in text contributions, instead preferring to work independently. Her partners were not responsive to her requests. This group demonstrated the lowest mutuality among all group discussions: there was little negotiation in their chat discussion and few revision instances on each other’s contributions (1, 18, 10) (Table 5). The group chat discussion clearly showed nonreciprocal interaction with little scaffolding as the two other members took a passive role and contributed little to the text.

Scaffolding strategies were not exhibited in this group. Figure 6 exemplifies one of the instances where the dominant writer RE asked other members to share their ideas and resources to write the introduction. However, they did not respond (lack of responsivity), that precluded the divergent thinking that leads to reaching consensus (lack of intersubjectivity). RE was outraged and complained that they were irresponsible and careless. YA then responded in an inattentive manner, saying that she had sent the documents to RE, to which RE replied that she had sent broken links.

# Collaborative writing strategies

I analyzed the DocuViz and accompanying chat content to identify the writing strategies and working modes in terms of synchronicity. Most groups started with an outline in which one member created the title page with the main headings. Then, each student would write briefly or begin their part. Before the first draft was due, students began composing more to complete the requirements. After the instructor’s feedback, they tried to edit their text accordingly.

Figure 7. Continued.

Groups 2 and 4, who both demonstrated a collaborative pattern, used different writing strategies (Figure 7). The analysis of the group visualization and chat discussion revealed that the students in Group 4 adopted a synchronous hands-on style. They divided their work among each other, but then arranged a Zoom call so that they would all be online as they worked on the Google Doc. The visualization chart shows that students started with the divide and conquer style, in which each student wrote their section. Later, just three days before the due date, they adopted the synchronous hands-on style, where all four students were online and simultaneously built on each other’s text. They freely edited each other’s work by either correcting, reordering, or deleting, as indicated by the frequent intermingling of colors throughout the chart.

Group 2 adopted a more divide and conquer style, where they divided their work into sections and worked in parallel. The chart showed a few intermingling lines by the blue writer, indicating a few edits on each other’s text. This group used WhatsApp chats as their main platform for planning and discussing the task. Once they decided on a plan, they began working on the Google Docs.

Group 5 initially adopted a sequential style, in which each member wrote their section and passed it to the other writers. However, toward the due date, the experts (AM and MU) demonstrated a more cooperative revision style. All group members went online to complete their texts, and MU and AM freely moved around all parts of the document and made the required edits. AM began writing and contributing to the text just one day before the due date because she had a technical issue accessing the Google Doc (she was able to view but not edit it). However, the group chat showed that she was present to provide explanations and feedback when needed. Once she was able to edit, AM was very active; besides inserting her own parts, she also completed edits throughout the document.

Similarly, Group 1 demonstrated a sequential style. The blue writer (NF) started outlining the document with a name stamped with each section that resembled the group’s chat discussion, asking each member to write their sections. After the instructor’s first round of feedback, the students became more active, and all members tried to contribute to the text. The orange writer (MA), not the authoritative leader (NF), engaged with most of her partners’ texts and undertook some edits, as indicated by the intermingling lines and her additions in most text sections.

Group 3 manifested the main writer style as the text is mostly composed by the blue writer (RE). She started the task once it had been introduced and checked it every day, adding more content. The two other passive writers (YA and LU) checked the document only twice to add their parts and never returned. Even after the instructor feedback (orange line), only RE made the necessary changes.

Although all groups had some synchronous sessions, as indicated in Figure 7, these sessions occurred coincidentally without planning, except for Groups 5 and 4. There was no simultaneous editing or contributing apart from Group 4.

# Discussion

The study examined two research questions. Regarding the interaction patterns, students demonstrated different patterns (collaborative, dominant/withdrawn, expert/novice, and authoritative/passive). While these patterns are consistent with previous findings (Li & Zhu, 2013; Storch, 2002, 2005), some variations exist. For example, groups 2 and 4, identified as collaborative, exhibited mutuality differently. Group 2 demonstrated this characteristic via group online chats, whereas group 4 via other WCFs. This indicates the value of using metadata sources, enabling me to precisely pinpoint equality and mutuality parameters. In fact, the groups’ approaches and uses of technological tools seem to have impacted the enacted patterns. Most groups used WhatsApp, yet their use varied. Groups 1 and 3 used the app to share basic information, divide the work, ask for clarifications, and engage in social interaction. Meanwhile, Groups 2 and 5 viewed it as a space to share texts and receive peer feedback before posting on Google Docs. Interestingly, Group 4, the most active group in terms of WCFs, switched to Zoom, a video/audio call app. They found this more suitable for facilitating the CW process and understanding each other’s perspectives, consistent with Cho’s (2021) findings that voice chat enhanced understanding and increased students’ task discussions. Group 4 used WhatsApp to plan Zoom calls or ask clarification questions. Moreover, all groups rarely used the comment and chat functions of Google Docs even though they were trained on how to use all Google Docs functions, especially those related to communication.

Students’ selection and engagement with specific technological tools could be influenced by their previous experiences and beliefs. Thorne (2003) stated that ‘individual and collective experience is shown to influence the way students engage in internet-mediated communication with consequential outcomes for both the process and products of language development’ (p. 38). Students favored familiar apps to accomplish their goals. Notably, as the groups in the study comprised four students (with the exception of one group with three students), group members exhibited their group’s identified pattern at different rates; for example, WE and SA in group 2 and RA and Hu in group 4 as indicated by the proportion of individuals’ contributions (Table 4). The study echoed Abram’s (2016) call that modifiers in non-dyadic groups (high, moderate, and low) are needed to accurately describe group interaction patterns, especially among many differentiated groups. Another way of analyzing group patterns could follow Aufa and Storch’s (2021) approach, in which they provided different descriptors for each group member (e.g. facilitate/ cooperative/cooperative).

Regarding the second question, the text mining supported by the visual analysis showed that during the planning stage, students distributed the task in which one member initiated the document with an outline followed by other members contributing either in parallel or sequentially. They then engaged in different writing strategies during the revision stage. The use of a divide-and-conquer strategy at the beginning may have been influenced by the writing task ‘literature review’. Li and Zhu (2017) pointed out that an annotated bibliography lends itself to a division of labor in which members summarize their selected studies. Another factor could be the communication mode. Aufa and Storch (2021) found that groups working on CW tasks in blended contexts exhibited more cooperative or passive styles wherein students wrote their assigned parts discussed during class meetings. In contrast, they were more collaborative during class meetings in which they discussed the assignment. Since it was difficult to arrange a time for everybody to be online simultaneously (except for Group 4), students wrote individually at their convenience based on collaborative discussions during class or on WhatsApp, resulting in a sequential and parallel writing strategy.

Interestingly, the study illuminated the recursive writing patterns overshadowed by manual coding (Strobl, 2014). Previous studies (Li & Storch, 2017) noted that students’ collaboration mainly occurs during the planning and reviewing phases. Students write individually during the composing phase owing to the difficulty of writing simultaneously. The visual analysis in the present study revealed that Google Docs affords students a new ‘hands-on’ writing style (Group 4) in which they can simultaneously build on each other’s contributions during the composing phase.

# Conclusion

CW is a complex and multidimensional task in which various factors and variables interplay with the nexus of the interaction patterns’ framework. Aiming to complement the previous work on CSCW, this study utilized different data sources, adopted various coding frameworks for analysis, and performed text mining analysis to examine the CW strategies enacted throughout the writing process in contrast to group interaction patterns, between which previous studies have not distinguished clearly. The study showed that The two collaborative groups (2 and 4) exhibited different writing strategies. While groups 1 and 5, who displayed different interaction patterns, demonstrated similar writing strategies (sequential). It is hoped that this study will stimulate more discussion in developing a framework for collaborative writing strategies distinct from Storch’s peer interaction framework (Li & Zhang, 2021).

The study has important pedagogical and methodological implications. Pedagogically, DocuVis is a straightforward app; once the instructor grants access to a certain Google Doc, a visual display like the ones in Figure 7 is shown, accompanied by statistical information about each member’s contributions. Instructors can use these details to get a sense of the workflow of individual written contributions, review the revision/ editing histories, and, most importantly, assess the CW process rather than the final product. For instance, in this study, students were informed about the grading procedures that the instructor would use with the help of DocuViz. This may explain why, in this study, few students were ‘free-riders’ or ‘social loafers’, which can negatively affect the merits of CW activities (Arnold et  al., 2012; Li & Zhu, 2016). One downside is that DocuVis is only compatible with Chrome and, specifically, Google Docs. Further, it is important that teachers raise students’ awareness about maintaining a positive relationship with their fellow group members and building an online rapport. An authoritative tone and a lack of responsivity negatively impacted the overall environment of Groups 1 and 3; therefore, teachers could provide students with examples of good and bad interactions in online interactions. Teachers can also ask their students to use the app for self-assessment or reflection on their collaboration. One downside is that DocuVis is only compatible with Chrome and, specifically, Google Docs.

Methodologically, as Thorne (2003) previously noted, web-based collaborative tools do not only serve as a medium for collaboration, but also provide learners with new arrays of collaboration characterized by their recursive nature. However, even though Google Docs facilitates collaboration in all writing stages, its complexity poses challenges to analysis. Abrams (2019) noted that analyzing Google Docs revision histories was tedious. Strobl (2014) also found that the writing and reviewing phase was ‘hardly distinguishable’ in terms of manual analysis. This study implanted text-mining techniques triangulated with qualitative and quantitative analyses allowing me to detect information about students’ collaborative writing process that would otherwise have been unattainable.

Despite these implications, some limitations should be considered. First, the study attempted to account for all the surrounding factors of the CW activity, which necessitated a relatively small sample size (19 students divided into five groups); thus, the findings cannot be generalized to other contexts. Second, the study focused on just one task type that might have influenced the enacted writing strategies, although this connection was not its focus. Examining the relationship between task type and CW strategies is worthy of future examination. Finally, the student participants in all groups were mostly high achievers, which must be considered when interpreting the study’s results. The analysis revealed that the three students with a good GPA (below average) contributed to the text. Yet, they never or rarely engaged in others’ contributions and did not try to edit. This could stem from a lack of confidence in their language level, as noted by Aydin and Yildiz (2014). However, there were other students with an excellent GPA (HU in Group 4 and GH in Group 1) and a very good GPA (NO and NS in Group 5), who similarly did not engage in others’ text. Therefore, factors that led to less mutuality merit future research. Previous research (Lee, 2010; Olson et  al., 2017) related the existence of leaders in groups to a better final written product. Interestingly, in this study, groups that demonstrated high equality and mutuality were those with no evidence of leadership. Future research could investigate the potential impact of leadership on groups’ collaborative interactions and the final written product.

This study is significant as it goes beyond Storch’s (2002) framework, which provides invaluable insights into groups’ equality and mutuality parameters of CW interaction patterns, to closely investigate the writing strategies through the lens of text mining analysis, revealing details and illustrating the steps that students enacted to collaboratively co-construct the text. CSCW studies could continue this endeavor by using DocuVis information to illuminate groups’ writing strategies in relation to different phases of the writing process, that is, the sequences of collaborative knowledge construction. They could also explore different CW interaction patterns in relation to writing strategies. Further, researchers could utilize information from DocuVis for product–process assessment as opposed to product-only assessment and its effect on learners’ performances
