East Asia

This study explores the ways in which English for Specific Purposes (ESP) teachers in three East Asian countries, Vietnam, Japan, and Thailand, understand and utilize top-down and bottom-up (hereafter abbreviated to TD and BU respectively) teaching pedagogies in their classrooms. A judicious combination of either approach in both classroom pedagogy has long been advocated by both theorists and veteran practitioners. However, the authors, when working as teacher trainers, had observed that many ESP teachers reverted almost wholly to bottom-up approaches in their classroom practices. The present study seeks to understand whether or not this perception is accurate and what justifications and/or explanations might be put forward in favour of adopting either approach in ESP milieus. With the participation of 14 ESP teachers in Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, the study was conducted using a semi-structured written questionnaire which was followed by an open-ended live interview. Emerging and significant themes were then identified and codified by the authors, utilizing a reflective ethnographic approach. Among the most sig. nificant findings were 1) that teachers often failed to apply aspects of their training as language teachers into their own classrooms and 2) that the judicious application of either approach was more often performed unconsciously than as a result of any conscious methodological application.

# 1. Introduction

# Nomenclature

Macro-structure and micro-structure are terms that have been used acros a variety of academic disciplines ever since Van Dijk's (1980) seminal description of higher-level structures relating to global meanings, themes, or topics acros academic and professional disciplines. Almost allcomplex items, whether physical or theoretical, can be said to have both a macro and micro structure often popularly referred to in the binary form of big picture vs. details). In lingustics, macrostructure refers to both the surrounding parameters (participants, environment etc.) and/or the form of a text or discourse, as opposed to its microstructure, the internal qualities, such as syntax. In second language pedagogy, this dualit i often manifested in the dichotomy of top-down vs. bottom-up, referring to how learning content may be processed by both teachers (as a pedagogical aproach) and learners (as a method of acquisition), a distinction that should affect pedagogical choices and practices. Generally, top-down processes will prioritize macrostructures whilebottom-up approaches willemphasizethe micro. For the sake of brevity, the terms top-down and bottom-up wil hereafter be abbreviated to TD and BU respectively.

The term ESP Teachers' in this paper refers to those universty English teachers whose students are not majoring in English itself but rather a subject or skillwhich includes English study as a part of is required curriculum. ESP can broadly be further divided into English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English for Professonal Purposes, with the later being the primary focus of this paper. Within the category of 'ESP teachers' we are also careful to distinguish between those trained as English teachers and 'subject teachers', those professionals or experts in the subject domain not trained or employed specficall as English teachers, ut who teach content courses in English.

# 1.1. TD vs. BU pedagogies in ESP

In order to more clearly understand the research focus of the present study, it is necesary to provide a conceptual grid as to what the terms top-down/bottom-up refer to in terms of actual pedagogical practices within the scope of ESP.

When teaching aparticular speech event or written text type, one initially has to consider the communicative purpose/function, which willin tur affect the suitability of the linguistc choice applied. These choices may include particular rhetorical moves that are codified by rules governing the specific type of discourse community within which the exchange is taking place. These, in turn, will demand particular lexical and syntactical choices at the micro-structural level.

A layman's view of acquiring a second language might be that it would naturally be built up from the smallest semantic units, words and syntax, which graduall accumulat into larger units sentences, then paragraphs, and then eays or other extended texs. Indeed, when teaching FL beginners, particularly children, it can be difficult to avoid such an approach. However, once learners are at a certain age and have a certain degree f cognitive sophistication and a basic grasp of second language vocabulary and syntax,a i the case with most ESP students, it may not be helpful to always proceed from smaller to larger units but rather to approach specialist speech and written texts from a top-down perspective.

Teachers of specialist speech events and written texts may choose o initiall focus upon it general purpose/function, fllowed by the codified internal structure, before breaking it down into smaller units. However, it is also possible that some teachers might approach such speech events and text-types from multiple directions: alternating between top-down and bottom-up as the content requires.

It is these type of practces in the ESP classrooms of East Asiaand the choices (or lack thereof) underpinning them-that we hope to illuminate in the present study. The crucial questions are to what degree ESP teachers actull utilize uch approaches within their classroms and why these pedagogical choices are made. Do teachers teach rhetorical moves with leaners expected to add specialist content? Are templates or models presented? Is there a constant movement between a focus on the macro-structure interspersed with attention paid o microstructure? fso, how are thee proceses typically manag?The i aso the possility tha some teacers will choose to not teach set speech events or particular text-types at all. Is this a conscious decision? If so, why?

Based on these initial enquiries, the authors then sought to answer the main research questions of this study:

(1) What are the participating teachers' perceptions of TD and BU teaching approaches? (2) How do they utilize TD and BU teaching approaches in their classrooms? (3) What factors affect their choices of TD/BU teaching approaches?

# 1.2. Literature review

A sensitivity to, and concern for, understanding broader contexts as a basis for second language pedagogy goes back as far as Hymes' (1974) introduction of the SPEAKING model. SPEAKING is n acronym, in which the constituents of a given speech event were established as: Seting/scene, Participants, Ends, Act sequence, Key (comparable to tenor/register), Instrumentalities (comparable to mode), Norms, and Genre. It isthrough an analysi of each of these constitents, it was argued, that best enables one to fully grasp the framework of a speech event, enabling effctive communication in specialist domains. Although Hymes was more concerned with a genre-based description of spoken language and not pedagogy per se, the SPEAKING model presents one of the earliest and most widely recognized approaches to the top-down processing of language, one which can be applied to both the teaching of speaking and of writing.

An illustration as to how this may be manifested in terms of TD and BU pedagogies may appear as follows. Letsconsider history. taking, a primary speech event in medical discourse. AD approach would give priority to questions such as: What is the purpose of the interaction? Who are the participants and how does this afect the management of the interaction? What typical moves or sequences does the event involve? Whereas from a BU perspective, the teacher may be concerned about question structure or the frequent use of the perfect tense to indicate symptom lengths. Writing may manifest itself in terms of clinical case reports, in which TD gives consideration to a distinct purpose (communicating clinical data),a different audience (fellow health workers), and the use of stan. dardized clinical categories, al of which require learner atention. A BU approach, meanwhile, might ead a writing instructor to focus more upon medical terminology or, perhaps, helping learners to syntacticall differentiate between expressing patient past history, recent past, and current status.

Consideration for TD-led approaches has subsequently been manifested as a cornerstone of genre analysis. Genres are described as staged, structured, communicative events, motivated by various communicative purposes, and performed by members of specific discourse communities (Berkenkote & Huckin, 95; Bhatia, 1993; Swales, 1990) beause, \*different discilines have different ways of presenting information," (Goh, 2012, p. 67). Analyses of target genres are expected to be performed by ESP instructors in order to grasp the underlying assumptions and values f those genres. A degree of metacognitive istruction is therefore considered esential in ESP pedagogy since the purposes, assumptions, and rhetorical formulae of a particular genre are understood as being a "staged, goal-oriented social process" (Martin, 1992, p. 505).

Genre analysis has never meant to be a mere academic exercise but, rather, operates upon the assumption that an understanding of gere will manifest itelf in classoom materis and practce. SP practitioners therefore require ounding edagogical decisions in our understanding of target texs and practices" (Hyland, 2002, p. 393) since the goal of much of (genre) research is pedagogic . n the form of syllabus and materias design (Flowerdew, 2011, p. 516). A particular strength of ESP practice has ben the maintenance of a balance between research and pedagogical practice, motivating practitioners to uncover authentic descriptions of specialized language to be used specifically for teaching purposes (Hewings, 2002).

To summarize, most ESP practitioners/researchers agree that a pedagogical focus needs to be placed on both the micro and macro needs of students (Tarantino, 198) because, "all benefit from knowing structure of genre and ways to achieve speaking aims" (Feak. 2012, p. 48). Thus, due to ESP's primarily pedagogical orientation, most genre-based research has followed the expectation that genre analysis will provide practitioners with decriptions that can be implemented in syllabi and manifested in material (Hyland, 2004; Swales & Feak, 2004). The communicative purposes of different genres, "are recognized by the expert members of the parent discourse community" which \*shapes the schematic structure of the discourse and influences and constrains choice of content and style, because "exemplars of a genre exhibit various pattns of similarity in terms of structure, style, content and intended audience (Swales, 1990, p.58). Genre analysis therefore represents a top-down, process-based approach to understanding texts,starting with the macrostructure and larger units of text, as opposed to sentence-level minutiae or lexico-grammatical forms (Swale, 2002). Thus, having analyzed specific genres, the ESP teacher should consider how best to teach them in order to provide leaners with aces to a specific discourse community.

# 1.3. The East Asian context

In this study, although the participants come from three diffrent counries (Japan, Thailand, and Vienam), our resarch purpose is not to compare or contrast pedagogical practices on a national basis. Rather, we view these countries as having sufficiently similar EFL/ESL teaching and learning environments to warrant iclusion under a wider East Asia banner. Some features of this shared environment include the fct that ll thre countries teach English as foreign language, as Englishi not in common use domestically in any of them, and that Englishis linguisically, cultrall, and psychologically far removed from the native languages ofall three countries, meaning that most learners come to the English language as near or absolute beginners, which, in turn, can affct pedagogical approaches and teaching methods.

Moreover, traditional English teaching in these three countries has tended to view test taking and the awarding of resultant qualifications a the main endgame of English study, which in turn, has engendered a pedagogical focus on the taching and leaning of discrete items, usually stuctral/synactical n form, typicll pitched at the sentence level, ad usually involing textbook r teachergenerated texts, in short, a propensity to view bottom-up approaches as the default. However, there has also ben a recent increase in establishing viable ESP programs in the region, with the aim being the development of professionals and academics who can engage in international business practices or academic discourse communities in English. ESP teaching would normally necesstate a multivariate pedagogical approach, combining top-down and bottom-up strategies, but we wonder if this i actuallyoccurring in practice. Based on our experienceas both teachers and teacher trainers in the region, our hunch is that significant number of local Asian ESP teachers stil favour a bottom-up approachto ESP teaching, even wher it might be pedagogially inadvisable. We also suspect that this might be occurring unknowingly or unwittingly neglected in spite of some respondents' formal knowledge of how language is structured and practiced, which they likely would have been exposed to as graduate students in their teacher education.

With this is mind, the ESP contexts of the three countries included in the present study are here reviewed. In Vietnam, while schema-building through activities in reading is quite widely accepted and practiced, this appears to be les common in terms of the productive skils (Pham & Le, 2020). Further, according to Pham and Bui (2021), in Vietnam: \*Writing teachers do not pay much attention to contexts and communicative purposes in the writing teaching process" (p.95) and thus have not provided students with sufficient knowledge of genre-based approaches to writing" (p.96). Such neglec f the communicatie purpose and audience f texts is echoed by Trinh and Nguyen (2014) who state that most Vietnamese teachers aim primarily at having their students produce grammatically mistake-free texts, often resulting in a lack of overall clarity (Tran, 2018).

Research in Thai settings echoes the benefits of fering a genre-based approach to ESP. Kongpetch (2006) states that, \*The strengths of the approach encouraging students to think, plan and work at the whole-text level result in graduates having an expectation of working with extended and elaborated ideas" (p.25). Srinon (2011) claims that student essays matched bettr with genre prototypes interms of exposition and discussion after being taught with a genre-based approach. Ueasiriphan and Tangkiengsirisin (2019) nt hat, tis the teacher reonsibility o provide stratgi fr te eaer to analye . Tradtiona grmmar instruction is also necessary, but needs to be based on the particular language features essential to the genre" (p.735).

In Japan, pplications of genre analysis to the classoom context in Japan has been lagging until very recently as most EFL learners in Japan are told to memorize the literal meanings of vocabulary items without being taught their functional meanings (Nagao, 2019, p. 14) even though \*macro and micro scaffolding assted learners to organize their writing and understand the nature of the target text" (p.16). However, the question as to whether the wider pedagogical applications of genre and other top-down frameworks hold sway in the Japanese ESP classroom remains open, as resistance to top-down ESP approaches has been reported (Guest, 2016).

Given the teaching contexts, and some of the local typical characteristics as mentioned above in the three East Asian countries, it appears that littl research has been done to shed light on how English teachers reall utilize the knowledge of genre analysis or TD teaching approach in their teaching practices, especiall in ESP contexts. This actually reeals a notable gap that this study aims to ill in with the focus on the exploration of how ESP teachers in some East Asian contexts understand and utilize TD and BU teaching pedagogies in their classrooms.

# 2. Methods

Our study attempted to discover non-native English-speaking East Asian ESP teachers' top-down/bottom-up approaches and practices through a combination of questionnaires and fac-to-face interviews. Although the distinction between so-called native and non-native peakers of a language is blurr to the extent that the binary concept has largely been eschewed, we felt the inclusion of teachers who had leaned English as a mother tongue would skewer the parameters of our inquiry, since English as first language ESP teachers willinvariably have learned the language top-down. Our investigation, rather, sought to discover how those teachers who were likely have been exposed to English as a second/foreign language learning in a bottom-up manner now maintained their practice as professional language instructors. Therefore, allselected respondents were 2 speakers of English. The proces of investigation we undertook is described below.

The authors first developed and distributed a written questionnaire (see Appendix), conducted via email,followed by a supple mental online Zoom interview (typically lasting 30 minutes-1 hour) with 14 Japanese $\mathtt { ( n = 5 ) }$ , Thai $( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ , and Vietnamese $( \mathtt { n } = 7 )$ ESP practitioners (se Table 1). The questionnaires were semi-structured, while the faceto-face iterviews were more open-ended and loosely structured, expanding upon points arising from the questionnaire responses and allowing for any necessary re-interpretation or

readjustment of the responses by the participants.

The reason for this binary approach to data gathering is that the written questionnaire would allow respondents to compose more thoughtful answers and have time to familiarize themselves with the nomenclature. The live interview allowed participants to further discus the written responses, enabling participants to expand, explore, further explain, r ask the researchers for clarification, while the researchers confirmed and/or summarized.

The focus of the study/questionnaire and subsequent interviews was almost exclusively upon the productive skill of writing and speaking. Local, and not foreign, teachers were selected for this study primarily because we wanted to gain an overview of local practices. Both ESP or similarly specialized professonal content course English teachers (the latter hereafter referred to as subject teachers') in Vietnam, Japan, and Thailand were selected as respondents. In order to gain a wellrounded understanding of the pedagogical practices employed, the authors sought a variety of age, training/teaching experience and academic/professional current teaching positions and institutions, and professional domains backgrounds among the respondents. While some of the respondents were previously known to the authors, others were recommended via networking and/or through colleague recommendations. Since the main purpose of this study was not to generalize the findings to all ESP teachers in those thre countries nor to explicate the differences among them, convenience sampling was employed so as to gain aces to participants who were avalable and wiling to cooperate in the research, and would thus be considered more committed to provide rich dataregarding their thoughts and practices.

After initial contact was made with the participants, and a general outline of the purpose of the questionnaire/interview was explained, the questionnaire was sent to willing respondents. It was made explicitl clear that respondents need not answer all questions by email and that afollow-up online or face-to-face interview would take place and this would allow for further expansion on the subtler or more demanding questions.

In order to obtain an accurate description of how teachers manage their ESP classes, as opposed to how participants may think they are supposed to respond given the orientation of the questions, the authors emphasized to the respondents that any lack of familiarity with the pedagogical or linguistic ssues discussed would in no way be penalized or regarded as problematic, and that the interviews would serve primarily for the purposes of expansion and clarification.

The online interviews were recorded with the respondents permission. Respondents could refuse to answer any question and stop the interview at any time. The names and institutions of the respondents have been anonymized in this final publication. The in. terviews conducted in Vietnam were carried out entirely in Vietnamese. The interviews conducted in Japan and Thailand were conducted largely in English, with Japanese being used occasionally for purposes of expansion and/or clarification. Interview lengths ranged from $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$

Afer completing the interviews, the authors conferred in order to note any significant emerging patterns among the responses in the analysis of the data obtained in both the questionnaires and the live interviews. Common keywords and significant phrases were noted, correlations between teaching environments and practices were also closely observed and codified. Thorough efforts were made by the researchers to fully and accurately grasp the initial responses of the participants during these interviews. Included were several cases in which the researchers offered their own observations on the practices previously mentioned by the participants for the purposes of clarification and the possbilit of ltering or adjusting a response. On two occasions, respondents were contacted again for further clarification, although the content of the data that the researchers eventually codified or deemed as significant were not directly conveyed to the participants. Interms of data analysis, the data from both the semi-structured questionnaires and the recorded and subsequently transcried interviews were carefully noted and categorized acording torecurring themes, from which several findings were initially highlighted and then either confirmed or discarded as being significant after follow-up interviews and discussion. Table 1 includes a brief outline of respondent identity and responses.

Such an approach to gaining data on classoom practices can serve to paint a picture of genre norms which might be further applied to the ESP classroom, with irs-hand inerpretation, local context, and situated texts providing alegitimate perspective of practices (Hyland, 2002). Therefore, the methodological process we employed is lrgely in keeping with a reflective ethnographic approach to gaining qualitative data, with the cultural milieu of the participants being that of ESP teachers within the East Asian region. Such an approach typicall strives to include generalizations made by participants that are later compared to or contrasted with the re. searcher's observations and interpretations (Harklau, 2011), whil alsoalowing the opportunity for further feedback from the par. ticipants (Scollon and Scollon, 2001), both points of which we acted in accordance with.

All participants were fully informed regarding the content and nature of the study as well as their roles in obtaining the data. Full consent was obtained by each of the respondents before both completing the questionnaire and proceeding with the interview. It was further consented that the respondents would not be identified by name or institution in the text of the study.

# 3. Results

In order to analyze the results of our study, let us return to the three research questions that we initially established.

(1) What are the participating teachers' perceptions of TD and BU teaching approaches? (2) How do they utilize TD and BU teaching approaches in their classrooms? (3) What factors affect their choices of TD/BU teaching approaches?

Below, a number of results emerging from our inquiry that we consider to be significant are listed and explained briefly in relatior to each of these three research questions. Respondents are encoded as TV1, TV2, TV3, TV4, TV5, TV6, TV7, TJ8, TJ9, TJ10, TJ11 TJ12, TT13, TT14, corresponding to the order in which the teachers were interviewed and an abbreviation of their nationality (whic)

in every case also matches their current teaching stting). J refers to Japan, T to Thailand, and V to Vietnam. According to the coding, TV1, for example, refers to the first teacher from Vietnam.

# 3.1. Participant perceptions of TD and BU teaching approaches

# 3.1.1. Degree of familiarity with TD and BU approaches

In the questionnaire, only four respondents (TV2, TV3, TJ9, TJ10) stated that they were familiar with top-down (TD) as an explicit teaching approach, although several others with ELT backgrounds expressed some awareness f the notion of top-down as a means of learner content processing (as opposed to it being a pedagogical approach).

Two respondents (TJ11, TT14) initiall, and mistakenly, believed that TD referred to teacher-centered classrooms. When informed of our definition of TD during the video interview, three interviewees (TJ8, TJ11, TT14) immediately appeared to grasp the concept and subsequently altered some of their responses from the questionnaire. As one respondent (T11) said, Td misundersood. In that case, I suppose I actually do a lot of top-down teaching. Two respondents (TV1, TV4) (perhaps due to their lack f formal teacher education) indicated a complete lack of knowledge regarding TD/BU approaches. Interestingly, one teacher (TV7), despite having a PhD degree in English teaching methodology, thoroughly misunderstood the connotations of TD/BU approaches. Further, si of the 14 respondents associated TD approaches only with receptive kills reading and listening) and not with productive skill (speaking and writing).

Most respondents had only a very vague, and sometimes questionable, understanding of the concept of textual macrostructure/ microstructure with only TV2, TV3, and TJ10 understanding the notions well (perhaps due to lengthy in-service and specialized training backgrounds). When these concepts were further explained during the interview, three respondents (TJ8, TT14, TV1) admitted that these concepts were something new, and potentially helpful, to them although TV1 added that, Even now, although understand more about them, to be honest, I don't know how to apply them in my teaching. Two respondents, subject teachers who did not come from linguistic or formal language teaching backgrounds and thus had no familiarity with these terms, immediately understood their applications once this was clarified during the video interview.

# 3.1.2. TD perceived as 'difficult' applied linguistics

Two of the respondents formally educated in ESP teaching were familiar with academic felds such as discourse and genre analysis from their days as graduate applied linguistics students but admitted to never having aplied these to their actual clsroom pedagogies (TJ9, TJ12). Both teachers expressed the view that such fields were largely of value only to lingustics students and therefore had no discernible value in ESP/ELT classrooms. Further, one teacher (TV7) claimed that her students are not linguistic students}, and therefore it was not necessary for them to understand the structure/template of the texts/materials provided for them. Others stated that they felt reluctant to use such pedagogies in their teaching because they might not know how to apply it (TV1, TV4), or because they were teaching content-based course rather than actual ESP contexts (TV2, TV3, TV5, TV6).

Three respondents (TJ9, TJ11, TT14) expresed a belief that they could not adequately teach TD because their students were "not proficient enough in general English" (T11) or that they hadn't yet mastered or perfected the basic language" (TJ9). Other respondents also regarded TD as an approach that should be applied only to the most proficient of students, with (TV7) claiming that, it is not necessary for my students to understand sophisticated structures or analysis of the texts or materials'.

Some respondents further stated that by simply teaching terminology and grammar structure their students could perform suffi ciently well in the target stuations. (TJ9) admitted to doing so because they believed these produced the outcomes that were, apparently, favoured by thir institution. However, once the D approach was further explained, TJ9, TJ11, and T14 all expressed a greater need to become more aware of applying it.

3.2. Participant utilization of TD and BU teaching approaches in the classroom

# 3.2.1. Common parameters towards utilizing TD or BU approaches

The narrower a particular course description was, the more likely it was that teachers paid attention to macro-structure or employed aTD approach. One teacher (TT13), who taught course explicitly designated for Oral Presentations said that she,\*. could only teach top down, starting with understanding the audience or purpose of an academic presentation'. To respondents (TJ10, TT13) also emphasized the importance of activatig cognitive strategies and utilizing the students existing knowledge of the domain as a springboard for introducing content in English. TJ10 stated that, \*the students have some knowledge of the content in Japanese already. I use that to inroduce English contents. TT13 employed only self-made materials, including speech models and templates. In other words, these teachers were consciously activating leaner cognition at a general level before proceeding to teaching more specific items.

In contrast, the more general the course designation, the more likely teachers were to use a BU approach. Three respondents (TJ9, TJ10, TJ12) considered BU teaching to be a default, standard approach. One respondent (TJ9) boldly stated, \*Of course my approach is bottom up since I am a language teacher, not a cientist. BU teaching aproaches seemed to be more common than TD among many respondents because of their choiceto fous n teaching teminology in the field rather than moves/spech events, text types, or larger units of discourse. For example, several respondents (TV4, TV5, TV6, TV7, TJ8, TJ9, TJ10, TJ11, TT14) viewed the pecialist aspect of their ESP classes as being either largely or almost exclusively reducible to the study of terminology. Most of these teachers also admitted to a strong BU orientation in their pedagogy and had not deeply considered genres, macrostructures, or wider-ranging modes of discourse although such approaches, particularly those involving authentic texs and tasks, despite these having long been widely :commended in EFL teacher training (Allwright & Allwright, 1977)

# 3.2.2. Unconscious usage of TD approaches

It quickly became apparent through the video interviews that many of the teachers used partial top-down approaches uncon. sciously. One respondent (TJ8) who teaches economics student, said, T have never tried top-down teaching" but subsequently stated that, "I usually sart by having students discuss what they know about the topic, what kind of writing iscommon in that subject and What the function is before I introduce something." This is, of course, an explicit example of top-down teaching.

It appeared that in cases where the courses were designed towards the production of written texts (as in the Business Communi. cation courses of TV1, TV2, TV3) and dialogues (for medical students, as with TV5, TV6), the teachers admitted to having more opportunities to use TD teaching, although most seemed unaware of such applications until this was discussed in the interviews. ven though written texs in professional disciplines will inevitably include clear purposes vary significantly acording to the mode of communication, and carry different lels of register, they also tend to follow templates that guide or standardize form. Nonetheless most of the teachers mentioned above admitted to progressing primarily from sentence-level to paragraph-level structure, and only thereafter to the whole-text level (BU to TD) when teaching such specific writing genres.

Those with professional backgrounds outside of English teaching or language pedagogy (subject teachers TJ8, TT13, TT14) all employed interlocking elements of both TD and BU pedagogy in their clasroom practices, even though they were not explicitly aware of these pedagogicalapproaches. For example, T13 expressed the need to emphasizeteaching dental procedure asa series of discrete 'moves' in English.

# 3.2.3. Alternation between TD and BU approaches

Based on the description of their lessons, those respondents who appeared to use both top-down and bottom-up approaches (TJ10, TJ11, 14) tended to shif between these pproaches constantly, oten unconsciously, during thecourse of a given lesso. One (TJ11) stated, usually start with a lis of the new vocabulary in the leson bottom-up but then  have students do group work to discuss why that vocabulary is being used, for what purpose, which I suppose is kind of top-down. This preceded addressing the actual linguistic content, providing the students with a framework that would allow the content to be more easily processed. TV5 and TV6 stressed their utilization of student background knowledge to brainstorm about the topics before providing them with any new terminology, with TV5 stating, Depending on the topic, I can ask the students to discuss what they already know about i, and then I willintroduce the vocabulary".

# 3.3. Factors affecting participant choices of TD/BU teaching approaches

# 3.3.1. Perceived influence of institutional restraints on $T D$

A significant number of respondents (TJ8, TJ9, TJ10, TJ12, TT14) stated that the textbooks were not of their own choosing, forcing' them to adopt at least to some extent, a BU approach, although it was not made clear how having mandated textbooks necessarily precludes such an approach. Two respondents (TJ8, TJ12) claimed to use more relective essays that focused upon the humanistic elements of the field rather than professional discourses. In the cases of TV4 and TJ10, specific and expected course outcomes (proficiency tests and licenses) strongly informed their BU teaching approaches. Some courses designated as ESP were actually expected toconform to a content-based curriculum, in which case it was claimed that i was dfficult for the teachers to apply a TD approach (TV1, TV2, TV3, TV7). As a result, these teachers admitted to focusing more on teaching content and/or specialist terminology in a piecemeal, linear, BU fashion.

# 3.3.2. Perceived difficulty in using authentic materials

It was hoped that having at least a knowledge of discourse and genre analysis would inform or inspire teachers about the potential value of using authentic materials in the classroom which would, further, be more likely to engender aD focus, but only two teachers (TJ11, TT13) admitted to doing so, one of whom is working at an elite high school and the other who is teaching graduate students. These two teachers admitted to analyzing authentic genres for rhetorical moves or to codify norms of discourse. The consensus among respondents, however, apeared to be that authentic ESP materials were oo advanced for their students. Interestingly though, TV2 and TV3 mentioned past teaching experiences in \*real ESP courses, in which they admitted to recognizing opportunities to apply an explicitly TD approach.

# 3.4. Brief summary of significant results

It i not surprising, giventhe variet f teaching roles, formal training, and teaching environments, that  wide variety of responses were elicited. The results were ecectic, although certain patterns appeared to emerge corresponding to the type of teaching situation that respondents found themselves in. It became apparent that, in most cases, teachers could grasp and appreciate the concepts and potential applications of TD and BU, even if this grap was often unconscious. However, it appears that having a background in ESP and/or familiarity with the concepts did not necessarily mean that the teachers put them into practice. The most salient results are explicated further in the discussion.

# 4. Discussion

The concepts of top-down/bottom-up and macro/micro structures in language pedagogy are not particularly esoteric or complex. We were not surprised that many respondents with academic ESP backgrounds were somewhat familiar with the notions and that most of those who were not from ESP backgrounds readily grasped the concepts once explained. Those who had misunderstood the scope of the term top-down (such as rendering it as meaning teacher vs. learner centered) werealso usually able to make immediate cognitive adjustments lthough, as noted in the preeding setion, there were still wo practtioners who did not em  fully grasp the concet even after a lengthy explanation and examples were presented).

Among respondents who undersood the concepts and aproaches well, more than half admitted to utilizing them only when teaching receptive sils (reading and istening), typically starting a task with a schema to serve as  springboard for interpreting the minutiae of the content. However, only two of the respondents actively used (or indeed, full understood) how TD approaches and focusing upon macro-structures could prove beneficial in teaching productive skill (writing and speaking). We believe the fact that TD approaches can be applied to speaking and witing wthin professional fields particularly in light of the widespread belief that students in much of the East Asian region lack productive English skils that would benefit them in the workplace, should be more widely disseminated in teacher training.

What did surprise us however was the small number of teachers who admitted to actively and consciously applying any of these approaches in the ESP classrom. The beliefs expressed by some that such abstract notions should be saved for applied inguisics students or that they be treated merely as formal aspects of teacher education were somewhat unsetting, particularly when one considers how foundational such pedagogical approaches are expected to be deployed in ESP classrooms.

It was also notable that subject teachers were occasionally employing TD approaches unconsciously. As experts with wide-ranging subject knowledge, this is perhaps to be expected. We feel, however, that it would be advantageous for subject teachers to be made more explicitl or actively aware of these approaches. A conscious understanding of generic moves or how certain discourse features allow for improved communication can inform lesson plans in which teachers consciously shift between TD and BU approaches. While subject teachers are valuable members of the language teaching community, we believe it would be even more beneficial for these subject teachers to receive specific ESP teacher training before engaging learners in the language classroom.

The necessit of textbooks, vague or general course descriptions, and lack of student English proficiency were also offered as reasons for not actively employing TD approaches. Most textboos that we are aware of, however, fer tass intended to utilize both TD and BU approaches. Moreover, textbooks can, and indeed should, be adapted by teachers to conform to their teaching priorities and approaches, not the other way around. What is more concerning though, is that many ESP textbook matrials are not based upon actual research (Dudley-Evans & St John, 1998), while Hyland (199) finds the use of textboos in ESP restrictive since they often do not, "introduce students to the fullrange of conventions within which the socio-cultural system of the discipline is encoded'" (p.22)

Course expectations that demand or require specific performance outcomes, however, are extremely problematic. Administrators who establish an ESP course but view scores arising from a standard English proficiency test as a measure of that course's succes need, as much as circumstances allow, toalter their outcome expectations to correspond with the course content. This may require some gentle persuasion by the teacher(s) involved which may not be an impossible task, particularly at intitutions in which teachers are given carte blanche over teaching methods and material. nglish course descriptions in EFL contexts are often left vague allowing teachers the opportunity to build or create courses and improved numerical outcomes need not necessarily imply the use of bottom-up, cumulative approaches. At the very least, teachers should not immediately capitulate to these incongruent demands without discussion or input. Even where administrators appear to be intransigent, this should not be viewed as an impediment to deploying TD strategies. Teachers can stillcraft their course descriptions to include a focus on macrostructures, common text types, or spech events found within the specific domain.

What our results appear to suggest is that ESP teachers would do wellto more actively learn about the genres and forms of discourse related to the students' fields of study. Genre analysis should not be viewed merely as an academic indulgence but s atool that can positively impact lassroom syllai, pedagogies, and materials (Flowerdew, 2010. Teachers should learn what wrien text-types are commonly utilized in their students field and how these are structured, as well as what speech events are standardized and how these are typically constructed and managed. Authentic materials thus should be sought out and, if necesar, be adapted by the teacher.If teachers can provide a realiti concetual framework, ESP students, who will usually hae some degre of subject/content knowledge, can adapt content to the frameworks provided by savy instructors. At the higher levels of ESP instruction, students can also serve as informants to both teachers and classmates (Pritchard & Nasr, 2004). In doing so, there i likely to be an ideal convergence between theory, research, and pedagogy (Johns, 2002; Swales, 2009) with the classroom being the goal of the research focus (Tard, 2006) and genre analysis treated as \* situated response to an emerging rhetorical need" (Swales & Rogers, 1995, p. 237). Therefore, collaboration with disciplinary experts and specialist informants is especially recommended if ESP teachers are not knowledgeable about students' disciplines (Horn et al., 2008; Hyland, 2007).

We recognize the dangers of possibly having presented TD versus BU approaches as a binary choice, with TD being the favoured concept and thus consciously sought to avoid influencing the respondents in this regard. However, we do believe that it would be beneficial for language teachers to make more conscious pedagogical choices for adopting one approach over the other at any given time and to be able to justify that choice. Providing discourse-based tass alongside lexico-grammatical tasks allows each approach to reinforce the other so tht, \*the combination of the two approaches . provides the enriched input necessry for students to make the connection between general rhetorical purposes and specific lexico-grammatical choices,' (Charles, 2007, p. 289).

Despite our summarizations above, we also caution against an over-dependency on TD approaches alone, as both ESP teachers and learners may come to see genre-based templates, moves, and models as static and prescriptive when in fact many are mallable, dynamic, and often contingent upon local factors. Bhatia (199) warns of this as possibly resulting in an oversimplification of the complex purposes, multiple functions, and varied intentions of the speaker/writer, while Bazerman (1988) suggests maintaining an constant awareness of the social contexts and surrounding texts, as opposed to merely providing students with, the formal trapings of the genres they need to work in' (p.320).

Our research questions were not of the variety that allow for a confirmed/unconfirmed binary response, as may be expected when employing a reflective ethnographic approach to a wide field such as language teaching methodology and practice. Although we entered the study with a few expectations, these did not constitute a hypothesis to be proven or disproven. Instead, as we have seen, a number of salient and sigificant possbilities were suggested by the study and we hope that other teacher/researchers may expand the scope of enquiry even further.

# 5. Conclusions

It may be suggested from our study that formal training in English language teaching sems to have littl impact on ESP teachers This further suggests that there should be more in-service training for ESP teachers to provide them with the practical sills regarding the delivery of ESP lessons by combining TD/BU approaches to make them more aware of genre-specific speech events, moves/ schemas, and text-types, and knowledge as to how these might be managed in the ESP classrom. Such approaches can further help to motivate students (Tardy, 2006) and facilitate their own investigation into their disciplinary discourses (Swales & Lindemann, 2002)

The differences noted in classroom practces between those respondents trained as English teachers and subject teachers trained in specialist fields also deerves moreattention, as this could be very significant in terms of understanding contemporary ESP pedagogical practices and policy.

While the locale of our inquiry was East Asia, it may wellbe that the practices and proclivities described here may apply to other, similar, locales in which specialist English is taught almost exclusively as a second or additional language. As such, we are not currently in a position to make claims beyond the regions discused in our study. We also, therefore, hesitate to make any further broad claims that the practices we describe are culture-bound. We would, however, welcome insights and input from ESP practitioners and researchers as to whether our analysis and the resultant issues we have raised pertain to the teaching of ESP in other geographical regions.

Our study also contains limitations that may mitigate its applicability. First although we attempted to apply a reflective ethnographic approach, which normally mandates some amount of acompanying field work in order to bolster or confirm perspectives claimed by the participants, our study was conducted at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic which made such activities unfeasible, such that only one actual classroom observation was undertaken (J11). However, in order to bridge any potential discrepancies between participant response and classoom practice, the Zoom-based interviews did allow participants to engage in extended discussion and explanation about classroom practices connected to pedagogical theories and approaches.

Second, based on the small number of participants, it is impractical to make wider generalizations as to what degree this may be reflective of ESP teaching in the East Asian region at large, which is why we consider our study to serve primaril as an iluminating snapshot of ESP practices in the region and nothing more.

Dialogue between disciplines for a fusion agenda of ESP teaching and research depends on an effort to bring together teachers, researchers, aplied linguis, and discourse analysts, particularly in East Asia, which is, . fertile gound for such dilogue to take place with the blesings of academic institutions and funding bodies. (Chiappini & Zhang, 2013). We hope that our study may contribute to such a dialogue.
