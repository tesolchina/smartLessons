# ABSTRACT

Studies have explored how second language (L2) learners engage with peer feedback in instructional contexts. However, how learners engage in self-initiated and self-directed feedback practices beyond the classroom in online spaces is largely unknown. Informed by an ecological perspective, an in-depth exploration of the dynamics and underpinning mechanisms of learners’ engagement with written peer feedback on an educational social networking site for L2 writers was conducted. Longitudinal data on 11 language learners’ interactions on the platform were collected. An analysis of their interactions on the platform over time and their responses to semi-structured interviews revealed that how they perceived and acted on feedback changed over time. Furthermore, these changes were intertwined with various individual and contextual factors. The findings suggest that encouraging socially related feedback, enhancing certain platform affordances, building a sense of community belonging and helping learners reconceptualise the platform in relation to their language learning are critical elements of enhancing learners’ engagement with peer feedback. They also indicate a need for a dynamic and holistic approach to understanding and supporting learner engagement with peer feedback beyond the classroom.

# Introduction

Peer feedback is a type of dialogic interaction between learners in which knowledge and understanding are shared to enhance learning (Zhu & Carless, 2018). Peer feedback has great potential to advance learning, as it benefits both the receivers and providers of the feedback cognitively and meta-cognitively (Cao, Yu, & Huang, 2019; Zhu & Carless, 2018). In the second language (L2) learning context, peer feedback as a form of dialogue between learners can enhance interactions through which learners clarify or negotiate meanings with each other, thus enhancing their language learning (Hyland & Hyland, 2006).

Social networking sites (SNSs), the social media platforms that enable users to access, create, evaluate, and share media resources with an emphasis on presenting personal profiles and networking (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; Lamy & Zourou, 2013; Reinhardt, 2017, 2019), have been found to hold great potential to advance language learning by offering peer feedback (Lin, Groom, & Lin, 2013). Social media, with its affordance for collective knowledge creation and learning through connection, is ‘inherently enabling informal learning experiences’ (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012, p. 4) and allows ‘learning in the wild’ (Haythornthwaite et  al., 2018, p. 219). Learning takes place on SNSs in the informal learning context through explanation, socializing, information seeking, providing resources under the rules and norms on the platforms (Haythornthwaite et  al., 2018). Greenhow and Lewin (2016) further argued that social media are learning spaces with varying informal and formal learning attributes. Social networking sites for language learning (SNSLLs), such as Lang-8, Babbel and Livemocha, are a form social media that combines language tutorials (e.g. instructional learning material) with social networking functions (e.g. enabling peer interaction, forming learning groups) to enhance the formal learning attributes so as to support language learners in the informal learning contexts. Interaction with native speakers beyond the classroom on SNSLLs may bring additional opportunities for peer feedback, providing L2 learners access to authentic linguistic resources (Xue & Churchill, 2019) and lowering the affective filters for peer feedback practices by supporting low-risk language and social practices with pseudonymous identities (Reinhardt & Zander, 2011; Wang & Vásquez, 2012). When social media shifts the provision of feedback from teachers to authentic audiences such as peers, how learning from peer feedback unfolds in such a learning space is worth investigating (Greenhow & Lewin, 2016; Haythornthwaite et  al., 2018).

However, most of the existing studies focused on language learners’ use of technology-mediated peer feedback during teacher-directed learning activities in instructional contexts (see Chang, 2016). Despite the wealth of opportunities and venues available for L2 learners to interact with native speakers in self-initiated learning beyond the classroom on social media, how L2 learners may engage with feedback from native speakers in their self-initiated experiences in these online spaces, SNSLLs in particular, has been relatively less explored. Given that different learning contexts/spaces may induce different perceptions of and reactions to the peer feedback received (see Díez-Bedmar & Pérez-Paredes, 2012; Gravett, 2020), inquiries that extend to the informal, autonomous online learning context may provide some insights into learners’ engagement with peer feedback. Therefore, the current study focused on the informal, autonomous online learning context. An analysis of L2 learners’ engagement with online peer feedback outside the classroom provides important information on language-learning social media platform design and the social interaction that is fundamental to the educational potential of such platforms.

To shed light on this issue, the current study examined learner engagement with peer feedback on an SNSLL, Lang-8, which was designed as an L2 writing sharing community. Lang-8 provides certain functions in common with general-purpose SNSs, such as user profiles, friending, messaging, and posting. Lang-8 also integrates the concept of tandem learning, in which Lang-8 users play both the role of L2 learners, whose writings are peer-reviewed by native speakers of their target languages, and the role of native speakers, who review writings in their native languages. To encourage peer review, the platform uses a reciprocity system in which users are awarded ‘L-points’ for providing feedback; the more L-points one has, the greater the possibility that one’s writings will be pushed to native speakers for review.

Studies examining learners’ experiences on SNSLLs have discussed the affordances and limitations of the sites’ design (Cho, 2015; Liu et  al., 2015; Nishioka, 2020), its pedagogical potential to support in-class writing instruction (Lin, 2015, 2019; Pollard, 2015), learners’ perceptions of the sites and their perceived learning outcomes (Lin, Warschauer, & Blake, 2016; Rosell-Aguilar, 2018). In the limited numbers of studies that did examine learners’ engagement with peer feedback on SNSLLs, factors that influence learner engagement were discussed in isolation from one another (e.g. Parrish, 2019), ignoring the fact that learner engagement with feedback is shaped by the interaction of individual and contextual factors (Chong, 2021; Han, 2019). Handley and colleagues (2011, p. 553) have also called for ‘broader systemic insights about how student engagement evolves over time’. Thus, using an ecological perspective that highlights a dynamic and holistic approach, this study examined learner engagement with peer feedback during self-initiated and self-directed use of Lang-8, by eliciting narrative interview responses from 11 Lang-8 users who had been using the platform for an average of 4.5 years and by tracking their interactions on the platform from the first day. The following two research questions were addressed:

1. What patterns of engagement with feedback did the participants develop on Lang-8 over time?   
2. How did individual and contextual factors interact to shape their engagement over time?

# Literature review

# Learner engagement with feedback

‘Learner engagement with feedback’ refers to ‘how learners respond to the feedback they receive’ (Ellis, 2010, p. 342). According to Ellis (2010), this concept includes a cognitive dimension (i.e. how learners perceive and attend to the feedback), a behavioural dimension (i.e. whether and in what ways learners attend and respond to the feedback) and an affective dimension (i.e. how learners feel emotionally about the feedback). Learners’ engagement with feedback is a manifestation of their feedback literacy, namely ‘the understandings, capacities and dispositions needed to make sense of information and use it to enhance work or learning strategies’ (Carless & Boud, 2018, p. 1316). Feedback literacy is essential to the realisation of the educational potential of feedback (Carless & Boud, 2018; Molloy, Boud, & Henderson, 2020). Thus, to understand the potential of peer feedback on SNSLLs, it is important to examine the nature of learners’ engagement with peer feedback on such platforms.

Studies examining learner engagement with feedback have reported the learning outcomes of such engagement (e.g. Hyland & Hyland, 2006; Liang, 2010; Ma, 2020), students’ behavioural patterns when interacting with peer feedback (e.g. Díez-Bedmar & Pérez-Paredes, 2012; Liang, 2010) and the factors that influence learners’ engagement in various instructional contexts (e.g. Malecka, Boud, & Carless, 2020; Min, 2005; Nash & Winstone, 2017; Yu & Hu, 2017). Studies (e.g. Hyland & Hyland, 2006; Liang, 2010; Ma, 2020) have documented the various cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes of learner engagement with peer feedback, such as enhancing writers’ audience awareness, improving writing quality in terms of language errors and content, developing pragmatic competence and boosting learning interest and motivation. Research has further found that learners’ behavioural engagement with peer feedback is subject to the characteristics and affordances of the specific learning context. For instance, Díez-Bedmar and Pérez-Paredes (2012) found that students responded more to language error–related feedback than to socio-affective feedback on wikis and in forum posts. They explained that the engagement patterns resulting from learners’ intentional learning were conducive to higher achievement in their writing assignments. In contrast, Liang (2010) found that students engaged more in social feedback during synchronous online interaction in writing classes for English as a foreign language (EFL), which may have been due to the nature of synchronous online spaces, which have better affordances for communicative interaction than for correcting errors. Studies have further identified a set of individual and contextual factors that shape learner engagement, such as language proficiency, feedback literacy, learning awareness, motives, learning beliefs, types of assignment, classroom culture and social traditions (Malecka et  al., 2020; Min, 2005; Nash & Winstone, 2017; Yu & Hu, 2017).

Interaction on social networking platforms has been identified as providing additional affordances for peer feedback, as the feedback may offer not only language learning support but also social and emotional support (e.g. Jin, 2015, 2018; Xue & Churchill, 2019). How learners respond to and perceive feedback from native speakers on SNSLLs in informal learning contexts, however, has been discussed less frequently. It has been noted that the volitional nature and informality of out-ofclassroom learning may induce different perceptions of and reactions to peer feedback compared with that encountered in the classroom (Díez-Bedmar & Pérez-Paredes, 2012). For example, researchers have found that online environments decrease learners’ anxiety levels in interacting with native speakers and thus may allow learners to focus less on language errors (Freiermuth, 2001; Wang, Crooks, & Borst, 2017).

Language learners can access native speakers through SNSs beyond the classroom in the digital wilds (e.g. Jin, 2018; Özdemir, 2017), therefore, particular attention is paid to the self-directed and self-initiated learning contexts in this study to better understand and support L2 learners’ engagement with peer feedback from native speakers.

# An ecological approach to understanding learner engagement with peer feedback

An ecological approach views human development in relation to the surrounding contexts, and regards human experience as involving mutually constitutive relationships between individuals and their environments through which both people and environments are transformed (Bronfenbrenner, 1979,1994; Engeström, 1987). In L2 research, an ecological approach involves taking a holistic view of the interaction between the various factors that shape how learners take action with respect to the learning opportunities around them (van Lier, 2004). The increasing fluidity of learning boundaries, especially boosted by technology, gives rise to new resources, actions, relationships and contexts and new forms of learning that demand a theoretical transformation of ecological perspective to examine learning in this multidimensional, polyhedral, and complex digital wild (González-Sanmamed et al., 2019; Sangrà, Raffaghelli, & Veletsianos, 2019). Education researchers introduce the concept of learning ecology that highlights learning as creation of new spaces that transcend time and space, bridging different learning settings such as formal, non-formal and informal learning contexts in personal life course and timeline (Barron, 2006; González-Sanmamed et  al., 2019; Sangrà et  al., 2019). Focusing on learning in the informal lifelong learning contexts, Goodyear (2021) argued that learning events are ‘triply situated: physically (digitally and materially), socially and epistemically’ (p. 1597), and learners take agency to dynamically (re)configure these elements to create one’s epistemic environments. Technology are epistemic devices that are ‘constitutively entangled in “meshworks” of activity’ (p. 1601). Similarly, González-Sanmamed et  al. (2019) also argues that technological resources, as one of the components in the learning ecologies, are closely related and interwoven with other components in learning dispositions (i.e. learning conceptions, motivations, and expectations) and learning processes (i.e. relationships, actions, and context).

In the learning process, the learner’s agency is critical to their perception of and acting upon potential learning opportunities (van Lier, 2004). Therefore, only when the learning opportunities embedded in feedback are perceived and acted upon by language learners can the learning potential of feedback be realised (Han, 2017; Han & Hyland, 2015). This perspective underscores the importance of understanding learners’ agentic role in engaging with feedback. This echoes a learning-centred framework for understanding feedback literacy in which the learner’s role in processing feedback is conceptualised as more than simply that of an information receiver (Molloy et  al., 2020).

‘Learner agency’ refers to ‘the socioculturally mediated capacity to act’ (Ahearn, 2001, p. 112). To examine learner agency in feedback processing, its situated nature should be noted. An ecological view of learner agency in feedback processing suggests that the dynamic interaction between individual and contextual factors shapes learners’ willingness and capacity to engage with feedback and influences how they make use of the feedback to support their language learning (Bitchener & Storch, 2016; Ellis, 2010; Han, 2019). From an ecological perspective, the changing relationships between individual and contextual factors over time influence learner agency in processing peer feedback and thus may lead to changes in learners’ engagement with feedback (Chong, 2021).

For instance, in a recent study, Han (2019) adopted an ecological perspective to analyse two ESL learners’ engagement with teachers’ corrective feedback on their writing, examining the alignment and/or misalignment between the participants’ willingness and capacity to engage in the learning opportunities embedded in the feedback. The results suggested that a set of individual factors influenced the participants’ engagement with the feedback. Specifically, language abilities, metalinguistic knowledge and prior knowledge of feedback influenced the participants’ capacity to act on the feedback, whereas the learners’ beliefs and motivation influenced their willingness to act on the feedback.

Furthermore, the individual factors that shaped the participants’ agency were mediated by four dimensions of contextual factors: textual (i.e. the characteristics of language errors and feedback), interpersonal and interactional (i.e. the interpersonal relationship between teacher and student and the availability and focus of Q&A with the teacher after class), instructional (i.e. the curriculum and instruction and the students’ access to online resources) and sociocultural (i.e. socioculturally shaped views of the role of teachers and students and of learning strategies). Han (2019) concluded that learners’ engagement with feedback is multi-faceted and dynamic.

Thus, the ecological perspective conceptualises learners’ engagement with peer feedback as potentially changing over time and as being situated at the nexus of the relationships between the various individual and contextual factors and their changes over time. Studies have provided evidence of the relational aspect of learner engagement with peer feedback in the instructional context. Self-directed learning beyond the classroom presents an alternative and increasingly important context in second language learning (Reinders & Benson, 2017). An exploration of informal online learning experiences may provide implications for instructors. As Lehtonen (2017, p. 57) commented, ‘the classroom should somehow imitate learning in informal ways’. Therefore, the current study paid particular attention to the self-directed learning context beyond the classroom when examining learners’ feedback engagement.

Informed by an ecological perspective, this study adopted a learner-centred view to examine the dynamic and relational nature of learner engagement with peer feedback on an educational SNS, Lang-8. Longitudinal data from a group of L2 learners on the platform over a substantial period of time and narrative interview data were collected to shed light on how L2 learners perceive and act on the learning opportunities embedded in feedback from native-speaking peers on this platform.

# Method

# Participants

Eleven existing and active Lang-8 users were recruited for an examination of their longitudinal learning trajectories on the platform in terms of 1) their engagement with written feedback from native speakers on the site and 2) the individual and contextual factors that influenced their engagement with feedback. Given the research focus on the dynamic and relational nature of learner engagement with peer feedback, sustained users of the platform were targeted. Two recruitment criteria were used. First, the target participants were required to be existing users of Lang-8. Second, they were required to be active users who appeared on the Lang-8 platform leader board as top contributors of blog entries and comments on the platform. These two recruitment criteria were applied with the goals of collecting rich data on self-initiated and self-directed online learning over time and shedding light on their dynamic experience of engaging with peer feedback. By focusing on participants who persevered in using the platform’s system, the study sought to shed light on the most important factors contributing to sustained engagement on educational SNSs, which has been reported to be a major challenge in the realisation of the educational potential of instructional SNSs (Lin et  al., 2016).

Invitation messages, which included the purpose and an outline of the study’s procedure, were sent to 84 potential participants who appeared on the site’s leader board. Ultimately, 11 candidates volunteered to participate in this study. Table 1 presents the profiles of the participants.

# Lang-8

L2 learners’ engagement with peer feedback on an educational SNS, Lang-8 (www.Lang-8.com), was examined. Lang-8 allows users to post their L2 writing on their dedicated blog spaces, and their posts are reviewed by native speakers of the target language who are also users of the platform. As shown in Figure 1, after the writing (article) is posted, sentences in the article are automatically recognised sentence by sentence in the discussion forum for each blog post. Text formatting functions similar to those available in word processing programmes (e.g. bold, italic, underline, strikethrough and colour) are available in the discussion forum for native speakers to revise sentences. Users are also able to add explanations or comments to their corrective feedback (see Figure 1). Although the users on the site are not necessarily well-trained L2 teachers, studies have reported that learners perceive the feedback received as useful in most cases (e.g. Cho, 2015; Parrish, 2019). The integration of Lang-8 into writing instructions has been found to improve writing motivation and quality, and lessen learners’ writing anxiety (Lin, 2015, 2019; Pollard, 2015). The platform appeals to language learners/native speakers from over 190 countries and enables them to learn over 90 languages.1

# Data collection

A dual data collection process was used. First, the platform’s archived data on the interactions between the participants and native speakers were collected. Textual data were collected, starting from the day the participants signed up for the platform. In total, 25,189 peer feedback posts and 11,573 feedback responses were collected (see Table 2).

After the platform’s archived data had been collected, a narrative interview was conducted with each participant. The interview required the learners to provide narratives of their learning histories since starting to use the platform. A narrative interview is a person’s account of their long-term experiences (Syed & Nelson, 2015), in this case covering a range of timescales to allow depictions of the learners’ learning trajectories (Chik, 2011). The interviews delved into not only the participants’ learning experiences on the platform but also the learning settings they had experienced beyond the platform in various periods. The participants were asked to identify key factors that may have induce changes in their engagement with peer feedback (i.e. their motivations, learning beliefs, and interaction with peers). By combining the learners’ narratives as gleaned from the interviews with their behavioural data, the study aimed to obtain a richer picture of their engagement with feedback on the platform as well as the factors influencing their engagement from an ecological perspective (Barkhuizen, Benson, & Chik, 2014; Lee, 2006; Shenton, 2004).

Interviews were conducted in either the participant’s native language or the language the participant preferred to use2 via a communication platform (WeChat, Line or Skype). Each interview lasted approximately 1.5 hours and was recorded. One participant (P2) was interviewed twice, first when he was about to finish his studies as an exchange student in China and once more after he had returned to his hometown in the United States. Numerous follow-up conversations were conducted with all of the participants via online messaging for clarification and supplementary explanations. The interviews were transcribed verbatim.

# Data analysis

The current study operationalised behavioural engagement as learners’ actions upon feedback (involving whether and how to respond to feedback) (Ellis, 2010), affective engagement as the emotional reactions and attitudinal responses (involving willingness to respond to the feedback and the emotions displayed upon receiving peer feedback) (Fan & Xu, 2020; Han & Hyland, 2015; Koltovskaia, 2020) and cognitive engagement as mental effort in processing peer feedback (involving the level of noticing the feedback as well as cognitive and meta-cognitive operations) (Han & Hyland, 2015; Yu et  al., 2019). Behavioural engagement relates to actual behavioural interaction with feedback, whereas affective and cognitive engagement relates to intentions, feelings and thinking (Ellis, 2010). Willingness to engage, which was conceptualised as ‘readiness-to-engage’ by Handley and colleagues (2011), does not necessarily lead to action (Handley, Price, & Millar, 2011). Therefore, information on affective and cognitive engagement was mainly derived from the interview data. Textual extracts written by the participants were mainly analysed to document actual behavioural engagement. However, because these three elements are interconnected (Fan & Xu, 2020), the participants’ behavioural data and their self-reported interview data were triangulated for the presentation of the findings to enhance the trustworthiness of the study (Creswell & Poth, 2016).

A thematic analysis of the interview data was performed, aimed at developing a story through emerging salient themes (Neuendorf, 2018). The study adapted and revised the coding scheme from Fan and Xu (2020). The participants’ affective engagement with feedback was elicited regarding (1) the emotions displayed upon receiving peer feedback (e.g. ‘I feel encouraged’ or ‘I do not feel comfortable’) and (2) their willingness to respond to the feedback (e.g., ‘I am not interested in discussing things like that on this learning platform’). Cognitive engagement was elicited regarding (1) noticing peer feedback (e.g. ‘I focused more on corrective feedback rather than those comments on my topics’), (2) cognitive operations in processing feedback (e.g. ‘asking for further explanation’, ‘looking up the words in online dictionaries’) and (3) meta-cognitive operations involving monitoring and regulating their language learning when processing feedback (e.g. ‘using the feedback to find learning materials’, ‘I’d like to chat with the native speakers through Skype rather than on [the] Lang-8 discussion forum’). Fan and Xu (2020) operationalised behavioural engagement as revision strategies in their coding scheme. However, the current study identified few self-revisions following feedback, which may be due to the self-directed learning context. Thus, in line with Ellis (2010), the study operationalised behavioural engagement as (1) whether the learners responded to feedback (e.g. ‘I didn’t discuss my personal life with online users’) and (2) in what way learners responded to feedback (e.g. ‘I reply to their comments, sometimes maybe typing a smiling face’, ‘I only discuss errors with online peers’).

To analyse written exchanges between the learners and native speakers, a content analysis, which is a systematic coding and categorizing approach aimed at revealing the trends, patterns, and discourses of communication from large amounts of textual data (Vaismoradi, Turunen, & Bondas,

2013), was performed. Qualitatively, feedback from the native speakers was categorised as shown in Table 3. Drawing on the categories of feedback on SNSs used in previous studies (e.g. Díez-Bedmar & Pérez-Paredes, 2012; Lee, 2010; Liang, 2010), the written exchanges between the participants and native speakers were coded into the following categories: 1) language form correction, 2) discussion around ideas and organisation and 3) social talk and affective support. According to an exploratory study on interaction patterns on Lang-8 (Lyu & Lai, 2020) determined that these codes can be roughly categorised into an instruction-related dimension and a socially related dimension.

In addition to the categorising the various types of feedback, the relative percentages of the types of responses to peer feedback (i.e. the number of a given type of peer feedback comments responded to/the total number of peer feedback comments received) were assessed to understand patterns and trends.

To address the second research question, a thematic analysis of the interview responses was conducted to determine the influencing factors and the interactions between them over time. The interviews were analysed inductively and deductively through a cyclical and evolving process (Saldaña, 2021). In-vivo codes were used in the inductive phase (e.g. ‘I am not familiar with the online strangers’ and ‘language should be accurate’). The in-vivo codes were then compared across cases and categorised into sub-categories through a deductive coding process (e.g. ‘learning beliefs about errors’ and ‘community belonging’) and into categories (i.e. individual factors and contextual factors) in reference to the framework adopted by Chong (2021) and Han (2019). Table 4 lists the factors identified in this study.

The qualitative data were coded independently by two researchers. The inter-coder reliability was 0.892 (kappa $= \ 0 . 8 9 2$ ; $\mathrm { ~ p ~ } < \mathrm { ~ . 0 0 1 } )$ . The participants’ self-reported data were also summarised and discussed with them as a form of member checking (Zacharias, 2016). The participants confirmed that the summaries were accurate descriptions of their experiences.

# Findings

# Learners’ engagement with peer feedback over time

# Affective engagement

Affective engagement with feedback involves the emotions displayed upon receiving peer feedback and willingness to respond to the feedback (Fan & Xu, 2020; Tian & Zhou, 2020; Zhang & Hyland, 2018). The interview data revealed that the participants displayed increasingly positive emotions and willingness to engage with native speakers’ feedback over time.

For example, one of the participants was an adult learner in Korea who had been learning Chinese on the platform for approximately nine years. She shared how she had been initially hesitant about interacting with native speakers online during the early period of her participation on the site but became more comfortable as she accumulated experience with peer feedback on the platform:

Actually, I hesitated to reply to the comments from the native speakers, especially to those asking about my personal information, such as my hobbies, my jobs, where I live and so on. We don’t know each other. But I found they were not bad people, and [then] I felt it was ok to interact with them now. (Extract 1, P5)

Similarly, when recounting their early interactions on the platform, the participants frequently used phrases such as ‘hesitated’, ‘surprised’, ‘embarrassed’ and ‘not used to [receiving so many comments from native speakers]’ to describe their emotional attitudes towards receiving peer feedback.

In contrast, when describing their emotions towards peer feedback in later stages, the participants used phrases such as ‘joyful’ and ‘enjoy’. The changing emotions could also be elicited from the way the participants expressed thanks in their responses to feedback. For example, P10, a Chinese learner of English in Australia, expressed his gratitude using the words ‘thank you’ in his first blog discussion forum (06:58, 8 Jul. 2014). In contrast, in his last blog entry (08:21, 19 Jan. 2020), he used ‘thank you buddy\~’, which illustrates a shift towards more positive emotions and a sense of intimate affiliation when engaging with native speakers over time.

Furthermore, the participants reported their increased willingness to engage with feedback on the platform and interest in doing so with phrases such as ‘would love to [respond to native speakers]’ and ‘willing to [give responses]’ in the interviews (the triangulated evidence of their increasing number of responses is shown in Appendix A):

I did not get used to receiving such [a number] of comments from native speakers. I was surprised. I just looked through it. […A]fter one month, I was gradually not being surprised and tended to reply to them (native speakers). (Extract 2, P4)

In summary, the participants displayed an increasing willingness to reply to the comments and an increase in positive emotions related to doing so, over time.

# Behavioural engagement

‘Behavioural engagement with feedback’ refers to whether and how learners respond to feedback (Ellis, 2010). An examination of the participants’ affective engagement found increasing willingness to engage with peer feedback, which was also triangulated in the behavioural data. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of the learners’ responses showed a general trend towards greater engagement with peer feedback over time. As shown in Table 5, the response rate increased from $4 0 . 1 4 \%$ in the first year to $5 4 . 1 5 \%$ in the last year of participation on the learning platform. This increasing pattern was consistent across the participants. (Detailed information on all of the participants over the years is provided in Appendix A.)

In the interview data, the participants also explained how they tended to respond to the comments received:

I try to respond to every native speaker who gave their comments to me now. (Extract 3, P6)

Table 5. P roportions of learners’ responses and non-responses to peer feedback.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Period</td><td> Non-responses</td><td>Responses</td></tr><tr><td>First year</td><td>59.86%</td><td>40.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Last year</td><td>45.85%</td><td>54.15%</td></tr></table></body></html>

I find I did not interact with the native speakers at beginning, but definitely I respond to them now. (Extract 4, P7)

Moreover, two behavioural patterns emerged when analysing the participants’ actions upon instruction-oriented and socialization-oriented feedback. As shown in Table 6, the participants in Group 1 (learning-oriented) continued to engage primarily with instruction-related peer feedback (accounting for approximately $8 5 \%$ of their responses) over time. In contrast, the participants in Group 2 (socialization-oriented) tended to dedicate a greater proportion of their responses to socially related peer feedback (an increase from $2 4 . 4 2 \%$ to $5 5 . 6 4 \%$ and a smaller proportion to instruction-related peer feedback (a decrease from $7 5 . 5 8 \%$ to $4 4 . 3 6 \%$ ) over time. These contrasting patterns were also consistent across the individual participants (detailed information on all of the participants over the years is provided in Appendix B).

For example, one of the participants (P7) in Group 2 reported increasing engagement with socially related feedback from native speakers over her three years using the platform. In December 2015 (two months into her use of the platform), she posted a diary sharing some dishes she had eaten in a restaurant. One native speaker corrected the name she gave to a dish (‘beef stir-fried’, which was corrected to ‘stir-fried beef with onion’) and then asked for detailed information about the dish (‘which part of the beef?’). However, while she followed up on the language-corrective feedback, she ignored the content-based feedback, which reduced the opportunity to engage in further authentic communication with the native speaker about food (see Table 7 for details on this interaction).

However, as time went by, P7 showed more engagement with socially related feedback than with instruction-related feedback. For example, during an interaction in 2017 (3 years into using the platform), one native speaker gave both instruction-related feedback (explaining the structure of ‘plan to do’ in Japanese) and socially related feedback (sharing what he did for the Mid-Autumn Festival). P7 responded to the socially related feedback from the native speaker (see Table 8).

During an interaction in 2018 (see Table 9), this participant even took the initiative, turning instruction-related feedback into an opportunity for social interaction. In this example, the online peer corrected a mistake in P7’s blog post. P7 expressed her appreciation and her wish to engage further with this peer in the future. Notably, P7 also used an emoji $( \bullet _ { \mathbf { \alpha } } \mathbf { \otimes } ) )$ to show her friendliness. When asked about that interaction during the interview, she noted that she wanted to express her ‘wish of becoming friends with [the online peer] and enhancing bonding between each other by sending the emoji’. This also provides evidence of her increasingly positive emotions regarding affective engagement.

In summary, two types of learner profiles regarding behavioural engagement with feedback emerged over time (see Table 6). The participants in Group 1 continued to engage with instruction-related peer feedback over time, whereas the participants in Group 2 shifted their engagement away from instruction-related peer feedback to focus on socially related peer feedback over time.

a This explanation is not correct; however, the native speaker self-corrected in later conversation.

# Cognitive engagement

Cognitive engagement with feedback refers to how learners attend to the feedback they receive (Ellis, 2010), specifically the noticing of feedback as well as cognitive and metacognitive operations (Fan & Xu, 2020; Han & Hyland, 2015; Zheng & Yu, 2018). The participants who showed different levels of behavioural engagement with instruction-oriented and socialization-oriented feedback also displayed different profiles of cognitive engagement.

All of the participants recalled primarily paying attention to instruction-related peer feedback, such as corrective feedback on their language errors and language learning suggestions, when they started using the platform. For example, one participant stated:

My focus was on language learning, I paid more attention to corrections of my errors. (Extract 5, P10)

They reported a high level of cognitive operations when processing instruction-related peer feedback, such as ‘asking for further explanation in the follow-up discussion with native speakers’ $\mathbf { \Psi } ( \mathbf { n } = 1 1 ) ,$ ), ‘checking whether the corrections were consistent with what [the participants] wanted to convey’ $\left( \mathrm { n } = 1 1 \right)$ ), and ‘seeking for detailed explanations online’ $\left( \mathtt { n } = 8 \right)$ . The textual data from the platform triangulates the interview data. For example, Table 10 shows how P10 addressed a correction he did not understand. His cognitive operations included ‘asking for further explanation’ and ‘looking up in a dictionary’. He stated in the interview that ‘corrective feedback did improve [his] language accuracy, but the most important thing is understanding the grammatical rules through the conversations with native speakers’.

They also reported a certain degree of meta-cognitive operations in terms of monitoring and regulating their language learning when processing instruction-oriented feedback. For instance, three participants suggested that they had taken notes while reading the corrections, and one of them had even printed all the corrections out as a reference source:

Table 10. An example a participant’s cognitive operation.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Date and time</td><td>Interaction between P10 and native speaker</td><td>Annotation</td></tr><tr><td>8 Jul. 2014 07:37</td><td>NS: I had to help her because we had established a relationship based on trust. and she was not only my neighbor but also my friend..</td><td>NS corrected P10. The words in. red and with strikethrough were native speaker&#x27;s. amendments.</td></tr><tr><td>8 Jul. 2014 13:53</td><td>P10: I check the dict and found the phrase &quot;trusted relationship&quot;, why can&#x27;t I use it here or some other reasons? thanks.</td><td>P10&#x27;s cognitive operations, such as &#x27;looking up in a dictionary and &#x27;asking for further. explanation.</td></tr></table></body></html>

I [focused almost] all my attention on the corrections I received. I even printed all the corrections out, like when I wrote my first 10 or 20 entries. I was thinking, well, now I have something to refer to next time [I write entries]. (Extract 6, P3)

They further reported limited levels of cognitive and mete-cognitive operations when receiving social-related peer feedback:

I asked for further explanations when I didn’t understand the corrections made by the native speakers, but when they started a conversation, like their opinions on Trump’s talk, I was just not interested. (Extract 7, P6)

Thus, the participants showed a higher level of cognitive engagement with instruction-related feedback at the early stage of platform use.

However, over time, six of the participants (Group 2), reported their shifting cognitive engagement with socially related peer feedback, reflected in the levels of their noticing and meta-cognitive operations they displayed when processing socially related peer feedback. For example, one participant (P8) started using Lang-8 when she was an undergraduate student majoring in Japanese. At that time, she used the platform to practise the language she had learnt in class and ‘just looked at the corrections on language’ in peer feedback. However, over time, she tried to connect with native speakers online through socially related discussions. She commented, ‘I find I pay much more attention to the content when I am discussing [things] with native speakers now’.

Participants in Group 2 further reported using socially related feedback to regulate their learning after they realised its value. One participant, for instance, explained that thanks to the content-based conversations, ‘peers online know what I am interested in, such as the songs [and] movies, so I can find the learning resources in their comments’. Another participant suggested that while content-based comments may not directly improve language accuracy, they do enhance cross-cultural awareness:

I didn’t like to chat with them [online native speakers]. It’s weird; I don’t know them. […] But now, I sometimes look forward to comments from them. I want to know their opinions [about the topics I posted]. It is actually interesting to know the different views from people with different cultural backgrounds and discuss [them] with them. (Extract 8, P5)

Thus, the participants’ cognitive engagement with the peer feedback on the platform also showed divergent developmental trajectories over time that were consistent with their behavioural engagement.

In summary, analyses of the behavioural data and the interview responses reveal that the participants showed a gradual increase in their willingness to engage with peer feedback. Two behavioural patterns were detected, showing different changes in the trajectories of the participants’ cognitive engagement with feedback over time.

# Factors shaping L2 learners’ engagement with peer feedback

Five key factors shaping the learners’ engagement with peer feedback emerged from the interview data, as shown in Table 11. In general, the individual participants’ perceptions of the platform and the nature of the peer feedback they received there were frequently cited as factors that shaped their engagement with peer feedback. Quite a few of the participants reported a sense of belonging to the online community and the technological affordances and constraints of the platform as influencing factors. Approximately half of the participants also mentioned that their engagement with peer feedback was influenced by their learning beliefs with respect to errors.

The interview responses further revealed that the nature of these individual and contextual factors morphed over time and the factors interacted with each other to influence the learners’ engagement with peer feedback, as shown in Table 12. All of the 11 participants reported that how they positioned the platform in relation to their language learning shaped their perceptions of the affordances of the platform, which subsequently influenced their engagement with peer feedback. Some of the participants also reported that socially related feedback enhanced their sense of belonging to this online community $\left( \mathtt { n } = 5 \right)$ and shifted their learning beliefs with respect to errors $\left( \mathtt { n } = 5 \right)$ , which boosted their engagement with peer feedback.

# Socially related feedback and sense of community

The availability of socially related feedback and the concomitant sense of community were found to shape the learners’ willingness to engage with peer feedback. The participants reported that socially related peer feedback helped ease their anxiety about interacting with native speakers on the platform and enhanced their sense of belonging to a community, which resulted in an increase in the number of their responses to native speakers over time:

Actually, after I began to feel a sense of community because of the positive feedback they gave me and discussions on the topics I was interested in, I want[ed] to build up the connection with them. (Extract 9, P1)

I gradually identified a group of users who regularly read and commented on my posts. They also shared their life with me on the discussion forum. […] I’ve never seen them face-to-face, but they ‘talked’ with me like my friends. Now I regard them as peers rather than teachers or students. (Extract 10, P7)

These extracts suggest that access to socially related peer feedback from native speakers made the participants reconsider their relations with them. The positive socially-oriented feedback received on the platform allowed the participants to develop a stronger sense of personal affiliation with the native speakers, whom they began to regard as ‘learning peers’ or ‘friends’, and to bond with them on the platform. This resulted in an increased willingness to respond to feedback received from them.

The interview data were triangulated with the learners’ behavioural data. Figure 2 shows that the ratio of the participants’ responses to comments changed in parallel to the amount of socially related feedback they received from native speakers. This suggests that the more socially related feedback the participants received from native speakers, the more likely they were to increase their responses to feedback.

# Perceptions of the platform and its technological affordances

The interview and behavioural data further suggested that the perceived functions of the platform and its technological affordances interacted to shape the learners’ differentiated engagement with different types of feedback.

Participants who held relatively narrow perceptions of the platform’s affordances (e.g. perceiving the platform as just a language learning platform) tended to attend to and respond to only instruction-related feedback. For example, one participant (P6), a learner who maintained his engagement mainly with instruction-related feedback over time, mainly perceived Lang-8 as a ‘help-seeking’ platform:

![](img/16b95c1a9819ef9ba4068ccdc13c1ee06be203db801a28066e5e4aaec0b7a80c.jpg)  
Figure 2. P roportion of the participants’ responses to total comments received and the socially related comments received to total comments received from native speakers.

For me, Lang-8 is a help-seeking platform. If I had any questions in my Japanese learning, for example, phrases I didn’t understand when I read Japanese comics or lines I missed in some instructional YouTube videos, I posted those questions online and sought help from the native speakers. Lang-8 is a platform where I discuss linguistic questions with native speakers. I don’t regard it as a discussion forum for comics fans. (Extract 11, P6)

Accordingly, he mainly attended to native speakers’ comments on his linguistic questions rather than those on the content of the Japanese comics or YouTube videos that he shared.

In contrast, the participants who perceived the platform as both a language learning platform and a social networking platform tended to engage with various types of feedback. For example, P1 used phrases such as ‘writing practice site’, ‘self-expression and emotional regulation platform’, ‘social networking site to meet native speakers’ and ‘proofreading site to support authentic language use’ to describe his perceptions of Lang-8 at different stages of his use of the platform. He was an adult learner who had been learning Chinese for over 10 years. He started to use Lang-8 after he had stopped studying at a Chinese language school. He explained, ‘I would like to continue my Chinese learning for free. Lang-8 attracted me because the native speakers could revise my writings, my grammar and vocabulary mistakes. At that time, Lang-8 was a platform for writing practice’. Accordingly, he focused on the corrections he received from native speakers; as he reported, ‘I focused on the errors I made’. However, over time, he broadened his perception of the platform, viewing it more as a means of meeting native speakers of Chinese, because he ‘had never studied in China and wanted to get to know some Chinese people to chat with’. Accordingly, his responses to socially oriented feedback from native speakers increased over time.

The contrasting case analyses of P1 and P6 suggests that the participants’ perceptions of the function of the platform shaped their differentiated engagement with different types of feedback.

The participants’ perceived functions of the platform also shaped how they interpreted and acted with respect to its affordances, which further influenced their engagement with the feedback they received from native speakers online. Although the participants all felt that due to its ‘asynchronous nature’, the technological features of the platform did not lend themselves to socialisation, participants who held a more diversified position on the platform’s functions, such as P1, could still perceive its affordances for socialisation.

I once posted my travelling experiences in Hubei Province, and a Chinese lady commented on my article, saying she is from where I had been to. She also gave me her WeChat account in her comment, so I friended her. Communication on WeChat is different from that on Lang-8, the dialogue and the relationship between us were close and the words were more intimate. But because she already knew some information about me from my Lang-8 postings, such as my hobbies [and] my travelling experiences, we had a lot of topics to talk about on WeChat. After I realised the benefits of Lang-8 regarding deepening interaction with the native speakers, I became more willing to get involved in meaningful communication with them on the platform. Lang-8 paved the way for closer relations. (Extract 12, P1)

Therefore, despite perceiving other communication tools as being more suitable for instant and in-depth communication, P1 was still able to perceive and exploit the opportunities Lang-8 provided for in-depth interaction. Accordingly, he was more willing to respond to socially related feedback as a means of socialising with native speakers on the platform. In contrast, P6 did not recognise the potential of the platform for socialisation: ‘I could use other tools to talk with native speakers; Line, Facebook, these are better tools for chatting’. It can be concluded that the participants’ perceptions of the platform influenced how they perceived its affordances, which further shaped their selective engagement with the feedback they received from native speakers (see Appendix B for detailed statistic data of the comparison between P1 and P6).

In summary, the perceived functions of the platform directly and indirectly influenced the participants’ selective engagement with different types of peer feedback via the platform’s perceived technological affordances.

# Socially related feedback and learning beliefs about errors

The participants’ learning beliefs about language errors were found to shape their engagement with different types of feedback. The participants who valued accuracy in language use seemed to engage more with instruction-related feedback. For example, two participants (P3 and P7) reported that when they first used the platform, they were very cautious when posting online and felt embarrassed when making language errors because they believed that they should try to ‘avoid mistakes’. They tried to use ‘perfect language’ and therefore paid a lot of attention to instruction-related feedback during their first year on the platform. Accordingly, they focused more on and responded more to instruction-related feedback.

However, their language learning beliefs shifted over time in response to the socially related feedback they received on the platform. Receiving socially related feedback on the platform made some of the participants let go of their original belief in the importance of accuracy in language use and begin to regard errors as learning opportunities. Having observed that the native speakers on Lang-8 neither criticised nor laughed at the participants’ language errors, they gradually began to accept their ‘imperfect language’. For instance, P7 recounted in her interview, ‘On Lang-8, it is totally fine if I make mistakes. The native speakers did not laugh at me; they just encouraged me. So now I give more focus to the content rather than language form when interacting with them’. Both P3 and P7 shifted from the belief that they should ‘avoid mistakes’ towards the belief that they can ‘learn from mistakes’. As a result, they tended to show increased engagement with socially related feedback on the platform over the years (see Appendix B for detailed statistic data).

Thus, socially related feedback may have induced ongoing changes in the participants’ learning beliefs about language errors, resulting in changes in their cognitive and behavioural engagement with peer feedback.

# Discussion

Adopting an ecological perspective, this study examined language learners’ self-initiated and self-directed engagement with the peer feedback they received on a writing-based SNSLL over time. In line with the previous studies (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012; Haythornthwaite et  al., 2018), the SNSLL in the study showed its potentials in personalised learning in the informal learning context. The findings further provide insights into how language learners’ engagement with peer feedback changes over time, a longitudinal view that has rarely been adopted in research on peer feedback in L2 writing. The findings also highlight the determining roles that learners play in shaping the efficacy of peer feedback. They show that learners perceive and appropriate peer feedback differently depending on their changing personal language learning experience.

The longitudinal data reveal that the educational potential of peer feedback should not be taken for granted; rather, it is subject to the agentic interpretations and actions of learners. This result, first and foremost, argues for a learner-centric view in examining learners’ engagement with peer feedback, as only when language learners perceive and act upon the learning opportunities embedded in the feedback they receive from native speakers can they realise the potential of peer feedback for writing development (Han, 2017; Han & Hyland, 2015). Thus, merely facilitating peer feedback and providing opportunities for interaction with native speakers are not sufficient; additional efforts are required to support L2 learners’ willingness and capacity to attend to and respond to the various types of feedback they receive from native speakers.

The findings further show how a set of contextual and individual factors interact to shape learners’ engagement with feedback over time. The finding that these factors’ influences are intertwined suggests the need for a dynamic and holistic approach to understanding the influence of various individual and contextual factors in shaping L2 learners’ engagement with peer feedback, as indicated in Figure 3.

Some of the factors identified in this study are consistent with previous findings, such as the positive association between a sense of belonging and learning engagement, the perceived academic, social and emotional support provided by peer learners (Agosto, Copeland, & Zach, 2013; Berry, 2017); and the relationship between accuracy-driven learning beliefs and students’ attention and responses to instruction-related feedback (García-Gómez & Garc, 2020; Han & Hyland, 2015; Yu & Hu, 2017).

This study also revealed certain factors and their interactions that are unique to informal online learning spaces. One such factor is the importance of socially related feedback. The study found that socially related feedback greatly enhanced the participants’ sense of community belonging. Studies have suggested that interpersonal relationships between students and/or between students and teachers may influence feedback engagement (Chong, 2021; Han, 2019; Xu & Carless, 2017). In the classroom context, a sense of community may be built up through collaborative learning activities (Shea, Li, & Pickett, 2006). The findings of this study suggest that in a self-initiated learning context beyond the classroom, community belonging in SNSLLs can be induced through socially related feedback, such as learners’ commenting and sharing their own points of view on their topics of interest, and eventually boosts engagement with peer feedback.

Socially related feedback also induced changes in the learners’ learning beliefs about language errors from a desire to ‘avoid mistakes’ to a readiness to ‘learn from mistakes’, which in turn changed their focus when engaging with peer feedback. A shift away from accuracy-driven learning beliefs is significant, as a decreased concern about language accuracy in communication facilitates more meaningful and authentic interactions with native speakers through communication technologies (García-Gómez & Garc, 2020; Lai, Hu, & Lyu, 2018; Trinder, 2016). The fact that this study identified the critical role of socially related feedback, in contrast with previous studies, may be related to the unique learning context studied and the duration of the study. While most studies (e.g. Hyland & Hyland, 2006; Liang, 2010; Ma, 2020) have been conducted in the classroom learning context, where peer discourse around language errors is highly valued for improving writing performance, this study was conducted in a self-initiated, informal learning context, where diversified interactions on topics of personal interest are key to sustaining learners’ engagement. Furthermore, studies on learner engagement with peer feedback have primarily been conducted over short periods. As such, they have failed to shed light on the long-term effects of socially related feedback. The observation of the critical role of socially related feedback in this study may result from the study’s longitudinal approach.

![](img/8937ae673fa61a30e75c8bc4a2448c9a7fcd463467c9cde3d291f8b5f2ef64c1.jpg)  
Figure 3. I nteraction between individual factors and contextual factors in shaping learners’ engagement with feedback from native speakers online.

Given the importance of socially related feedback, mechanisms must be devised to encourage and support such peer feedback on educational SNSs to foster an attitude of openness towards language errors among learners. Certain design features are needed in SNSs to boost learner engagement with peer feedback. For instance, designers could prompt users to comment on the content of posts in addition to giving language feedback. Awards, such as special badges and extra points on leader boards, could be distributed based on the nature of the interaction between users. Reports on learners’ engagement with different types of feedback could also be provided to promote their self-reflection and self-regulation. To create opportunities for authentic, meaningful and socially driven communication, technological designers could create a variety of learning groups based on shared interests and learning goals or on such profile aspects as age and target language.

Another factor influenced feedback engagement identified in this study is learners’ agentic positioning of the functions of the learning platform. This factor influenced the participant learners’ engagement with peer feedback, both directly and indirectly, via the technological affordances of the platform that they perceived. This finding supports the proposition that learning experiences are open to learner interpretation (Balaman & Sert, 2017; Coughlan & Duff, 1994; Lantolf, Poehner, & Swain, 2018; van Lier, 2004). This study shows that learners may define the same platform differently in relation to their overall language learning experience and needs. Some may regard it solely as a language learning site, while others may regard it as having more diversified functions, such as enabling learners to meet native speakers and to use authentic language. How the participants perceived the platform further shaped their cognitive foci and behavioural engagement with different types of peer feedback. The findings support a learner-centric view – that is, learner-defined technological use based on learner needs and interests – in understanding the language learning potential of educational technologies (Arndt & Woore, 2018; Kukulska-Hulme, 2012; Lai, Hu, & Lyu, 2018; Vanderplank, 2016). Therefore, it is important for the learners to define the technological resources in relation to the learning that is meaningful to them. Goodyear’s (2020) autoethnographic study also showed the importance of learners’ capabilities to configure the suitable learning contexts to them, which may lead to successful life-long learners.

More importantly, the participants’ perceptions of the language learning affordances of the platform varied depending on how they positioned the platform, which further shaped their differential engagement with different types of peer feedback. Therefore, to maximise the potential of educational SNSs and encourage and sustain diversified engagement with such platforms, it may be necessary to guide language learners in their interpretation and positioning of the platform. For instance, users could be encouraged to share and discuss their perceptions of the platform to inspire and expose others to diverse interpretations and differential uses of the platform.

# Conclusion

This study adopted an ecological approach to examine L2 learners’ engagement with feedback from native speakers on an instructional SNS beyond the classroom. The findings reveal that the participant language learners’ affective, cognitive and behavioural engagement with peer feedback was dynamic and that they varied according to the type of peer feedback. The study also identified influential factors and interactions between them that were unique to this learning context. Specifically, the availability of socially related peer feedback and the learners’ perceptions of the functions of the platform were significant factors in shaping learner engagement with peer feedback in this learning context. The findings also highlight the need for these two factors to be taken into account in both platform design and learner preparation.

The findings of this study should be considered in conjunction with certain limitations. First, the scale of the study was limited. The findings were based on only 11 cases. However, a case study may be considered ‘generalizable to theoretical propositions’ (Yin, 2003, p. 10). In the future, large-scale survey studies could be carried out to test the influential factors and interventional studies could be conducted to examine how the manipulation and intervention of the studied variables may enhance learners’ engagement with feedback. Second, the study was based on the self-reports of active users of the studied platform with an average length of five years’ experience using it. This may have biased the research findings, as the individual and contextual factors that shaped these active and persistent L2 users’ engagement on the platform may differ from those of inactive users. Therefore, future studies could include both active and inactive learners to obtain a more comprehensive view. Third, the longitudinal data in this study consisted of narrative interviews and archived behavioural data on the platform. Further studies may collect other data, such as learning journals, over time to track students’ learning trajectories and tap into the factors that might influence their dynamic engagement with peer feedback over time.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this small-scale exploration of L2 learners’ engagement with feedback beyond the classroom provides insights into the dynamic nature of engagement on an educational SNS and into how changing engagement is subject to the influence of a set of intertwined individual and contextual factors. The findings suggest that a dynamic and holistic approach to understanding and supporting learner engagement with peer feedback is needed. Future studies could include explorations of the quality of feedback engagement in a self-directed learning context beyond the classroom as well as the factors influencing such engagement.
