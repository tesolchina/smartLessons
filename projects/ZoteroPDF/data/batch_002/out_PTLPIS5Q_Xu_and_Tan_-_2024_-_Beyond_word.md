# ABSTRACT

Keywords:   
ChatGPT   
L2 writing teachers   
Visualization   
Metaphor

Since its inception, ChatGPT has been characterized by L2 writing teachers with various metaphors, such as a tool and a collaborator. Complemented with text-based metaphorical conceptualizations, this research brief contributes ten visual conceptualizations of ChatGPT in L2 writing pedagogy from L2 writing teachers who teach in US higher education. Four themes emerged from our analysis of these visual conceptualizations: ChatGPT as a (1) tool, (2) resource, (3) threat, and an (4) unknown entity. The visualizations help tease out the intricacies involved in the use of metaphorical representations of ChatGPT and provide a multidimensional picture of L2 writing teachers' perceptions and attitudes towards the use of ChatGPT in L2 writing classrooms. This report concludes with an overview of the potential implications of applying visual metaphorical conceptualizations of ChatGPT to educational settings, such as raising L2 student writers' awareness and fostering the development of their critical digital literacy.

# 1. Introduction

Since its rollout in November 2022, ChatGPT has created quite astir among writing teachers around the world. Amidst the heated debate on how writing teachers should react to students' spontaneous use of ChatGPT, a consensus has emerged: It is necessary to address students uses of ChatGPT instead of ignoring the isue in the classroom (e.g., MLA-ccc Joint Task Force on Writing and AI, 2023).

The question of how to guide students on the use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (Al) tools to facilitate their writing brings the construct of Al literacy to the frefront. A plethora of research on students Il literacy existed before the rollout of hatGPT. For example, Ng et al.s (2021) review study compiles thirty pee-reviewed articles and concludes that Al literacy incorporate  set of skills, including know and understand AI, use and apply I," \*evaluate and create AI," and consider and reflect onAI thcs' (p. 4). In addition, core to critical AI literacy are students being aware of bias and pitflls f large language models (LMs) (MLA-ccc Joint Task Force on Writing and Al, 2023) and being able to communicate and collaborate with AI and use Al as a tool in various settings (Long & Magerko, 2020). Assting students to develop these skill and awarenessivolves the exploration of relevant metaphorical frameworks for ChatGPT conceptualization (Anderson, 2023). For example, Anderson (2023) explores the two common metaphors--the tool and collaborator metaphors--used to frame ChatGPT and points out their limitations:

In particular, the tool metaphor fail to account for ChatGPT's human components-namely its repurposing of thousands of authors' writing and ideas, from which it draws with no transparency on sources. While the collborator metaphor appears to address the nee to cite ideas that are not one's own, ChatT fails to provide the accountability of a human author, even as it includes biased output derived from its training corpus, and while again failing to identify original sources. (p. 1).

Instead, Anderson (2023) invites scholars and teachers to consider the metaphor of body as it provides " framework for assesing the new technologys compatibilit and use in writig clssrooms (p.8). The corporeal metaphor see the AI-generated texs as blood products, stem cell, or donor organs which are taken from thir original contexts and are processed before being reused. The bodily metaphor also intends to shed light on the ethical isues involved in using AI-generated works. Based on her analysis, Anderson (2023) argues that paying attention to metaphorical language might help facilitat students' critical digital litrcy. Likewise, Kubota 2023) frames the rolef ChatG in wring as oo,  paer, and dcor, which reflets her critical peretions of the affordances and limitations of generative AI. As the mentors who guide the students exploration of how to conceptualize ChatGPT in second language (L2) writing classrooms, L2 writing teachers conceptualizations of ChatGPT in teaching and learning are worth investigating. Moreover, L2 writing teachers need to recalibrate their pedagogical practices in the age of ChatGPT by maximizing its potential and mitigating its issues (Barrot, 2023). Examining how L2 writing teachers conceptualize ChatGPT through various metaphorical frameworks can help us asess their perceptions and possibly calibrate those perceptions with insights from the rapidly developing body of research on this topic.

This research brief seeks to complement the current discussion on conceptualizations of ChatGPT in pedagogical contexts by sharing ten L2 writing teachers' visualizations of how they perceive the role of ChatGPT in teaching and learning. Specificall, our research question was: What can the L2 writing teachers visualizations tel us about their perceptions of the role of ChatGPT in learning and teaching? To answer this question, we present visualizations produced by ten L2 writing teachers along with their own explanations obtained through interviews. These visualizations will likely help cast light on producing nuanced metaphorical frameworks for conceptualizing ChatGPT that can be drawn on by L2 writing teachers to facilitate the students' development of AI literacy.

# 2. Method

Collecting visual conceptualizations as a data source has been applied in a few studies in applied linguistics. In comparison to written texts as decrtive rereentations, visualizations are detive rereentations (Schntz, 2001), which deonstrates a strong, direct relationshi between theappearance and configration of the subject matter and how those atribute ae portrayed (Boucheix & Fillisch, 2017, p. 179). Past studies have adopted visualizations as a research tool in investigating law instructors' perceived identities (Kesser, 2021) and computer teachers conceptualizations f"school" and "computer teacher (Saban, 2011). We focused on metaphors implied in the visualizations, as metaphor is more than a name; it incorporates sociocultural meanings and posesses epistemological function (Leary, 1994) and mirrors one's perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs (Koc, 2013).

The visualization data in this study come from a larger projec that investigates L2 writing teachers perceptions of using ChatGPT in teaching L2 writing. An anonymous survey launched on Qualtrics was sent out through email listservs and social mediato groups of L2 writing teachers i higher education. At the end of the survey, an optional question was provided for survey respondents to opt into follow-up interviews. The researcher then contacted the respondents who left their contact information via email and provided a link for them to ign up for a follow-up interview. Thireen survey respondents eventually signed up for follow-up interviews. Three out of those interviewees were interviewer's acquaintances, and the rest of seven did not have prior contact with the researcher. The data presented here were part of the data set collected from one-on-one online interviews with the thirteen L2 writing teachers that happened in June and July 2023. The interviews tapped into L2 writing teachers own experience with ChatGPT, their responses to students' use of ChatGPT, and their perceptions of using ChatGPT in L2 writing classrooms. As the last part of the interview, allin. terviewees were asked the question of Please select three adjectives or phrases to describe your understanding of ChatGPT" and then were prompted to draw their visual conceptualizations via an online drawing too called Kleki (https://klek.com). The prompt they received for drawing was "Please draw/visualize the role of ChatGPT in second language writing pedagogy." The participants then shared the visuals they drew with the interviewer via Zoom chat and explained how the visuals represented their conceptualization of ChatGPT in L2 writing teaching and learning. Ten out f thirteen interviewees successfull completed the task of creating a visual, which our report is based on. Table 1 summarizes the demographic information of the ten interviewees.

The data analysis tok two overall steps. Firstly, we imported the visualizations into a document as image files along with the transcriptions of the participants explanations of their visualizations in the interviews. Following Schmitt (2005), the two reearchers conducted an inductive thematic coding on metaphors independently--that is, what metaphors of the role of ChatGPT in L2 writing pedagogy were allded to in these drawings. During this initial coding process, we drew on the interviewees' verbal explanation to comprehend their drawings. Next, we merged the generated labels of metaphors in independent coding that suggest similar meaning and resolved the disagreements on naming through an in-depth discussion. The eventual generated ten metaphorical labels are: hammer, tol, source of invention, river, alcohol, classroom add-on, monster, ghost house, and chaos. Notably, in this coding proces, we based our identification of metaphors on what is most obviously portrayed visually. Afe that, we refined the preliminary codes and categorized them into four broader concepts, which will be llustrated in the next section. We then independently placed each aforementioned metaphorical label under the appropriate theme category, which returned a high rate of agreement (i., $9 0 \%$ . The disagreement on classoom add-on" was resolved through discussions and was double-checked with the visualization author. Sec ondly, the researchers together categorized the adjectives and phrases that our 2 writing teachers selected based on the connotation. This supplementary data source facilitated our understanding of the L2 writing teachers' general attitude towards ChatGPT.

Our categorizations of the metaphors were triangulated with two types of supplementary data provided by the participants: 1) verbal explanations of the visualization; and 2) the consolidated list of adjectives and phrases. To minimize the possbilit of misinterpretation, \*participant or respondent validation' (Birt et al., 2016, p. 1802), also known as member checks, were conducted by the first author via email to ensure that no strong objections to the categorization of visualizations were raised by the participants.

# 3. Findings and discussion

# 3.1. Categorization of adjectives

In total, 30 adjectives and phrases were generated by our ten interviewees. The categorization of these descriptive adjectives and phrases was based on the connotation to reveal the afective aspects of how L2 writing teachers conceptualize the use of ChatGPT in pedagogical settings. As Table 2 shows, the words and phrases are evenly distributed into positive and negative connotations, suggesting L2 writing teachers' mixed reception of ChatGPT. Despite the fact that our participants unanimously agre that there are promising possbilitis for the use of ChatGT in teaching and learning, they remain cautious about potential isues. For example, one Of the interviewes said, .. it wil take time for us to work out what those [l technologies] are and how we can best incorporate them in the classoom. So, I'm trying to avoid those kinds of negative words. ButI also don't want to sem like I'm glorifying it either." The attitudes encapsulated in the L2 writing teachers selected adjectives and phrases were drawn upon to supplement the inter pretation of their visualizations of the role of ChatGPT in teaching and learning.

# 3.2. Visualizations

Through the metaphor analysis (Schmit, 2005) of visualizations accompanied by the L2 writing teachers' explanations of them four primary metaphorical representations were identified: (1) ChatGPT as a tool (2) ChatGPT as a resource (3) ChatGPT as a threat, and (4) ChatGPT as an unknown entity.

# 3.2.1. Tool

For the metaphor of tool, two of our interviewees provided nuanced conceptualizations. In Alices visualization, ChatGPT was compared to a hammer used by L2 writers to knock down the wall f language barrier (see Fig. 1) For her, ChatGPT can serve as a communication and translation tol that i similar to Google Translate, while being more reliable (Alice interview). As Alice explains: Excerpt 1. It can be something more of aplatform where they can met together, absorb that vocabulary, jargon together and find that, wow this student from Colombia is actually, you know, exactly the same as me....

Fig. 1. Alice's visual conceptualization of ChatGPT in teaching and learning.

Another participant, Norton, who views ChatGPT as an integral part of teaching. For him, students as humans stilloccupy the central position, and ChatGPT provides a more powerful tool than existing technologies that the students used. As he indicated: Excerpt 2. [..] Student, ChatGPT, Grammarly, miscellneous tools, teacher and students are side by side, working together. ChatGPT is a littlebit smaller, but has a big role. Grammarly and others miscellaneous are minor tols that people would use.

The visual conceptualizations of ChatGPT as a tool depicts the afordances of ChatGPT while also highlighting the role of humans, as it i through human interactions (e.g, students & students; students & teachers) that ChatPT as a tol was functioning. This echoes the argument made in Anderson (2023) when she clarified the metaphor f ChatGPT as atool: \*the ChatGPT outputs are imbued with some of the same variability, creativit, and humanity on which the technology was trained' (p. 5). When positioning the role of ChatGPT in L2 writing teaching and learning as a too, L2 writing teachers may highlight the humanity that cannot be stripped from the tool metaphor. As ubot (2023) pointed out in her explanations of AI as tool, hs oo an be usful when mployed to lfil the ultimate goal of teaching and learning writing which remains unchanged" (p. 2). Fig. 2.

# 3.2.2. Resource

Positioning ChatGPT as a resource situates it among numerous other resources within L2 writing clarooms. Under the category of ChatGPT as a resource, four specific metaphors have been identified: ChatGPT as a source of inventio, water alcohol, and a classroom add-on.

To demonstrate ChatGPT as a source of invention, in Fig. 3, John listed ChatGPT on the left as one of many sources of inventions, and he purposefull jammed all the same sources together on the right to indicate that what L2 writers need to do is to synthesize these sources. John's response also underlines the critical role played by students:

Excerpt 3. So the central part is L2 writer. So you think it's not just the writing teacher, but also L2 writer can also internalize an. benefit from all of these provided resources.

The subcategory of ChatGPT as water indicates its perceived ambivalent nature. In Daisy's visual conceptualization (see Fig. 4), ChatGPT is water, be it a lake or river, that breeds hope but also harm. As she illustrates,

Excerpt 4. [.] depending on ow we use it, how students and teachers are using it, this body, a water can either create very positive outcomes, such as vegetables, fruits, animals like fishing. And I meant like this would be in terms of tech.

The third resource metaphor i ChatGPT as alcohol. Cecile described ChatGPT in L2 writing classrooms as alcohol, which may enrich the good tast in cooking or become asource of addiction depending on how it i used. She also clarifies the good practices of making use of this "resource" in teaching, Fig. 5.

Excerpt 5 I think pedagogy is always changing, depending on your needs and the expectations of society, what we nee from our teaching, what do we want our students to learn. o pedagogy should be very inclusive. I dont think it's wis to not allow certain tools or technology to be incorporated into your pedagogy. Thats why it's important to explore different ways to use it. So it enhances and makes our meal more....

The last resource metaphor is ChatGPT as aclassroom add-on (se Fig. 6). Kate believed that all the elements in a regular L2 writing classoi coninto exst, suh as techr, stts diffe rat dissio, and faciittion. ht i jut e add-n that offers an altenative way for teachers to achieve their pedagogical goals. Kates atitude points to the belief that technology does not necessrily lead to revolutionary changes to L2 writing clasrooms but may prompt L2 writing teachers to rethink about the approaches to reaching their goals in teaching.

The metaphorical descriptions of ChatGPT as a resource primarily point to the perceived double-sidednes of using ChatGPT in L2 writing classrooms and emphasize the importance of conscious use of ChatGPT. As Wittgenstein (1953) ilustrates, to perceive something as a particular thing is tosee features that are shared with that particular thing, and such percption willimpact what one actuall see (Anderson, 2023). Here, resource is perceived as more than a simplified descriptive word for envisioning ChatGP but a metaphorical concept that shares conflicting attributes.

# 3.2.3. Threat

Two interviewees (Jack and Lily verbally describe ChatGPT as a potential threat and visually depict the chatbot as evil-loking creatures. However, Jack foregrounded the human agency in controlling the tamed monster, whereas Lily's visualization seems to highlight the concerns she had as an L2 writing teacher. In Jack's visualization (se Fig. 7), ChatGPT is depicted as a monster with a large body and a small head. As he explains,.

Excerpt6. rie to mak t ha lite hd se it hs litte bn, ad its  smart, nd  think its smart, ut its not smart and it's like any tool you can control it and use it and turn it for your purposes.

Additionally, Jack drew a chain around the monster's neck, which according to him stands for the conventions of L2 writing. The human in the visualization represents himself as aL2 writing tacher, whipping at the monster. With this visualization, Jack intends to emphasize that ChatGPT is not as smart as i seems and that user can \*dominate the technology and tur it toward [their] use" (Jack, interview).

Lily, in her drawing, echoes the idea of ChatGPT being a monster (see Fig.8). However, she visualizes the chatbot as a lurking evil that could potentiall lure younger users into the misuse of technologies. The tex accompanying the image reads: \*Trust the machine, children. I'lldo all the thinking for you," which possbly suggests that her major concern with using ChatGPT is the ossof thinking ability.

The metaphor of ChatGPT as a threat shares similar concerns with the \*AI as a dictator' discourse in Kubota (2023), mainly due to writing specialists' perceived role of AI as a competitor to humankind. Though the two interviewees (Jack and Lily) conceptualized ChatGPT as a threat, they adopted different affective beliefs towards this threat. Jack was confident in L2 writing teachers agentive role in harnessing the stupid monster, whereas Lily's visualization indicated that the lurking ghost will entually corrupt students thinking aility desite the 2 writing teachers guidance. The ifferent levels of confidencethey indicated in their aility to resond to the threat posed by ChatGPT seems to be related to their prior experience.In Jack's interview, he disclosed that he had been reading and researching on using technology to reduce students' cognitive load, whereas Lily admitted that she could not pretend to know everything about ChatGPT and that she was sillin the stage of familiarizing herself with it. Another reason that possibly explains the gap in L2 writing teachers responses to the threat relates to their fundamental beliefs about technology. As Anderson (2023) points out, some people see mechanistic features in ChatGPT's productions while others se sentience in ChatGPT-generated texts. According to their interviews, Jack believed that through smart pedagogical design, L2 writing teachers as humans are capable of control tecnology as a tool; contraril, Lily found that she had a philosophical problem with the machine as it was offensive on a personal level.

# 3.2.4. Unknown entity

Two of the interviewees (Emma and Katherine) highlight the fact that ChatGPT has not been thoroughly investgated and thus more research is needed. Emma metaphorizes the chatbot as ablack box that requires scholars, teachers, and educators to"open doors to understand the iner world of this tol and to know more about what it is capable of' (se Fig. 9). The metaphorical way of opening doors symbolizes a way to "envision more creative ways of using this tool for specifi clasrooms and teaching tasks" (Emma, interview).

The image created by Katherine shares similar perspectives, depicting ChatGPT as chaotic and uncertain, which is represented by the red tangled lines at the bottom (se Fig. 10). But Katherine's visualization aso sheds a positie light on the current situation, as she believes that new ideas, represented in colored lines, wil emerge from the chaos. The development of ideas does not follow a linear path and does not see an end point either. Katherine also underscores the uncertain nature with exploration of ChatGPT: \*How this chaos down here is where it's gonna end up eventually. I don't think we know" (Katherine, interview).

The conceptualization of ChatGPT as an unknown entity indicates L2 writing teachers' open mindset when faced with new tech. nologies. Such opennes could be of great value in encouraging students' exploratory behaviors of using ChatGPT. Yan (2023) found that their participants went through three tages, namely, familiarizing themselves with ChatGPT, experimenting its basic usage, and exploring the advanced techniques of ChatGPT by combining it with other software and discussng their uses within learner groups. When guiding students o continuously explore ChatGPT, L2 writing teachers may foster students open attitude during the exploration of ChatGPT as non-linear and potentially endles and rewarding, which is reflected in Katherine's visual representation. Bearing in mind that the zigzag process may require them to constantly revisit their previous perceptions and practices, teachers could co-investiate with the students about the affordances and pitall of using ChatGPT in L2 writing and helpL2 writers refine the configuration of their AI literacy.

Of note, our analysis only indicates the L2 writing teachers most salient perceptions of the role of ChatGPT in L2 writing classrooms for heuristic purposes. In other words, these categorizations of metaphors cannot be interpreted as mutually exclusive or isolated, as some of them share overlapping features. For instance, the traces of ChatGPT as atool may be prevalent throughout allthe metaphors identified.

# 4. Implications and conclusion

Several implications can be drawn from the current report. Firstly, the analysis of the visual representations produced by our participants can be used in pedagogical settings as a starting point for students to evaluate and ponder upon their own perspectives of

Al technology in writing. Drawing on ChatGPT as a tol, a resource, a threat, and an unknown entity, pedagogical activities for fostering students' critical AI literacy may guide L2 writers to reflect on these atributes and how these conceptualizations are frutful or limiting. In addition, focusing on metaphors implied in visual conceptualizations of ChatGPT can also help tease out the intricacies involved in the controversial use of ChatGPT in pedagogical settings. Methodologicall, visual conceptualizations may serve as a tool for researchers to investigate AI technology and teaching..

In sum, this research brief responds to the cal for attention to metaphorical frameworks for conceptualizing ChatGPT proposed in Anderson (2023) by reporting ten L2 writing teachers visual conceptualizations of ChatGPT in L2 writing pedagogy. The brief also offers more nuanced qualitativ insights into L2 writing teachers attitude towards incorporating ChatGPT in their clarooms. Due to the accessconstraint, this report examines L2 writing teachers who teach in US higher education. We advocate further exploration of metaphors from L2 writing teachers who teach in varying teaching and learning contexts in future research. Additionally, given the unique status that English holds and the large amount of L2 writing rearch produced, which is heavily Western-dominant, it is worth considering if the result of a similar study would be different for non-English L2 writers.
