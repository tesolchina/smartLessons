Intra-journal variation

Interest in language variation is a staple of English for Academic Purposes research and underpins its distinctive character as a field of inquiry. It is the specific nature of language use which defines EAP, yet this definition has been established almost entirely on the basis of inter-discoursal studies, with comparisons of register, genre, discipline, first language, etc. dominating our understanding. In this paper we take a different approach and focus on variation within the field, and specifically within its flagship journal, JEAP. Categorising every paper between volume 1 and 52 as principally taking a textual, critical, contextual or pedagogical orientation, we explore writers' preferences for metadiscourse use. The differences which emerge can be attributed to the argumentation preferences of sub-fields and their knowledge-making practices. The findings offer evidence of intra-disciplinary variation in discoursal preferences and hopefully contribute to our understanding of both the journal and our field.

# 1. Introduction

Central to the characterisation of English for Academic Purposes as a field of inquiry and practice is the importance of inter. discoursal studies (Hyland, 2018; Hyland & Shaw, 2016). Comparisons of register, mode, genre, discipline, irt language, proficiency groups, etc. have played a key role in the emergence of the field's descriptions of language use and disciplinary practices. Less studied, however, are the discoursal differences within disciplines. Only rarely do we find studies of the ways that individuals of different theoretical, profesional or methodological hues vary the tcit knowledge of disciplinary expectations in communicating with peers. EAP itself has also escaped this kind of scrutiny. Yet the considerable range of interests and approaches in EAP, as showcased in compendia such as Charles and Pecorari (2015) and Hyland and Shaw (2016), may conceal considerable rhetorical variations.

Such diversity, then, has rarely been the subject of empirical research. In fact, Ding and Evans have recently suggested that the focus of EAP has been too outward-facing, arguing that:

What needs to be added to this is an inward-facing orientation to the texts, cultures, values, practices and epistemologies of the field and discipline of EAP. Practitioners need to understand their own field as wel as they strive to understand the fields and disciplines of their students. (Ding & Evans, 2022: 4)

Ding's own work (Ding & Bruce, 2017) has taken a step in this direction by focusing on the impact of neoliberalism on the roles and dentities of EAP practitioners. Similarly rflexive, although taking affernt perspective, Hland and Jiang (2021a) used bibliometric echniques to track changes in EAP research and reveal the most influential topics, authors and publications over the last 40 years.

We extend this reflexivity here by exploring the discourse of the field and the extent to which topic foci influence the argument patterns and interactional preferences of writers. To do so we take the main themes contained in th flagship publication of th feld: The Journal of English for Academic Purposes. Categorising every paper since its beginning 20 years ago as taking either a textual, critical, contextual or pedagogical orientation, we explore how writrs employ metadiscourse to present their ideas and engage with their readers in thesedifferent areas. Our purpose i to explore JEAP as a rhetorical domain and determine linguistic variation in EAP. We believe evidence of intra-disciplinary variation in discoursal preferences can contribute to our understanding of both the journal and the field.

# 2. EAP: Homogeneity and heterogeneity

While broadly concerned with research and instruction around the communicative needs and practices of individuals in academic contexts (Hyland & Shaw, 2016: 1), Englis for Academic Purposes has always prided itself on a certain theoretical and methodological eclecticism. It borrows, for example, from various genre models (e.g. Evans, 2022; Swales, 1990), investigative approaches (e.g. Paltridge et al., 2016; Swales, 1998) and theoretical perspectives (e.g. Bruce, 2022; Kirk, 2022). We might, then, more accurately see EAP as a convenient umbrella term under which like-minded people can gather and project a shared professonal context.

Participation in the jounals, conferences, classrooms and discourses of EAP, as well as a geeral orientation to language use and the applied principles of the field is, to some extent, underpinned by the professional, pedagogical and social proclivities and experiences of active individuals. We all contribute to the daily re-construction of something called EAP by gaining qualifications and teaching experiences, reading and writing papers and materials, engaging in recognised social networks, enjoying shared involvement in conferences, journals, learned societies and the other diversions of academic activity.

But while this helps arrange knowledge and skills within the subject area and draw the boundaries of cooperative action among practitioners, we come to this conceptual edfice from different directions and with different interests and goals (e.g. Hyland, 2018) Like allfields of inquiry, EAP is asystem in which multiple eliefs and practices overlap and intersect. Some of us are interested in the cultures and values of academic discipline, some in the genres and discourses of these fields, some in students acquisition and use of specialised language, and others in the practical applications of this knowledge to create materials, fashion classrom tasks or plan further research. This rich mix comprises diverse knowledge-base and motivations for EAP practitioners, so while the borders of the field may be clear enough for everyday purposes, there is considerable intra-disciplinary heterogeneity.

The pluralit of interests and orientations in EAP allow sub-groups and individuals to innovate and combine within the margins of its practices without weakening its direction and common actions. One area in which diferences can manifest themselves is in the preferred patterns of argument and language use which have been shown to characterize diffrent disciplines (e.g. Hyland, 2005; Hyland & Bondi, 2006). Writing as a member of a disciplinary group involves textualizing one's work as biology or aplied linguistics, for example, and oneself as a biologist or applied linguist. As Foucault (1972) oserved, there are isciplinary constraints on discourse which are both restrictive and authorizing, allowing one to create successful texts which display one's disciplinarit, or tacit knowledge f it expectations, for the practical purposes of communicating with pers. Given the varied interests of those working in EAP, it might be surprising if work was not discussed and presented in different ways.

To minimize the effect of genre differences and journal proclivities, we have chosen to take the unusual step of focusing on the papers in a single journal, although an important one for those working in EAP. This i a forum where, for over 20 years, theorists, researchers, practitioners, students, administraors and policy makers have gathered to share ideas and shape a discipline. While not a picture of the field itself, the input of JEAP editorial team of some 60 of the world's leading EAP figures, hundreds of reviewers, countless submissions and over 450 published article, reviews and editorial, has contributed to the ways we understand, and write, EAP. In the next section we briefly offer a short profile of JEAP and outline the different strands of work within its pages.

# 3. JEAP and focal diversity

The Journal of English for Academic Purposes, like many good things, was conceived in the back of taxi. Liz Hamp-Lyons suggested the idea to Author 1 crossing the Johor Bharu causeway to Singapore in 2001, having first gained the support of the publisher Elsevier. The journal was launched the following year with an invite frs issue of five papers, an editorial overview of the field, and a book review. The journal was an almost inevitable outcome of a field which had by then outgrown its established home in the journal of English for Specific Purposes.

In a recent overview of published research in EAP, Hyland and Jiang (2021b) suggest this growth is the result of two main social changes: the increasing complexity and diversity of EAP contexts with the commercial globalisation of academic activity, and the effort ofpractitioners to professionalise the field. Practitioners now find themselves working with undergraduates, PhD students academics writing for publication and a myriad of other learners and situations, needing to understand these contexts and students While working in environments which offer them litle respect or resources. By providing a professional forum for internationally recognised research in the most prestigious indexing databases, JEAP has helped to establish professional respectability for practi. tioners and academic credibilit for the field. The most recent figures, for example, show the journal as having an Impact Factor of 2.17 and ranked in the first quartile of the Scimago journal rankings with a healthy average of 2.7citations per paper. Another indication of the quality of a journal is the papers which don't make it to publication, and here JEAP has an acceptance rate of only $1 4 \%$ which is less than many other social science journals (Herbert, 2020).

JEAP, then, has become a major force in the expansion and growth of EAP as a disciplinary field, enabling practitioners and researchers to keep abreast of developments and contribute to is continued updating. I has, moreover, contribute to a movement away from an exclusive focus on discourse features to understand the social practices of disciplines and of teaching and learning. It is this applied nature of the journal, emerging out of concerns with revealing the constraints of academic practices and how these might be used in classrooms, which helps account for the diversity of interests found in the journal. Moreover, in 2016 the journal explicitly sought o encourage the submisson of more pedagogically-oriented papers by introducing the Reserch into practice section together with the Liz Hamp-Lyons award for papers judged to have the greatest potential to positively nfluence EAP curicula, materials or assessment at the classroom and programme level".

This diversty of the field has been described in various ways. Charles (2013) distinguished three approaches to EAP, namely, \*corpus-based work, genre analysis, and investigation of the social context" (p. 137). In a recent study of JEAP papers, Riazi et al. (2020) classified articles ccording to a rather unwieldy 24 categories of research focus and 9 of theoretical orientation' This level f specification, however, sems to risk overlap (e.g. features of discourse' vs discourse across disciplines', or L1 and L2 vs intercultural rhetoric). In an earlier discussion, Hyland (2009) summarised EAP research as encompassing three broad areas a textual orientation, focusing on language choices and textual patterns; a contextual orientation, ecompassing wider situational aspects, such as the sociology of science, ethnography and sociohistorical perspectives; and a critical orientation which brings an attitude of scepticism and challenge to these contexts, embracing critical discourse analysis and academic literacies.

In this paper we add another category, embracing the pedagogical orientation that JEAP has often sought to champion. This comprises papers addressing teaching and learning issues, classroom methods, fedback and review, assessment, material, engagement and attitudes, etc. So, in all, we characterize the research published in JEAP as primarily having a textual, contextual, pedagogical or critical rientation. We are, of course, ware of likely overap among these categories but sought o discern the main focus of each paper. While these areas comprise a coherent sum of EAP endeavour, it is possble that they are composed and consumed by distinct groups within the community. As a way into this isue, we explore how these different interes are rhetorically elaborated through writers' choices of metadiscourse.

# 4. Metadiscourse and academic interaction in writing

Metadiscourse is now an established approach to the discourse analysis of academic texts (e.g. Consonni, DAngelo & Anesa, 2020; Hyland, 2017; Hyland & Jiang, 2018). Successul writing rests on the assumptions writers make about the abilit of their audience to see arguments s coheret inelligible and persuasive. Metadiscourse ssiss our understanding of how thi is accomplished by offering a model of the resources available to writers to organise their texts and help readers interpret, evaluate, and react to propositional information (Adel & Mauranen, 2010; Hyland, 2005). Informed by the idea of recipient design (Hyland, 2017), i allows us t see how communication is shaped to guide readers to recognise the writers stance, see connections between ideas and fee involved in what is being discussed.

While understood in different ways, we take a broad, integrative view of metadiscourse here, seing metadiscourse as a coherentset of interpersonal options (Hyland, 2005). This means identifying both the ways writers organise a cohesive text and convey their attitudes to what is discussed. Thus:

an awarenessof the reader not only involves assisting their grasp of cohesive connections but also the efect that their evaluation and assessments of material might be understood. (Hyland & Jiang, 2018 p.19).

Hyland (2005) therefore distinguishes interactive and interactional resources (terms adapted from Thompson, 2001). The former refers to what the writer believes should be made explicit to organise the discourse and guide readers interpretation of the text. The latter concerns the writer'sefforts to control the level of personality in a text and estblish a suitable relationship to arguments and audience, marking the degre of reader involvement and the expression of attitude and commitment. These purposes, together with example realisations, are:

Interactive resources allow the writer to manage the information flow to establish his or her preferred interpretations. They include:

transitions - devices (mainly conjunctions) used to mark additive, contrastive, and consequential relations (in addition, but, tus, however).   
frame markers -refer to text boundaries or structure, including items used to sequence, label tages, announce discourse goals and indicate topic shifts (finally, to conclude, my purpose is)..   
endophoric markers - make dditional material salient to help the reader recover the writer's intentions by referring to other parts of the text (noted above, see Fig, in section 2).   
. evidentials - indicate the source of information from outside the text, mainly citations (Smith argues) and evidential markers (according to).   
: code glosses - restates information (for instance, in other words).

Interactional resources focus on the participants of the interaction and display the writer's persona and a tenor consistent with community norms. They include:

. hedges - withhold the writer's full commitment to a statement (might, perhaps, possible, about) : boosters - express certainty and emphasise propositional force (in fact, definitely, it is clear)

attitude markers- state the writer's atitude to propositions, conveying surprise, agrement, imprtance, etc (ufortnately, I ge, surprisingly).   
engagement markers - explicitly addres readers to focus their atention or include them in the text through second person pronouns, imperatives, questions and asides. (you, consider, note that)   
: self-mentions - explicit reference to authors (I, we, our, my)

Essentially, the model captures the interpersonal character of communication, so that more features are found in soft than hard disciplines (Hyland, 205), in the work f higher than lower proficiency students (Jiang, 2017) and in some spoken than written modes (Zou & Hyland, 2022). Here we examine intra-journal differences to determine if metadiscourse use diverges in the presentation of topic areas.

# 5. Data and analysis

We created a JEAP corpus by gathering all empirical articles published in the journal from volume 1 in 2002 to volume 52 in July 2021. The collction included papers in all regular and special issues but excluded editorials, book reviews and brief reports. This produced a corpus of 441 articles of over 3 million words. As noted above, we followed Hyland (2009) in identifying 4 groups, textual, critical, pedagogical and contextual orientations, each embracing a variety of methods. The key themes in these areas are:

: textual -- discourse, text, linguistic, grammar, lexis : critical - CDA, academic literacies, power, ideology, identity : pedagogical - teachers, materials, tasks, learning, students, assessment : contextual - context, sociohistorical, institution, community, university

We identified the primary research focus of the paper through a close reading of the article title, abstract and keywords, giving priority to the author(s)' perception of their principal approach. Where there was any uncertainty we tumed to the research questions and then to the content of the paper itself. Where there was overlap we categorised the paper acording to the predominant focus of the text as a whole. Both authors worked independently on allthe papers and coded examples according to the 4 categories, achieving a high inter-rater agreement of $9 7 \%$ before resolving disagreements through discussion. The outcome of this process is shown in Table 1.

JEAP, then, is predominantly a journal which addresses textual issues, with $3 7 \%$ of papers concerned with the discourse and grammar of EAP texts. This concurs withRiazi et al.s (2020) reent review of JEAP.It i intereting tonote that pedagogicall-oriented papers are generally shorter than the average, while contextually focused ones tend to require far more elaboration.

Using the concordance software AntConc (Anthony, 2019), we searched each f the four sub-corpora for the items in Hyland (2005) list of most common metadiscourse words and phrases in academic writing. As Author 1 observes, this is not an exhaustive list Metadiscourse is an open category which allows the use of aditional items acording to need, while insider understandings mean that not all ntendd metdiscoural meanings are transparent to the analyst. These 500 items, then, are the most explicit textual devices and provide a solid basi for examining variations across research practices. It i also worth mentioning that metadiscourse signals can stretch to clause or, ocasionall, sentence length, so that frequency counts are merely indicative of cases and are principally a way of comparing patterns of occurrence of metadiscourse in different corpora.

Following Hyland and Jiang (2018), we omitted both and and or from the counts of transitions, since these are typicall default options of marking conjunctive relations of addition and alternation rather than rhetorical strategies and produce thousands of examples. We then manually checked each concordance line to ensure that the items were functioning as metadiscourse as irst and second in (1) and exclude extraneous examples as first, second, third and fourth in (2).

(1) First, despite its macrostructure, the RA should have a separate Discussion section. Second, the first available drafts had to have been written by the students (the first authors) on their own. (2) the sample encompassed the first, second, third, and fourth year candidates along with graduate students.

Both authors worked independently and achieved an inter-rater agreement of $9 7 \%$ on interactive and $9 6 \%$ on interactional metadiscourse before resolving disagreements. We then normalized the raw frequencies of to 1o0,o00 words so that the use of metadiscourse could be compared across the four corpora of ifferent sizes. We used Rayson's spreadsheet to calculate log-likelihood $( L L )$ value to determine whether the dffrences of normed frequency were statistically significant. The spreadsheet allows a comparison between more than two corpora, so the raw frequencies and total words of each corpus were entered with the resulting $L L$ and significance $( p )$ values as output indicating whether the differences were significant.

# 6. An overview of metadiscourse use in JEAP

We identified 201,232 metadiscourse markers overall averaging 654.5 cases per 10,000 words or about 456.3 cases in each paper.

Table 1 JEAP articles in different strands of research.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>texts</td><td>words</td><td>words per text</td></tr><tr><td>Textual orientation</td><td>164</td><td>1,157,413</td><td>7057.4</td></tr><tr><td>Critical orientation</td><td>124</td><td>871,535</td><td>7028.5</td></tr><tr><td> Pedagogical orientation</td><td>112</td><td>740,736</td><td>6613.7</td></tr><tr><td>Contextual orientation</td><td>41</td><td>304,707</td><td>7431.9</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>441</td><td>3,074,391</td><td>6971.5</td></tr></table></body></html>

There were 103,751 interactive devices 337.5 per 10,000 words) and 97,484 interactional devices (317.1 per 10,00 word). The distribution aligns with Author 1 and Hyland's (2018) findings for aplied linguistics overall, which showed a substantial decline n interactional metadiscourse i reent years so that frequencies are now dominated by interactive forms. The papers in JEAP, of course, cover a 20 year period and so our figures may disguise this trend, but itis clear that interactional devices, which convey the writer's stance and strength of engagement with readers, continue to play a hugely significant role in these articles.

Turning to the use of these metadiscourse choices across the diffrent topic foci, we find that the authors of textually oriented papers make considerably more use of metadiscourse overall, and particularly of interactive forms. Both the pedagogical and contextual groups show asimilar preference for cohesion constructing interactive forms, but the critical papers have a remarkably low figures for interactive functions (Table 2).

We were surprised at the extent of the variation in the use of metadiscourse types as we had assumed there would be greater similarities in such an apparently homogeneous field. One possibility which occurred to us was the potential inluence of NNS authorship on the use of metadiscourse as Hyland and Jiang (2021a), for example, found that most papers in EAP areauthored by Asian and European authors and these may favour textual papers. However, there is ittle evidence for this and reviewing and editing processes involved in a paper's journey to publication appear to rule out the influence of NNs authorship on rhetorical choices (Englander, 2006; Jiang, 2017). The journal itself i relatively non-directive in its recommendations regarding style, with the guide to authors simply specifying the need for inclusive language. But while writers have a certain leway in creating their connections between ideas and wit readers, their choices appear to be constrained by the topics they select, most obviously in the difference between 12 textual and pedagogical papers. In the following sections we explore these choices in more detail.

# 7. Interactional metadiscourse in different strands

Interactional metadiscourse represents the writers intrusion into the text to comment on what i being discussed or directly address the reader It concerns the participants of the interaction. Table 2 shows that frequencies were very similar with three of the strands close to an average of 32.5 per 100 words. The importance of these features can be seen in this example:

(3) What varieties of acent are used? It can beargued that the introduction of multiple varieties into testing at lower levels should be avoided because it deprives listeners of a major set of phonetic cues. At an advanced level, however, we might argue that inclusion of accented varieties is desirable ... (Critical)

The use of a question helps to directly involve the reader in the text and encourages engagement with the issue which is then presented from a point of view whichreaders might accet or consider reasonable. This is then challenged as the author ffers his personal view. he us of a question, modal erbs, incusie we and n expressionf atitude al combine effctively to hook the reader and carry the argument forward.

# 7.1. Expressing stance

Table 3 shows that epistemic markers dominate the expression of stance in JEAP articles, with hedges heavily predominating in every strand and alldifferences statistclly significant. These figures broadly reflect practices in applied linguistics articles more generally (Hyland, 2005; Hyland & Jiang, 2019).

We also s in the table that textual and critical papers, which typically offer tentative, and often even peculative, explanatios for the language patterns they report in text, re most heavily hedged. Thus trying to explain the decline of a language feature over time can involve relatively tortuous prose:

(4) This suggests that writers may have les confidence in their readers ability to recover background knowledge about experimental practices. Possibly as a result of changing audiences with less knowledge of specialist techniques. (Textual)   
Reporting pedagogical research, on the other hand, allows for greater assurance in explaining results:   
(5) Indeed, the answers to questions prompting the participants to elaborate on measures they took to enhance validity showed that most were unfamiliar with the validity evidence they needed to attend to in order to addres the types of validity that concerned them most. (Pedagogical)

Pedagogical papers also contain significantly fewer self-mentions. This was surprising as we had assumed that many of thesestudies would involve the writers' personal experiences of clasroom practice, but this does not seem to be the case. Instead, we find dis cussions of textbook materials, tasks, programmes, curricula and classoom methods which are not directl related to the reporting authors' experiences. This can be illustrated by these brief extracts from two presentations of methods:

(6) A content analysis method was used to study the feedback comments. Each sampled feedback comment was coded into a set of evaluative statements relating to the Task Fulfilment and Organisation category, with each coded evaluative statement assigned to a sub-category. All coding was performed by the author, using Microsoft Excel. (Pedagogical)   
(7) We adapted the original survey instrument and only incorporated two further questions in Section A, as we found i f interest to identify the multilingual background of the respondents ... We also deemed it of interest to know their future publication plans in international English-medium journals. It was also our purpose to elicit perceptions on posible language burden... (Contextual)

Attitude was most frequently expressed by writers presenting work from a critical perspective. Here the writers' affective as. sessments contributeto general evaluative tone or, as here, can play an important role in establishing a critical ontex for the study (8) The undeniable shortcomings of EAP education in Iran, from unformed polies to uninformed choices of materials based on unverified assumptions to flawed methodologies and haphazard practices by unqualified teachers, has hitherto piqued the interest of several EAP specialists and researchers. (Critical)

Attitude markers seem to have been falling steadily over the past 50 years in applied linguistic (Hyland & Jiang, 2019), but clearly they continue toplay an important role. This is particularly the case where writers bring a morereflective and valuative stance to texts and practices, as in critically-oriented papers.

Interestingly, boosters are most frequent in the textual papers, where they asst writers to ensure readers get the bottom line message of the study:

(9) The study has shown that local grammars can be a valid altenative to explore discourse acts in academic texts and that such research has significant pedagogical implications for EAP teaching. (Textual) (10) This study exhibits the additional value of exploring epistemic stance more narrowly through the investigation of specific phenomena beyond more general investigations. (Textual)

Our study also concurs with Hyland and Jiang's (2016) indings that boosters conveying objective, data-supported assurances, like show, demonstrate and find, greatly exceeded those expressing personal beliefs, such as believe and know. The need to convey epistemic judgements with some caution and reserve, as shown by more hedges, perhaps indicates a risk -averse academic culture in which strong commitments and definitive judgements might be counter-productive.

# 7.2. Expressing engagement

Engagement, the features writers use to rhetorically acknowledge the presence of their audience, tends to be les studied than stance and is always far les frequent in reearch artices. espite this, it i a key means by which witers preent themseles s sharing or perhaps failing to share, atitudes with readers and how they manage solidarity and affiliation. Table 4 shows, once again, sig nificant differences across topic trands in JEAP, with reader mention, knowledge appeals and directives dominating the frequencies. Explicitly referring to the reader is the clearest signal that the writer is considering the presence of an active audience, and while second person you and your are the most explicit demonstration of this, inclusive we is the most common reference. In (11) we see it used in a contextual study to ensure readers are on board with the writer's interpretation and seeing things i the same way. In (12)the pronoun shows an attempt to create a strong persuasive bond with readers in a pedagogical text.

(11) We can se that there is es variety in the NNES group. If we consider the totaloccurrences, shown in Table 2, NNES used 269 connectors fewer than NES. (Contextual)   
(12) We need teaching materials to raise awarenessof key features of academic discourse fr teachers and learners alike. But we cannot rely on most textboos to do this to an acceptable standard at present. However, this i not to say we should abandon the textbook altogether. Rather, we should strive to raise the quality of textbooks being produced. (Pedagogical)

Another feature which stands out in Table 4 is the high use of appeals to shared knowledge in the textual papers. These devices are explicit ways of asking readers to recognise something as familiar or accepted, seking to position readers within the seemingly unproblematic boundaries of disciplinary understandings. But while they mark what might be considered implicitly agred, the notion of sharedness is problematic and open to manipulation. Writers may misjudge or, more often, deliberately exploit what s controversial for rhetorical ends.

This appears to be a particularly attractive option for textual analysts seeking to create a connection with readers in order to prepare them for the argument to come:

(13) Of course, analysing a semi-technical ist will only give a partial view of a disciplinary field's epistemology. (Textual) (14) cOCA-Academic is of course just part of the larger Corpus of Contemporary American English (cocA) .. (Textual)

A more rhetorically incisive appeal to shared knowledge helps to influence readers' perceptions of the argument itself, seeking tc persuade readers of their interpretation of discourse patterns:

(15) Obviously, these ifferent types of ethos respectively corrlate with a higher use of hedges on the one hand, and  higher use of attitude markers on the other hand. (Textual)   
(16) Some situations obviously require writers to combine both rhetorical steps in the same introduction without disrupting the logical flow in establishing research niches. (Textual).

While jargon, familiar acronyms, etcetera all foreground a common frame for seeing the world, these forms more directly hely finesse reader agreement and solidarity.

Directives are the third most common type of engagement marker in the JEAP corpus and are particularly popular among writers of pedagogicall-riented texts. These papers often instruct readers not only what they should attend to in the argment (17) but often to accept that what is being advocated is worth pursuing in their own classrooms.

(17) It is important to note that reading speed was not a diagnostic subcomponent in the CAEL. (Pedagogical) (18) We must acknowledge that our students face social, economic, and educational pressures to compose in SWE. (Pedagogical) (19) In addition, more ffort should be given to designing motivational straegies for students of lower academic motivation and EFL proficiency. (Pedagogical)

Because directives seek to engage and position readers, they carry strong connotations of unequal power, claiming greater authority for the writer (Hyland, 2001). This seems to be most aparent with necessity modals which seem to impose far more on the reader than imperatives, yet despite this, modals remain a common rhetorical option in our corpus.

Asides and questions are far les common in JEAP papers, although questions do crop up in critical and pedagogical papers. Questions, of course, are atthe heart of allaadmic inqury, bt only osionally surface in rech paprs. Their appearance invites readers into the text by addressing them as having an interest in an issue and the good sense to follow the writr's response to it (Hyland & Jiang, 2016).

The use of questions seems to be particularly attractive to those working in critical and pedagogical areas. In the former questions not only help capture readers curiosity (Chang & Schleppegrel, 2011), but also provide an orientation for them; a frame where they can be led to the writer's viewpoint (Hyland, 2002).

(20) Are language studies journals therefore acceting the use of we as a means for single author elf-rference? Should they do so? How about sentences such as \*This paper thinks/believes? (Critical)

In pedagogical papers, the questions posed appear to be more involving, posing isues that readers might ask when considering their own classroom practices:

(21) How do participants in advanced academic writing courses learn to analyze genre examples when they are introduced to the genre analysis framework outlined in Swales (1990)? The answer to this question seems unclear in Swales (1990). (Pedagogical)

So questions, while relatively rare in these JEAP papers, can play a useful rhetorical role for writers in some areas.

# 8. Interactive metadiscourse use in different strands

Interactive features are those which organise a text to help readers recover the writer'sintentions, creating surface cohesion and influencing understandings of propositional material. They function to link material, ffer elaborations, sigal text stages and refer to information elsewhere in the text. As such, they not only help glue the text together but also represent an internal dialogue with readers, reflecting the writer ssessment of what needsto be doneto present information in the most comprehensible and convincing way for particular readers.

Table 2 shows significantly diffrent frequencies of interactive features acros the strands, with critical and pedagogical papers containing substantially fewer forms. Writrs of the textual papers, it sems, often go to considerable lengths to spell out the connections between ideas when trying to explain reasons for their findings:

(22) The last reason why Persian writers overused 6-word lexical bundles may be because Persian writers ften tended to avoid, or modify, the structures of particular lexical bundles which result in awkward use of them. In other words, Persian writers conveyed a particular function (i.e., structuring signal), using an unnatural structure. For instance, the 6-word lexical bundles in examples (10), (11) are modified versions of as can be seen in table in extract 9, which English writers did not choose. (Textual)

Here we see the authors pressing frame markers, transition signals, code glosses and endophorics into service to account for ter. results.

In contrast, this extract of similar length taken from an interpretive passage in acritical paper presents an argument with a parse use of interactive forms. We see only an endophoric here referring back to a previously discussed student tex, a contrastive marker and an evidential.

(23) Zohra's writing decisions here do not stem from acritical incident or serve as an example of linear transfer oten highlighted by studies that consider the role of students' prior knowledge in transfer. Instead, she gives us an insight into the uptake that guided her ultimate transfer: ffering an expanded example of the metaphor for transfer that Alexander et al. (2016) define as literacy linking, for Zohra works toward expertise only by reshaping multiple literacies in a proces of "adaptive remediation" (p. 35). (Critical)

Clearly this s avery iferent kind f disussion with es rflexie sinalling and overt stcturing. The intrretationis foused on a single case supported by a reference without the need for greater elaboration.

We find similarly low frequencies of interactive forms in the pedagogical papers, which, like many of the critical papers, are focused on particular case study subjects, as here:

(24) Lee joined a group with two NSE students due to seating proximity. She was alittl nervous as she knew at least Diane was avery strong student. \*She's very serious to her study, and always has great points." (weekly chat) Lee's group decided to write a listening tes for level l students at the ELI. The entire test consisted of two parts focusing on improving listening skills such as paraphrasing, inferencing, understanding the main idea and listening for details. (Pedagogical)

This narrative-style account of astudent's participation in a teacher education writing group contains just one evidential, citing the weekly chat' record as the source of the quote and a code gloss expanding listening skills. Despite the lack of reader assistance, however, the extract is readable and easy to follow.

What many of the pedagogical and critical papers have in common is a shared methodological orientation. While some of the critical papers are text focused, taking a broadly Critical Discourse Analytic viewpoint, the majority adopt an academic literacies stance. This geerall involves exploring the perspectives of writers and readers in a particular context, with isues of identity, power and authority central. As with a great deal of pedagogical research, this employs qualitative methods, focusing on the observation of individuals or groups and structured around interviews.

This may help explain the variations in our data as Cao and Hu (2014) found cler cross-paradigmatic dfferences in the incidence of five types of interactive metadiscourse in 120 research articles. They explain thir findings in terms of the contrasting epistemologies underlying qualitative and quantitative research paradigms, So, because it takes a more positivist stance in uncovering generalisable statements, quantitative research tends to employ more interactive metadiscourse which signpost logical relationships and statistical links between hypothesizd causes and effects. In contrast, qualitative research is underpinned by a more interpretivis eistemology that prioritizes participant meanings in order to develop contextualized understandings of experience. As a result, there are fewer opportunitie, and le need, to ompare reults with prior expectations, while its analysis of examples ecerpts, and eisoes requires fewer references to tables or numeric structuring devices (Cao & Hu, 2014, pp. 26-7).

The differences in individual interactie features can be seen in Table 5.Whil alldifferences are significant, we note that textual and contextual papers contain more code gloses, frame markers and transitions and that writers of critical and contextual papers used fewer endophorics and evidentials.

Table 5 suggests that writers of textual and contextual papers are more likely to use code glosses, devices which help explicate or reformulate material for readers. This finding might be explained in terms of the often more technical and abstract nature of these papers. Concepts are sometimes clarified by the use of examples (25) or, overwhelmingly more often, by reformulations to spel out a technical term (26):

(25) Factive verbs such as hold, state, note' and require were prevalent for courts and legislation while non-factive verbs such as 'claim' and 'comment' were used to report academics' views. (Textual)   
(26) Quoted segments consisting of es than a one T-unit were marked as \*phrasal' and then coded acording to their phrasal structure: "verb phrase," (defined as one or more inflected verbs plus any modifiers, objects or complements accompanying them), \*noun phrase, (defined as one or more nouns plus any modifiers accompanying them) or adjective phrase" (defined as one or more adjectives plus any modifiers accompanying them). (Textual)

Such highly theoretical, technical knowledge ofen requires elaboration to asst comprehension, but is far es common in the generally more accessible critical and pedagogical papers.

Endophoric and evidential markers are also more highly represented in the textual papers. Endophorics aid comprehension of detailed arguments by directing readers around the text, pointing them towards examples or other parts of the discourse:

(27) Consider the italicized expressions of atitude in example 6, which were flatly declared and thus presented as not at isue (Textual) (28) Table 13 below shows the frequency of the two semantic motives discussed above across the four sub-corpora. (Textual) (29) Nursing and agriculture journals, as noted earlier in this paper, often have required sections. (Textual)

Argument and interpretation in the other strands, however, seem to involve lessredirection of this kind, with more linear struc. turing and fewer tables and visual data presentations. This example is typical of such papers:

(30) Although local knowledge may refer to anything from key course information to incidental facts, it is evident from these interviews that international students want to know more about what is going on around them so that they can successfully complete the tasks required of them and at the same time, feel they can contribute to general discussions. It is therefore important that lecturers and students try not to assume local knowledge which may exclude overseas students. (Pedagogical)

Similarly, textual papers make greater use of citational support with evidential markers. This is the key way in which writers integrate their claims into current knowledge and signal their disciplinary credentials:

(31) A key interet of many of the studies cited above is how authors adopt various \*roles" (IVanic, 1998, Tang and John, 1999, p. 25) such as a meta-textual guide, who directs the reader through the text, and a conductor of research, who outlines methodological procedures (e.g. Harwood, 2005b, Hyland, 2o01, Hyland, $\mathbf { 2 0 0 2 a } ,$ Starfield and Ravelli, 2006). (Textual)

In this textual extract we see considerable rhetoricaleffort invested in establishing the significance of author roles, drawing on six sources to support the point. This kind of evidential backing i far les a feature f critical, pedagogical and contextual papers, again, perhaps because of a greater focus on less generalisable local contexts.

The often narrativestyle of contextually-oriented papers, however, means that these often contain a greater number and range of transition markers, particularly those signalling addition and contrast. We see this in the extracts below:

(32) Genres produced include book chapters, journal articles and conference procedings; however, none of the five informants produced a journal article in Swedish, whereas all have written journal articles in English. The lingusts are also less visibly active than historians in terms of outreach genres; nonetheless, English and Swedish have been used in this domain by at least one informant. On the other hand, they have been more active than historians in using digital media such as blogs, which have appeared in both English and Swedish. (Contextual)

(33) Additionally, awareness-raising activities led by writing professionals were found to effectively reduce instance f text-ased plagiarism in students' writing (Huang, 2014). However, writing professionals sometimes encounter difficulties in teaching discipline-specific EAP courses. In addition, writing in such EAP courses taught by language instructors may lack authenticity. (Contextual)

We can see here very different argument style than that in (31). Insted of pointing outside the text for supporting testimony for an argument, these writers lay out an account of connected events in a linear way. In both cases information is presented almost as astory. In (32) concessive connectives predominate as the writer holds our interest by confounding our expectations while in (33) there is a preference for additive markers with a concessive used to shift the focus of the argument.

Finally, frame markers. These extend transitions by helping to organise the text and reduce the readers processing effort by explicitly marking the structure of the argument and labellig boundarie. Cao and Hu (2014) found that frame markers served similar functions in their quantitatie and qualitative RAs and, once again they are most frequent in contextual papers and least common in pedagogical ones. Table 6, however, shows there are some variations in this broad generalisation.

Announcing the goal of the research is a function used in al four areas of study, an unsurprising finding as the need for clea objectives is crucial to encourage readers to engage with the paper and evaluate its effectiveness.

(34) The aim of this study is to shed some light on whether it is beneficial todevote classroom time to the explicit teaching of a limited number of academic FS and how this might be best achieved. (Pedagogical)   
(35) In order to address the issues outlined in the introduction, the study aimed to uncover the processes through which the three writers completed their assignments. (Contextual)

Sequencers are also heavily used by writers irespective of the topic orientation of their paper with pedagogical authors making particular use of them. These devices act liketransitions in explicitly linking steps in the arument or clarifying points. As can be seen, they are particularly useful in seting out the organisation of the paper, or part of it (36), or to summarize key findings (37):

(36) In this section we first describe the student participants' reports of thir experiences and their perceptions of their EAP classes and then the teachers' perceptions. (Pedagogical)   
(37) First a supportive online environment should enable learners to take charge of their online actions . Second, resonating with previous findings .. Finall, to increase students' engagement and motivation, online writing tools could incorporate popular gaming elements. (Pedagogical)

Our data show that authorsof critical papers rarely indicate that they are shifing topics during the course of their discussion and pedagogical authors almost never d so. While the numbers are relatively small this may indicate something of the preferred argument patterns taken by the different authors. The contextual and textual paper often addres multiple ssues and authors take considerable pains to lead their readers through the complexities of different topics:

(38) Returning to the more frequent referential discourse function, normalized mean per-text counts of the subfunctions between sub-corpora are displayed in Table 7. (Textual)   
(39) We now look at our results in more detail, beginning with moves. (Contextual)

Finall, the contextual papers contained substantially more frame markers which serve to label stages in the unfolding discourse or mark particular pragmatic acts. Once again, theseassist readers to follow the discussion by providing expli signposts of the writer's direction:

(40) To summarize, the concept of parallel language use is not transparent. (Contextual)   
(41) Overall, we believe that the concepts of linguistic capital and performative competence complement each other by alowing us to see how professional capabilities and practices are construed in discourse. (Contextual)

Table 6 Categories of frame markers across strands (per 10,o00 words).   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>textual</td><td>critical</td><td> pedagogical</td><td>contextual</td><td>LL</td><td>p</td></tr><tr><td>state goals</td><td>14.0</td><td>13.9</td><td>14.9</td><td>14.7</td><td>539.1</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>label stages</td><td>5.3</td><td>4.8</td><td>5.3</td><td>8.2</td><td>214.4</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>sequencing</td><td>22.6</td><td>23.3</td><td>26.2</td><td>21.8</td><td>1119.9</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td>shift topics</td><td>11.1</td><td>4.4</td><td>0.5</td><td>13.0</td><td>836.9</td><td>&lt;0.0001</td></tr></table></body></html>

The pervasiveness of these fatures in the contextual papers perhaps suggests a sense among writers that their topic, or argument form, requires more explicit elaboration than normally found in JEAP papers.

# 9. Conclusions

This study has taken a novel approach to discourse variation by exploring the intra-journal use of metadiscourse in the Journal of English for Academic Purposes, the flagship journal of EAP. Classfying every one of the 441 papers published between volume 1 and 52 as taking a textual, critical, contextual or pedagogical orientation, we have identified significant differences in the preferences for metadiscourse use.

We found that textuall-oriented papers contained the highest density of metadiscourse markers with both interactive and interactional types exceeding the frequencies in the other areas. Pedagogical papers, of which there are substantiall fewer, contained the least metadiscourse per 1o,o0o words. Stance markers were broadly similar across three areas but significantly fewer in the pedagogical papers, indicating, perhaps, a more descriptive and les argumentative style of discussion. Writers of pedagogical and contextuall-oriented papers, however, appear to make grater effrts to engage ther readers, with significantly more directives n the former and reader mentions in the ltter. Both invite readers to share the writer's experience of the situation observed and accept the interpretation offered. Regarding interactive metadiscourse, which help smooth readers xperience and comprehension of atext, we found critical and pedagogical papers contain sustantilly fewer forms. We atriute this tothe often qualitative approaches of these papers and the more narrative style they adopt.

These diferences in metadiscourse practices then, are more than the proclivitie of individual authors but can be seen as repre. senting diffrent methodological and epistemological practices. They indicate that while we can identify a broad disciplinary community of EAP scholars and practitiners, there are clear strands of interests within this community and that these interests are characterised by discoursal variations. We believe that these findings help to reveal the rich complexity of our field and something of the range of interests and discourses which the journal represents. We hope also to have pushed metadiscourse research into a new direction and encourage further work in intra-disciplinary metadiscourse variation. Finally, this evidence of intra-disciplinary dif. ferences may raise the awareness of students and teachers of EAP regarding variability within even a single journal and reinforce their efforts to reveal and teach specific forms of language use.
