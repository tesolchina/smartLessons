# Marketized university discourse: A synchronic and diachronic comparison of the discursive constructions of employer organizations in academic and business job advertisements

Baramee Kheovichai Silpakorn University, Thailand

# Abstract

UK universities have gone through drastic changes driven by the marketization of higher education. From the perspective of critical discourse analysis, Fairclough hypothesizes that university discourse will be colonized by business discourse. While a number of studies have been conducted, to my knowledge no study has compared university discourse and business discourse both synchronically and diachronically. This article compares how employer organizations are discursively constructed synchronically and diachronically in 240 academic and business job advertisements. The analytical frameworks are transitivity analysis and modality. The results indicate that academic job advertisements have changed from not mentioning organizations to discursively constructing organizations in a promotional manner like business job advertisements. In addition, universities reframe themselves as businesses, entrepreneurs and service providers. This article contends that universities should be selective in adopting business discourse and maintain their identity as educational institutions.

# Introduction and theoretical background

Universities nowadays have gone through a process of transformation driven by marketization with ‘markets driving the world of universities in a way unprecedented in their history’ (Foskett, 2011: 26). Marketization of higher education is a contentious issue. Supporters of marketization argue that with marketization universities will be more accountable, engage more with society and play a crucial role in economic development (Brown, 2011). Critics, in contrast, question the commodification of education, arguing that marketization obscures the essence of education and destroys the identity of academics (Deem, 2001).

Research on the impact of marketization has been carried out from various fields such as the sociology of education (Coffield and Williamson, 1997) and critical discourse analysis (henceforth CDA) (Fairclough, 1993). In the field of CDA, an approach led by Fairclough (1992) focuses on the analysis of discourse and social change. This approach investigates social changes which are driven by asymmetrical power relations and top–down changes. Fairclough’s (1993) seminal work on the marketization of public institutions, for example, focuses on the changing discursive practices of higher education institutions in the UK. Fairclough (1993) argues that the discursive practices of universities are being colonized by those of the businesses. Mautner (2010) also refers to this phenomenon, but terms it ‘discursive alignment’. One of the major claims is ‘the increasing salience within higher education of promotion as a communicative function’ (Fairclough, 1993: 143).

Since Fairclough’s seminal study, there have been several studies of marketization of universities from the CDA perspective. Critical discourse studies on marketization of higher education can be divided into two strands. The first investigates texts written about higher education institutions by external organizations. The second analyses texts produced by universities, which therefore represent the discursive practices of universities rather than how external bodies talk about higher education.

Studies in the first strand analyse various text types, namely, policy documents (Mulderrig, 2006; Wodak and Fairclough, 2010), news articles (Haas and Fischman, 2010; Williams, 2011) and election manifestos (Pearce, 2004). The main findings from these studies are that education is commodified, competitiveness rhetoric is prevalent in the discourse about higher education, and students are viewed as customers. One point of interest is Williams’s (2011) argument that students are disempowered when being viewed as customers, which is contrary to the pro-market argument (Brown, 2011). Williams argues that student customers are presented as being ‘vulnerable’, in need of protection and focused on the outcomes rather than the process of learning.

Studies in the second strand look at several genres, namely, prospectuses (Askehave, 2007; Fairclough, 1993; Teo, 2007), job advertisements (Fairclough, 1993; Mayr, 2008; Xiong, 2012), websites (Mautner, 2010; Mayr, 2008), mission statements (Caiazzo, 2011; Connell and Galasiński, 1998; Morrish and Sauntson, 2013; Sauntson and Morrish, 2011; Slater, 2010) and other official documents. Findings from these studies indicate that university discourse has become more promotional and more similar to business discourse (Fairclough, 1993).

While this claim has been investigated, previous studies rarely compared university discourse and business discourse to find evidence of convergence between them (see Slater, 2010, for an exception). Furthermore, a number of previous studies are based on small data sets (Fairclough, 1993; Mayr, 2008; Teo, 2007), which in turn limit the strength of the claim about the extent to which university discourse has become marketized. In addition, the diachronic dimensions of university discourse and business discourse have not been investigated in a systematic manner (see Haas and Fischman, 2010; Mulderrig, 2006, for exceptions). As such, questions remain as to whether universities have indeed completely adopted marketized discourse and become a simulacrum of business organizations, or not.

This study compares, synchronically and diachronically, how universities and businesses are discursively represented in job advertisements, to see whether there is evidence of a convergence between university and business discourse. The focus of comparison is on the actions and attributes that employer organizations are construed as performing and having. The analytical frameworks are transitivity analysis and modality (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004) and other relevant linguistic features. In this article, I argue that the representation of universities and their institutional entities is aligned with that of business organizations. The portrayals of universities in discourse have changed, with heightened emphasis on promotional messages, the entrepreneurialism of institutions and the conceptualization of universities as businesses.

# Social and institutional background of marketization of higher education in the UK

According to Coffield and Williamson (1997), in the past, universities in the UK were elitist institutions where research and teaching were the main focus of activities. Higher education institutions enjoyed freedom in the way they operate. Students were mainly UK residents and they were entitled to education without having to pay tuition fees. The higher education sector expanded rapidly as education became viewed as a right to which all citizens are entitled and was acknowledged as a crucial mechanism for socio-economic development (Tomlinson, 2005).

From the 1970s onwards, the UK higher education landscape has dramatically changed due to complex driving forces such as an economic crisis, a growing public concern over the accountability of universities, insufficient financial resources, and the education for economy policies (Tomlinson, 2005). Neoliberalism has become a key political ideology and the role of the state has been minimized, while the free market mechanism and ideology have been introduced in public institutions (Harvey, 2005).

The market system has been promoted in UK higher education institutions to respond to this political and economic climate and to continue the enlargement of the sector while maintaining the quality and keeping the cost low (Foskett, 2011). Former polytechnic institutions have been granted a university status, diversifying the choices for students (Tomlinson, 2005). The government increased competition among and within universities by spending cuts, the introduction of cost centres and other policies. To maintain the quality and inform students’ choice, there are various measures such as the Research Assessment Exercise (now the Research Excellence Framework), league tables and the National Student Survey (Harley et al., 2004). The escalating tuition fees, which transfer the fee burden from the tax-payers to the individual student ‘customer’, are an additional drive towards commercialism.

Furthermore, universities have adopted managerialist ideologies, management strategies and practices (Trowler, 2001). Universities are engaged in marketing activities such as branding and advertising (Sauntson and Morrish, 2011). It has been noted that many universities have allocated increased funds to marketing activities or have even established whole marketing divisions as part of their infrastructure (Foskett, 2011). Auditory culture and target settings have become common practice, while research is judged based on value for money (Harley et al., 2004: 332). Slaughter and Leslie (1997) also note the phenomenon which they term ‘academic capitalism’. They argue that the roles of academics have changed as they are also responsible for income generation, commercialization and finding alternative financial resources. Furthermore, universities are encouraged or required to establish links with business organizations (Coffield and Williamson, 1997). Furthermore, they are encouraged to view students as customers (Mautner, 2010).

In addition, research studies have argued that the language of business permeates the discourse of UK universities, and some manager-academics adopt such language and the ideology that comes with it (Coffield and Williamson, 1997; Deem and Brehony, 2005; Johnson, 2001; Love, 2008). There is a consensus among these researchers that language can shape the way in which UK universities and people involved position themselves and reflect the reality of how universities operate. In Love’s (2008: 17) words, the ‘language and symbolism of a rampant business culture now surround and permeate the modus operandi of today’s academy’. Within this context of the recognition of the importance of discourse in construing identity, this study focuses on university and business recruitment discourse and investigates how organizations are discursively constructed. The section that follows describes data collection.

# Data

To carry out this study, job advertisements from universities and businesses were selected for investigation. This is because the production of this genre is a routine activity, thereby a potential site of naturalized discursive practices. Furthermore, Fairclough’s (1993) seminal work in marketization of higher education discourse has argued that job advertisements are a part of universities’ orders of discourse that have been heavily marketized. For the present-day data sets (in the year 2010) 60 academic job advertisements were taken from www.jobs.ac.uk and 60 business job advertisements were collected from www.efinanicalcareers.co.uk. These two websites were selected because they are very influential in the recruitment process. As a basis for diachronic comparison, data from the 1970s (1971–1974) were collected from newspapers which can be considered closely equivalent to these websites (obviously, online job advertisements did not exist in the 1970s). Sixty academic job adverts were randomly selected from the Times Higher Education supplement and 60 business job adverts were randomly selected from the Sunday Times.

# Data analysis

In this article, the analysis aims at deconstructing the representations of organizations in discourse. Fairclough (2010) argues that analytical frameworks from systemic functional linguistics (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004) can be used to deconstruct how entities are construed in discourse and how a representation of an event can be manipulated for ideological effects. Therefore, two concepts from systemic functional linguistics – transitivity analysis and modality (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004) – are used to analyze the discursive constructions of universities and businesses in terms of experiential and interpersonal meaning.

The transitivity systems shed light on how experiential meaning is construed in discourse in terms of the participants, the actions and the circumstances. The actions are divided into six categories:

Material process: physical action;   
Mental process: mental, cognitive and emotional action;   
Behavioral process: acting out the emotion;   
Relational process: the act of being or having;   
Verbal process: verbal action;   
Existential process: the act of existing.

Modality refers to the interpersonal meaning construed in discourse in terms of:

the degree of confidence about the statement (epistemic modality); the obligation imposed on the addressee (deontic modality); and the volition or desire of the speakers (modality of inclination).

However, the process type classification in itself does not show whether universities convey their marketized identity and thus the analysis requires a more semantic oriented approach discourse. As such, I adopt the method used by Askehave (2007), which involves grouping the processes according to semantic categories first before looking at the selection of process type to construe the action. This method has an advantage in that the categories are more specific and meaningful in the context of recruitment discourse. The processes were first divided into actions that organizations are construed as performing and attributes that organizations are construed as being or having. The actions and attributes are then grouped according to the semantic domains to which they belong. After this semantic grouping, the analysis of process type categories according to the transitivity system and modality was conducted to find how the selection of process types influences the meaning of the statement. As will be shown here, job advertisements do manipulate process types and modality to enhance the positive meaning when it comes to promotional messages about employer organizations. Furthermore, other linguistic features related to the image construction and interpersonal meaning are investigated, namely, presupposition, politeness and lexis, which shows that universities are construed as business organizations in discourse.

# Representations of employers in academic and business job advertisements

This section reports on the analysis of the representation of employer organizations in academic and business job advertisements. First, the actions that employer organizations

are construed as performing are elaborated. After that attributes which employer organizations are construed as possessing are discussed.

# 1. Action

The analysis of actions that employer organizations are construed as performing shows a clear change in the university advertisements, from a tendency to reticence in the 1970s to willingness in 2010 to construct themselves as influential, entrepreneurial and enthusiastic. This portrayal of employer organizations makes academic job advertisements in 2010 promotional and persuasive. Business job advertisements on the other hand show less change, having been self-promotional since the 1970s. There are seven types of actions that employer organizations are construed as performing. These are:

Recruiting;   
Working;   
Promising work conditions;   
Financing;   
Developing/creating;   
Requiring;   
Urging contact;   
Others.

Examples of each category are shown below. At the end of each example there is a code identifying the job advert from which the excerpt is taken, with $\cdot _ { \mathrm { A } } ,$ standing for Academic and ‘B’ for Business. The first four digits are the year of the advertisement and the rest are the code used for each advertisement. Examples are drawn from all data sets wherever possible.

Others

(27) The Unit has just moved into a new building, the Wolfson Centre in the central university precinct (A1972 2) (28) The University of Oxford is introducing a new e-Recruitment system . . . (A2010 202)

It is apparent from these examples that three categories are inherently persuasive and promotional – promising work conditions, financing and developing/creating. When employer organizations are construed as offering a good work environment or career prospects, the job advertisements incentivize potential applicants to apply for a job. The financing category construes employer organizations as having abundant resources, thereby promoting the employer organizations while incentivizing potential applicants at the same time. The developing/creating category consists of words which construe employer organizations as growing or establishing themselves. The growth of an organization indicates its good prospects, financial strength and influence. This category is consequently self-promotional. Table 1 shows the frequency of each category across the four data sets to facilitate diachronic and synchronic comparisons. Here ‘A’ stands for academic job advertisements, whereas ‘B’ stands for business job advertisements. The numbers following ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent the year of job advertisements.

Table 1 shows an apparent trend whereby university discourse is increasingly aligned with business discourse in the following categories: recruiting, working, promising work conditions, developing/creating and requiring. The use in the A2010 adverts of the promising work conditions and developing/creating categories, which are inherently promotional, shows that academic job advertisements have become more promotional and aligned themselves with business job advertisements. Other categories of actions which show the alignment of university discourse with business discourse, namely, recruiting, working and requiring, do not seem inherently promotional on the surface. However, an investigation of the linguistic features within these categories indicates an attempt to appeal to potential applicants. In what follows, I expand on the analysis of linguistic features of the categories of recruiting, working and requiring.

Recruiting. When employer organizations are construed as recruiting, the linguistic features indicate that while academic job advertisements in the 1970s simply announce a job vacancy, academic job advertisements in 2010 and business job advertisements strive to sell the job to potential applicants. This can be seen from example 2 earlier, in which the phrase ‘seeking to appoint’ contains the modality of inclination ‘seeking to’. The use of modality of inclination portrays the enthusiasm of employers for a new member of staff. The comparison of phraseology used to frame the recruiting activity reveals a clear tendency in which academic job advertisements move towards business job advertisements, as shown in Table 2. Here capitals refer to a lemma, N refers to a noun and V refers to a verb related to recruiting. The number following each phrase is the frequency. Where a number is not provided, the phrase occurs only once.

From Table 2, it can be seen that while the 1970s academic job advertisements use only a few phrases to talk about the activity of recruiting, the 2010 academic job counterparts use a greater variety of phrases. In the business job data we see the opposite trend. In addition, the 2010 academic job adverts have more phrases which are identical to those in business job data than the 1970s academic job advertisements do. In the business job advertisements and the 2010 academic job advertisements, there are phrases which frame recruitment as an active search for a new member such as ‘BE $^ +$ looking for’ and ‘BE $^ +$ seeking’. Moreover, the use of modality of inclination can be observed in the phrase ‘BE $^ +$ looking to $+ \textrm { V }$ and ‘BE $^ +$ seeking to $+ \textrm { V }$ . Some job adverts phrase vacancies in evaluative terms, such as ‘an exciting opportunity’ (see Martin and White, 2005). The word ‘opportunity’ stresses that the vacancy is beneficial to potential applicants. These observations indicate that the 2010 academic job data are aligned with business job advertisements in that they accentuate their desire for a new member, whereas the 1970s academic job data do not do so.

Working. The words used to construe organizational work shows a noticeable change in how the work of universities is portrayed. In the academic job data, the work can be subdivided into five categories as follows:

Teaching;   
Research;   
Support services;   
Administration/management;   
Others.

Research and support services are more prominent in the 2010 academic job advertisements in comparison to the academic job advertisements from the 1970s. While the 1970s academic job advertisements use the word ‘teach’, the 2010 academic job advertisements paraphrases teaching as ‘work with ambitious students’ or ‘offering a wide range of programmes’. The latter conceptualizes teaching as offering services.

Requiring. The requiring category indicates that the 2010 academic advertisements and the business job advertisements from both periods mitigate the imposition of requirements in many ways – a practice which is absent from the 1970s academic job advertisements. For instance, in some cases academic and business job advertisements phrase requirements as preferences rather than as absolute obligations, as shown in the phrase ‘are keen to hear from’ and ‘welcoming’. The 2010 business job advertisements also use the phrase ‘we are looking for’ to state requirements. This phrase is identical to the one used to construe the employer as recruiting. This move can arguably blur the distinction between recruiting and requiring, and potential applicants might not feel an imposition posed on them. This strategy does not occur in the academic job advertisements. The mitigation of requirement can be viewed as an attempt to appeal to readers, adding further contributory effects on the discursive construction of employers as selling the job to potential applicants.

To summarize, the analysis of actions that employers in academic and business job advertisements are construed as performing clearly indicate that university discourse is increasingly aligned with business discourse. Specifically, self-promotion, which was already prevalent in business job advertisements in the 1970s, has become prominent in the 2010 academic job advertisements. The employers in the 2010 academic job advertisements are construed as performing actions that are inherently promotional using words that are business-oriented. The financing category conveys the financial strength of employers and presents universities as entrepreneurs. Even when referring to actions that are not inherently promotional, there are various linguistic features which are used to sell the job to potential applicants and reframe the job of academic institutions as service providers. Although differences still remain between academic and business job advertisements, there is a clear trajectory in which university discourse is moving towards business discourse.

# 2. Attributes

This section tracks changes in attributes that are ascribed to the employer organizations in the corpus. There are six categories of attributes as follows:

Part of organization/organizational classification;   
Credentials;   
Plan/mission/commitment;   
Equal opportunity;   
Legal status;   
Location;   
Others.

Examples of each category are shown below:

Others

(51) We are open from 08.30 to 18.00 . . . (A2010 1622).

The only category that is inherently self-promotional is credentials. However, as will be discussed below, other categories are also used to portray employers in a positive light. The frequency of each category is shown in Table 3.

From the table, it is clear that there is a steep rise in the instances of credentials in 2010 academic job advertisements, while credentials have been a defining feature of business job advertisements since the 1970s. Equal opportunity only appears in the 2010 job advertisements, probably because of changes in equal opportunity legislation. Location occurs in the 2010 academic job advertisements and the business job advertisements from both periods but not in the 1970s academic job advertisements. The legal status category occurs just once in the 2010 academic job advertisements but eight times in the 2010 business job advertisements. Plan/mission/commitment occurs more frequently in the 2010 academic job advertisements than in the other data sets. This category is associated with an aspiration and a sense of purpose of an organization. The higher frequency of this category in the 2010 academic job advertisements indicates their stronger emphasis on constructing an organizational identity as ambitious and purposeful. When mentioning work location, academic job advertisements describe it in a neutral way while business job advertisements leverage location to convey the strength of the employer organization. While equal opportunity is a legal requirement of every employer, advertisements in some cases frame it as an organizational culture that employers embrace or ‘value’ by its own volition. It could be argued that some of the advertisements use inclusive culture as a selling point.

Table 3. Frequency of attributes of employer organizations.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Attributes</td><td>A1970s</td><td>B1970s</td><td>A2010</td><td>B2010</td></tr><tr><td>Part of organization/organizational classification</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Credentials</td><td>3</td><td>39</td><td>54</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Plan/mission/commitments</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Equal opportunity</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>14</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Legal status</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>

As mentioned earlier, the attribute that clearly indicates self-promotion is credentials, which refers to various ways in which the strength of employer organizations is shown. The specific credentials which are utilized in academic and business job advertisements are shown in Table 4.

From the table, it can be seen that five categories are identical on both lists. Indeed, academic and business job advertisements use several similar points to describe themselves positively.

An interesting feature of this category is the use of different process types to convey and enhance the evaluative meaning of the credentials of employer organizations. Such a strategy intensifies the attitudinal meaning of a message. Often in the place where a relational process is arguably a more congruent form, advertisements use mental process or material process, which then personalizes employer organizations or increases the dynamism of the statement. Examples are given below:

(52) The Department of Architecture and Built Environment has an international reputation for its teaching and research . . . (A2010 1/1907)   
(53) The Geography Department at the University of Hull enjoys a growing international reputation for excellence in research and teaching . . . (A2010 1266)   
(54) . . . Winchester School of Art continues to build on its reputation for excellence and innovation (A2010 4/305)

In these examples, reputation is an attribute that the organization possesses. Example 52 uses a relational process ‘has’ which is the most congruent form. In example 53, the ‘Department’ ‘enjoys’ the ‘reputation’. ‘Enjoys’ connotes a positive attitudinal meaning, which in turn further enhances the positive meaning of having a reputation. In example 54, ‘build on’ is a material process and here it is a metaphor which conveys a sense of stability (Charteris-Black, 2004).

There are instances where universities and businesses are construed as phenomena being sensed by other sensers. This has an effect of attributing an emotional involvement to the senser in the clause, using other voices to make a promotional message about the organizations. Examples are offered below:

(55) Cranfield School of management has long been recognized as a leading centre of excellence for research and teaching in Finance and Accounting . . . (A2010 1/357) (56) The University attracts over 2,200 students ( $3 5 \%$ at postgraduate level . . . (A2010 1/1405)

In example 55, ‘Cranfield School of Management’ is construed as a phenomenon of the mental process ‘recognized’ and the senser is an unknown agent. The promotional message ‘a leading centre of excellence’ is a circumstantial adjunct, but this is in fact the quality that is being communicated. In this example then, the School attributes the claim to an unknown agent, presumably the public, to create an impression that the promotional message comes from an external body rather than itself.

In example 56, ‘the University’ is construed as a phenomenon of the mental process ‘attract’ while the senser is ‘students’. Here ‘students’ are construed as having a positive attitude towards ‘the University’. Therefore, the use of these words shows a strategic manipulation of process types to intensify positive evaluation and presupposes the self-promotional messages, making it more difficult to challenge.

There is a pattern that only appears in the academic job advertisements – the use of verbal process as shown in an example below. Here the advertisement uses a media source to portray the attribute of the university. In so doing, it strengthens the claim about the image of this university, making it more credible because it comes from an authoritative source rather than the university itself.

(57) A commitment to high quality . . . led the Times Higher Education to describe us as “elite” without being “elitist”. (A2010 1/437)

A pattern that only occurs in the business job advertisements is the self-promotional claim via positioning the company against the competitors, as in examples 58 and 59 below.

(58) We have shown our ability to draw level with the old-established well-known companies (1971 10)   
(59) They compete with the bulge-bracket banks. (B2010 0064)

These examples show an aggressive self-promotional strategy. The companies establish a competitor and claim that they are equally powerful. This strategy may be too aggressive to be adopted into university recruitment discourse.

# 3. Other linguistic features

This section discusses other linguistic features which are employed to enhance selfpromotional messages, mitigate imposition and re-conceptualize universities as business organizations, reflecting market ideology in university discourse. These are presupposition, politeness strategy and lexis associated with market ideology.

The use of presupposition in the 2010 academic job advertisements and business job advertisements serve to presuppose the credentials organizations, making them more difficult to challenge. Presupposition can be seen from the word ‘continue’ and the embedding of the promotional message in the non-finite clause in the thematic position as shown below.

(60) Brunel Business School continues to expand its research and consolidate its student numbers. (A2010 1519)   
(61) Santander in the UK is in a very strong position and continues to gain momentum (B2010 2617)   
(62) Building on existing institutional strengths, we are particularly interested in research leaders in . . . (A2010 1/120)   
(63) Acknowledged as one of the leaders in the leasing market, specializing in many kinds of large equipment, their rate of development & growth . . . (B1971 4)   
(64) Operating in over 20 countries, we’re ideally positioned to achieve . . . (B2010 0384)

The presupposition trigger ‘continues’ (Huang, 2007) in examples 60 and 61 presupposes that ‘Brunel Business School’ has been expanding its research and that ‘Santander’ has been gaining momentum and will go on doing so. Therefore, it adds another layer of meaning and in turn intensifies the self-promotional message. The use of ‘continue’ occurs twice in the 2010 academic job advertisements and once in the 2010 business job advertisements.

The embedding of processes with self-promotional meaning as a non-finite clause in the thematic position as in examples 62, 63 and 64 makes the statement taken for granted. This strategy makes the statement more difficult to challenge than when it is stated outright in a finite clause. The promotional message then becomes more powerful because it is given and not open to question. This linguistic feature occurs four times in the 2010 academic job advertisements, twice in the 1970s and four times in the 2010 business job advertisements. The frequency indicates a pattern in which university discourse aligns with business discourse.

Politeness strategies, found in the 2010 academic job advertisements, are used to mitigate requirements, a move which can arguably be motivated by sales motive. The two instances where politeness strategy is used are shown below.

(65) Due to recent government policy changes on immigration, we can only accept applications from Non EEA candidates who hold Tier 1 status . . . (A2010 1414)   
(66) Regrettably we are unable to consider applications from candidates who require . . (A2010 1472)

In these examples, the advertisements frame requirements as an inability as shown in ‘can only accept’ (example 65) and ‘are unable to’ (example 66). Example 65 also provides a reason as shown in ‘due to’. Example 66 sounds apologetic because of the word ‘regrettably’. Giving reason and apology are negative politeness strategy (Brown and Levinson, 1987), which shows deference to the hearers. Using politeness strategy, universities background their role as a gate keeper and try to appeal to potential applicants.

We now move on to the analysis of lexical items which reflect the market ideology in university discourse. These are ‘customer’, ‘investment’ and the phrase ‘has seen growth’. There are three instances in which ‘customers’ appear to be receivers of university services as shown in examples 67, 68 and 69 below. The use of the word ‘customers’ indicates a reconceptualization of staff and students as customers and as such the use of this word indicates an emerging trend in which universities explicitly construe students as customers in discourse.

(67) The Service Desk acts as the focal point for all ICT-related queries and requests from ICT’s customers (A2010 1622) (68) . . . yet also acts as the ‘face’ of ICT to its customer base (A2010 1622). (69) The Service Desk represents the interest of its customers. (A2010 1622)

The word ‘investment’, which is associated with business activities and has a profitoriented meaning, is used in the 2010 academic job advertisements in example 14, which is reproduced in example 70. It is also used in business job advertisements as shown in examples 15 and 16. By using this word, the university in question invites the reader to look on it as a business. This example is an instance of ‘interdiscursivity’ (Fairclough, 1992: 10), where university discourse is mixed with business discourse.

(70) LBS . . . has been focusing research investment within Business and Management (A2010 1/1575)

Another pattern I observed is the use of ‘has seen growth’ in the 2010 academic and business job advertisements. This phrase is used in academic job advertisements to implicitly frame students as sources of profits, thereby implicitly construing universities as profit oriented organizations. Examples are offered below:

(71) It has seen an unprecedented growth in PhD students with over 160 registered research students. (A2010 1519)   
(72) The FI Cash Management sales team has seen a period of extensive growth over the past 5 years . . . (B2010 2509)

To interpret this linguistic feature, I consult the British National Corpus (BNC) to see how ‘has seen’ is used and what is often talked about when ‘has seen’ collocates with growth. Searching in the BNC (Hoffman, 2013), the right collocates of ‘has seen’ with the span of three words to the right are overwhelmingly related to development and increase (‘increases’, ‘changes’, ‘growth’). When looking at instances where ‘growth’ collocates with ‘has seen’, five out of 11 instances are derived from the Informative: Commerce and Finance section of the BNC. In addition, seven out of 11 instances are deployed in the context of profits and sales volumes (concordances are given in the Appendix). Thus, I argue that in the academic job advertisements, the use of ‘has seen $^ +$ GROWTH’ to talk about student numbers implicitly construes students as entities that contribute to profit.

# Conclusion

This analysis of the discursive constructions of universities and businesses in recruitment discourse supports Fairclough’s (1993) hypothesis that university discourse is gradually being ‘colonized’ by business discourse. Universities and their institutional entities in 2010 are construed as performing actions and possessing attributes that are selfpromotional, resembling business job advertisements in the 1970s and 2010. Further analysis of modality and other linguistic features indicates that academic job advertisements in 2010 construe employers as being enthusiastic about potential applicants and as mitigating their requirements, thereby attempting to sell the job to potential applicants. Moreover, there have been changes in the way university work is construed, from ‘teaching’ to ‘offering services’ and in some cases ‘serving customers’.

The portrayal of students as customers has been problematized in many studies, including critical discourse ones. According to Koller (2004), customers are often conceptualized as territory to be fought over and occupied. Resonating with this work, Mautner (2010) argues that customers are subjected to mental manipulation by businesses. Consequently, the concept of customer is aggressive and should not be applied to students. Furthermore, while the conceptualization of students as customer has been argued to empower students (Barnett, 2011), an alternative view is that it disempowers them, rendering them passive receivers of knowledge (Williams, 2011).

In addition, the representation of universities as entrepreneurs and service providers is controversial. The profit motives that some business lexis such as ‘invest’ and the conceptualization of students as commodity from which profit is to be made are problematic. The profit-driven motivation entails some form of exploitation, which is not appropriate for universities – institutions that nurture and educate students. Such a discursive construction risks alienating staff and students who may feel that they are exploited.

The transfer of business ideology and discourse has led to a number of inappropriate representations of universities. This article argues that business discourse and ideology do not sit well with education institutions. Consequently, universities need to be more critical about the adoption of business discourse and ideology. Universities are academic institutions and should portray themselves accordingly.
