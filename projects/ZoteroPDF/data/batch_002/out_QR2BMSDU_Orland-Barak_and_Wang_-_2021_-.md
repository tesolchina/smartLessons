# Teacher Mentoring in Service of Preservice Teachers’ Learning to Teach: Conceptual Bases, Characteristics, and Challenges for Teacher Education Reform

Lily Orland-Barak1 and Jian Wang2\* iD

# Abstract

Preservice teacher education programs worldwide are increasingly becoming field based with student teaching as the capstone experience for preservice teacher learning in the program. Consequently, mentor teachers at field-placement program schools are bestowed with new and unique functions to support preservice teachers’ learning to teach, which calls for new conceptualizations of teacher mentoring approaches. This article critically examines the theoretical underpinnings of four existing approaches to teacher mentoring during student teaching, analyzes the focuses and practices associated with each approach, and identifies the major challenges that each approach faces in guiding preservice teachers to learn to teach as expected by the field based teacher education reforms. Finally, it proposes an integrated approach to teacher mentoring for field-based teacher education that transcends the four existing teacher mentoring approaches.

# Preservice Teacher Mentoring—A Challenged Terrain

The aforementioned assertion made by a preservice teacher who graduated from a teacher education program (Maskit & Orland-Barak, 2015) reflects a common sentiment of preservice teachers’ learning to teach experiences from different backgrounds, contexts, and programs. Indeed, preservice teachers learn to teach in their mentor teachers’ classrooms during student teaching has been regarded as a capstone experience in teacher education programs over the decades (Anderson & Stillman, 2013; Veenman, 1984; Wideen et al., 1998). Mentor teachers, also referred to as cooperating teachers, field-based teacher educators, or associated teacher educators, are frequently found to play the most influential role in preservice teachers’ learning to teach in their program (Clarke et al., 2014; Wang & Odell, 2002).

The centrality of student teaching component has grounded worldwide policy initiatives to promote more intensified, lengthened, and enriched field experiences for preservice teachers to learn to teach in real classrooms with the support of mentor teachers (Valencia et al., 2009). Some examples of those initiatives are as follows: the Blue Ribbon panel in the United State (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 2010), the National Curriculum Standards for Teacher Education in China (Han, 2012), and the Scottish Teachers for a New Era program (Livingston & Shiach, 2010).

These initiatives envision that teacher preparation programs need to be structured around student centered teaching practices aligned with reformed school curriculum standards to improve students’ academic performance regardless of their ethnic, cultural, social, and economic backgrounds (Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation, 2013). They hold field-based teacher preparation accountable for teaching practices that preservice teachers are expected to develop and consequently, for student learning outcomes that such teaching practices are expected to produce through accreditation and evaluation processes (Darling-Hammond, 2010).

Teacher education programs are called to intensify and lengthen student teaching experiences using various forms including professional development schools (Levin & Rock, 2003), community-based student teaching (Zeichner, 2002), year-long student teaching, fifth-year internship, and teacher residence programs (Wilson et al., 2002). In these forms, preservice teachers are intentionally and persistently engaged in examining and practicing the expected teaching in authentic classrooms seen as transferrable to other teaching contexts later (Burn & Mutton, 2015).

In these intensified, lengthened, and fully immersed field experiences, mentor teachers are bestowed with multiple yet often competing responsibilities to support preservice teachers to learn to teach effectively (Clarke et al., 2014; Edwards & Protheroe, 2003). They are expected to help preservice teachers learn how to connect what they learn from their program courses with what they do in their classrooms (Zeichner, 2010), assist preservice teachers to develop situated understandings of theoretical ideas acquired in their program courses (Chaliès et al., 2004; Margerum-Leys & Marx, 2004), and integrate their content and pedagogical knowledge and classroom management strategies acquired from the program coursework into teaching practices (Hashweh, 2013; Wilson, 2013) while managing the complex and dynamic character, norms, and demands of the workplace to sustain and create an optimal learning environment for their own students (Avalos, 2011; Carter & Francis, 2001). In addition, they need to help preservice teachers cope with the constant tensions between the beliefs and images of teaching that preservice teachers bring into student teaching, the program expectations for learning to teach in the field, and the values and norms of their own teaching practices in their school contexts (Opfer & Pedder, 2011).

Working in this complex and multifaceted scenario, mentor teachers recurrently report themselves juggling between competing expectations and conflicting directions of mentoring (Bullough & Draper, 2004; Wang, 2010). In such a situation, they are often forced to attend to emergent needs by following their intuition and anecdotal experiences instead of developing reasoned and informed mentoring practices based on appropriate understanding of the potentials and limitations of their own practice and careful consideration of other possible alternatives (Becher & Orland-Barak, 2016). To develop informed and reasoned mentoring practices that attend to the aforementioned complexities, a thorough understanding of existing teacher mentoring approaches is needed, including the theoretical assumptions, focuses, practices, and challenges that each approach encounters when adapted to the visions of field-based teacher preparation.

Thus, a comprehensive synthesis of predominant mentoring approaches in the literature can provide mentor teachers with a conceptual map that guides them to develop reasoned and informed mentoring practices in their differentiated classroom contexts (Feiman-Nemser, 2001a). Such a synthesis can also offer teacher education programs a useful guide to select and match schools and mentors with preservice teachers, develop a curriculum and strategies central to training and preparing mentor teachers and to offer scholars a conceptual base for further inquiry into teacher mentoring in the field based teacher education programs (Wang & Odell, 2007).

The article is developed to serve for the previously mentioned purposes and further develop an alternative framework for preservice teacher mentoring in several steps: First, we reviewed the position papers and general conceptual studies on teacher mentoring approaches which do not specifically differentiate between preservice, induction, and inservice mentoring approaches (Cochran-Smith, 1991; FeimanNemser & Parker, 1993; Grossman et al., 2009; Wang & Odell, 2002). Then, we synthesized the aforementioned literature into four major mentoring approaches based on the similarities and differences among the underlying assumptions and related mentoring practices of various teacher mentoring. Next, we searched and reviewed the empirical literature reviews on preservice teachers’ learning to teach (Anderson & Stillman, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; McIntyre et al., 1996; Veenman, 1984; Wideen et al., 1998) and additional empirical studies directly examining preservice teacher mentoring during student teaching to verify the four identified mentoring approaches. In this synthesis, we paid attention to the underlying assumption, mentoring focuses, practices empirically examined for each approach, and the challenges that each faces as it is adapted to the needs of the field-based teacher preparation. Finally, we proposed an integrated teacher mentoring framework including its assumptions, focuses, and exemplary based on our aforementioned synthesis.

# Four Approaches to Teacher Mentoring

Our synthesis of the relevant conceptual literature on teacher mentoring approaches and review of related empirical literature on preservice teacher mentoring during student teaching yielded four main approaches to preservice teacher mentoring. They are personal growth, situated learning, core practice, and critical transformative approaches as shown in Table 1 along with their assumptions, focuses, practices, and challenges for each.

# Personal Growth Mentoring Approach

Assumptions about teacher learning. A personal growth mentoring approach revolves around mentors’ support for preservice teachers’ personal growth and retention as teachers in the school system (Gold, 1990). It is grounded in humanistic psychology stressing the importance of attending to human beings’ personal growth and psychological well-being (Maslow, 1962; Rogers, 1982) and self-determination theory emphasizing the self as a central agent in human functioning (Ryan et al., 2013).

Three ideas of learning to teach lie at the core of this approach: First, psychological and emotional support is central to preservice teachers’ professional growth and the development of positive self-image as future teachers (Gold, 1996; Kelchtermans & Deketelaere, 2016). Second, preservice teachers’ professional growth is conceived as a staged process of development characterized by specific needs to be attended before moving to the next stage (Fuller, 1969). Third, their motivational beliefs, sense of efficacy, and identity related to teaching influence their ability to plan, organize, carry out teaching activities, and promote student learning (Beijaard et al., 2004; Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 2007). Thus, meaningful learning to teach will occur when preservice teachers can develop their own ideas about teaching, have autonomy to practice these ideas, and take initiative to improve their practice (Kemmis et al., 2014).

Mentoring focuses. A personal growth mentoring approach stresses the role of the mentor teacher as a counselor who is empathetic to the personal needs of preservice teachers (Israel et al., 2014), while assisting them in solving personal problems and becoming comfortable about teaching (Ganser, 1998). Mentors, thus, strive to create opportunities for preservice teachers to test their own ideas of teaching through trial and error while keeping a low profile in imposing their own ideas as expert teachers on preservice teachers (Harrison et al., 2005a). They also endeavor to establish positive and friendly relationships with preservice teachers, listen to their needs and feelings, and help them identify their own problems in learning to teach and develop their own solutions to these problems (Wang & Odell, 2002).

Practices examined. Personal growth mentoring practices are widely documented. For example, survey studies on teacher mentoring at preservice level (Hoffman et al., 2015; van Ginkel et al., 2016) reveal that offering positive support and sufficient space for preservice teachers to experiment with their own ideas and construct their own teaching practices are one of the most popular roles that mentor teachers assume in their mentoring practice. Studies on the interactions between mentor and preservice teacher (Hoffman et al., 1986; Rajuan et al., 2007; Väisänen et al., 2017) also suggest that preservice teachers tended to perceive their mentors’ emotional support as the most important characteristic of their mentoring relationships. In addition, mentor teachers following this approach often report the tensions between their understandings of what effective teaching entails and what their preservice teachers intended to experiment (Jaspers et al., 2014).

Perceived challenges. A personal growth mentoring approach faces three challenges as it is adapted to the needs of fieldbased teacher education programs. First, while offering ample opportunities for preservice teachers to experiment with their own ideas of teaching, what they practice in teaching may not always be consistent with those visions of teaching that the field-based teacher education reform promotes (Reeve & Pattison, 1996). For example, preservice teachers often enter their programs with rigid views about what and how minority students learn that are hard to eradicate (DeCastro-Ambrosetti & Cho, 2011). They are also less confident in their ability to influence the learning of students from diverse backgrounds (Paine, 1989; Shultz et al., 1996) and deal with individual differences while maintaining an orderly classroom environment (Weinstein, 1989, 1990). These rigid views and efficacious beliefs could present significant challenges for preservice teachers to develop culturally responsive instruction to support diverse student learning (Gay, 2000; Milner, 2010). Thus, it is reasonable to question whether a mentoring approach focusing predominantly on supporting preservice teachers to experiment with their own ideas of teaching will eventually lead them to develop the kind of teaching expected by the field-based teacher education reforms (Wang & Odell, 2007).

Second, mentor teachers’ emotional support plays an important role in helping preservice teachers reduce their stress and solve personal impasses in adjusting to the workplace (Hastings, 2008; Shoffner, 2009). However, such an emotional support alone might not be enough to help them develop specific contents and practices of teaching (Ball & Bass, 2001) useful for particular classrooms contexts (Putnam & Borko, 2000).

Finally, mentor teachers may also face challenges when evaluating preservice teachers’ learning as expected by fieldbased programs. Such a top-down evaluation is in a direct conflict with the central premise of personal growth mentoring that mentors should not impose predetermined criteria for evaluating preservice teachers’ learning to teach (Bradbury & Koballa, 2008; Harrison et al., 2005b).

# Situated Learning Mentoring Approach

Assumptions about teacher learning. A situated learning mentoring approach is rooted in a socially situated perspective on learning (Brown et al., 1989), which stresses the role of context in shaping what and how people learn and making one’s knowledge meaningful (Resnick, 1991). According to this perspective, knowledge development is first exhibited in the social plane and then internalized at the individual plane through one’s legitimate peripheral participation in the practice of a professional community (Edwards & Protheroe, 2003; Lave & Wenger, 1991).

Three specific ideas underlie the situated perspective on teacher learning. First, knowledge of effective teaching resides in the minds and actions of experienced teachers as tacit and unarticulated and thus, is hard to be accessed as discrete concepts and theories (Loughran, 2012). Second, meaningful teacher learning occurs through preservice teachers’ apprenticeship of observation of others’ teaching and reflection in and on their own practices (Hiebert et al., 2002; Hiebert & Morris, 2012). Thus, observing and learning with and from exemplary teachers in these contexts is central to acquiring and reproducing such teaching practices in their classrooms (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1999; Little, 1990; Smagorinsky & Barnes, 2014). Finally, knowledge of teaching is distributed across different resources, places, and participants in the contexts and cultures of teaching (Kelly, 2006; Putnam & Borko, 2000) and shaped by these contexts and cultures (Kardos et al., 2001; Wang, 2001). Thus, it is important for preservice teachers to be fully enculturated into the teaching settings where they had student teaching experience and become familiar with the relevant resources necessary for them to develop local knowledge and practices (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1999; Cochran-Smith & Paris, 1995).

Mentoring focuses. Following a situated learning approach, mentor teachers rely on their own experiences and expertise as teachers to socialize preservice teachers into the cultures and practices of teaching in the school contexts where preservice teachers learn to teach (Hoffman et al., 2015). To this end, mentor teachers need to engage preservice teachers in observing and modeling after their teaching with a focus on having them reproduce it in their classrooms (Clarke et al., 2014). Their interactions with preservice teachers are directive and evaluative and focus mostly on technical and procedural feedback (Hoffman et al., 2015).

Practices examined. Empirical studies examining the situated teacher mentoring practices point to several findings. Mentor teachers following this approach were found to see themselves as expert teachers exhibiting strong practical knowledge effective for student learning in their contexts (Scherer, 2001; Sternberg & Horvath, 1995). They were identified as able to demonstrate and model teaching practices in their classrooms and focus their mentoring on assisting preservice teachers to develop such knowledge and practices accordingly (Zanting et al., 2003). In addition, they were found to be able to co-teach with preservice teachers (Meijer et al., 2002) and offer direct suggestions and critique on preservice teachers’ instruction (Loughran, 2012). Furthermore, few studies (Feiman-Nemser & Parker, 1992; Wang & Odell, 2002) revealed that such mentor teachers are experienced local guides who are familiar with relevant resources and settings of teaching and can help preservice teachers develop local knowledge and practices in these contexts. Finally, case studies revealed that mentor teachers following this perspective often perceived the theoretical knowledge and ideas to which preservice teachers were exposed in their programs as not valuable in helping them develop local knowledge and teaching practices (Bullough & Draper, 2004; Wang, 2010).

Perceived challenges. A situated learning approach to teacher mentoring faces several challenges in the context of fieldbased teacher education reform. First, by stressing that knowledge for effective teaching as contextualized and situated in the particular contexts of teaching, it can become difficult to help preservice teachers to transfer and adapt the teaching that they developed in student teaching to the other teaching contexts where they may end up teaching (Forzani, 2014; McDonald et al., 2013). This can be problematic because the field-based teacher preparation aims at preparing preservice teachers with knowledge and practices that can be effectively generated in different contexts of teaching (Feiman-Nemser, 2001a; Grossman et al., 2009).

Second, by prioritizing an apprenticeship mode of acquiring and developing teaching knowledge and practice (Borko, 2004; Putnam & Borko, 2000), it backgrounds the role that theoretical knowledge and reasoning play in promoting preservice teachers’ learning to teach (Cochran-Smith et al., 2014; Zeichner, 2010). This can limit preservice teachers learning how to articulate theoretical, moral, and political dimensions of teaching practices in their classrooms (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1999), which is seen as necessary for reconstructing effective teaching practices in different contexts (Lampert & Graziani, 2009) and for reforming teaching for social justice purposes (Achinstein & Athanases, 2005; Silva & Tom, 2001).

Finally, an emphasis of mentoring on preservice teachers’ socialization into their local culture and contexts of teaching can be useful for them to reproduce the kinds of teaching in such contexts (Bradbury & Koballa, 2008; Wang, 2010). It may not be useful for them to learn to teach effectively as expected their program or as what preservice teachers think they have to learn (Cochran-Smith & Paris, 1995; Johnson & Birkeland, 2003).

# Core Practice Mentoring Approach

Assumptions about teacher learning. A core practice teacher mentoring approach draws on a behavioral-cognitive perspective on learning that stresses the importance of adapting learning from one context to another, provided that these contexts share similar workplace conditions (Anderson et al., 1996). Such a perspective is grounded in several ideas central to learning to teach in different teaching contexts (Grossman et al., 2009).

One idea is that preservice teachers need to develop core teaching practices effective for diverse teaching contexts (Grant et al., 1998; Hiebert & Morris, 2012) rather than limited to the specific context of teaching as suggested by the situated perspective on learning to teach (Putnam & Borko, 2000). Another idea is that to develop such teaching practices, teachers need to decompose core teaching practices to understand the connections among its components (Forzani, 2014) and its approximations to the present and future classroom contexts (McDonald et al., 2013). They also need to be actively engaged in modeling after and rehearse core teaching practices systematically with special attention to reconstructing them in different teaching contexts (Pianta & Hamre, 2009).

Mentoring focuses. Mentor teachers following this approach to mentoring focus on modeling core teaching practices for preservice teachers and actively engage them in observation and systematic rehearsal of such practices (Feiman-Nemser, 2001b). They also support preservice teachers to decompose core teaching practices with a focus on how different components of such practices deliver its intended functions and play out differently in diverse teaching contexts (Grossman et al., 2009). In addition, they co-plan and co-teach with preservice teachers around core teaching practices while attending to the principles and pedagogical reasoning underlying such practices (Harrison et al., 2005b). They also generate opportunities for preservice teachers to develop such core practices in different teaching contexts (Feiman-Nemser & Carver, 2012).

Practices examined. The empirical examination of core practice teacher mentoring is scarce, and the relevant studies are mostly case studies in nature that point to several findings. First, drawing on the analysis of interactions between mentors and preservice teachers, some cases (Barnett & Friedrichsen, 2015; Edwards-Groves, 2014; Wetzel et al., 2017) documented that mentor teachers following core practice mentoring often focus on helping preservice teachers develop knowledge of content-specific instructional strategies, students’ understanding of the content, and curriculum and assessment with attention to theory–practice relationships. Second, such mentor teachers were also found to have the competence in engaging preservice teachers in reflecting on core teaching practices (Clarke et al., 2014; Hoffman et al., 2015) and inquiring into the deep principles and assumptions underlying various aspects of teaching that cut across different teaching contexts (Richardson-Koehler, 1988). Third, with appropriate and focused training, mentor teachers could develop the skills necessary for engaging preservice teachers in analyzing core teaching practices (Crasborn et al., 2008; Hennissen et al., 2010) and in supporting them to analyze exemplary teaching practices with attention to the general principles underlying these practices (Feiman-Nemser, 2001b). However, the impact of this kind of mentoring on the development of preservice teachers’ core teaching practices is yet to be examined and documented (Anderson & Stillman, 2013).

Perceived challenges. Core practice teacher mentoring is regarded as being strongly consistent with the vision of fieldbased teacher education reform and potentially valuable for creating meaningful connections between what preservice teachers learn in their program courses and the practices they develop at school (McDonald et al., 2013; Zeichner, 2010). Still, it faces a few challenges when adapted in the fieldbased teacher preparation programs.

One challenge is that the underlying assumption that core teaching practices are generic and transferrable to different contexts of teaching conflicts with two well-established concepts of teaching, the notion of pedagogical content knowledge which presumes that teaching practices need be differentiated according to specific subject contents and concepts (Shulman, 1987) and the ideas of culturally responsive teaching, which assumes that teaching practices effective for student learning from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds and contexts need to be uniquely distinct (LadsonBillings, 1995). These conflicting notions may help create the confusion among mentor teachers as for which ideas to follow in their mentoring practices and deciding what teaching practices can be core practices transferable across different contexts, content areas, and student population (Anderson et al., 1996).

Second, although the principles of core teaching practices are conceptually sound, they have not been empirically sustained. Thus, they cannot be used as a set of proven core practices that mentor teachers rely on to help preservice teachers to acquire, test, and adapt to various school contexts (Sykes et al., 2010).

Related to the aforementioned fact, teacher education programs may not have sufficient mentor teachers who can conceptualize and enact core teaching practices and are competent to support preservice teachers in practicing, articulating, and adapting such practices to various school contexts (Hiebert & Grouws, 2007; Minner et al., 2010). These programs are often limited in terms of resources and situated understandings of what constitutes a core practice curriculum for preparing mentor teachers (Barnett & Friedrichsen, 2015; Edwards-Groves, 2014; Wetzel et al., 2017).

# Critical Transformative Mentoring Approach

Assumptions about teacher learning. Critical transformative mentoring approach derives from critical pedagogy (Freire, 1970; Giroux & McLaren, 1986; Kincheloe et al., 2000) which presumes that teachers should form the political and pedagogical forces through active, collaborative, and continuous critique and inquiry into teaching to generate their professional knowledge and practice necessary for improving student learning for social justice purposes (CochranSmith & Lytle, 2009). The following specific ideas ground the theoretical bases of this approach to teacher mentoring.

One is that, teaching knowledge and practice are inherently problematic and contribute to the reproduction of social inequality and injustice (Apple, 2011; McLaren & Farahmandpur, 2001; Sleeter & McLaren, 1995). Thus, what preservice teachers need to learn cannot be limited to their instrumental and immediate individual needs or those of the specific school contexts, and instead, they should develop a critical stance toward teaching and strive to reconceptualize their practice by working closely with other teachers in different contexts and relevant communities (Apple, 2011; Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009).

Furthermore, knowledge and sources of teaching are neither limited to research findings and codified propositions (Shulman, 1987) nor restricted to the taken-for-granted craft and contextualized experiences of exemplary teachers (Grimmett & Mackinnon, 1992). Instead, it should be generated through teachers’ systematic inquiry into teaching practices and reconstructed for social justice and equity goals (Noffke, 1997). Thus, preservice teachers need to be engaged in systematic action-research processes in and out of their own classroom through ongoing collection and analysis of multiple evidences (Anderson, 1989; Carr & Kemmis, 2003; Kincheloe, 2012).

Finally, effective teacher learning depends on their collaborative construction and reconstruction of teaching knowledge and practices with other teachers, teacher educators, and/or parents (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2012; Noffke, 1997). Such collaboration should address issues across different contexts and communities (Levin & Rock, 2003) and offer diverse ways to develop more comprehensive and deeper understandings of critical educational issues at stake (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009).

Mentoring focuses. Following the critical transformative mentoring approach, mentor teachers need to be committed to and competent in engaging preservice teachers in learning to teach against the grain (Cochran-Smith, 1991). They actively assist preservice teachers in raising problems for teaching practices of their own and others (Wang & Odell, 2002) and work as co-thinkers and co-learners with preservice teachers in learning to teach in their classroom contexts to address their students’ needs. In addition, they expose preservice teachers to alternative visions of teaching and use them as a base to describe, interpret, and enact teaching practices normally not consistent with existing cultures of teaching, their own schooling experiences, or those developed from their university courses (Achinstein & Barrett, 2004; Stanulis & Brondyk, 2013).

Practices examined. Critical transformative mentoring is a less popular practice in contexts of student teaching. For example, a survey with more than 700 mentor teachers from different professional backgrounds and geographic regions and schools (Clarke, 2005) found that most participants perceived their role as mentors to either offer emotional and nurturing support or transmitting knowledge and practices to preservice teachers. The role of mentors as critically transforming existing teaching practices was not even mentioned.

However, several case studies do demonstrate the promise of a critical transformative mentoring approach when appropriately supported by their programs and school administration. For example, mentor teachers are found to be able to form more bidirectional relationships with preservice teachers to develop teaching practices involving community learning in urban school contexts (Jacobs et al., 2006). They could also help preservice teachers critically reflect on their practices and propose alternative ideas to teach for social justice (Gardiner, 2011). In addition, mentor teachers and preservice teachers could also be involved in action-research projects to construct new understandings about diverse students’ needs, motivations, abilities, and achievements (Levin & Rock, 2003). Nevertheless, adhering to the critical transformative mentoring approach, mentor teachers were often found caught in the tensions between their task to foster social justice and teacher agency and their responsibility to be accountable for the curriculum and assessment standards dictated by policymakers (Cherian, 2007; Roegman et al., 2016).

Perceived challenges. Critical transformative mentoring offers the opportunity for preservice teachers to transform traditional teaching practices in the company of mentor teachers (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009). However, such an approach presents several challenges for the field-based teacher education reform initiatives.

First, it presumes that codified knowledge and practices of teaching are inherently problematic and need to be radically questioned and revamped (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009). This position may conflict with the idea of field-based teacher education reform that regards preservice teachers’ access to the accumulated experience of mentor teachers in their classrooms as a central source for learning to teach (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 2010).

Furthermore, when mentors and preservice teachers are engaged in challenging each other’s assumptions and practices, misunderstandings and distrusts between them can quickly develop (Sykes et al., 2010). These misunderstandings and distrusts can hamper their mutual engagement in collaborative inquiry central to this mentoring approach (Kennedy, 2010).

Finally, encouraging preservice teachers to constantly problematize their teaching and those of others might leave them in uncertainty long before they can identify alternative ideas, test their effectiveness, and implement them in their classrooms with certainty (Putnam & Borko, 2000; Sykes et al., 2010). It may also discourage mentor teachers from actively using their expertise of teaching as a base to support and assess preservice teachers’ learning to teach in their classroom.

# Toward Integrated Teacher Mentoring

By examining the four mentoring approaches, we argue that teacher mentoring in practice cannot be perfectly boxed into any one of them. Rather, it needs to draw on mentoring practices emanating from different approaches (Hudson, 2013), given that mentor teachers constantly juggle between multiple dimensions of their work with competing functions (Hall et al., 2008; Kwan & Lopez-Real, 2010). They may offer preservice teachers support to develop their own teaching practice while performing tasks as expected by their school contexts, which is further complicated by different values and images of teaching that preservice teachers bring into student teaching (Bullough & Draper, 2004; Fuller, 1969). These values and images are varied and shaped by their unique school experiences (Achinstein & Athanases, 2005; Ladson-Billings, 1995), cultures of teaching in their placement school (Kardos et al., 2001; Wang, 2001), and the kinds of knowledge and experiences developed in their programs (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 2009; Sykes et al., 2010).

Figure 1. Integrated mentoring of preservice teachers in practice

Thus, it is almost impossible for mentor teachers to separate their functions of emotional and contextualized support from their roles as co-thinkers or critical friends (Ambrosetti & Dekkers, 2010). Such a complexity invites the development of teacher mentoring that addresses the challenges associated with each existing mentoring approach when adapted to the needs of field-based teacher education.

To attend to such complexities of mentored learning to teach, a mentoring framework capitalizing the strengths of different approaches is necessary for developing preservice teachers’ learning to teach experiences as expected by the field-based teacher education. Here, we propose an integrated framework of teacher mentoring, including its assumptions, focuses, and exemplary practices as shown Figure 1.

# Assumptions and Focuses of Mentoring

Central to integrated teacher mentoring are diagnostic, deliberative, and inquiry skills and competencies for supporting preservice teachers’ learning to teach as expected by the field-based teacher education reform (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, 2010). Diagnostically, mentor teachers need to understand the differentiated trajectories of preservice teachers’ learning to teach and use this understanding to develop their profiles in terms of conceptions of learning and teaching, knowledge, competence, and personal needs in terms of teaching and learning to teach (Norman & Feiman-Nemser, 2005). These profiles can, then, be used to map their strengths and challenges and the areas of learning to teach that need to be improved (Wilson et al., 2017).

Deliberatively, mentor teachers need to be knowledgeable and competent in practicing the kind of teaching expected by the field based teacher education reform (Grossman et al., 2009), using various strategies rooted in different mentoring approaches (Hall et al., 2008; Kwan & Lopez-Real, 2010), and accessing appropriate school and classroom resources for preservice teachers’ learning to teach (Putnam & Borko, 2000). With this knowledge and competence as a base, they need to know how to flexibly select and prioritize different kinds of knowledge and strategies based on their diagnosis of preservice teachers’ differential trajectories of learning to teach (Feiman-Nemser, 2001a) and implement them to support their preservice teachers in learning to teach and to inform the professional of mentor teachers.

Integrated mentoring presumes that mentors need to constantly conduct systematic inquiries into their mentoring practices to identify strengths and limitations in their own mentoring knowledge and practice. These inquiries are especially necessary, as the existing knowledge and how-how of mentoring associated with the four existing mentoring approaches are limited in helping mentor teachers address the needs of mentoring as expected by the field-based teacher education reform. Thus, they support mentor teachers to develop their understanding and competence of teacher mentoring and the professional knowledge of teacher mentoring when the exiting knowledge and how-how are not effective or unavailable (Cochran-Smith & Lytle, 1999).

Overall, the integrated teacher mentoring required its mentors to be knowledgeable and competent in teaching and learning to teach as expected by the field-based teacher educating reform themselves. In addition, they need to be knowledgeable about the trajectories of preservice teachers’ learning to teach and use this understanding to identify areas of preservice teachers’ learning to teach in which their mentoring practices should focus diagnostically. Then, they need to be knowledgeable about different kinds of mentoring approaches and be competent in flexibly integrating the relevant mentoring strategies and know how to mentor their preservice teachers deliberatively. Finally, they need to be knowledgeable about how to examine the process and outcomes of their mentoring practices collaboratively with preservice teachers, teacher educators, and/or their colleagues to develop necessary knowledge and strategies for their mentoring practices as well as to contribute to the professional knowledge and know-how of integrated mentoring inquiry wise.

# Exemplary Mentoring Practice

How are the aforementioned diagnostic, deliberative, and inquiry skills and competencies enacted in integrated mentoring? Using a case selected from a larger data base of observations and interviews with mentors and preservice teachers in a school–university partnership teacher education program, we illustrate such integrated teacher mentoring.

Preservice and mentor teachers in the case. Daria was a secondary English preservice teacher from a teacher preparation program who demonstrated outstanding performance in her program coursework as expected by the program. For example, she exhibited a high sense of self-efficacy and an excellent command of content and pedagogical knowledge and theories of learning and teaching. She also demonstrated a strong competence in articulating, reflecting, theorizing, and critiquing what she learned from the program coursework orally and in writing.

Daria started her student teaching in an urban diverse high school in a well-established middle-class community that promotes community service and teacher agency and developed a successful partnership with the program over many years. She was placed for student teaching in the classroom of her mentor, Stacey, who was an experienced teacher in terms of practicing culturally responsive teaching aligned with the vision of the school and the program.

Through the school–university partnership, Stacey became experienced in developing positive relationships with preservice teachers by attending to their personal needs and assisting them in solving personal problems strongly associated with a personal growth approach to mentoring. In her mentoring, she would encourage preservice teachers to develop their own initiatives in learning to teach while keeping a low profile in imposing her own ideas on her preservice teachers and having them emulate her teaching practices in spite of her expertise in teaching as expected by the program.

Diagnosing Daria’s needs for development. Despite her academic success as a preservice teacher in her program coursework, Daria demonstrated a lower competence in classroom organization and teaching skills as expected by the program, as she moved into teaching in Stacey’s classroom. Her teaching was dominant with teacher-led discussions featuring teacher question–pupil answer, in which she was responsive only to a few students in the class. She also exhibited very limited ability to improvise for unplanned situations that required intervention, activate her students in creative thinking, and adjust her teaching to the diversity of student population. Of the above, Daria was not aware.

Drawing on her observation of Daria’s teaching and conversations with her, Stacey identified the gap between Daria’s strong competence in observing, conceptualizing, and critiquing teaching practices, her narrow focus in attending to students’ needs, and her limited competence in identifying emergent issues in class and improvising solutions to them. Such realization prompted Stacey to critically question whether her personal growth approach to mentoring was, indeed, effective in helping Daria to become aware of her learning to teach gap.

Deliberating and implementing integrated mentoring. In the process of assisting Daria to move forward toward the expected teaching practices, Stacey drew on her strong personal relationship with Daria and Daria’s strong competencies in observing, conceptualizing, and critiquing teaching practices. She started to engage Daria in conversations with questions that pushed her to think in context about her own teaching. Specifically, she highlighted instances in her teaching that evidenced both congruencies and incongruencies between her theoretical understandings and the teaching strategies. Then, she guided Daria to examine her teaching practices so that she could gain a more accurate and critical understanding of her teaching to identify the gape in her thinking about teaching and her actual practices as consistent with the critical transformative mentoring. Finally, Stacey encouraged Daria to develop some ideas to address the challenges that she faced in teaching and test these ideas in her teaching practices. In the cases when Daria ran short of ideas, she was not hesitated to offer alternative practices and demonstrated them for Daria to emulate as a situated mentor teacher often does.

In the aforementioned imperfect case, Stacey did not follow perfectly the kind of teacher mentoring approach that she preferred. To help Daria overcome her in learning to teach, Stacey diagnosed the issue of Daria’s learning to teach and engaged her in identifying it herself, drawing on her own strengths in learning to teach. Finally, she helped Daria address the issue and move her toward the kind of teaching as expected by deliberatively adopting mentoring strategies from different approaches including those that she did not commonly use.

# Perceived Challenges

Integrated teacher mentoring faces several challenges. One is how to effectively prepare mentor teachers with the appropriate knowledge and strategies from different mentoring approaches, given that each of them adheres to a different theoretical assumption about teacher learning and that entrenched ideologies are hard to change. This is especially the case considering that teacher education programs are traditionally limited in space, time, and resources (Wang & Odell, 2002; Zeichner, 2002).

Another challenge is how to support mentor teachers to think and perform adaptively and move flexibly across different mentoring contexts in mentoring preservice teachers (Achinstein & Athanases, 2005; Achinstein & Barrett, 2004). Specifically, how to help them cope with the tensions between preservice teachers’ idiosyncratic needs for learning to teach, mentors’ own tendencies to preserve familiar modes of practices, and professional demands on teacher learning and transformation.

Finally, integrated teacher mentoring is challenged to strike a balance between attending to the needs of preservice teachers’ learning to teach and those of students in the classrooms of student teaching (Wang & Odell, 2003). Keeping such a balance seems necessary, given the fact that mentor teachers need to help preservice teachers venture into the uncertainties of learning to teach by testing new ideas and experimenting alternative practices, in which failure and mistakes are often unavoidable outcomes (Sykes et al., 2010). At the same time, they have the moral and professional responsibility to help preservice teachers to use the reliable professional knowledge and practice with certainty to produce quality student learning outcomes in their classroom (Kennedy, 2010).

# Developing Integrated Mentoring Knowledge and Practice

Considering the knowledge base and specific know-how required to enact effective integrated mentoring has not yet been solidly established and reliably verified across different programs and teaching contexts, the traditional sense of teacher mentor preparation is not going to work. In such training, the experts offer workshop to mentor teachers regardless of their contexts and then, mentor teachers implement the ideas with limited ongoing support (Wang & Odell, 2002).

This situation invites a design-based research approach to preparing mentors to practice integrated mentoring as expected by the field based teacher education reform using integrated approach (Anderson & Shattuck, 2012). Following the design-based research, the development of integrated mentoring practices, professional knowledge and know-how of integrated mentoring, and actual mentoring practices need to be unified and situated in the mentoring contexts, in which continuous cycles of collaborative inquiries into the mentoring practices with teacher educators and preservice teachers are conducted (Beasley et al., 1996).

In particular, the theoretically assumed ideas of effective mentoring practices guides the design of mentoring interventions and the measure of preservice teachers’ learning to teach outcomes in student teaching. These interventions and outcome measurements are then implemented in the contexts of actual mentoring practices across different contexts along with a carefully planned data collection and analyses to examine the effects of mentoring practices on preservice teachers’ learning to teach in student teaching. The interventions and measures are then modified and implemented contiguously as informed by the results of previous round in an iterative manner to contribute to the knowledge base upon which the integrated mentoring policies, training curriculum, specific mentoring strategies can be reliably and continuously developed (Zinger et al., 2017).
