# Abstract

To what extent have postmodernism and research modalities which fundamentally question the notion of the objective researcher impacted on the production of Ph.D. theses in the humanities and social sciences? This paper examines the visual and verbal representations of the writerly self through the title pages, tables of contents and introductory chapters of a corpus of 20 recent Ph.D. theses in History and Sociology from an Australian university. While affirming the dominance of the topicbased thesis macrostructure in the social sciences and humanities, it subjects the topic-based thesis category to greater scrutiny, presenting a case for the emergence of a New Humanities Ph.D., marked by its construction of a reflexive self, unable to write with the classic detachment of positivism. The paper briefly considers the implications for disciplinarity and postgraduate pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

In 1998, in an article provocatively titled Monstrous knowledge: Doing Ph.Ds in the ‘new humanities,’ Hodge (1998, p. 113) asked ‘‘what might a doctoral thesis2 be like in the ‘New’ or ‘Postmodern’ Humanities?’’ For Hodge, the New Humanities represent a fundamental shift in knowledge construction under the influence of postmodernism that signals a questioning of the assumed relationship between discipline and knowledge, of the ‘‘systemyof disciplinary doctorates’’ (p. 114). New Humanities theses would typically be inter or trans-disciplinary, adopt a critical perspective, be self-reflexive, ‘‘unstable’’ (p. 122) or hybrid and be informed by an awareness of the role of discourse in constructing knowledge. They would tend to be experimental in form and ‘‘break with the modernist values of realism, transparency of text, linear logic, [and] purity of genres’’ (p. 123). Hodge predicted that ‘‘a reasonably high proportion of doctorates in the humanities and social sciences commenced or completed in the next five years will [sic] be broadly in the ‘New Humanities’ area’’ (p. 126).

The implications of both the postmodern turn and of the impact of qualitative methodologies for research writing have been considered by other writers. Richardson (2000) conceptualises writing as a method of inquiry (author’s emphasis), arguing that postmodernism has affected all disciplines in that boundaries are regularly broken and knowledge is ‘‘partial, local [and] historical’’ (p. 218). In Richardson’s terms, qualitative researchers can ‘‘eschew the questionable metanarrative of scientific objectivity and still have plenty to say as situated speakers, subjectivities engaged in knowing/telling about the world as they perceive it’’ (p. 518). How then to represent and position him or herself textually in relation to subjectivity, authority, authorship and reflexivity becomes one of the key issues confronting the postmodern writer (p. 520).

Drawing on the characterisations of Richardson and others of qualitative research, Belcher and Hirvela (2005), in a study of the challenges faced by L2 writers who choose to write a qualitative dissertation, further identify the qualitative thesis genre as both underresearched and ‘‘ill defined’’ and ‘‘fuzzy’’ (p. 3).

Turner’s (2003) case study of a student writing a Ph.D. thesis in what she refers to as the ‘‘contemporary humanities,’’ identifies a cluster of analytic tools including psychoanalysis, postcolonial theory, poststructuralism, critical theory, performance and feminist theorising that would locate a thesis within the contemporary humanities rather than its adherence to the humanities per se or to specific disciplines. The employ of theorists such as Foucault, Derrida, Lacan, Deleuze, Guattari, Habermas, Benjamin would also situate the thesis within the contemporary humanities as would what she calls the contestation of the ‘‘epistemic subject.’’ In other words, these theses challenge the traditional depiction of the researcher as scientific, rational and objective and construct the researcher as operating in a much more subjective or intersubjective mode—as constructed, at least in part, in and by the text (and the research process) itself. The contemporary humanities writer’s use of the first person pronoun, $I ,$ which is a characteristic of many of these theses, should therefore not be seen simply as a feature of informal language (see Chang & Swales, 1999) but as standing for an ‘‘embodied’’ rather than the ideal, rational subject of positivist research (Turner, 2003, p. 39).

Our paper attempts to respond to Hodge’s question. We draw on Paltridge’s (2002) identification of thesis macrostructures to examine the title and contents pages and the introductory chapters of a corpus of 20 recently completed Sociology and History Ph.D. theses at an Australian university. While affirming the dominance of the topic-based thesis in the social sciences and humanities, we subject Paltridge’s topic-based thesis category to greater scrutiny and present a case for the emergence of a New Humanities Ph.D., marked by its construction of a reflexive self, unable to write with the classic detachment of positivism. We briefly consider the implications for disciplinarity and postgraduate pedagogy.

# 2. Ph.D. thesis macrostructure

Despite some recent research (Bunton, 1998, 1999, 2002; Dong, 1996; Dudley-Evans, 1999; Johns & Swales, 2002; Paltridge, 2002; Starfield, 2003, 2004; Swales, 2004; Thompson, 1999), the claim that the doctoral thesis genre is a ‘‘neglected’’ area of linguistic research remains a reasonable one. One of the few areas which have been researched to some extent is the thesis macrostructure (Bunton, 1998; Paltridge, 2002; Thompson, 1999). Paltridge (2002) identifies three basic thesis types3 which occur across a range of disciplines. These are outlined in Table 1.

These thesis types were also identified in both Bunton’s and Thompson’s studies of thesis macrostructure in the Social Sciences, Humanities and Science and Technology fields. In terms of our study, which focuses solely on Ph.D. theses in two disciplines, it is perhaps more useful to look at the macrostructures of only the Ph.D. theses in the previous research. Table 2 attempts to demonstrate the relationship between thesis type and broad disciplinary field in the three studies reported on above, considering only the Ph.D. thesis macrostructure, based on the available data. It is difficult to draw conclusions from the data as the numbers are small, discipline and faculty are at times conflated, and we lack information as to the methodological and theoretical approaches adopted in particular theses. For example, Paltridge mentions that he found different thesis types within Architecture but we do not know whether there is a relationship between thesis type and the subfields that make up Architecture or whether the Ph.D. theses in Medicine adopted quantitative or qualitative approaches. Bunton’s (1998) corpus was drawn from six faculties but in his analysis of thesis macrostructure, Science, Engineering and Medicine are grouped together as Science and Technology while Arts, Social Sciences and Education are grouped as Humanities and Social Sciences.

Table 2 PhDs only by discipline and type in 3 studies   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Arts/Humanities/Social Science</td><td colspan="4">Science and Technology/Architecture/Medicine</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Simple</td><td>Complex</td><td>Topic</td><td>Simple</td><td>Complex</td><td>Topic</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Paltridge</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Thompson</td><td></td><td></td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td></td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Bunton</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td></td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>17</td><td>2</td><td>41</td></tr></table></body></html>

Our table therefore makes what may appear to be fairly arbitrary and broad distinctions between Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities on the one hand and Science, Technology, Architecture and Medicine on the other. Paltridge’s one Economics Ph.D. and Thompson’s six Agricultural Economics Ph.Ds are included under the social sciences while Agricultural Botany falls under the sciences, although as Thompson (1999) explains, these are two schools within the same faculty, illustrating again the problematic alignment of faculty, discipline and thesis type. We can, however, note the small number of topicbased Ph.D. theses in the Sciences broadly defined and the larger number of complextraditional theses across this area, as compared to the larger number of what broadly appear to be topic-based theses in the Humanities/Social Sciences’ grouping, based on the macrostructure as identified in the table of contents of the thesis. Paltridge claims there is no necessary correlation between discipline and thesis type, while Swales (2004, p. 110) suggests that subfield may emerge as a strong determining factor as may theoretical or methodological approaches. Clearly there is a need for further investigation of the relationship between thesis type and disciplinary field or subfield.

Interestingly, while noting the impact of the New Humanities on the changing nature of research theses, Paltridge suggests that the topic-based thesis is ‘‘not all that new’’ (p. 135) as an example in his corpus dates from 1978. It is our contention that the topic-based categorisation has been based on a formalistic assignment which has not taken into account the identity choices writers make as they align themselves with particular theoretical and methodological positions and how these choices are manifested in title pages, tables of contents and thesis introductions. In the sections we examine in this paper, the disciplinary differences between the Humanities and the Social Sciences in doctoral theses as observed by Parry (1998) can be seen to blur, allowing for the identification of the topic-based New Humanities thesis shaped by the researcher/writer’s decision not to position him or herself as the ‘‘detached, positivistic, classical sociologist’’ alluded to in the title of our paper.

# 3. Self and structure in Ph.D. theses

What might be described as apparently trivial features of the thesis, the title pages, the table of contents and their typography are, we would argue, already sites of identity negotiation where the writer begins to align him or herself with a research tradition.4 While the title and contents pages are finalised as one of the last aspects in the production of the thesis, they are presented as one of the first aspects the reader encounters. The contents pages present an obvious overview of the thesis structure, and so act as an initial guide for the reader and as such act metadiscoursally (Bunton, 1999; Swales, 1990, 2004). The metadiscursive functions of the contents pages can be seen as textual and interpersonal (Hyland & Tse, 2004), or ideational, as they simultaneously overview the text macrostructure and begin to construct and negotiate an identity for the writer, and a location for the writer and his/her thesis within a research culture. We can clearly see, for instance, whether the Sociology students align themselves with one branch of the discipline or another. Again, this identity is produced from the totality of the research process, including all the reading, research, and writing the candidate has undertaken, but it begins to be presented in the contents pages, for the reader (examiner) to recognise, and accept or reject as a valid contribution to a research culture.

We would argue that both tables of contents and thesis introductions are to a large extent metadiscoursal in their function. In all but two of the theses in our corpus for example, the introduction chapter stood outside of the numbering system—in other words, it was not Chapter One but could be understood to be playing an overall organisational role in the thesis as a whole (see Figs. $\mathsf { A l b } ^ { 5 }$ and A1d for examples of this). Moreover the overall metadiscoursal role played by both table of contents and thesis introduction seems tacitly acknowledged by the experienced examiners interviewed by Mullins and Kiley (2002) who reported that they tended to read these first (along with the conclusion and references) to ‘‘gauge the scope of the work,’’ prior to reading the entire thesis ‘‘from cover to cover’’ (p. 376). While the contents pages give some glimpse into the identity, structure, and nature of a thesis, these features are of course constructed through the entire text. In particular, the introduction, conventionally a separate chapter, is the first substantive textual construal of identity, and the first substantive indication of the remaining structure of the thesis.

# 3.1. Topic-based theses revisited

Our corpus (see Table 3) differs from those previously studied in that it is exclusively drawn from Arts and Social Sciences, specifically from the disciplines of History and Sociology, and contains only Ph.D. theses. History and Sociology were chosen for our study as they can be seen to typify the Humanities and Social Sciences, respectively. The 20 Ph.D. theses in our corpus, 10 from Sociology and 10 from History, were submitted between 1998 and 2002 at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and selected from a list of recently submitted Ph.Ds supplied by the respective schools. A successful Ph.D. was considered simply to be one deposited in the UNSW library as this conferred faculty recognition on it as a successful exemplar of the Ph.D. thesis genre. The language backgrounds of the writers were not known to us and therefore not a criterion for selection.

Table 3 Variation in thesis type according to discipline (current study)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline</td><td>Complex traditional</td><td>Topic based</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Sociologye</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>History</td><td></td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr></table></body></html>

Through an examination of the tables of contents of the theses, their layout and content, the theses in the current study were classified into the thesis types as discussed above. The results are summarised in Table 3. The theses examined in our study were found to use either the macrostructures of the complex-traditional or the topic-based types. All of the History theses favoured a topic-based format. Within the Sociology theses, only two were of the complex traditional type, the remaining eight being topic-based, consistent with the findings of the previous research (see Table 3).

An examination of the topic-based category reveals that while superficially these theses may appear to belong to the same category, closer analysis reveals additional distinctions that allow us to locate some of our corpus as belonging to the New Humanities. On the other hand, several of the History theses which appear topic-based through their choice of title and chapter layout, on closer examination are not New Humanities in nature but seem to belong to a tradition of more narrative-chronological structuring. For example, a biographical thesis from History (Fig. A1a), is topic-based in appearance but has a chronological, linear, literal structuring (see Fig. A1b) quite distinct from that of history making/making histories (Figs. A1c and d), also topic-based in appearance and from History but located, via its playful title, chapter titles and several other features, on which we elaborate below, within the New Humanities.

A simple scan of the thesis title and chapter titles in the contents page begins to establish an identity for the thesis itself: the reader’s expectations for the thesis, ‘‘Being somewhere: young homeless people in inner-city Sydney’’ (see Fig. A1h) will be very different to their expectations for ‘‘A socio-cultural analysis of sexual risk and disease in a developing countryy’’ (Fig. A1e). These expectations are not just about content, but about the overall approach to research adopted in the thesis, and its overall research paradigm. In fact, the thesis and chapter titles in our corpus can be placed along a continuum, from the literal and descriptive at one end, to the metaphorical and self-reflexive at the other, where language is used in an overtly creative way to evoke a range of associations. Examples of each of these groupings are illustrated in Table 4.

As would be expected, the complex-traditional thesis type, being closer to the more social scientific research paradigm, tends to use literal, descriptive titles for both thesis and chapters, with perhaps some indication of an overarching theme, such as ‘‘Challenges and Risks:y’’ (see Fig. A1e). In the topic-based theses there is more metaphorical play but even here there is wide variation in the overall style of thesis and chapter titles with those that seem closer to the New Humanities tending toward the more metaphorical and the topic-based yet more traditional theses tending towards the more literal. The theses that we identify as being topic-based New Humanities theses also distinguish themselves from the more traditional theses in the regular use of the gerund in both thesis title and chapter headings and sub-headings, for example ‘‘grieving home’’ (see Fig. A1h), implying a subject of the action, whether researcher or researched or some combination of the two, compared to the impersonal nominalisation of ‘‘Work, Modernisation and Sociological Imagination.’’ Similarly, we note greater use of alliteration, word play and cryptic chapter and subsection headings that are not immediately self-explanatory (see Fig. A1h for example).

Alongside this stylistic variation in thesis titles is enormous variation in typography and layout. No two theses in the sample used the same conventions for layout, numbering, font type or font size. Again however, a continuum can be seen, ranging from more conventional practices with traditional fonts (such as Times), conventional orthography and punctuation, numerical marking of chapters, sections and subsections (2, 2.1, 2.1.1, etc.), to contemporary fonts (such as Chicago), unconventional orthography and punctuation, and bullet points or a complete absence of numbers to indicate chapters, sections and subsections (see Figs. A1a–h for examples). These features, while related to presentation and therefore, in some respects, trivial, are nevertheless part of the inscribed materiality of the thesis (Kress & van Leeuwen, 1996), and as part of the design and production processes, add important layers of meaning to the overall product (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2000).

Four theses in our corpus, that is, theses H10, S6, S3, S7, played extensively with conventional presentations of the title page and table of contents in some identifiable way. Following Halliday and Matthiessen’s (2004) description of the three metafunctions in language, these visual manipulations were either ideational (representational resources); interpersonal (interactional resources); or textual (organizational resources). For example, texts which used hyphenation of lexical items which are not normally hyphenated (such as ‘‘Re-cognising power’’ in Thesis S2), which used gerund forms (such as ‘‘Being somewhere’’ in Thesis S7), or which used other forms of word play, such as metaphors or puns, were identified as playing with representational resources. The devices mentioned draw attention to the content that is being constructed. Similarly, devices such as marked highlighting of a heading (such as an especially large font size or bolding of the font) were identified as playing with both textual and interpersonal resources. Textual because such a change in font size or use of bolding makes the specified content more salient (Kress & van Leeuwen, 1996), and interpersonal because it amplifies the writer’s interactional stance (Martin & Rose, 2003). In contrast, two other theses (S1 and S5) exhibited no innovative manipulation of resources in either the title or contents page (and were the only theses in the corpus to be so conventional). The others, however, may have exhibited one instance of play—perhaps a contemporary font, or an enlarged font size to indicate emphasis, but without the multiple variations in practice exhibited at the right-hand end of the continuum. Between these extremes, the remaining theses all demonstrated some degree of novelty in presentation, indicating that this is a widespread trend. Importantly, however, all the theses, including the most radical, still presented recognizable title pages and tables of contents from Ph.D. theses; none were so radical that they had departed from the conventions of the genre completely. But the fact that the majority of theses played with these resources in some way, indicates an awareness on the part of the writers that these resources are not neutral but themselves contribute to meaningmaking in terms of the thesis as a whole, and it is here that we begin to see the emergence of their identity as writers. This variation contributes to the distribution of theses, as presented in Table 5 where an association is made between thesis structure and disciplinarity.

Table 5 Thesis types and disciplinarity reconsidered

The presentation of the thesis is therefore itself an act of meaning-making and identity negotiation. The writers are choosing a form of presentation which they believe to be appropriate to their thesis in relation to their discipline. It also suggests that the institutional genre of the doctoral thesis, even within a given discipline, is open to considerable negotiation. Certain marked choices situate the thesis within what can broadly be called the New Humanities and not all topic-based theses are New Humanities.

In the next section of our paper, we pursue our examination of identity negotiation and, through an analysis of the writer’s use of the first person pronoun, suggest further ways in which the ‘non-detached’ writerly self is depicted in the New Humanities research thesis.

# 3.2. Introducing the self

No doubt under the influence of our subject matter, we have allowed ourselves a postmodernist word play in the title of this section of our paper in which we give consideration to the presentation of self in the introductory chapters of the History and Sociology theses in our corpus and relate this to the thesis macrostructure.

While ideational, interpersonal and textual choices are embedded (and embodied) in the look and structure of the title pages and tables of contents, and begin to allow us a preliminary identification of the New Humanities thesis, it is the introductory chapters of the theses in our corpus which, through the constitution of an embodied and reflexive writerly self (Ivanicˇ , 1998), more clearly distinguish the contemporary or New Humanities thesis. The epistemic subject of the New Humanities thesis is the qualitative researcher who can no longer write with the positivistic detachment of the classical sociologist but ‘‘bears social, historical, socialised and biographical characteristics and who interacts and intervenes in his or her research objects’’ (Breuer & Roth, 2003, paragraph 13, authors’ emphasis).

The constitution of the writerly self in academic writing has recently become a focus of interest, itself influenced by insights from postmodernist thinking about the constitutive nature of discourse in shaping the self in discourse (Ivanicˇ , 1998; Tang & Johns, 1999). Ivanicˇ ’s multi-faceted conceptualisation of writer identity comprises elements of an autobiographical self, a discoursal or textual self created in the process of writing and an authorial self whose voice is more or less authoritative. In academic writing, these three elements interact, in the act of writing, with the institutionally available subject positions or ‘‘possibilities for self-hood’’ (p. 27) as the writer negotiates a writerly identity that aligns to a greater or lesser extent with disciplinary conventions.

It is perhaps not surprising that in the postmodernist moment there has been a growing acknowledgement that academic writing is not as impersonal and objective as writing manuals would have had us believe, and that academic writers are situated and located within communities. Academic writing is seen as inhabited by the presence of the writer and of other writers with whom he or she is in dialogue; studies that seek traces of the writer’s persona in the text (e.g., Hyland, 2002a) have led to recent interest in the use of the first person in academic writing. While the use of $I$ is seen to signal a more ‘‘voiced’’ or authored text (Hyland, 2002b), there is an acknowledgement that uses of the first person pronoun differ as to rhetorical function.

Several writers have examined the use of personal pronouns in the academic essays of undergraduate students (Hyland, 2002a; Tang & Johns, 1999), with Hyland comparing the student use with that of experienced writers of journal articles. Harwood (2005) compared master’s students’ employment of the first person pronoun with that in a corpus of published journal articles within a specific disciplinary context. The previously identified representations of the writerly self are characterised as being more or less authoritative and are listed in Fig. 1.

To date, however, no one has considered the role of the first person pronoun in the Ph.D. thesis in terms of identity construction. Our framework draws on Hyland, Tang and

![](img/80dd097ba530b17dce93e420a6759ff9750475e45fa2da642be8e979d96f5ef6.jpg)  
Least authoritative

Johns and Harwood to distinguish the uses of $I$ in our corpus and to argue for the identification of a previously unreported use which is found solely in the New Humanities theses in our corpus. These thesis writers create a powerful textual self that draws its authority through its explicit attention to autobiography and the use of $I$ to locate the writer as subject within the research process. We have called this reflexive $I$ and elaborate on it in (3.2.5) below.

First, some general observations about the use of $I$ , in the introductory chapters of our corpus. The two complex traditional Sociology theses contain no instance of $I .$ This is perhaps not surprising, for as we stated earlier, they bear resemblance to the social scientific model in their overall layout and methodological framework. More surprising perhaps is the realisation that three of the History theses and one of the Sociology theses contain no uses of $I .$ They are all topic-based in appearance (see Table 3) but, as pointed out earlier, topic-based and New Humanities are not homologous. The remaining theses in our corpus vary significantly in the use of $I _ { \ast }$ , with four History theses having fewer than five instances while the remaining ten theses each contain fifteen or more uses of $I$ , some having over 30 instances. While many of these instances can be categorised in terms of the existing typologies (see below), the embodied $I$ of the New Humanities theses is distinctive.6

# 3.2.1. I as the guide or architect to structure the discourse and state the writer’s purpose

Drawing on specific evidence from NSW in the period up to the outbreak of the Second World War, I want to explore the ways in which gendered differences were articulated in medicine. I am equally interested to discover who articulated these differences, when, and to what effect. Ultimately, I aim to investigate how medical women of that era imagined their world and their roles in it. (H5)

Rather, $I$ have structured my thesis around a number of key themes in the historiography of women in medicine. I also suggest ways to identify the women’s motivations for becoming doctors. (H2)

In the first part, I analyse and discuss the relationship between some contemporary, pessimistic sociological views about work and earlier classical sociological statements about work and modernisation. (S10)

# 3.2.2. Methodological I—explains what was done (as researcher)

As the above discussion suggests, I approach this problem by combining a critique of the dominant market orthodoxy and liberal elite-centred histories with an examination of the politics of domination and resistance. (H1)

At the same time, I finalised the design of an open-ended interview schedule which was to maximise the reflexivity of respondents (see Appendix A6). As is usual in open-ended interviews, I planned to allow the answers of the interviewee to direct the flow of the interview, rather than maintaining a strict adherence to the written questions. This means that though on each occasion I covered all of the areas of the original interview schedule in each interview, the order of questions and indeed, some follow up questions which emerged as relevant from the responses of some interviewees, resulted in a degree of variability from interview to interview. A small number of interviewees insisted on confidentiality, and I have taken such ethical considerations into account in how I have utilised the interview material throughout the thesis. (S8)

As a qualitative study designed to focus on both young people’s use and experience of place, the methodology and research methods reflect the importance of a careful process of entering into young homeless people’s life worlds. Initially, I began the research with an introduction to the field through participating in street outreach for the inner-city homeless population and in street outreach aimed at young female sex workers in Darlinghurst and Kings Cross. (S7)

# 3.2.3. I as opinion holder—I think/believe/assume

As I go on to observe, the standard of historical work in medical history varies widely’ (H5)

This is no doubt related to the difficulties attached to Marxist-based critiques, in which work has particular categorical and empirical significance.7 But it is also related, I think, to deeper, long-held assumptions about the relationship between work and modernisation that have informed the sociological imagination. (S10) In the end, I am unable to do more than make the suggestion, presenting the evidence to hand, and leaving it to others to form their own judgments—and perhaps be inspired to continue the search. (H3)

I have attempted to provide a ‘road map’ of immigrants’ relation to the Australian social security system. This ‘map’ contains, I believe, some of the most critical signposts that provide us: (a) with an understanding of the evolution of Australian citizenship and social security and their linkages so far; and (b) these signposts may be able to help us deal with the road ahead. (S4)

# 3.2.4. I as originator—claim maker

In the first chapter, I demonstrate the importance of the assumptions I have discussed above in the context of the legacies of Marx, Weber and Durkheim. (S10)

I show how an emergent labour pacifist critique affected the direction and outcomes of the post-war campaign. (H2)

Following Stuart Hall though, I would argue that globalisation (or for that matter, ‘Americanisation’) cannot be equated with homogenisation. (H10)

Thus, in this thesis I critique dominant understandings of power that are based upon a repressive model which assumes that power is exercised by an exclusive group for the purposes of repression. I argue that Foucault’s rigorous critique of the repressive hypothesis can be read as a comprehensive account of power’s complex ontology. (S2)

# 3.2.5. Reflexive I

Gradations of reflexivity and narrativity impact on the autobiographical extent of the self. Where this self is present, it is typically in the opening pages of the introduction as the story of the thesis’ origin is foregrounded. In the extracts below, this is explicit—the opening narrative voice frames the central question of the thesis:

A brief overview of developments in the last decade related to the processes which result in people becoming refugees begins the story around which I formulate the central problem of this thesis. I ask: how can we best ensure a balance between the protection obligations which those claiming asylum seek to engage, and the local needs and interests within societies which are asylum destinations? yMy personal experience of immigration and integration into a new society were no doubt also of influence in formulating this topic. yThe countries under consideration were chosen partly for personal reasons, as I have lived in both countries and am fluent in both German and English, and also as they are representative of ‘most different’ models of asylum host countries. (S8)

Reading about this incident in the initial stages of research for my doctoral thesis left an indelible impression on me. I wondered why someone like Mary Bennett and the papers she had collected were considered such a threat to the state as to be hastily and somewhat furtively banished, ensuring the death of her legacy as well. I had not intended to focus particularly on her, indeed $I$ came across the details of this event in the papers of Jessie Street. But she was becoming more and more central as $I$ tried to trace white women’s relationship to questions of race, and more particularly to Aborigines and Aboriginal issues. What was fascinating about this discovery was that it confirmed what $I$ had suspected about Mary Bennett. I was aware of the papers in the Battye Library relating to her slavery allegations in the 1930s, which had been cited in feminist documentary compilations. yIt was in this context that $I$ became more intrigued by these white women’s campaigns, about the contemporary feminist analysis and the relationship between the two. (H2)

How the nature of the research and the research process itself, the situatedness of the researcher can (and must) shape the choices the writer makes as to authorial self is clearly evident in this reflexive passage from the Sociology thesis from which our title was drawn. Reflexive as to self and reflexive as to the act of writing itself:

The writing of this thesis was a process that $I$ could not explore with the positivistic detachment of the classical sociologist. After all $I$ was affected by the repression, the exile and the mutations within Chilean society as much as anyone else in the country. As an activist of the Chilean left, $I$ was an active participant in that collective constitution of the political opposition and protest movement that challenged the regime in the early 80s. For the same reason I could not write a thesis about others’ displacement and subjectivity without talking about my own. (S3)

The social and political location of the researcher is articulated as requirement, necessitating the presentation of an autobiographical self which is intimately imbricated in the research process:

I believe that my position as both researcher of gay men’s lives, and as active participant in the gay community life that $I$ have been investigating, require that $I$ interrogate and clearly articulate my own position and perspective on these. I will discuss the place of the researcher in relation to the research subject, as well as provide a biographical account of how I came to do the work I do. (S6)

Perhaps it is a function of growing up in the stunning environment and protective gaze of a smaller town that has made me more aware of the importance of place. Perhaps too, a growing sense of being remote and then some living and travel ‘overseas’ has forced a continual reimagining of where I am in the world and where I am in relation to what I think too though, in a time of such movement, indeed around the globe, what continues to shine in my head are images of mountains, of still tarns, of bright fagus (deciduous beech) and then of trees, trees and ocean, a wheeling sea eagle and then of a dog at the gate, of a house rubbing shoulders with peppermint gum. Of home. yMy own interests in tracing more strongly the contours or rhumb lines of my own connections (perhaps because now they feel more under threat) has [sic] brought me towards a growing phenomenon and academic area of interest: ‘youth homelessness’. Even as I think more carefully about my own homeplace, $I$ become more and more conscious, obsessed even, with my growing awareness of a shifting population of young and old people through this new city in which $I$ am desperately trying to carve a sense of permanence, a sense of place, myself. (S7)

Clearly, the distinctiveness of this reflexive self emerges through a variety of resources which situate the writer at the centre of the writing and research process. There are certainly overlaps with the other types of $I _ { \cdot }$ , particularly in terms of choice of process type (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004). For example, material processes occur in Category 1 (I as guide: $I$ want to explore the ways in which gendered differencesy), Category 2 (methodological I: I approach this problem) and Category 5 (reflexive I: I could not explore with the positivistic detachmenty) and other similar overlaps can be found. Where the categories seem to differ is in the surrounding co-text, where Category 1 is about objects of the research process itself (gendered differences), Category 2 about aspects of the research design (this problem) and Category 5 about the process of the self as an individual engaging in the research (the writing of this theses was a process I could not explore with the positivistic detachment). Further clarification of this category is necessary to establish it firmly as a separate type but we believe that it is an important trend in these theses, and worth additional investigation (see also Harwood, 2005 on the relevance of co-text in assessing methodological $I$ in computing science M.Sc. reports).

# 4. Thesis types and disciplinarity reconsidered

It is probably more useful to conceptualise the evolution of thesis types along a continuum (see Table 5), with some being clearly traditional in terms of their macrostructure, layout, title choices, typography and absence of $I .$ . Our complex traditional theses and several of the History theses and one of the Sociology theses are thus located within the traditional humanities or social sciences as are those theses with an occasional use of I. In the middle of the continuum are topic-based theses that contain the uses of $I$ previously documented. The theses on the right-hand side of our continuum are those that both through their macrostructure and other features identified earlier as well as in the construction of a reflexive, embodied self can be seen to tend to the New Humanities. The New Humanities bring into question the traditional disciplinary boundaries as a number of the theses in our corpus which are officially from Sociology are seen to exhibit characteristic of the New Humanities.

# 5. Conclusion

We have argued in our paper that the choices thesis writers make as to macrostructure and representation of self can be identified via the title, contents pages and introductions of their theses and that through these choices, writers begin to align themselves with or against particular research traditions. Doing qualitative research within postmodernist frames of reference challenges students to reflect on their positioning as a researcher within the research process in relation to their research and shapes the textual selves they construct both visually and verbally. We believe we have begun to provide a response to Hodge’s question which we cited in our opening paragraph—‘‘what might a doctoral thesis be like in the ‘New’ or Postmodern Humanities’?’’

To return to the claims of Parry (1998), namely that Social Sciences and Humanities doctorates are structurally distinguished by the Social Sciences’ reliance on explanation and argument, while the Humanities theses rely on argument with recounting and narrative, our study of the introductions and tables of contents of the 20 theses in our corpus leads us to the view that in the New Humanities theses we see narrative-like elements entering Social Science introductions through the construction of the reflexive, autobiographical non-positivistic self. It is interesting to reflect on the extent to which we are witnessing a fundamental shift in thesis production within the Humanities and Social Sciences or a momentary blip. Has the topic-based New Humanities thesis become the unmarked genre for student writers for whom it is no longer risky business but conforming to new rhetorical expectations of the post-modern thesis? Maton’s (2003) claim that reflexivity has become a ‘‘hegemonic value of the social scientific field’’ might provide support for this view (p. 54). On the other hand, Turner (2003) argues that the Ph.D. is an inherently conservative genre and that the risks involved in challenging the dominant institutional (disciplinary) norms are factors likely to perpetuate its conservatism with changes that enact critical epistemic values appearing at a micro, rather than a macro level.

Lewin, Fine, and Young (2001), in their study of the generic structure of the introductions to a corpus of Social Science research articles speculate that journal article introductions and, in fact, research texts in their entirety, may have evolved from a ‘‘narrative schema’’ (p. 59). We believe that in the New Humanities theses, we may be seeing a resurgence of the narrative that positivist discourse had evacuated from the text. The first person narrations that we have identified which insert the writer as participant in the story of the origin of their thesis would seem to support this view and would merit further investigation as would the evolution of disciplinarity.

As Paltridge (2002) has demonstrated, published advice on thesis structure is frequently at odds with actual practice and based on scientific or social-scientific paradigms that, as Hodge argues, are sites of disciplinary contestation. At best, simplistic advice about thesis models or types can be little more than a starting point. In terms of thesis pedagogy, the types of analysis we are proposing may be valuable for student writers who become aware of the range of options potentially available to them as they develop the structure of their thesis. Similarly, the perennial question of whether students may use $I$ can be addressed through the kinds of analysis we have proposed to illustrate that $I$ has multiple, situated, contextualised meanings that involve choices writers can make.

For those engaged in the pedagogy of the genres of advanced academic literacy, it is imperative to extend one’s own knowledge base and study the doctoral theses being produced and deemed successful at the local level of the institution. For, if we may conclude (as we began) with Hodge’s words: ‘‘the new Humanities [are] an unstable patchwork of premises and fields, an incoherent and shifting map whose present status is not agreed on, much less its future’’ (p. 22).
