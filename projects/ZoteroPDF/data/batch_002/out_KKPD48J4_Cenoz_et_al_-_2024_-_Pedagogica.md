# ABSTRACT

The concept of translanguaging is widely used in studies on multilingualism and language learning nowadays and it is important to distinguish between spontaneous translanguaging and pedagogical translanguaging. Spontaneous translanguaging refers to the discursive practices of multilingual speakers that have not been planned by the teacher and which take place both at school and outside school. Pedagogical translanguaging refers to pedagogical strategies planned by the teacher inside the classroom. The aim of this article is to explore the possible relationship between pedagogical translanguaging and the perception of students’ and teachers’ levels of anxiety when teaching and learning through the medium of second and third languages. Participants in the study were 124 teachers who took an in-service course on pedagogical translanguaging. These teachers implemented pedagogical translanguaging activities in their classes. The participants completed a questionnaire and some open questions to report their views on their own level of anxiety and that of their students while implementing translanguaging. The results indicate that pedagogical translanguaging can be associated with a reduction in students’ anxiety and teachers’ guilt feeling about using more than one language in class. These results are discussed as related to monolingual and multilingual ideologies in language teaching.

# Introduction

Teaching and learning through the medium of a second or foreign language is widespread in schools in many countries. Traditionally, only foreign language teachers used languages other than national or regional languages in their classes but nowadays there are more contexts involving the learning of second or additional languages. For example, the spread of English as the medium of instruction in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programs implies that there is an increasing number of content subjects which are taught through the medium of English. Moreover, for some teachers who speak regional minority languages such as Catalan, Basque or Welsh, their first language is often the majority language and the minority language is the one they have learned as a second language and use in their teaching. Many students in these regions also learn through the regional minority language even when it is not their home language. Likewise, the mobility of the population has an important effect with some teachers teaching through a second or third language because they do not live in their home country. This situation is also common in the case of immigrant students who often learn through the medium of a language that is not their L1.

These situations involving teachers and students who are multilingual and work through the medium of first, second and additional languages demand multilingual approaches. In fact, traditional monolingual approaches based on monolingual speakers and monolingual ideologies are being challenged and proposals based on translanguaging are being implemented in some contexts (Duarte 2020; Leonet, Cenoz, and Gorter 2020).

This article focuses on translanguaging in education as related to anxiety. Communicative anxiety was defined by Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1996, 127) as ‘a type of shyness characterized by fear of or anxiety about communicating with people’. In the context of foreign language teaching, communicative anxiety has often been associated with being a non-native teacher (Horwitz 1996). Nowadays, as teaching and learning academic content through a second or additional language is spreading, communicative anxiety is more likely to exist beyond the foreign language class.

The aim of this paper is to discuss the relationship between the use of pedagogical translanguaging and communicative anxiety. It reports on a study conducted in the Basque Country that explores this relationship by looking at primary and secondary teachers’ perspectives of their own anxiety as well as their perception of the anxiety experienced by their students with regard to pedagogical translanguaging. The organization of the article is as follows. First, we focus on the shift from monolingual to multilingual ideologies that is taking place in the study of multilingualism and we discuss the concept of translanguaging making a distinction between spontaneous and pedagogical translanguaging. In the next section we discuss the concept of anxiety and its possible links to translanguaging. Then we report the results of a study on teachers’ perceptions in the context of multilingual education involving three languages, Basque, Spanish and English, in the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain. The discussion brings together translanguaging and anxiety perspectives as related to previous work and outlines some future perspectives.

# Theoretical background

# Towards multilingual ideologies and translanguaging

Traditionally, the point of reference for language teachers and learners has been the monolingual native speaker of the target language. This idea has been associated with anxiety and low selfesteem because non-native speakers do not usually achieve the same level of ‘nativeness’ as native speakers (Llurda 2014; Santos, Cenoz, and Gorter 2017). The idea of comparing multilinguals who can use different languages to the ideal monolingual speaker has been criticized because multilingual speakers have a different type of competence that is unique and not comparable to the competence of monolingual speakers (Cook 1992; Grosjean 2010). According to Cenoz and Gorter (2020) monolingual and multilingual speakers are not only different regarding competence but they also have different linguistic trajectories and discourses. Multilingual speakers’ linguistic trajectories are often richer and more dynamic than those of monolingual speakers. Their discourses are different because multilingual speakers navigate between languages and use multilingual resources when they translanguage. Taking a social justice perspective, Ortega (2014, 36) criticizes the reference to the native speaker because ‘linguistic ownership by birth and monolingual upbringing is elevated to an inalienable right and advantage’. In spite of these criticisms, in many educational contexts the reference to monolingual native speakers, who only speak the target language, is still present and even though non-native teachers can be highly skilled, there remains a preference for native teachers (Jenkins, Cogo, and Dewey 2011). Nowadays there is a trend towards multilingual ideologies that do not give a central role to the native speaker and language separation. Translanguaging is a concept at the core of these multilingual approaches (Makalela 2015; Duarte 2020).

Translanguaging was initially used in Wales and its original meaning has evolved over the last decade. Translanguaging was defined as the pedagogical practice of deliberately alternating the language of input and output in bilingual classrooms (Lewis, Jones, and Baker 2012). For example, the teacher would plan a lesson with an initial presentation in Welsh and students then answered questions in English or vice-versa. By alternating the use of languages in the input and output, it was thought that students could develop their knowledge and improve understanding of both languages (Lewis, Jones, and Baker 2012). Williams (2002, 42) explains that translanguaging in the Welsh context aims at reinforcing proficiency and use of Welsh and English and he also adds that translanguaging aims at developing confident students.

Nowadays, translanguaging is also used to refer to natural practices that do not necessarily take place inside the classroom when multilingual speakers use elements from different languages in their linguistic repertoire (see García 2008; García and Li 2015). Cenoz and Gorter (2017, 2021) distinguished between spontaneous translanguaging and pedagogical translanguaging and represent it as a continuum.

Spontaneous translanguaging refers to the discursive practices of multilingual speakers which have not been planned by the teacher and which take place both at school and outside school. Pedagogical translanguaging refers to pedagogical strategies planned by the teacher inside the classroom and can include the alternation of the languages in the input and output as well as other strategies. This applies to pedagogical strategies used to teach languages and/or content based on the learners’ whole linguistic repertoire. Pedagogical translanguaging uses the knowledge multilinguals possess together with the resources of their whole linguistic repertoire. Pedagogical translanguaging can increase metalinguistic awareness and can be used in both language and content classes (Leonet, Cenoz, and Gorter 2020). Multilingual learners are likely to have prior knowledge because their multilingual repertoires are broader than monolingual repertoires and also have more experience to know how languages work. Pedagogical translanguaging aims at making learners aware of their own resources and teach them to reflect on them so that they can use them when learning language(s) and/or content.

Even if pedagogical translanguaging may be useful for language learning, many teachers who are influenced by monolingual approaches seem to be afraid to use resources from other languages in the foreign language classroom. Arocena, Cenoz, and Gorter (2015), in a study on primary and secondary school teachers from the Basque Autonomous Community, found that teachers were reluctant to admit that they use other languages besides the target language in their classroom (see also Gorter and Arocena 2020). This finding was confirmed by Zhang et al. (2020), who reported that both spontaneous and pedagogical translanguaging were used by Chinese language teachers but that they often felt guilty about using translanguaging (see also Hall and Cook 2012) . Anderson and Lightfoot (2018) also reported the results of a study carried out in India with teachers of different levels and concluded that teachers feel guilty about translanguaging. They related this feeling to widely spread monolingual ideologies that influence teachers even if their own behavior is multilingual.

# Language anxiety

Communicative anxiety is an affective variable that has attracted a lot of attention among researchers in different contexts (see for example Gkonou, Daubney, and Dewaele 2017). Focusing on foreign language anxiety, Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986, 128) defined it as ‘a distinct complex of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors related to classroom language learning arising from the uniqueness of the language learning process’. According to MacIntyre (2017) it is situationspecific because it is associated with the learning context and it is different from an anxious personality.

Most studies on language anxiety have shown the detrimental effect of anxiety on students’ academic performance and their capacity to learn and use a language (Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope 1986; MacIntyre and Gregersen 2012; Zhou 2016; MacIntyre 2017). These findings are confirmed by a metaanalysis of 89 journal articles and eight unpublished dissertations carried out by Teimouri, Goetze, and Plonsky (2019), concluding that ‘Anxiety, overall, is negatively associated with L2 achievement’ (377). Communicative anxiety in the classroom can therefore have a negative effect on comprehension and production as well as on student participation in the class (Chou 2018). In the language learning context, anxious students tend to distrust social situations, feeling pressure and unease, and leading them to focus more on what they believe they cannot do instead of on what they really can do (Oxford 2016). The importance of providing a positive climate to support learning has been highlighted in second language research in recent years (see for example MacIntyre, Gregersen, and Mercer 2016; Martínez Agudo 2018).

The teacher can obviously contribute to the positive climate of the classroom by being aware of the emotions and the anxieties that arise and being ready to provide the necessary tools for students to manage those emotions positively (Gkonou, Daubney, and Dewaele 2017). At the same time, teachers should also ‘be able to regulate their own emotions to ensure they are in the right frame of mind to create positive rapport with learners, generate enjoyment and manage any anxieties’ (Dewaele, Gkonou, and Mercer 2018, 126). One of the reasons for teachers’ anxiety is that they are non-native speakers of the target language. Non-native teachers may feel linguistically inferior and hesitant about their ability to teach because of their L2 competence (McNeill 2018; Santos, Cenoz, and Gorter 2017).

The importance of emotional factors and anxiety in particular is widely acknowledged but its relationship to translanguaging needs to be explored further. Some studies indicate that translanguaging pedagogies could have a positive effect on reducing the level of anxiety and enhancing comprehension and engagement in academic tasks (Back, Han, and Weng 2020; Rivera and Mazak (2017). Back, Han, and Weng (2020) reported that the use of the whole linguistic repertoire not only facilitates comprehension but can also be regarded as emotional scaffolding. In their case study they report how two primary school students became more engaged in learning when translanguaging was encouraged. Rivera and Mazak (2017) also underlined some positive aspects of using translanguaging pedagogies in the classroom. They found that in stressful situations, translanguaging allowed students to use their own linguistic and communicative resources, which increased their ability to express, explain and justify new ideas. In a similar vein, Ticheloven et al. (2019) highlighted the importance of the affective functions of translanguaging and reported that teachers considered that encouraging students to use other languages in class was positive. Martínez Agudo (2017, 78) also considers that the use of the L1 in the classroom can be ‘a helpful strategy for reducing students’ affective barriers like language anxiety’. Taking into account the potential relationship between translanguaging and anxiety, it is important to listen to teachers’ voices reporting their own perceptions. Pedagogical translanguaging is a common practice in some contexts (Arocena, Cenoz, and Gorter 2015; Wang 2019; Zhang et al. 2020) but it is necessary to understand more about its relationship with communicative anxiety.

# The study

The study reported here was carried out in the Basque Autonomous Community, where Basque and Spanish are official languages and English is studied as a foreign language (Gorter, Zenotz, and Cenoz 2014). Basque is a non-Indo-European language that can be considered a minority language in its own territory. According to the 2016 sociolinguistic survey, it is spoken by approximately $34 \%$ of the population over the age of 16 (Basque Government 2019). In spite of being a minority language, Basque is the main medium of instruction in the Basque Autonomous Community.

The aim of this exploratory study is to examine the relationship between pedagogical translanguaging and anxiety by looking at teachers’ perceptions. The research questions are the following:

R1. How do teachers perceive students’ anxiety during the implementation of pedagogical translanguaging? R2. How do teachers perceive their own anxiety as related to using pedagogical translanguaging practices in class?

# Methodology

# Participants

This study includes a sample of 124 teachers from the Basque Autonomous Community, 99 of whom were female $( 7 9 . 8 \% )$ and 25 male $( 2 0 . 2 \% )$ . The mean age of the participants was 45.3 years $( \mathsf { S D } =$ 9.04), and the average number of years of teaching experience was 20.2 years. Most of the teachers taught in pre-primary, primary or secondary school $( 9 1 . 9 \% )$ . The rest of the participants $\left( 8 . 1 \% \right)$ were school advisors. The first language of participants was either Basque, Spanish or both languages. The percentages for L1 Basque $( 4 4 . 3 \% )$ and L1 Spanish $( 4 5 \% )$ were very similar and $1 0 . 7 \%$ of the participants reported both Basque and Spanish as their first languages. Most participants taught one or more languages and some other subjects $( 8 3 . 9 \% )$ . Basque, Spanish and English are taught as school subjects in primary and secondary schools and most primary school teachers teach several school subjects.

All the participants in this study took part in a training course for in-service primary and secondary school teachers entitled ‘Focus on Multilingualism: Language Integration in the Curriculum’ at the University of the Basque Country. The course combined theoretical perspectives with the application and implementation of pedagogical translanguaging in the classroom. It adopted a holistic approach and a multilingual focus that considers pupils as emergent multilinguals who can use their linguistic repertoire and translanguage when learning and using languages. The course consisted of an intensive face-to-face part, a theoretical component (20 h) and an online part (seven weeks) in which teachers participated while they were teaching. As the course was in English, $5 8 . 5 \%$ of the participants taught English or through the medium of English, sometimes along with classes of other languages or other content subjects. Other teachers taught mainly through the medium of Basque, which is the main language of instruction.

During these seven weeks, teachers and school advisors worked with reading materials and participated in online discussions. They also had to design, implement and assess a translanguaging unit. The aim of the implementation was to soften boundaries between languages to enhance students’ communicative and academic competences in the three languages Basque, Spanish, and English. A few teachers had some experience in coordinating with teachers of other languages but the use of the three languages in the same class in planned activities was completely new for them. During the implementation the use of the whole linguistic repertoire as a resource implies that prior knowledge can be activated and metalinguistic awareness can be reinforced (Cenoz and Gorter 2021). Teachers were guided through the process of the implementation and had to submit a lesson plan for the pedagogical translanguaging unit. They were free to decide how to adapt pedagogical translanguaging to their courses and they made different choices including exercises with cognates in science or history classes taught in English, grammar in Basque, English and Spanish in language classes or reading and writing skills in the three languages (see for example Cenoz and Santos 2020). The third part of the course was a face-to-face follow up session where teachers could discuss their experiences.

# Instruments

In this study, quantitative and qualitative techniques were used in order to collect the data. The instruments used were the following.

Translanguaging and anxiety questionnaire: It was a longer questionnaire on different aspects of translanguaging but in this study we refer to all the items on the perception of anxiety in order to answer the research questions. There were seven items on a Likert scale, ranging from (1) ‘strongly disagree’ to (7) ‘strongly agree’. Four of the questions were specific about the students, two were specific about the teachers, and one was more general. Teachers were asked to rate statements related to the effect of pedagogical translanguaging activities on students’ and teachers’ language anxiety. The questionnaire was administered at the end of the course once the teachers had attended the theoretical sessions on translanguaging and had implemented a pedagogical translanguaging unit in their classes. The value for Cronbach’s Alpha for the seven items together was $\mathtt { a } = . 8 2$ .

The questionnaire was in Basque and Spanish and most teachers filled it in Basque.

Teachers’ qualitative feedback: Apart from the quantitative data, qualitative data were also collected with the aim of obtaining deeper insights into the feelings of teachers and students when planning and using their translanguaging strategies inside the classroom.

All the teachers in the study were asked to reflect about their own feelings, student’s behavior and perception of students’ learning during the implementation of pedagogical translanguaging. They were given the following questions as prompts

(1) How did you feel when implementing the ‘Pedagogical Translanguaging’ session? Why? (2) How did students behave? Did they understand the activities? (3) Do students learn more or less with these multilingual activities?

As it can be seen the questions were not specific about anxiety but the reflections included specific comments about anxiety, both teachers’ perceptions of their own anxiety and comments about how they perceived their students’ anxiety. These comments were identified and analyzed in order to answer the research questions.

# Procedure

Participants signed a consent form allowing the data to be used for the purposes of the research study. The data were analyzed with the SPSS program version 22. The qualitative data were codified and analyzed with the program Atlas.ti. In the results section below, both approaches have been combined. Qualitative data have been used to confirm and strengthen the quantitative findings (Cresswell and Plano Clark 2011).

# Results

# Teachers’ perception of students’ anxiety as related to translanguaging

The first research question focuses on teachers’ perceptions about students’ anxiety related to the implementation of translanguaging practices. In order to answer this question, we will look at four items of the translanguaging and anxiety questionnaire and the feedback provided by the teachers. In all cases the focus is on their students’ anxiety.

As can be seen in Table 1, the results of the item Translanguaging is good to reduce students’ anxiety indicated that overall teachers agreed with the statement $M = 6 . 3 7$ , ${ \mathsf { S } } . { \mathsf { D } } . = 1 . 1 2$ ). The score for the item By using translanguaging, students’ confidence to learn languages can increase $( M =$ 6.12, ${ \mathsf { S } } . { \mathsf { D } } . = 1 . 2 5 )$ was also high on a scale from 1 to 7.

The other two items on students’ anxiety (Table 2) distinguish between pedagogical and spontaneous translanguaging, which were concepts the teachers were familiar with because they had worked with them during the course. The formulation of the questions was about the possibility of increasing anxiety and as can be seen, the scores are low in a scale from 1 to 7. The item If pedagogical translanguaging is used, students’ anxiety can increase had a low score $( M = 1 . 8 4 , 5 . \mathsf { D } . = 1 . 3 3 )$ and very similar to the item If spontaneous translanguaging is used, students’ anxiety can increase $( M =$

1.83, ${ \mathsf { S } } . { \mathsf { D } } . = 1 . 2 8 )$ ). The results indicate that teachers do not perceive an increase in students’ level of anxiety when pedagogical or spontaneous translanguaging is used.

The qualitative data were used to obtain a more detailed description of teachers’ perceptions about students’ anxiety regarding the translanguaging experience. The data confirmed the results of the questionnaire. The comments were in Basque or Spanish and they have been translated to English.

The following examples indicate that after the implementation, teachers see translanguaging as a beneficial resource to reduce student anxiety as can be seen in Extract 1.

Extract 1

T 11: I use these strategies to reduce students’ feelings of anxiety.

Extracts 2 and 3 show that students are perceived to get more confident during the implementation of pedagogical translanguaging.

Extract 2

T 98: I felt that I was using a useful tool to help the students realize that their English level is higher than they thought. They gain confidence in their writing and speaking skills.

Extract 3

T 25: Using translanguaging allows children to express themselves. They feel confident and their contributions are richer.

The students’ own reactions towards the translanguaging experience were also very positive. Most teachers report that students felt really comfortable, participated actively and made connections between the languages of their linguistic repertoire. Even some students who did not usually dare to participate in class took part actively. All this made teachers feel very satisfied with the results of the translanguaging units they had designed, as can be seen in the examples. Teachers highlight that students could make connections between Basque and English when translanguaging because of the linguistic distance between the two languages (Extracts 4 and 5).

Extract 4

T 101: Students felt at ease and enjoyed the activities proposed and they even mentioned that there were more connections between languages than they had previously imagined.

Extract 5

T 62: What has impressed me most is the students’ reactions. When asked to reflect on the process, most of them confirmed that they felt really comfortable and the work was easier. And, to my surprise, they also said that they had never thought that the knowledge of Basque could be helpful in order to learn English.

Teachers’ perceptions also indicate that translanguaging can help students who have more learning difficulties both when learning Basque as a second language and English as a foreign language (Extracts 6 and 7). The teacher in Extract 6 explains that she was already making some comparisons between Basque and Spanish when students had difficulties.

Extract 6

T 10: I have always defended the idea that comparing L1 and L2 makes classes richer and easier to follow for any student who may have a problem with learning languages in general. Actually, I have a student who hasn’t passed the subject for some years now and didn’t use to participate in class, but once I explained some parts of the activity in Spanish, he even volunteered to answer because he felt he had finally understood something.

# Extract 7

T 13: It is very helpful for the ones who struggle with the foreign language.

The following extracts show that, in general, students were more active when participating in different activities. In Extract 8 the teacher perceived that students were more engaged and participated more because they felt more comfortable. In Extract 9 the teacher also perceived that students were more active and relates this engagement to the help she was providing. It is interesting to see that she also perceives that they learn more than before.

Extract 8

T 66: They told me they felt much more comfortable when they were able to use different languages in class because it was easier for them to take part and ask questions.

# Extract 9

T 9: Their behaviour was more active because they were paying attention, so if there was something they did not understand, they knew I was going to help them either in the target language or in their mother tongue. They got the point easier and learnt a lot of new vocabulary.

Another important point highlighted by teachers that can be seen in the previous extract and also in Extract 10 was that comprehension was better. In extract 10 the teacher also refers to having less anxiety when they translanguaged.

Extract 10

T 7: After the implementation, we took some time to think and talk about what we had done and they expressed their interest in continuing to work like this, because it helped them relax and not feel forced to speak in their L3 if they didn’t feel secure enough, so it helped to lower stress. They also thought they had understood the topic better and learned more than if we had just used English in the classroom.

In sum, both the results of the questionnaire and the feedback provided by teachers after the implementation of the pedagogical translanguaging unit indicate that teachers perceived that during the pedagogical translanguaging unit, students were more confident and less anxious. They also perceived that comprehension was better and that students were more engaged with the class activities. Some teachers thought that translanguaging was particularly helpful for students who had learning difficulties.

# Teachers’ perception of their own anxiety as related to translanguaging

As we have previously seen, the second research question aims at exploring teachers’ anxiety related to the implementation of translanguaging practices. In order to answer this question, teachers were asked about the perception of their own anxiety when using translanguaging inside the classroom.

Table 3 shows the means obtained in the 1–7 Likert scale. The mean scores indicate that teachers tend to agree with the statement Translanguaging can help to reduce teachers’ anxiety $( M = 5 . 6 4$ , S.D $= 1 . 5 1 )$ and also with the statement We teachers can also gain confidence by using translanguaging (M $= 5 . 4 6 , \mathsf { S . D . } = 1 . 6 0 )$ . In addition, teachers also agreed with the more general item If anxiety is reduced in one language it will be reduced in the other languages as well $( \mathsf { M } = 5 . 5 2 , 5 . \mathsf { D } . = 1 . 5 6 )$ . The scores for these three items are above the mean but not very high on a scale from 1 to 7.

The teachers’ qualitative feedback on the development of their translanguaging unit indicates that some teachers initially expressed concern about the implementation of pedagogical translanguaging (Extract 11 and 12). It was a new approach as compared to the usual activities in class but their insecurities disappeared when they got positive feedback from students (Extract 11) and saw they could implement the different pedagogical translanguaging activities they had designed (Extract 12). It is interesting to see the reference to being native in Extract 12 when using three languages. There were no other references to being a native speaker or not.

Table 3. Teachers’ perceptions about their own anxiety $( N = 2 4 )$ ).   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>M</td><td>S.D.</td></tr><tr><td>Translanguaging can help to reduce teachers&#x27; anxiety</td><td>5.64</td><td>1.51</td></tr><tr><td>We teachers can also gain confidence by using translanguaging</td><td>5.46</td><td>1.60</td></tr><tr><td>If anxiety is reduced in one language it will be reduced in the other languages as well</td><td> 5.52</td><td>1.56</td></tr></table></body></html>

Extract 11

T 28: At the beginning I felt a bit strange when I asked my students to use the three languages to work on their activities. Their feedback was positive, though. This made me feel confident and now I use them without feeling guilty at all.

# Extract 12

T 12: I felt good when working on these exercises. I was nervous but you don’t have to be a native speaker to do this. At first, I thought it would be difficult but it wasn’t and I felt comfortable.

It was the first time for teachers to implement pedagogical translanguaging but they were already using language(s) other than the target language in their classes before they took the course. Extracts 11, 13 and 14 refer to ‘guilt’ when they were using other languages. Their comments show how they felt relieved when they saw that using other languages as a resource was expected in pedagogical translanguaging.

Extract 13

T 23: It was nice to see that what I’ve been using in my classes isn’t something I should feel guilty for.

Extract 14

T 62: I felt more aware of the things I was doing and why I was doing them. And less guilty.

Extracts 15 and 16 also show that teachers feel confident about using resources. The teacher in Extract 15 highlights that it is natural to do it and he feels good. The teacher in Extract 16 also feels confident because she was not following the monolingual approach she had been taught and now she did not have to feel be ashamed of it.

Extract 15

T 102: I felt good; it seemed natural to be able to use more than English in the classroom, so I did it with confidence.

# Extract 16

T 46: I felt confident. It is very interesting as it gives credit to the way in which we have used this method spontaneously in our previous professional experience, feeling ashamed when doing so. When we were students, the model teacher was the only one using the target language in a monolingual way.

In sum, the results of the quantitative and qualitative data indicate that teachers were a bit hesitant about the implementation of pedagogical translanguaging at the beginning but they got more confident when they saw that it worked and had positive feedback from their students. They also refer to their own previous experience using resources from other languages but feeling about doing that.

# Discussion

The results of this exploratory study suggest that, according to their teachers, pedagogical translanguaging could be associated with students’ reduction of anxiety. The teachers in this study reported that students were more confident and less anxious during the session in which translanguaging was implemented than in other classes. They also reported that both pedagogical and spontaneous translanguaging do not increase anxiety. Moreover, some teachers reported that comprehension, participation and engagement in classroom activities improved and they associate this improvement with reduced anxiety (Chou 2018). These results confirm the findings reported in other contexts where translanguaging is associated with cognitive and emotional benefits (Back, Han, and Weng 2020; Rivera and Mazak 2017). Some teachers in this study also perceived that translanguaging can be particularly beneficial for students who have learning problems.

Oxford (2016) explained that anxious students focus more on what they cannot do rather than on what they can do. This study is exploratory but it is possible that one of the reasons why translanguaging practices are successful in reducing anxiety is that students’ prior knowledge as multilingual speakers is valued. The data show that teachers reported the students’ had realized that their knowledge of Basque could help with their English. It is their own multilingual competence that is valued when pedagogical translanguaging is put into practice and that experience can create a positive climate in the classroom. Even if students are not very confident about the target language they can participate in class because they know other languages. The results of this study show that pedagogical translanguaging is associated with lower levels of anxiety and higher confidence but there is not enough evidence showing the exact direction of that relationship. One possibility is to think that it is bidirectional. It is possible that pedagogical translanguaging has a positive effect on students’ engagement and comprehension and as a result students have lower levels of anxiety but this reduced anxiety could also enhance students’ engagement.

The results of the two questions about teachers’ perception of their own anxiety as related to translanguaging only show a weak trend in this association. The qualitative data indicate that teachers felt guilty and ashamed when they used resources from other languages before the course (see also Arocena, Cenoz, and Gorter 2015; Zhang et al. 2020). The teachers participating in this study had been influenced by monolingual beliefs which are widely spread and the translanguaging course provided a theoretical and empirical basis for pedagogical translanguaging. The implementation of pedagogical translanguaging has contributed to legitimizing some strategies which teachers already used and has reinforced pedagogical translanguaging practices by making them more grounded and systematic. The fact that the teachers already used resources from other languages and that their beliefs changed from the beginning to the end of the course (see Gorter and Arocena, 2020) could indicate that teachers’ real beliefs may not be as monolingual as it was expected. The pedagogical translanguaging approach of the ‘Focus Multilingualism: Language Integration in the Curriculum’ course, together with their own experience in the classroom, changed their feelings of shame and guilt.

Some of the teachers already had some experience using more than one language in class but during the course they learned to use pedagogical translanguaging in a systematic way, establishing aims in their lesson plans and designing specific activities. The results indicate that some teachers were a bit anxious about the new design and the integration of three languages in the same unit but they got more confident when they saw that students liked pedagogical translanguaging activities. The results also indicate that translanguaging was taking part in the classes but it was not planned with specific objectives. It seems that teachers were translanguaging in a spontaneous way to enhance communication in the classroom. As Cenoz and Gorter (2021) explain, spontaneous translanguaging can also have a pedagogical value. Pedagogical translanguaging adds a new dimension by activating prior knowledge and focusing on metalinguistic awareness and this study shows that adding this dimension is regarded as positive by the teachers. Implementing pedagogical translanguaging in the classroom is an important step towards using the resources of multilingual teachers and students when teaching and learning languages and academic content.

This study has some limitations because our data are based on teachers’ views in a specific context. Future studies could look at the direction of the relationship between translanguaging and anxiety. It could also be interesting to analyze the specific effect of spontaneous translanguaging as compared to pedagogical translanguaging not only in the learning of language and content but also in students’ anxiety.

In spite of these limitations, this study shows that pedagogical translanguaging has a positive influence on students’ confidence and give theoretical and empirical support to multilingual ideologies and practices.
