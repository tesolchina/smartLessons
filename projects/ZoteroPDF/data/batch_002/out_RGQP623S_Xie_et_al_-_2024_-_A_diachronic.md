Stance-taking in academic writing changes over time in response to individual options and shifting disciplinary, social and cultural practices. The existing literature on stance primarily adopts a synchronic perspective and diachronic studies are scarce. To add to the thin body of literature, this study investigates the changing patterns of authorial stance in the part of discussion of Chinese MA theses and published research articles (RA) over the past 30 years in the discipline of applied linguistics. Two corpora, one consisting of 90 thesis discussions written in English by Chinese MA students from 1991 to 2020, and the other comprising 90 RA discussions from three leading journals in the field from the same time period, were built and retrieved for four major stance resources, namely, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, and self-mentions according to Hyland's (2005b) stance model. Results reveal that Chinese students consistently used fewer stance markers than RA writers across the three decades. The two groups of writers' employment of the four stance resources also displayed distinct changing patterns over the years. The study also unveils problematic demonstration of authorial stance by Chinese students, thus emphasizing the need for explicit instruction on stance-taking in L2 English academic writing.

# 1. Introduction

Academic genre changes over time in response to the shifing demands of the academic discourse communit (Swales, 2004). The diachronic evolution of academic genre can be traced through rhetorical feature, as a genre is "a conventional category of discourse based in larg-scale typification of rhetorical action (Miller, 1984, p. 163). Authoridl stance, one rhetorical feature constituting aademic genre, is thus expected to evolve over time. Stance refers to the ways writers express or convey their personal atitues, emotions or epistemic points of view towards the propositions or entities in their academic writing (Biber, 2006). Authorial stance is prevalent in al academic genres (Gray & Biber, 2012), and the way writers take positions plays a pivotal role in demonstrating the quality of the writig (Aull & ancaster, 2014). Successul academic writers would carefully consider their audience, anticipate what the audiences know and need, and effctively engage and interact with them by using various stance resources in the texts (Hyland, 2005a).

The interpersonality adressed by stance in academic discourse has garnered significant attention in academia. However, previous studies have primaril adopted asynchronic perspective, focusing on the varying features of stance construction indifferent academic subgenres, discipline, or written by writers with different language proficiency (e.g., Hu & Ca0, 2015; Hyland & Zou, 2021; Kawase, 2015; Lee & Deakin, 2016). It isknown that the academic landscape has witnessed significant changes over the past decades due to "major changes in the nature of publishing, the expansion of audience, institutional measurement imperatives and research practices which favor increasing coauthorship" (Hyland & Jiang, 2018, p. 29). However, how these changes affct writers construction of authorial stance over time remains largely unexplored, presenting a gap that warrants investigation from a diachronic perspective (ie, 2020).

Previous research shows that expert academic writers, with a more established scholarly background, are adept at expressing authorial stance in academic writing. In contrast, L2 student writers, novice members of the academic discourse community, enerally underperform expert writers in stance construction. Specifically, student writers are found to be les strategic in interpersonal positioning who often produce single-voiced texts with strong commitments, authorial detachment, or a reluctance to acknowledge alternative points of view (Lee & Deakin, 2016; Ruan, 2019), thus undermining the overall writing quality. Since there may exist a developmental trajectory for students who are les enculturated than their more experienced counterparts (Qiu & Ma, 2019), expert writers' skilld maneuver of stance resources can serve as a valuable reference for students during their traning and acculturating process to the academic community.

In light of theseconsiderations, the present study wil investigate the diachronic change of authorial stance in the structural part of discussion, where writers need to constantly align with the isciplinary community via various stance resources, of MA theses written by Chinese English-major students and of published research articles (RAs) authored by expert writers over the past 30 years. It is hoped that findings of this study would unveil the evolving stance patterns of Chinese student writers and RA expert writers over time and shed light on English academic writing pedagogy to improve L2 students' ability in constructing authorial stance in English academic writing.

# 2. Literature review

In academic writig, writers adopt a range of rhetorical strategies to express their views and engage with readers. Stance is a notion addressing such interpersonal meanings which encompasses atitudinal features towards entities and epistemic features towards propositions (Gray & Biber, 2012). Researchers have long been interested in characterizing the inguistic marks of writers authorial stance in academic writing. Earlier studies examined the matter by focusing on specific stance resources that function either on the attitudinal dimension like afect (Ochs & Schiefflin 1989), or on the propositional dimension such as modalit (Palmer, 1990), evidentility (Chafe 1986), and verral and atrition (Tadros, 1993). Drawing onhe ari tdie, rt stdies tend  addres both dimensions and have developed integrated frameworks (Xie, 2020) under various terms such as stance (Conrad & Biber, 2000), metadiscourse (Hyland, 2005a), appraisal (Martin & White, 2005), and voice (Matsuda, 2001).

Among these approaches, Hyland's (2005b) metadiscourse approach has led to one prominent and fruitful strand of research. Hyland's interpersonal model of metadiscourse incorporates interactive resources that guide the reader through the text and interational resources that involve the reader in the text. The interactional resources are further clasified into stance and engagement with stance being the most relevant aspect for the present study. Stance in this approach is viewed as one writer-oriented feature of interaction which involves \*the ways academics annotate their texts o comment on the possile accuracy or credibilit of a claim, the extent they want to commit themselves to it, or the attitude they want to convey to an entity, a proposition, or the reader (Hyland, 2005b, p. 178). Four major stance resources are identified: hedges (eg, might possbl), boosters (e.g., in fact defintel) attitude markers (e.g., unfortunately), and self-mentions (e.g., I, our). This study adopts Hyland's (2005b) approach because of its vitalit in unveiling authorial stance in academic discourse.

Numerous studies have been conducted on stance in academic discourse applying Hyland's analytical framework. These studies have revealed that a number of factors would exert impacts on academic writers stance-taking practice: disciplines (e.g., Khedri & Kritsis, 2018; Qiu & Ma, 2019), linguacultures (e.g., Hu & Cao, 2011; Lee & Casal, 2014) and EAP instruction (e.g., Crosthwaite & Jiang, 2017; Dastjerdi & Shirzad, 2010). For example, Khedri and Kritsis (2018) compared stance patterns in 72 RAs from applied linguistics and chemistry and found considerable disciplinary diferences. Hu and Cao (2011) compared hedges and boosters in Chinese and English RA abstracts in applied linguistics and discovered that Chinese writers expressed a notably higher degree of certainty or commitment than thir English counterparts. Crosthwaite and Jiang's(2017) longitudinal study found that explicit in struction of stance features is crucial for improving students' persuasiveness in academic writing.

It i alsofound that expert writers and novice writers differ greatly in their use of stance markers. yland and Milton (1997) found novice L2 writerstend to rely on a restricted repertoire of language items, display stronger epistemic commitments, and encounter greater challenges in conveying a precise degree of certainty. Basing on a comparative analysis of 120 Chinese theses and 240 international journal articles, Xu (2015) found that Chinese student writers used significantly fewer epistemic stance markers and self-mentions. Differently, some studies (Qiu & Ma, 2019; Wang & Jiang, 2018) found Chinese master students used more hedges, boosters, and attitude markers, ut fewer slf-mentions than expert RA writers in applied linguistics. These studies indicate that L2 student writer fce challenges in constructing authorial stance. However, the inconsistent findings foreground the necessty for more investigations to gain a better understanding of students' distinct usage of stance resources from expert writers.

While there is a considerable body of synchronic research as reviewed above, research on the historical features of academic writer's stance is scant, though there has been an emergent diachronic turn in recent years (Xie, 2020). Glaerts and Van de Velde (2010) made n earl attempt t investigate hedges, booster, and attitude marker in RA astracts in applied linguistis from 1990 to 2010 and observed asignificant decrase of interpersonality in cientific abstracts over time. Similarly, Babai et al. (2016) found a decreasing trend in the use of stance markers in RAs in anthropology, education, hortculture, and zoology within the same time frame of 1990-2010. However, Bondi (2014) detcted a statisically significant increase of we and other voice markers over the time span of 1990, 200, and 2010 in RA abstracts in economics, history, and inguisics. Hyland and Jiang's (2016) inspiring study discovered that stance markers were increasingly employed in the hard sciences but the usage declined in the social sciences from 1965 to 2015. In the soft discipline of applied inguistics, the authors noted a decline in the use of the four types of stance markers, which suggests diminished authorial presence and more cautious stances in the field over time. These studies reveal the evolving nature of stance construction in academic writing. However, extant diachronic research mostly focused on expert writers stance-taking practice, leaving the question of whether and how novice student writers stance construction has evolved over time under-explored. This area warrants investigation, particularl considering the changing practices in the academic circle and the EAP writing pedagogy in the recent years.

Among the different structural parts of an academic text, the focus of current litrature is placed dominantly on the abstract whereas the icussion part, which relies heavily on evaluative lnguage is les atended. Abdi (2011) explored the variations in stance markers across different subsections of RAs and found that approximately $5 0 \%$ of their total usage occurred in the discussion. This is because the discussion is the very part where the writer strives to persuade the readers of the sigficance of his/her findins withinthe broader research context, and the writer's authorial-positioning plays a particularly crucial role for building convincing arguments (Abdi & Ahmadi, 2015). As a result, writing the discussion part poses a great challenge for both novice and expert academic writers, especially n stance projection (Bitchener & Basturkmen, 2006; Martin et al., 2014). This acknowledged diffculty has spurred research on writer's stance-taking strategies in the discussion of BA theses (Peng & Zheng, 2021), MA theses (Lee & Casal, 2014), and RAs (Shirzadi et al., 2017). However, a diachronic perspective is still generally rare in the literature.

To addres the existing gaps and add to the thin body of diachronic research, this study adopts Hyland's (2005b) stance model to investigate authorial stance in Chinese MA thesis and published RA discussions in the discipline of applied linguistics from 1991 to 2020. The main objective of this study i to unveil the changing patterns of stance construction by Chinese student writers and RA expert writers over the past 30 years as well as any discernible distinctive features between them.

# 3. Corpus and method

To trace the diachronic changes of writers stance projection in MA theses and RA discussions, we built two sub-corpora. The frst corpus i Chinese MA Thesis iscussion Corpus (CMDC), consisting of 90 thesis iscussions written in English by Chinese MA students from 1991 to 2020. These students were enrolled in a three-year MA program specializing in applied lingustics at a universt in southern China, whichoffers the highest level of English study and research in the country. Admission to this program requires passing a rigorous English proficiency test, ensuring that the student writers are advanced English learners capable of utilizing resources to express stance. That i, their level of English proficiency is unlikly to hinder their stance demonstration in academic writing. Theses written between 2001 and 2020 were sourced from China Maste Dissertations Fll-text Database, an officially authorized electronic database that collcts master theses from various disciplines of most of the tertiary institutions in China. Theses from the period of 1991-2000 were rtrieved from the universt library in their hard copy form because electronic copies were not submitted before the year 2000, which were then transformed into editable electronic copies. The second corpus is Research Article Discussion Corpus (RADC), comprising 90 RA discussions selected from three ledin journals in the field f applied linguistics namely Applied Linguistics, Language Learning, and Journal of Second Language Writing from the same time span of 1991-2020. The choice of these three sCI journals was made out of the consideration of their top-ranking impact factors in the iscipline and the accessbility of the online RAs from 1991 to 2020.

The theses and RAs were chosen through stratified purposive sampling to ensure the comparabilit of the two corpora. Allof them are based on empirical research to avoid the influence of research type on writer's utilization of stance markers. In addition, the discussion stands as an independent part in all the theses and RAs and only the discussion parts were included in the corpora. Moreover, both the theses and RAs cover a wide range of topics to ensure their representativenes of the discipline. Following Hyland and Jiang (2018), we divided the time frame into thre periods: 1991-2000, 2001-2010, and 2011-2020 to explore the changes, and each ten-year period consisted of 30 texts with thre from each year. We focused solely on the discipline of applied linguisic to rule out the variable of discipline on writerstance-taking practice. Since instruction can be a potential variable for student writer's change of stance construction, we conducted document research and obtained the information that the MA program to which the students belong started to offer thecourse of Englis academic writing around the year 2000. This iformation wil be taken into consideration in our interpretation of the results. We are also aware that MA theses and RAs vary in some respects such as length, level of detail audience, and context of writing, however, the discussion part of both theses and RAs serve the same communicative purpose - to provide commentary and interpretation on the reasons behind the findings and their connection to the research problem and hypotheses (Bitchener, 2018), and we believe it is the communicative purpose that plays the most vital role in shaping the rhetorical feature of stance in agenre (Swale, 2004). Nonetheles, it would be wise for us to consider the potential inluence of genre variations when interpreting any distinct features between the two corpora. Detailed information of the corpora isprovided in Table 1 below. After their establishment, the corpora were searched and retrieved for stance features based on the word list provided by Hyland (2005a), using the concordance software WordSmith 8.0. These stance features were categorized into four groups following Hyland's (2005b) stance model: hedge, boosters, atitde markers, and self-mentions. Following Hyland and Zou (2021), subcategories of hedges, boosters, attitude markers were also identified:

Hedges indicate writers' recognition and admittance of other voices instead of holding a complete commitment to a proposition. Three subtypes were identified: downtoners that mitigate the intensity of a statement (e.g., largely, fairly, quite, rounders that indicate approximation (e.g., about, around, broadly), and plausibility hedges that signal plausible assumption (e.g., could, may, probably).

Boosters show that the writer chooses to narrow down the possible diverse positions and demonstrate his/her certainty and strong belief to propositions. Mirroring those of hedges, three subtypes were identified: intensity boosters which amplify the strength of a statement (e.g., actuall, indeed, truly), extremity boosters which signal the upper edge of a continuum (e.g., most, always, never) and certainty boosters which imply writers' epistemic conviction (e.g., definite, evidently, show).

Attitude markers express writers affective, rather than cognitive, atitudes toward propositions. Attitude markers can function to modify assssment (e.g., desirable, aropriate, remarkable), significance (e.g., important, useful, essentilly) and emotion (e., amazed, disappointed, fortunately).

Self-mention concerns the degree of explicit authorial presence in the text measured by the frequency of frst-person pronouns and possessive adjectives, namely, I, me, my, mine, and exclusive we (our, us).

Afterwards, we verified each stance item manually and eliminated entries that do not function as actual stance markers. For instance, in (1), the verb shown means display in a literal sense, but in (2), show conveys the writer's epistemic certainty and ful commitment t his/her findings. Therefre, only (2) was coded as booster. Likewise, could in (3) is merely used as a modal term while it expresses the writers withdrawal of commitment t the statement in (4). In thi case, could in (3) was removed and (4) was counted as hedge. Regarding sef-mention, inclusive we in (5) was excluded because it encompasses both the writer and the reader to create a sense of shared involvement, while exclusive we in (6) was counted since it refers to the writer alone and excludes the reader to establish the writer's authorial persona. The stance features generated from our corpora are provided in Appendixes A and B.

To ensure reliability of the manual screening, the first two authors independently examined $1 0 \%$ of the concordances, and then discussed and resolved the disagreements through discussion. The inter-rater reliability (calculated via SPss 19) was found to be $\mathrm { K a p p a } = 0 . 9 5$ signifying a high level of agreement between the two raters. Then the second author manually examined the remaining data. Finally, requency counts of each stance category and subcategory were normalized to a rate per 1o0,o00 words. After verifying data normalit, ANOVAs (with Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were conducted via SPs to identify any significant differences among the three time ris. ddtionll, tts were pefmed  dent pont sttisica diffeces bewthe corpora.ffec ize or the ANOVAs and t-tests were calculated using partial eta squared $( \eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } )$ and Cohen's $d$ respectively.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. A diachronic overview

Table 2 provides an overview of the stance markers in the corpora spanning the past 30 years. Comparing the two corpora, we find that Chinese students (CMDC) employ les stance markers than RA writers (RADC) in each time period. This finding is consistent with Xu's (2015), meaning that Chinese students are less willing to present authorial stance in the discussion than expert writers.

Diachronicall, the RA expert corpus demonstrates a consistent pattern, with minimal change observed in the normalized frequencies of stance markers per text acros the three decades (12.23, 10.55, and 11.45 respectively), indicating that there is no discernible downward tendency in presenting authorial stance in applied linguistics. This finding appears to contradict the results reported by Hyland and Jiang (2016). However, this inconsistency may arise from the diffrent data used in our study and theirs: our study focses speficall on the ussion while theirs ompasses the entire texts. As mentioned rlier, dicssion is the part of an RA that exhibits the most extensive use f stance resources. Even though there might be an increase of "more empirically grounded and quantitative studies that restrict opportunitie for more extensive overt stance-taking in the discipline ibidi, p. 258), the communicative purpose of discusion impels writers to constantly resort to stance resources to craft arguments for the significance of their findings. The student corpus displays a seemingly declining trend, with the numerical results indicating a decrease from 10.11 stance markers per text in 1991-2000 to 9.95 in 2001-2010 and then 7.76 in 2011-2020. However, this diffrence did not reach statistical significance $( p = . 1 1$ $\eta _ { p } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 5 \mathrm { ) }$ , potentially due to substantial individual variations, as indicated by the large standard deviations within each decade ( $\mathrm { \pmb { S D s } } = 4 . 7 4$ , 5.89, and 3.44, respectively). Such insignificant downward change in students' use of stance makers in the discussion is, again, dueto the fact that stance markers play a particularly important rol in achieving the persuasive purpose of the discussion. Nevertheless the noticeable decline in Chinese students' utilization of stance resources in contrast to the minimal change in RA writers use discloses students incapacity in establishing evaluative positions and navigating their own voices within the broader context of the research community (Geng & Wharton, 2016), which is cearly inconducive for building coherent arguments in the discussion writing.

# 4.2. Changing patterns of stance markers

# 4.2.1. Changes of stance markers across corpus

Table 3 presents the frequency of four stance resources in the two corpora, showing that hedges are the most commonly utilized resource by both student and expert writers followed by boosters, self-mentions, and attitude markers. We found seasoned writers employed more hedges than Chinese students in all three time periods and such discrepancy reached statistical significance in 2011-2020 $( t = - 2 . 1 8 , p = . 0 3 )$ . This finding matches with Hyland and Milton's (1997) and Lee and Deakin's (2016) that successful academic writers use significantly more hedges than les-successful writers, implicating that Chinese postgraduates are les adept at hedging their statements to align with readers when interpreting their research results.

Attitude markers are the least used by both groups of writer. Different from what was found by Crosthwaite et al.(2017) and Lee and Deakin (2016), the Chinese students are found to be es willing to convey their attitudes than RA writers in each time period and such discrepancy reached statistical significance in 1991-2000 $( t = - 2 . 1 4$ $p = . 0 4$ $d = 0 . 5 5$ ) and 2011-2020 $( t = - 3 . 1 0 , p = . 0 0 3$ $d =$ 0.79). We know that attitude markers are direct and explicit evaluative resources to encode attitudes, therefore, this finding suggests that Chinese MA students tend to avoid straightforward demonstration of personal valuation, which, again, i inconduciveto effective discussion writing because interpreting research results unavoidably involves subjective evaluation. Chinese students' reluctance to encode atitudes may be attributed to their apprenticeship status in the academic community, where they may feel uncertain or even intimidated when expressing personal asessment of research outcomes in the presence of their \*critical' expert audience, namely, supervisors and committe examiners. RA writer, in contrast, may feelobliged to show their evaluativeattitudes when constructing arguments in the discussin in order to project a professional persona to gain acceptance from the gatekeepers of publication, such as editors and peer reviewers.

Chinese students and RA writers use of boosters and self-mention present a less uniform picture and it is hard to tell which group uses them more or les frequently than the other over the past 30 years (Table 3). No significant difference i observed between the two groups in the us of boosters. Buti is noteworth that expert writer use elf-mention significantly more frequenly (2.06 per text) than student writers (0.66 per text) $( t = - 3 . 4 3$ $p = . 0 0 1 \AA$ with a quite large effect size $\stackrel { \cdot } { d } = 0 . 8 9 $ in the most recent decade of 2011-2020. The fluctuating occurrences of booster ad self-mention across time can be bettr undersood from a more fcused dachronic angle in the next section.

# 4.2.2. Changes of stance markers over time

As Fig. 1 displays, stance features in the two corpora do not exhibit aconsistent directional change over time. Specifically, Chinese students' utilization of hedges, boosters, and attitude markers frst underwent a slight increase then followed by a sharp decline Whereas self-mention exhibited a linear decrease over the three decades. In contrast, RA writers use of hedges and atitude markers demonstrated a continuous decline while their use of boosters and self-mention unfolded a zigzag pattern: a modest decrease frst, followed by a mild increase for boosters, and a substantial surge for self-mention.

In terms of mean frequency, Chinese students' employment of hedges dropped by $1 9 \%$ from 5.69 in the first decade to 4.60 in the third decade, and this sharp declining tendency had started from the second decade (5.9) (Fig. 1). The decline i also evident among expert writers, whose employment of hedges dropped from 7.40 in the first decade to 6.61 in the second decade and further t 6.20 in the third decade, presenting a continuous downward curve as depicted in Fig. 1. This result seems consistent with Hyland and Jiang's (2018) finding that RA writers use of hedges decrased in applied linguisic from 1965 to 2015. However, our further ANOVA post-hoc tests indicate that neither Chinese students' nor RA writers' decreasing use of hedges reached statistical significance (see Table 4). Therefore, it would be safer to conclude that both expert and Chinese novice writers exhibit agenerally consistent usage of hedges in the structural part of discussion from 1991 to 2020.

The steady use of hedges by both RA writers and Chinese students in the discussion is not surprising as academic argumentation aims for open-minded negotiation rather than unilateral imposition. Hedges alow writers to open up dialogic space with alternative opinions and help them construct a measured epistemic stance to shield off possile criticisms when they are interpreting their findings. In spite of the growing aplication of technology in data measurement and expansion of quantitative research using hard science methods and approaches in applied linguistics over the past decades (Hyland & Jiang, 2016), the persuasive purpose of discussion requires writers to utilize hedges to soften their tone and deploy circumspect arguments even when discussing their data-based "hard' results.

As shown by Fig. 1 and Table 4, Chinese students' and RA writers' utilization of slf-mention underwent a notable change in the past 30 years. Chinese students' use f elf-mention decreased significantly from 1.51 in the irst period to 0.66 in the third period $\left( p = \right.$ .01). Their diminishing authorial presence, especiall since the second decade, may be atributed to their apprenticeship identities in the academic community, who may avoid overt intrusion to the text given the perceived informality, subjectivity, and personal nature of slf-referential pronouns (Crosthwaite & Jiang, 2017). Another plausible explanation lies in the lind review and external audit that have been implemented on MA theses in the recent decade, which bring stricter supervision on thesis qualit and broad readership for the theses. Consequently, students may tun even more cautious and reluctant to make visiblepresence to take responsibilit for their epistemic claims. Students growing tendency to conceal themselves, however, deserves attention from practitioners of EAP pedagogy since appropriate "foregrounding" of authorial voice is necessary for making compelling arguments in the discussion.

In contrast, RA authors demonstrate a significant increase in self-mentions from 2001 to 2010 to 2011-2020 $\left( p = . 0 4 \right)$ . This finding is different from Hyland and Jiang's (2018), which however, is not unexpected. As Hyland and Jiang (2018) pointed out, major changes have taken place in the publication circle. For example, -journals with wide and fast circulations have replaced the traditional physical journals since the 21st century, this change has led to the vast expansion of audience for RAs. Moreover, under the current context of ever-growing competition and rocketing research works for publication, institutional measurement imperatives for researchers are becoming even more demanding which favor publications with high impact and citations, thus prompting collaboration and co-authorship in research practices. These changes, to some extent, may have spurred RA writers to assert a more prominent presence when interpreting their data and making novel claims in order to obtain more recognition, visibility, citations, and credits from peers of the community (Hyland & Jiang, 2016).

Both expert and Chinese novice writers exhibit a consistent usage of boosters and atitude markers in general across the three decades (Table 4). But i deserves mentioning that students' use of attitude markers decreased significantly from 0.89 to 0.53 from 2001 to 2020 $\left( p = . 0 3 \right)$ . We think this trend isatributable to the instruction factor. As mentioned earlier, the MA program to which the Chinese students enrolled has started to ffer English academic writing course around the year o00. Since then, students have begun to receive professional training on academic writing and have greater exposure and easier aes to academic writing because of the wide distribution of e-journals. As a result, they may have become more aware of and exposed to the impersonalized, reserved, and cautious style featuring academic reasoning. Such awareness would indirectly lead to students refrainment from excessive use of attitude markers signaling their acculturalization to the academic iscourse community. Notwithstanding, Chinese students growing caution and prudence in overt expresion of atitude can creat difficulty for projecting a professional and confident writer image, especiall in the writing of discussionwhere authorial voice is particularly crucial. This isue wil be further ilustrated in ction 4.3.

# 4.3. Changes of preferred forms of stance markers over time

# 4.3.1. Hedges

Hedges address the propositional aspect of stance, allowing writers to demonstrate a partial commitment to a claim and thereby fostering expanded dialogic spaces with the reader. The frequencies of the various subtypes of hedges are presented in Table 5, revealing that plausbility hedges dominate both corpora and al time periods. This prevalence is consistent with Hyland and Zou's (2021) finding, indicating that Chinese students and RA writers primarily employ hedges to attenuate their epistemic certainty regarding a proposition, thus acknowledging the existence of potential alternative perspectives. Notably, RA writers consistently employed a significantly higher number of plausibility hedges than Chinese students in 1991-2000 $( t = - 2 . 3 8 , p = . 0 2 $ $d = 0 . 6 2 \mathrm { \AA }$ and 2011-2020 $t = - 2 . 9 8$ $p = . 0 0 4$ $d = 0 . 0 . 7 7 )$ . A similar trend is observed in 2001-2010, although it did not reach statistical significance $( p = . 0 7$ $d = 0 . 4 7 $ . These findings suggest that Chinese students are less skilled in engaging with readers when discussing results given that plausibility hedges not only demonstrate writers' reservations about the acuracy of statements but also facilitate "expressing a more balanced and engaging tone by moderating the way the speaker conveys ideas" (Hyland & Zou, 2021, p. 50).

To gain a closer look, we listed the Top-10 most favored forms of hedges in Table 6 according to their normalized frequencies per 10,000 words. For verbs/verb phrases such as suggest indicat, appear, and tend to which can appear in the corpora in different grammatical variants, we subsumed the variants under one word, in accordance with Hyland and Jiang (2016). Therefore, the base form of the word ., uggest) with the totl frequency dded up from the variants frequencie ., uggest, sugts, sugsted) were presented in Table 6, as wel as in the ollowing Tables 8 and 12. Then for clrity, frequencies of each grammatical variant were also listed.

We can see from Table 6 that the majority of the Top-10 hedges are plausibility hedges, with the exception of the downtoner quite. which appears in the student corpus in 1991-200. Among them, may, might, and would are the most popular hedges among the student writer acrossthe three decades.Differently, RA writers' most favored hedging forms are may, might, would and suggest. In both corpora, may and might are often used to explain the osble reasons behind the indings (7), and would i mostly utilized to soften the tone of assertions to shade off potential questioning from readers (8). Diachronically, though may, might and would remain the most popular hedging forms in both corpora, their combined frequencies have declined over the past 30 years (Table 6). This finding aligns with Hyland and Jiang's (2016) observation that there has been a general decline of hedge forms that expres possbilities (may, might) and hypotheticality (would) among RA writers in applied linguistics.

(7) The reason may lie with the inability of most students to logicallycompute the compatiblestatement with the original sen. tences. (1998-CMDC) (8) Other things being equal, deeper levels of processing would require longer processing times. (2009-CMDC)

Similar to what was found by Hyland and Jiang (2016) that sugest and likely were the two hedge forms to become increasingly popular among RA writers in applied linguistics from 1965 to 2015, the frequencies of sugest and likely in our expert corpus rose steadily over the past three decades, with suggest reaching the Top-2 place and likely the Top-8 place in the most recent decade of 2011-2020. This diachronic change supports Hyland and Jiang's view that the common hedging forms in applied inguistics have shifted towards \*those that carry more speculative judgments, predicated on a reference to the uncertainty of human evaluation' (p. 260) such as suggest and likely, as exemplified in (9) and (10).

The plausibility hedge form could is another highly popular choice among the expert writers throughout the 30 years, who typically use could to soften the tone when making a claim (1. In contrast, could only appears in the lst in 2011-2020 in Chinese students dicussions. Addtionaly, pear, which i often useo inoduce writers provisional statments to opendicursive space wth readers (12), is one more hedging form favored only by RA writer as it is not in thestudents Top-10 list. These suggest that hinese students have rather limited vocabulary to construe epistemic uncertainty in academic writing compared to expert writers. This limitation may be attributed to the predominant focus of English academic writing courses in China on formatting aspects of thesis writing, such as general layout and citation style, with litle to no emphasis on training in academic vocabulary accumulation and stance expression (Xie, 2016). On the other hand, the hedging form should that expresses writers' assumption is much more popular among the Chinese students than the expert writers: the frequencies of should are 10.69, 12.4 and 10.5 respectively in the three periods in the student corpus and 9.41, 7.64, and 6.67 in the expert corpus. Since L2 students re prone to mother tongue transfer, Chinese students' favor of should could bea transfer of its Chinese counterpart Ying Gai (it), one of the most frequent words in Chinese academic writing Long & Xu, 2010), which conveys writers' uncertainty of the epistemic truth of a claim (13).

The frequencies of rounders in both corpora are low and have steadily diminished over the 30 years. This is unsurprising since rounders like about, around typically involve approximation of numerical data (14) and discusion generally requires precise reporting of numerical information. Chinese students and RA writers usage of downtoners witness mild decrease over the years, which are mainly used to\*add precision to statements that re unproven or protect the writer against inaccuracy Hyland & Zou, 2021, p. 50)as

# 4.3.2. Boosters

In contrast to hedges, boosters function to indicate writers' certainty regarding a proposition and elevate the significance, uniqueness, o originality of the propositions Hyland, 2005a), thus contracting spaces for alternative voices. The dominant subtype of boosters in both corpora and acros all time periods is certainty boosters, ollowed by intensity boosters and extremity boosters (Table 7). This implies that Chinese students and RA writers primarily utilize boosters to express their epistemic convictions in the discussion. Generally, Chinese students use of certainty boosters excel RA writers in each period, whereas their use of the other two types is les frequent than RA writers. It i noteworth that RA writers employed a greater number of intensity bosters than student writers in 2011-2020 $( t = - 2 . 1 0$ $p = . 0 4$ $d = 0 . 5 5$ , with a similar trend observed in 1991-2000, albeit only approaching statistical significance $( t = - 2 . 0 0$ A $p = . 0 5$ $d = 0 . 5 0 \AA$

Table 8 shows that the two most preferred forms among both groups of writers are the certainty boosters find and show, which are primarily used to indicate writers' ull commitment to their claims by presenting the information as factual without any need for negotiation as in (16) and (17). It is worth noting that although the overall frequency of boosters declined in the two corpora as discussed in Section 4.2, the popularit of the empiricall oriented booster find has progressvely grown over the past decades in both corpora and the frequency of another empirically oriented booster demonstrate (18) has also steadily increased in the RA corpus, indirectl suggesting a move from "a personal belief toward more empirical and data-supported commitments to claims" (Hyland & Jiang, 2016, p.11) resulted from the growing number of data-driven quantitative research in applied linguistics.

(18) The lack of mai effect for clas or interaction demonstrated that there was no difference in responses with respect to class and type of verb. (RADC-2011)

Another interesting finding is about the certainty booster must a strong word which implies writers unwavering commitment to the statement to reinforce the truth-value of aproposition or claim as in (19). We can see that must is prevalent in Chinese MA thesis discussins in 1991-200, ranking the fourth, but then its frequency plunged significantly from 3.98 in the first decade to 1.71 in the second decade, and finall dropped out of the list in 2011-2020. RA writers use of must also experienced a decline from 4.93 in 1991-2000 to 2.75 in 2011-2020, but it has consistently remained a popular booster form over the 30 years (Table 8). The waning popularity of must among the Chinese students since 200 may be attributed to the EAP writing instruction in China. Chinese students have long been criticized for overusing must i their English writing, which is atransfer of its popular Chinese counterpart Bi Xu () ) (Xu, 2015). Therefore, it is natural for intructors to discourage students from using it. However, this could also lead to over-correction from the students, who may deliberately avoid using must even when the use of i could sometimes help convey their strong epistemic convictions of a claim, as RA writers would often do (20).

(19) So the teacher must be wel cognizant of the role that listener's interests and prior knowledge play in the interpretation of listening materials. (1997-CMDC)   
(20) It must be acknowledged, however, that the correlations between teachers' ratings and FDI measures in the current study were low. (2000-RADC)

The only form of intensity bosters which Chinese students favor is actuall, which is primarily used to amplify the strength of a statement (21). In contras, RA writers use a variety of intensity forms with in fact nd indeed being more popular than actualy (22)

(21) This i actall in ccodance with our proposal of the in-rsonof context-sensitivity in that to a certain extent, it also reflects the competition of different contextual factors in arousing L2 learners' sensitivity to them. (2009-CMDC)

# 4.3.3. Self-mention

In the humanties and social sciences, the use of the firs person is closely associated with writers intention to alig themseles with an argument or to establish credibility for an individual perspective (Hyland & Jiang, 2016). From Table 9, we can see that the plural forms of self-mention, specifically we, or, and us, are the most favored ones by both Chinesestudents and RA writers over the span of 30 years. However, since 2011, RA writers have consistently employed these plural forms significantly more frequently than Chinese students $( t = - 3 . 7 7$ $p < . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 9 7 $ ). On the other hand, the singular forms of self-mention are sparingly used by both groups, while other forms such as the author are exclusively employed by Chinese students.

Chinese students preference for plural forms over the singular ones in their single-authored theses may be attributed to the in. fluence of the traditional Chinese culture, which values modesty and collectivism and discourages overt self-promotion (Hu & Cao, 2011). Thus, they are prone to use plural forms to downplay their individual role in the thesis writing (Hu & Cao, 2011). Another possible cause is that they usethe plural forms as a deliberate strategy to avoid potential questioning from the readers, who are experts in the field (23). On the other hand, the combined frequency of we, our and us has significantly dropped in the student corpus from 42.09 $\mathbf { \ 3 0 . 0 2 } + 1 0 . 9 7 + 1 . 1 0 )$ in 1991-2000 to 15.38 $( 8 . 9 4 + 6 . 4 4 + 0 )$ in 2011-2020 (Table 10). Chinese students' decreasing usage of plural forms over time could be related with the EAP instruction in China, which emphasizes the use of objective expressons and minimizing authors' roles in academic writing (Crosthwaite & Jiang, 2017).

In contrast, the combined frequency of the plural forms dramaticlly increased in RA discussions, with an upsurge from 39 (23.31 $+ 1 5 . 2 4 \substack { + 0 . 4 5 } )$ in 1991-2000 to 61.18 $3 1 . 1 8 + 2 9 . 0 2 \substack { + 0 . 9 8 } )$ in 2011-2020. This soar is clearly attributable, as noted by Hyland and Jiang (2016), to the growing trend towards multi-authored articles in applied linguistics resulted from career pressures which emphasize collaboratie writing and co-authorship, as collaboratie efforts enable reearchersto effctively plit the work to speed up progres and publish more artice. The massive rise of plural forms can also be attributed to the development of a promotional and consumer-oriented discourse which impels writers to construct strong images of selves and identities among the readers (Hogler & Gross 2009). To respond to the imperatie of high impact from institutional assessment and the ever-growing career pressure of "publish or perish, RA writers have to find ways to make their work more aessbleto the audience and make themselves visible via self-mention so as to highlight their innovative contribution, especially when discusing and interpreting the results in the discussion (24).

(23) However, we tentatively asume that the on-line backward inferences as a whole and reinstatements may be facilitative to the memorability of individual events of states in a story. ( CMDc-1999 )   
(24) We interpret this finding not as showing that collocations are easier than believed before, but as showing that derivative and multiple-meanings knowledge are harder than previously thought. (2020-RADC)

An interesting finding is also detected, that is, Chinese students occasionally use other forms of self-mention such as the author and the author's to refer to the authorship from a third-person perspective (25), which are absent in the experts' use. In addition, the students sem increasingly prefer the form the author over time, particularly during 2011-2020 (2.86), in contrast to 1991-2000 (1.23) or 2001-2010 (1.09). This tendency further indicates Chinese students' deliberate avoidance of explicit portrayal of authorial voices and withdrawal from commitment (u, 2015) in the discussion, who may consider using the third person form the author as a safer and less visible and intrusive way for self-mention.

(25) Looking back to previous studies, the author finds the same phenomenon that EFL leaners in whose mother tongue there is no article system use less English articles than English native speakers has also been noticed in Bergeron-Matoba (2007). (2013- CMAC)

# 4.3.4. Attitude markers

Attitude markers, operating within the attitudinal dimension of tance, encode writers' atitudinal and emotional meanings and are typically sigaled by verbs (disagree, prefer, adjectives (important, convincing), adverbs (crefull, comprehensively), and sentence adverbs (fortnately, hopefuly), etc. As Table 11 demonstraes the two groups of writers exhibit anirregular pattern in their usage of the three types of atitude markers over the course of 30 years. In general, theassessment type is the least frequently used by both groups, and a clear declining trend is observed. This finding may seem counter-intuitive, as it is commonly assumed that "evaluating the novelty, usefulnes, or contribution of the rerch findings iscealy a key featre of rearch (Hyland & Zou, p.50), especill in the context of the discussion part. Nevertheless, RA writers use this type more frequently than Chinese students, reaching statistical significance in the period of 2001-2010 $( t = - 2 . 4 6$ $p = . 0 2$ $d = 0 . 0 6 5$ . RA writers often utilize the assessment type to highlight what they perceive as interesting, unusual, or valuable findings, as exemplified in (26) and (27). Furthermore, Table 12 reveals that the assessment form interesting remains one of the most commonly used forms among both groups throughout the three decades.

(26) Another interesting finding of this study is that adult L2 learners appear to follow lexical learning patterns similar to those followed by L1 learners. (2009-RADC)   
(27) The hypothesized model showed a reasonably good fit to the data (both full sample and subsample) and explained more than 90 per cent of the variance in L2 reading. (2017-RADC)

The significance type of attitude markers, which are mainly used to draw readers attention to the social value of a research matter are more frequently employed in the RA corpus than the student corpus. However, no significant diachronic trend can be detected in either corpus over the 30 years. Referring to Table 12, we can observe that the most popular attitude marker in both corpora is the significance form of important, although Chinese students use important les frequently than RA writers. Chinese students often use important to collocate with role and factor to express positieattitudes toward the research entity in relation to ther research findings (28), while experts employ importnt with a wider range of collocations, who are fond of uilizing the patten t is important o note hat ... to draw the reader's attention to the research finding (29).

(28) .. indicating that phonology plays a more important role in the organization of L2 mental lexicon and that the semantic network in the learners is underdeveloped compared with that of the native speakers. (2006-CMDC)   
(29) It is also important to note the results of this study are not representative of the whole population of ELLs mainstreamed to upper elementary classrooms. (2014-RADC)

The emotion attitude markers express writers fective position of a claim or situation. Once again, RA writers employ this type more frequently than Chinese students and this discrepancy reached statistical significance in 2011-2020 $( t = - 3 . 3 2$ $p = . 0 0 2$ $d =$ 0.86). Notabl, een, expected, and surprising re the most preferred emotio forms among both groups over the course of 30 years. This aligns with our expectation since inthe writig of discussion, writers oten need to comment on the anticipated nature of the research findings in relation to shared common knowledge with the readers (Hyland & Jiang, 2016), as in (30) and (31). However, it is found that Chinese students use thee atitdinal forms at much lower frequency than expert writer. This can be atriuted to their status of novice writers, which could lead to their hesitation or a leser ability to formulate prior hypotheses and expectations regarding research findings, unlike experienced writers. Additionall, we observed that Chinese students rarely express negative emotions and attitudes in the discussion, as RA writers would do (32).

(30) It might be expected that the English L1 children would sustain their relative superiority in these language-related skills even after a full further year at school. (2001-RADC)   
(31) In other cases, it led to surprising results, which challenge typical views of vocabulary. (2020-RADC)   
(32) This is critical to the development of self-regulated learning (Wenden, 198) but unfortunately is not actuall incorporated into most textbook listening activities (Mendelsohn, 1998). (2003-RADC)

Another common problem is that sometimes Chinese students display confusing and ambiguous attitudinal stances towards the research matter. For example, in3), mportant signals strong positiecoloring, which i heightened by the certainty boosters pointed out and must. However, this atitudinal prosody is disrupted by the reporting verb clam as which signifies the writer's doubtul position towards the cited information, thus perplexing the reader and undermining the original argumentative intent. Of course, a possible reason is that many Chinese students may not be fully aware of the subtle evaluative stance conveyed by claim, which again pinpoints the necessity of explicit instruction on stance in academic writing (Xie, 2016).

(33) Strategies for effective guessing clearly are important. Alderson and Alvarez (1979, Se from Wen, 1997; for a review) pointed out that in comprehension, the learner must use guesing and inferencing strategies. Rubin and Thompson (1982, See from Wen, 1997) claimed that to be a more successful learner, one should learn to make intelligent guesses. (2002-CMDC)

# 5. Conclusion

This study has sought to identify changes in stance markers in the discussion of MA theses and RAs in applied linguistics from 1991 to 2020. Findings unearthed by this study disclose the dynamic evolving nature of stance-taking in academic writing. One major finding is that Chinese students consistently use fwer stance markers than RA writer across the three time periods, indicating thir reluctance to present authorial stance in discussion writing. This could be atributed to factors such as their novice writer identities, their lack of epistemic confidence, the target audience of theses, the increasingly stringent internal and external supervision, and EAP writing instruction. Diachronically though without stistica signficance, Chinee students employment of stane markers displays a declining trend over the past 30 years whereas minimal change is observed in RA writers use of stance markers. Therefore, we feel hesitant to conclude that RA writers in applied linguistics have become les willing to expres evaluative stances as some researchers would argue.

More specificall, both groups' use of hedges exhibit a consistent patten over the 30 years, which is against Hyland and Jiang's (2018)argument that there has bee a more assrtive claim-making practice in applied liguisics. This contradictory finding implies that the communicative purpose of discussion plays a major role in writers utilization of hedging resources when interpreting and discussing their results in spit of the growing number of data-driven, quantitative-oriented research in the field. The most divergent changing pattrn between the two groups lies in self-mention. Chinese students' self-mention has declined dramaticlly and continuously over the three decades whereas RA writers use of self-mention, especially the plural forms, soared during 2011-2020. The diminishing visibility of Chinese students can be attibuted to their cognition of apprenticeship status and the changing thesis supervision practices since the new century, while RA writers upsurging employment of slf-mention is aresult of the interplay of the changing publication pracices, increasing demand and pressure from career as well as the trendy collaboration in the recent decade in applied linguistics.

A close examination of the preferred forms of stance markers unveils the impact of EAP instruction on Chinese students'stance. taking practice. For example, the boosting form must has fallen out of favor since the offering of English academic writing course in the program. The EAP writing instruction could also be a highly plausible reason for the significant decrease of their use of attitude markers since 2001. It is possible that they deliberately avoided using these overt and \*risky" subjective stance resources so as to comply with the "objective' conventions of academic writing as advocated by the EAP instruction.

Our diachronic analysis not only reveals the changing patterns of stance construction in discussion writing, but also discloses the problematic use of stance markers by Chinese students that would concern EAP writing practitioners. For instance, Chinese students significantly fewer use of stance expressions in general than expert writer, particularly in hedges and self-mention, ther restrictive vocabulary to encode atitudes as well as their incongruous demonstration of stance positions, ll indicate their incapacity to take appropriate evaluative stances towards reearch findings. Such a usage pattern of stance markers is not conducive to build persuasive arguments in discussons and to project a professional and confident writer image, one that is not afraid of expressing subjective attitudes towards research entities especially when making subjective interpretations of research findings (Kawase, 2015).

Results generated by this study could have some pedagogical implications for English academic writing. irstly, considering the influence of instruction and Chinese students' problematic use of stance resources,it is strongly recommended that practitioners of English academic writing pedagogy cary out explicit intruction on stance construction. Secondly, since a sensitivit to the diachronic changes of stance makers canreinforestudents control to the cultural and linguistc resources neessary for them to engage critically with texts' (Hyland & Jiang, 2018, p.29), EAP writing practitioners should raise students awarenessof the changing patterns of stance construction in the field, so that students would not develop any rigid understanding of stance-taking in academic writing. Moreover, RA expert writers skilled use of tance markers uncovered by this study can facilitat ractitioners explicit instruction on stance. For instance, the preferred forms of stance markers can be incorporated into the instruction on stance vocabulary. In addition, the dis covery of students problematic use of tanceresource can direct instructors' atention to and focus on the weak aeas and implement pertinent instruction and guidance.

Given the relatively smal corpus size and the focus on the one structural part of discussion, findings of the present study need to be interpreted reasonably and wisely. With an expanded data, future studies can generate more generalizable findings. Second, though this corpus-based investgation generated a general pattern of writers stance construction, a fullr knowledge and thorough under. standing of researchers' stance-taking practice in academic writing would require further qualitative analyses.
