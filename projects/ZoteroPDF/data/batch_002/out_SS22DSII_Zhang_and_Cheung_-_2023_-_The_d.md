Most existing English for Academic Purposes (EAP) studies from a discourse analysis perspective adopt a discipline-based framework that foregrounds the influence of discipline on linguistic features. However, this practice may become unproductive and impractical, given the increasing interdisciplinarity of research. Informed by APPRAISAL theory, this study used Cluster Analysis and identified five different linguistic profiles in research article (RA) discussions ${ \bf ( n = 2 4 0 ) }$ from four disciplines: Chemistry, Geoscience, Education, and Management. The distinctions of the profiles cannot be fully explained by disciplinary characteristics. Instead, they may be shaped by the interplay of various factors, including 1) positively appraising the practical significance of the research, 2) mitigating claims and addressing alternative voices, 3) drawing upon existing knowledge, 4) reiterating experimental procedures and real-world observations, 5) idiosyncratic styles, and 6) journal specificities. The findings contribute to a new understanding of linguistic features and variations of research writing and offer empirical support to the recent call for reexamining the foregrounding of disciplinary influence in writing research. The identified linguistic profiles and shaping factors can guide the teaching and learning of the different ways to write publishable RAs across disciplines.

# 1. Introduction

English for Aademic Purposes (EAP research is fruitful in providing knowledge of the linguistic features and variations of research articles (RAs) to guide the teaching and learning of research writing in both first language (L1) and second language (L2) contexts. Most existing research foregrounds the influence of disciplinary norms and conventions in shaping writing for publication and seeks to identify the conventionalized discourse of various disciplines (e.g., Dong & Buckingham, 2018; Hyland, 2004; Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019; Triki, 2021). Comparative studies following the discipline-based framework are particularly productive in revealing significant differences in research writing from disciplines with distinct characteristics. However, the boundaries of disciplines are not demarcated. There are substantial overlaps between disciplines and internal fragmentation within a single discipline (Becher & Trowler, 2001). The increasing trend of interdisciplinarity also further complicates the picture. Consequently, there is a recent cal to re-examine the discipline-based framework in writing research and beyond (Kaufhold & McGrath, 2019; Trowler, 2014). This study aims to provide empirical evidence to support this call. A corpus-based approach was adopted to explore RA discussions from four different disciplines to identif linguisic features and variations that cannot be explained by disciplinary factors alone. The findings contribute to our knowledge of research writing across disciplines from an alternative perspective.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Linguistic features and variations across disciplines

Extant research suggests that the distinct characteristics of the soft and hard disciplines imprint linguistic variations of research writing. Soft disciplines lack standardized research approaches and create knowledge through cognitive interpretation, intellectual negotiation, and theoretical reasoning, which resulted in a heterogeneous readership bringing various criteria and intellectual frameworks to the reading (Bazerman, 1988; Becher & Trowler, 2001; Charles 2007; Hyland, 2005; Swales & Feak, 2012). To make claims more acceptable to a heterogeneous audience potentiall holding different positions, researchers in softdisciplines tend to be tentative, discursively elaborated, and interpersonally involved in their writing (Hyland, 2005, 2008; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Jiang & Hyland, 2018). Hard disciplines build knowledge on empirical evidence derived from more standardized approaches, such as experiments and replications, which resulted in highly cumulative knowledge and a homogeneous readership (Bazerman, 1988; Becher & Trowler, 2001; Charles, 2007; Hyland, 2005; Swales & Feak, 2012). Thus, researchers in hard disciplines write in a highly formalized style with greater certainty, rely on consensual knowledge rather than discoursal cues, and minimize the presence of authorial voice to appear "objective (Gao, 2016; Hyland, 2008; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Jiang, 2017; Jiang & Hyland, 2020; Peacock, 2010).

Specific disciplines also demonstrate their own distinctive characteristics. For example, Economics research builds on observations, statistical tool, and verifications of models, leading to frequent uses of "directies' to guide readers through mathematical reasoning (Dontcheva-Navratilova, 2021). Medical RAs often present findings from experiments and clinical tests as accredited facts and deploy significantly fewer evaluative \*that (e.g, "the author believe that ..) (Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019). Business RAs contain more metadiscursive nouns attributing power to corporations as their research value lies in informing corporate decisions (Jiang & Hyland 2018). Researchers in disciplines such as Electrical Engineering prefer writing styles that appeal to potential sponsors and non-specialists due to their increasing involvement in commercial and entrepreneurial endeavors (Hyland & Jiang, 2021). These findings, to certain degre, testify to the discipline-based framework and shed light on discipline-specific linguistic characteristics.

# 2.2. Linguistic variations that obscure disciplinary boundaries

Despite widely cited discipline-specific characteristics, evidence also points to linguistic variations that obscure disciplinary boundaries. Some argue that the hard-soft division may neither fit as a dichotomy nor a continum, and hasty generalization of research findings to represent specific disciplines should be avoided (Triki, 2021). For example, whil some studies show that sot disciplines often cite more, others found that Applied Linguistics has a comparable citation density with some hard disciplines like Medicine (Hu & Wang, 2014; Hyland, 1999; Thompson & Tribble, 2001). The diachronic changes in the linguistic features of RAs sometimes bring closer formerly distant disciplines but set similar ones apart. Over the past decades, research writing has become less formal, especiall in hard disciplines (Hyland & Jiang, 2017). Some hard disciplines, such as Biology and Electrical Engineering, gradually adopt more features related to reader visbility and interpersonal engagement, previously considered a writing style of the soft disciplines (Hyland & Jiang, 2016). Some soft disciplines, such as Applied Linguistics, have increased the proportional use of unattended references, which are more frequent in hard disciplines Jiang & Hyland, 2020). Countering evidence, however, suggests a decrease in unattended references across disciplines to avoid ambiguity and increase the clarity of texts (Dixon, 2022). The use of first-person pronouns has increased in both soft and hard disciplines but not in Applied Linguistics (Hyland & Jiang, 2018). This trend may seem surprising as research writing i traditionall considered objective, neutral, and detached, subordinating the researchers voice to nature (Ho0d, 2010; Hyland, 2001; Mauranen & Bondi, 2003). The increase of first-person pronouns may be motivated by the recommendation of publication manuals and high-impact journals, for example, the American Psychological Association's (APA) Publication Manual and the Nature journals (Hu & Cao, 2015; Jin, 2021; Yasuda, 2022). The target journal for publication is one crucial factor influencing the linguistic features of RAs, as those published in high-impact jounals demonstrate distinct writig stles, such as longer and more complex sentences (Lu et al., 2019).

The use f inguistic features may sometimes be highly idiosyncratic. For example, some high-frequency features do not disribute evenly across samples but are highly frequent in some but completely absent in others (Dixon, 2022). The researchers' choice of specific features i not always motivated by the features' discursive function (Jin, 2021). Researchers may strategically choose certan features to complement or compensate for their limited linguistic repertoire, resulting in different writing styles within the same discipline (Zhang & Cheung, 2020). These findings suggest that research writing does not mean sacrificing one's personal voice Jiang & Hyland, 2015). Individual researchers can exploit and manipulate norms and conventions as genres are dynamic and open to changes (Bhatia, 1999; Paltridge, 2012).

The linguistic variations that obscure disciplinary boundaries imply that the discipline-based framework widely adopted in writing research may be inadequate in explaining linguistic variations of RAs. This framework overemphasizes the homogeneity of writing within the same discipline and the heterogeneity of those from different ones (Kaufhold & McGrath, 2019; Trowler, 2014). Given the fragmented internal structure of a discipline, the potential overlaps of diffrent disciplines, and the increasing trend of interdisci. plinary research (Becher & Trowler, 2001; hou et al., 2022), aributing specific linguistic features to the influence of discipline may become unproductive and impractical.

Considering existing findings, this study does not intend to deny discipline as a shaping factor of research writing. However, the discipline-based framework may not be able to identify linguistic variations transcending disciplinary boundaries. The framework entails a top-down approach to pre-group samples acording to disciplines for comparison of group differences, which is unable to identify differences within each group. This study proposes an altenative bottom-up approach to first classfy samples according to their shard inguistic fatre r ingistic profils and then compare the rofiles to uncoer differencs and idtfy ptentil shaping factors. This approach avoids the foregrounding of disciplinary influence and may shed light on interdisciplinary similarities and intradisciplinary differences.

While there are many linguistic features worth exploring to understand research writing, this study chooses APPRAIAL features as the target of analysis. The use of APPRAIsAL features in research writing is closely related to academic persuasion. The current exploration of APPRAIsAL features complements EAP studies investigating other linguistic features (e.g., metadiscourse, syntactic complexity, and informality features) in offering a comprehensive picture of research writing across disciplines.

# 2.3. Research of academic writing from APPRAISAL perspective

In recent years, the APPRAsAL framework (Martin & White, 2005) has become popular in writing research to understand the construction of authorial voice and academic persuasion. This framework includes linguistic features from three broad categories, namely, ATITUDE, ENGAGEMENT, and GRADUATION. ATTITUDE relates to the expression of feeings, including emotional reactions (AFFECT), the judgement of human behavior (JUDGEMENT), and the evaluation of things (APPRECIATION). ENGAGEMENT relates to whether and how authors recognize other voices and take a stance, which can be monoglosic or heteroglossc in orientation. This study focuses on heteroglossic positions only, including denying, countering, concurring, pronouncing, endorsing, justifying, entertaining, and attributing. GRADUArION relates to the up/downgrading of atitudinal meanings according to intensit, quantity, and extent (FORCE) and the sharpening/softening of categorical boundaries (FOCUS).

The situationally appropriate use of APPRArsAL features contributes to effective academic arguments. In student argumentative writing, higher-rated essays employ APPRAISAL feature ifferentl from lower-rated one to construct more mature and sophisticated arguments (Cheung & Low, 2019 Lancaster, 2014; Miller e al., 2014). In research writing, the appropriate use of APPRAISAL features closely links to the rhetorical goals, authors' persuasive strategies, and genre conventions. Significant differences exist across RA sections and the diffeent moves within each section (Chang & Schleppegrel, 2011; Fryer, 2013). ome feaures such as COER and DENY often co-occur, serving as a persuasie strategy to mitigate the appearance of confrontation in addressing alternative claims (Geng & Wharton, 2016; Xu & Nesi, 2019a, 2019b; Zhang & Cheung, 2017). Among the ATTITUDE categorie, APPRECIATION ap. pears more frequently in academic writing than AFFECT and JUDGEMENT (Loi et al., 2016; Xie, 2016; Zhang & Cheung, 2018). The preference for APPRECIATION to express felings as evaluations of things or phenomena represents the institutionalized and nominalized nature facademic enres (Ho0d, 2010; Martin, 200). The use of JUDGEMENT in academic writing mainly serves to evaluate people's intellectual capacity rather than whether people's behavior is moral or ethical (Liu, 2013). Although GRADUATION features are not explicitly evaluative, they can invoke authoria attitudes and strongly guide readers toward an intended stance (Hood, 204, 2010; Yasuda, 2022; Zhang & Cheung, 2018).

While APRAIsAL reearch generated valuable insights to guide the teaching and learning of academic writing, there is a lack of studies to understand potential variations that transcend disciplinary boundaries and potential shaping factors. This study aims to il this research gap by exploring the following two research questions.

1) What are the different patterns of APPRAISAL in RA discussions across disciplines?   
2) What factors may shape the linguistic features and variations of RAs in different discipline!

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpus construction

The research corpus for this study consists f 240 RA discussions from two hard disciplines (Chemistry and Geoscience) and two soft ones (Education and Management). This study focuses on the discussion section because it is where the research is \*most vigorously 'sold" (Hyland, 2009, p. 73) and is among the most challenging sections to write (Flowerdew, 199). The samples were selected from top journals in the isciplines. Two subfields from each discipline were selected to consider the potential influence of sub-disciplines. The selection of journals to represent each subfield was informed by Web of Science (Wos) with crossreference to Scopus and Google Scholar. The Chemistry samples were from the WoS categories of Chemistry (physical) and Chemistry (medicinal). The Geoscience samples were from the categories of Hydrology and Soil Science. The Education samples were from the categories of Education & Educational Research (EER) and Education (special). As the EER is an allinclusive category, this study narrows the focus to journals publishing research addressing technology-assisted teaching and learning. The Management samples were divided according to ther relations to the isciplin of Applied Psychology and Business. t is worth noting that the selected journals ofte fall into multiple WoS categories, indicating the interrelations of seemingly distinct disciplines and their ways of writing. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the sample discussions.

Education and Management research predominantly rely on quantitative methods, so this study did not attempt to draw equal samples from the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms.

# 3.2. Data coding

The target features were coded following a comprehensive description of the APPRAISAL framework (Martin & White, 2005) with some necessary adjustments (Ho0d & Martin, 2005; White, 2012). Table 2summarizes the 18 APPRAISAL features analyzed in this study. The first author coded all the data using the AM corpus tool (0Donnell, 2019. peer coder with a masters degree in Applied Linguistics was trained to code $5 \%$ of the data. The intercoder agreement assessed by Cohen's Kappa is at an acceptable level of 0.829. The first athor oded the data twice at ifferen ittings and afteward cheked llte oded cateorie o guarante th onsistency of the coding.

# 3.3. Statistical analysis

This study adopts Cluster Analysis, which has been adopted fruitflly in studie of different genres, including student argumentations, RAs, and multimodal news discourse (Crossey et al., 2014; Zhang & Cheung, 2020, 2022). Using Cluster Analysis to identify linguistic variations avoids pre-grouping samples according to disciplines. In so doing, the homogeneity of writing in the same discipline is not assumed, and the influence of disciplines on writing is not foregrounded. Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted on the normalized frequencies (per 1000 words) of the 18 APPRAisAL features to eliminate variables demonstrating multicollinearity. All 18 variables were retained using a threshold of $\mathbf { r } < 0 . 9 0$ The normalized frequencies were used as independent variables in the initial hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distance and Ward's methods as the distance measure. Hierarchical clustering begins by assgning all the samples to a cluster of their own and then combines similar clusters into a new one based on their shared linguistic features. The clustering stops when all the discssions are combined into a single cluster. A five-cluster solution was selected for a follow-up cluster analysis to put every discussion into a specific cluster.

A multivariate analysis of variance (MAnovA) was run to identify the inguistic variations of the clusters using the normalized frequencies as dependent variables and the cluster membership as independent variables. The MANOVA results show that nine out of the 18 APPRAISAL features demonstrate significant differences among the clusters $\left( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ . Table 3 presents the MANOVA results.

The clusters with the highest and lowest mean frequencies for each feature were identified. The combination of the features with the highest and lowest mean frequencies represents the linguistic profile of each cluster. Table 4presents the linguistic profiles of the clusters. The profiles imply the potential co-occurrence of APPRAIsAL features and the linguistic characteristic of the clusters.

Last, a discriminant functional analysis (DFA) was conducted to assessthe model's accuracy. DFA can evaluate how accurately the features can predict cluster membership. The normalized frequencies were used as independent variables, whereas the cluster membership was used as dependent variable. The results show that the nine features successully predicted the cluster membershp $( \chi 2 = 7 0 6 . 5 4$ , df $= 1 6$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ). Table 5 presents the estimated accuracy.

# 4. Results

Cluster analysis clssified the sample discussions into five clusters characterized by distinct linguistic profiles. Table 6 presents the make-up of the clusters, which shows that the linguistc variations in terms f the different profiles do not stricl follow the divisionof (sub-)disciplines. The profiles of Clusters 1 and 4 may have closer inks with hard disciplines, as most RAs are from Chemistry and Geoscience. The profileof Cluster 3 may be more closely linked to soft disciplines, as most RAs are from Education and Management. On the one hand, these profiles may attest toiscipline as a shaping factor f rarch writing. On the other hand, they aso indicate the internal fragmentation and overlaps of disciplines, as these profiles only represent $4 4 \%$ of RAs from soft disciplines and $6 3 \%$ of RAs from hard disciplines. The representativeness of Cluster 2 and 5 is unclear. The findings point to complex linguistic variations that obscure disciplinary boundaries. This study did not identify any notable differences between samples from the two research paradigms within Education and Management.

To understand the use of APPRAIsAL features in writing RA discussions, the linguistic profiles of the clusters will be explained following the sequence: 2-5-4-3-1. f fewer than 3RAs from the same sub-disciplie fallinto one cluster, such exceptional cases will not be presented.

# .1. Linguistic profile 2 - intensified positive appraisal of practical significance

The linguistic profile of Cluster (see Table 7) is characterized by the significantly more frequent use of JUDGEMENT, valuation" INTENSIFICATION, "amount", and "distribution' but infrequent use of DENY.

The use of "valuation' features can be linked to the authors' positive apraisal of their research's practical value to establish its significance. For example, the Chemistry RAs primarily report new developments for practical applications, such as molecular probes. bacteria-detecting assays, and biocatalysts. The authors rely on "valuation' features to emphasize the developments' strengths or supreme qualities (see Example [1]).

[1] This sustainable [APPRECIATION: valuation] procedure can be considered a valid [APPRECIATION: valuation] biocatalytic alternative for the preparation of two of the most [INTENSIFICATION] important [APPRECIATION: valuation] classes of molecules in nature: amides and thioesters. (12_CP_NC_202002)

The Education (T) RAs mainly investigate educational phenomena. The authors ofen highlight the research's contributions in offering a more refined understanding of the phenomena to inform educational practices (see Example [2]). Most Education (S) RAs test the efficacy of interventions. The importance of the target skillsor abilities is frequently highlighted to justify the value of the research in providing pedagogical implications (see Example [3]).

[2] Such large-scale quantitative data enabled us to make various robust [APPRECIATION: valuation] and objective [APPRECIATION: valuation] comparisons between the three constructs, between the three stages and between the six universities, providing much-needed [INTENSIFICATION] insight [APPRECIATION: valuation] into the breadth, depth and features of the teachers' online engagement in different stages of BL implementation. (04_EC_IHE_201902)

[3] Given that acquisition of foundational measurement and data analysis skills is crucial (infused?)

(03_Es_Ec_201901)

The Geoscience (H) RAs examine methods or models for assessing, predicting, or estimating hydrological processes. Naturall, the uthors argue for the significance of their research by centering on the robustness and applicability of the methods or models (see Example [4]).

[4] Systematic biases in the hydrological model simulation such as observed for hydraulic head (cf. Fig. 3 and 4) are accurately [APPRECIATION: valuation] estimated resulting in narrow prediction intervals encapsulating most [INTENSIFICATION] of the observations and error quantiles that achieve high [INTENSIFICATION] reliability [APPRECIATION: valuation]. (22_GH_AWR_201902)

The Management () RAs generally aim to understand factors influencing the performance and commercial activities of firms (see Example [5]). The authors tend to emphasize the study's implications for managerial practices.

[5] The extension of confict in intergroup relations acros different social sub-/roups is particularly [INTEsIFIAION] useful [APPRECIATION: valuation] for international business, as multinational enterprises are inherently embedded in several countries and understanding how stakeholders identify with multiple groups can help [APPRECIATION: valuation] explain different internationalization outcomes. (10_MB_JIBs_201902)

The authors also sometimes use valuation features to state the limitations of their studies, which may increase the persuasiveness of the RAs by giving an impression of being objective rather than biased (see Example [6]).

[6] Among these limitations [APPRECIATION: valuation] that inevitably cause uncertainty [APPRECIATION: valuation] on the details of our findings, we assess the short data period as the most severe INTENSIFICATION] weakness [APPRECIATION: valuation]. (22 GH_AWR_201902)

The evaluations encoded through \*valuation" features are often graded through INTENSIFICATION (see Example [1] to [6]) and amount features (see Example [71), suggesting the co-occurring tendency of these features. The upgrading of "valuation" could contribute to a more compelling argument.

[7] Findings from the evaluation of the QAOTP framework advance [APPRECIATION: valuation] our understanding of institution. wide BL implementation in a number of [QUANTIFICATION: amount] ways. (04_ET_IHE_201902)

JUDGEMENT and \*distribution'" features are also frequently identified in this cluster. The use of JUDGEMENT emphasizes the study's contrbution or limitation by positively or negatively appraising the researchers' capacity (see Example [8]). The use of "distribution' highlights the study's significance in terms of is long-term impact or broad applicability (se Example [9]). Since the two features only frequently appear in les than half of the RAs but are completely absent in others, their use may be rlated to some authors' idiosyncratic style or preferred way of writing.

[8] Participants in the intervention condition were also aware of their assgnment, and given our study design, we were unable to [JUDGEMENT] control for such placebo effects. (05_ES_EC_202001)   
[9] Also, because they can be easily created using simple material, they are promising [APPRECIATION: valuation] for wide. spread [QUANTIFICATION: distribution] manufacturing and use. (15_CP_Joule_201901)

The infrequent use of DENY indicates that the authors seldom directly reect alternative voices, plausibly because they rely on the persuasive strategy of drawing readers' attention to the highlights of their research rather than denying potential rejections.

4.2. Linguistic profile 5 - tentative interpretation of research findings

The linguistic profile of Cluster 5 (see Table 8) is characterized by the significantly more frequent use of ENTERTAIN, COUNTER, and DENY but infrequent use of "distribution".

The use of ENTERTAIN can be related to the researcher's interpretive role in making sense of research findings. For example, the Chemistry (P) RAs mainly report laboratory work to understand the composition, properties, structure, and working mechanism of compounds or materials. The frequent use of ENTERTAIN suggests that the researchers interpretive role is crucial in the knowledge. making process as experimental results do not speak for themselves. The subjectivity involved opens the possibilit of alternative interpretations and opposing views. The use of ENTERTAIN indicates the authors awarenes of those alternatives (se Example [10].

[10] The dye-free dummy cell has a remarkably enlarged dark current after the $8 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ heat stress for $^ { 1 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { h } }$ (Figure 4D). However [COUNTER], the profile of surface-state distribution of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ film in the dummy cell, as well as in working cell (with dyesensitization), is hardly [DENY] changed after the heat stress (Figure 4E). We infer that [ENTERTAIN] the accelerated interfacial charge recombination (Figure 4F) very likely [ENTERTAIN] stems from the increased iodine adsorbed on the surface of $\mathrm { T i O } _ { 2 }$ nanocrystals. (Figure S12). (14_CP_Joule_201802)

The Education (T) RAs address various research topics, for example, identifing learning dificulties and comparing different educational methods. All Education (S) RAs come from the same journal that publishes clinical and experimental studies of stuttering therapies. The Education RAs frequently use ENTERTAIN to report findings, sometimes accompanied by COUNTER and DENY pairs to make concessions to alternative voices (see Example [11]).

[11] In conclusion, this result could [ENTERTAIN] be interpreted as an indication that separately presenting triangles was helpful for reducing difficulties in integrating information in the diagram, although [COUNTER] it may [ENTERTAIN] not [DENY] help to solve problems. The results also suggested that [ENTERTAIN] mental rotation could [ENTERTAIN] cause considerable difficulty in diagram comprehension. (25_ET_BJET_201801)

The Geoscience (S) RAs $( 7 8 \% )$ mainly come from two journals devoted to understanding the biological processes in soils (see Example [12]). The findings are often presented as one possible alternatie and sometimes involve negotiation with other voices e., Opsahl and Benner, 1995).

[12] Our results indicate [ENTERTAIN] that Sto V ratios were significantly higher in WF plots compared with NF plots, also pointing to a larger contribution of fern derived litter to soil C pools. However [counTER], vanillyl phenols are reported to be more stable than cinnamyl phenols in sediments and soils (Opsahl and Benner, 1995), and the increased S/V ratio may [ENTERTAIN] have resulted from an increased input of syringyls phenols, which mainly come from fern root tssue, rather than [coUNTER] a selective degradation of vanillyl phenols. (10_GS_SBB_201902)

The Management (B) RAs come from different journal addressing various topics related to firm performance. The Management (P) RAs mainly $( 7 8 \% )$ come from two journals that investigate factors that impact the mentality and behavior of people at work. While presenting their claims as open to altenative interpretations, the authors adopt COuNTER and DENY pairs t reect those alternatives to sustain their own claims (see Example [13]).

13] These results suggest that [ENTERTAIN] investors reward competitors in divergent ways, benefiting competing firms of a similar size, but [COUNTER] not [DENY] with similar political risk exposure. (21_MB_SMJ_201901)

It is evident from Examples [10] to [13] that linguistic profile 5 implies the co-occurrence of ENTERTAIN, COUNTER, and DENY. The use of ENTERTAIN recognizes and aligns with readers holding diffrent positions. The pairing of COUNTER and DENY recourses allows the authors to make concessions and refute opposing views.

# 4.3. Linguistic profile 4 - high citation density with fewer explicit appraisals

The linguistic profile of Cluster 4 (see Table 9 is characterized by significantly more frequent use of JUDGEMENT and ATRIBUTE but infrequent use of "valuation\* and INTENsIFICATION. This cluster comprises more Chemistry (M) and Geoscience (S) RAs and thus may have closer links with hard disciplines.

The Chemistry (M) RAs in this cluster are mostly laboratory studies exploring the efects of compounds and natural products on human health and developing biomedical technology for therapeutics and diagnostics. The authors frequently draw on existing findings in the field to describe and interpret their own results through ATTRIBUTE (see Example [14]). The use of ATTRIBUTE is

closely related to citation.

[14] This decomposition of polyunsaturated faty acids can produce an array of mutagenic compounds, and damaging intermediates, including alkoxyl fre radicals [52] [ATTRIBUTE] and malondialdehyde [49] [ATTRIBUTE]; both molecules are capable of directly damaging DNA, whilst alkoxyl fre radicals may perpetuate lipid peroxidation [52] [ATTRIBUTE]. (07 CM A 201801)

The Geoscience (H) RAs primaril seek to understand water distribution and movement. The Geoscience (S) RAs published in the two journals adresing bioloicl functions and procese f soil fll into either luster r this cluster. s shown in Example 1], the authors use ATTRIBUTE to draw evidence from existing studies to explain their own findings.

[15] This could likely be because moderately labile P fractions, which are more strongly asociated with iron and aluminum oxides and organic mattr than labile (Tiessen and Moir 1993; Blake et al. 2003) [ATTRIBUTE], might act s another critical factor in maintaining the soil labile P balance. (14_GS_BFS_201802)

The Management RAs in this cluster are mostly studies aiming to determine efects and relationships. For example, research to establish the relationship between marketing orientation and innovation. The use of ATTRIBUTE may be related to the authors strategy to justify the value and validity of their research by emphasizing that they are built on a solid foundation of established knowledge in the field.

[16] We built on existing conceptualizations of space in philosophy (Lefebvre, 1974/1991) [ATrRIBUTE], anthropology (Rab] now, 2003) [ATTRIBUTE], geography (Massey, 2005) [ATTRIBUTE], and organization studies (Taylor & Spicer, 2007; Weinfurtner & Seidl, 2019) [ATTRIBUTE]. (06_MB_AMJ_202002)

As shown in Examples [14] to [16], the frequent use of ATrRIBUTE may, to some extent, eflect the highly cumulative knowledge constructed in these RAs as the interpretation of the current findings necessaril build on knowledge established in previous studies Using ATTRIBUTE also allows the authors to argue for the significance of their study by framing their findings as building on and contributing to the ongoing scientific dialogue.

This cluster demonstrates a high frequency of JUDGMENT equivalent to Cluster 2, but the feature appears in les than half of the RAs. This finding further supports the possbilit of idiosyncratic tyles in research writing. This cluster employs valuation' and INTENsIFICATION least frequently, indicating the authors' deemphasis on the practical value of their research.

# 4.4. Linguistic profile 3 - low citation density

The linguistic profile of Cluster 3(see Table 10) is characterized by the significantly infrequent use of ATTRIBUTE, which contrasts with that of Cluster 4. This cluster contains more Education and Management RAs and thus may have closer links with soft disciplines. When describing and interpreting results, Chemistry RAs in this cluster infrequently refer to existing studies (se Example [17]. This may, to some degre, indicate that existing knowledge and findings are taken as consensual knowledge of the research community rather than attributable to specific individuals.

[17] As shown above, we have developed an fficient Fe-based electrocatalyst for OER with low overpotential and Tafel slope. In this catalyst, Fe clusters serve as the active catalytic sites for water oxidation, while the neighboring -03 groups assist to capture $\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ from $\scriptstyle { \mathrm { ~ } ^ { * } \mathrm { O H } }$ or $\mathrm { { } ^ { \ast } O O H }$ species in the thermocatalytic processes. (24_CP_AEM_202002).

The Education RAs devote much discussion to reiterating the findings and stating the implications and limitations without frequently citing other studies (see Example [18]). This cluster utlizes more ENTERTAIN to make tentative claims than any other cluster except Cluster 5.

[18] With these findings, there are several concluding implications. First, it appears that [ENTERTAIN] students with disabilities are increasingly atending full-day kindergarten over part-day kindergarten programs more so in 2011 than ever before in U.S. history. (02_ES_EC_201802).

The Management RAs often contain separate subsections within the discussion to elaborate on the practical and managerial im plications of the findings (see Example [19]). ArrRIBUTE resources do not play a big part in achieving this purpose. Instead, "valuation' is more frequently adopted to emphasize the study's practical value. This cluster adopts more "valuation' resources than any other cluster except Cluster 2.

19] For organizational practice, it is crucial [(infused) INTENSIFICATION $^ +$ APPRECIATION: valuation] to involve both employees and their spouses in the decision-making process regarding career paths. (20_MP_EJwOP_201802).

4.5. Linguistic profile 1 - comparatively infrequent use of multiple APPRAISAL features

The linguistic profile of Cluster 1 (see Table 11) is characterized by the significantly inrequent use of multiple APPRAIsAL features, including JUDGEMENT, COUNTER, ENTERTAIN, and "amount". This cluster contains more Chemistry (M) and Geoscience (H) RAs and thus may have closer links with writing practices of hard disciplines.

The Chemistry RAs in this cluster are mostly experimental studies addressing various topics.In the discussion, the authors often focus on reiterating the experimental procedures and results (see Example [20]). Compared to Cluster 5, this cluster uses fewer ENTERTAIN, DENY, and coUNTER, which makes the authors' interpretive role less noticeable, and the writings appear more "factual".

[20] Protein spots 5, 26, 35, and 42 was identified as mammalian target of heat shock protein B1 (HSP31) (Fig. S7), serine/arginine rich splicing factor 3 (SRsF3) (Fig. S8), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A (Cox5A) (Fig. S9) and protein kinase B (Akt), respectively, which were anti-apoptotic related proteins. (14_CM_EJMC_201802).

The Education RAs devote more space to detailed reiterations of the research design, implementation, and findings se Example [21]). There are limited APPRAisAL feature involved i such reiterations as they focus more on decribing real-world happenings and have less to do with interpersonal meanings in language.

21] One group with a similar initial premise as Janne and Gunnar, namely imagining their fist to be the earth, inscribed flight paths by literally drawing on the hand with a pen to view how this path might become distorted. (15_ET_IJcsCl 201901.

The Geoscience RAs form the largest group of this cluster. Geoscience research often depends on real-world observations and measurements, which may explain the infrequent use of multiple categories of APPRAISAL features (see Example [22]).

[22] Monotonic trends among end-member contributions were explored from WY 1994 to 2015 during May to October using the pSKT, and the only statistically significant results were a percent increase in talu-groundwater contribution to Andrews Creek $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ , percent decrease in snow plus rain contribution ${ \bf \Phi } ( { \bf p } = 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , and a slight decrease in snow plus rain dischargeweighted contribution ${ \bf ( p } = 0 . 0 2 { \bf ) }$ . (25_GH_HP_201801).

# 5. Discussion

This study identified five diferent linguistic profiles of RA discussions across disciplines. The factors that shape the profiles are discussed in the following.

\*Frequencies normalized per 1o00 words.

# 5.1. Strategy to positively appraise the practical significance of the research

Linguistic profile 2 is characterized by the co-occurrence of INTENSIFICATION and \*aluation' to highlight the research's practical significance. INTENSIFICATION conveys the authors' voice and strongly guides the readers toward the positive appraisal encoded in "valuation' (Yasuda, 2022). As Cluster 2 contains RAs from all research areas except for Geoscience (S) and Management (P), this profile may rresent a universa strategy to romot one's study. hat has be appraised may differ due t different topics adressed in the disciline. For example, the Chemistry RAs often report on new technologie or materials whose practical sigficance is related to their commercial values. Therefore, linguistic profile 2 may also be motivated by some disciplines' involvement in commercial endeavors (Hyland & Jiang, 2021). Since not all RAs in this cluster are of commercial value, the same profile may be motivated by distinct factors. For example, the Education (T) RAs adopt this profil to emphasize the study's significance in offering pedagogical implications.

# 5.2. Strategy to mitigate claims and address alternative voices

Linguistic profile 5 is characterized by the co-occurrence of ENTERTAIN, COUNTER, and DENY, which allows researchers to recognize alternative voices, reject opposing claims, and mitigate confrontation to maintain an aligning reader-writer relationship (Geng & Wharton, 2016; Xu & Nesi, 2019a, 2019b). This profile indicates that research claims are open to alternative interretations because the researchers subjectivity plays a significant role in making sense of research findings, even in hard disciplines, where the voice of the reearchers isthought to be subordinated to that of nature (Hyland, 2001). Existing reearch suggest that soft isciplines tend to make tentative claims due to the interpretive knowledge-making, a heterogeneous readership, and a lack of standardized research approaches (Bazerman, 1988; Becher & Trowler, 2001; Charles, 2007; Hyland, 2005, 2008; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Jiang & Hyland, 2018; Swales & Feak, 2012). The make-up of Cluster 5 suggests that hard disciplines sometimes demonstrate the same tendency, adding further evidence to linguistic variations that obscure the boundaries of the soft and hard disciplines.

# 5.3. Need to draw upon existing knowledge

Linguistic profiles 3 and 4 contrast with each other in their use of ArrRIBUTE. Cluster 4 deploys ATTRIBUTE significantly more frequently and contains more RAs from the two hard disciplines. The opposite i true for luster 3. The two profiles, to some extent, contrast with some previous findings that hard disciplines tend to cite les(Hyland, 199; Thompson & Trible, 2001). However, since the two clusters contain RAs from all four discplines, the citation density is not clear-cut between the hard and soft disciplines. Since more Chmistry (P) RAs all into Cluster 3, they are more like those in soft iscilines than in Chemistry (M). These findings support the claim that the hard-soft division neither fits as a dichotomy nor a continuum (Triki, 2021). As Cluster 4 more frequently draws upon existing knowledge to make sense of research findings, the more frequent use of ATTRIBUTE may be related to cumulative knowledge building. While cumulative knowledge building is deemed a characteristic of hard disciplines (Bazerman, 1988; Hyland, 2008), the make-up of the clusters suggests that it does not lead to universal linguistic features in hard disciplines.

# 5.4. Need to reiterate experimental procedures and real-world observations

Linguistic profile 1 is characterized by the infrequent use of multiple APPRAISAL resources, with more RAs from hard disciplines sharing this profile. The RAs tend to focus on reiterating experimental procedures and real-world observations with less authorial interpretations, which, to some degree, represents the less\*interpretive" writing style of hard sciences (Becher & Trowler, 2001; Hyland, 2005; Jiang & Hyland, 2018). However, the focus may be diffrent for specific disciplines. For example, Chemistry RAs focus on experimental procedures, whereas Geoscience RAs focus on real-world observations. Nevertheles, they share the same linguistic profile. Therefore, pre-grouping samples according to disciplines may prevent research from discovering hidden links between seemingly distinct research practices and how they may shape linguistic features.

# 5.5. Idiosyncratic styles and journal specificities.

The researchers idiosyncratic styles may also hape the linguistic profile of RAs. For example, Clusters 2 and 4 adopt JUDGEMENT more frequently. However, this feature only appears in a small percentage of the RAs, which echoes previous findings that some highfrequency features only appear in some RAs but are completely nonexistent in others (Dixon, 2022). Therefore, the identified group characteristics may not always be generalizable to the whole group but could be idiosyncratic. The use of JUDGEMENT in the current corpus is related to firt-person pronouns, which are traditionally not recommended in academic writing. Recent research has iden. tified an increasing trend of first-person pronouns in RAs acros many discilines Dixon, 2022; Hyland & Jiang, 2017, 2018). The use of first-person pronouns does not always align with researchers' knowledge of their discursive functions but may be motivated by the researchers' personal preference or their choice whether to follow the recommendations of popular writing manuals and some high-impact journals (Hu & Ca0, 2015; Jin, 2021; Yasuda, 2022). Previous findings suggest that some idiosyncratic styles may result from researchers strategic deployment of familia inguistic resources to complement or compensate for unfamiliar ones (hang & Cheung, 2020). Scientific jounals are tolerant of such different writing styles as all the samples explored are published work in prestigious journals. The journals' tolerance may empower novice researchers who lack ingustic and genre knowledge as they can choose the styles that are easier for them to manage. These findings indicate that writing publishable research can involve

The linguisic profiles may also relate to specific journals within certain fields. For example, allthe Education (S) RAs in Cluster 5 are from the same journal publishing research on stuttering therapies. Most of the Management (P) RAs in Cluster 5 are from two journals adresing the mentalit and behavior of people at work. All Geoscience () RAs from the two journals that target research of the biological functions and processes in soil fall into either Cluster 4 or 5. These paterns indicate both uniformity and division of writing practices of researchers working on similar topics and publishing in the same journal. While journal specificities may shape research writing, they may not always be at play, as not all linguistic profiles can be linked to specific journals.

# 6. Conclusion

This study complements and expands existing EAP research from a discourse analysis perspective It adopts Cluster Analysis to explore linguistic variations, which avoids the pre-grouping of samples according to disciplines and thus not foregrounding disciplinary influences. The distinct linguistic profiles identified in this study demonstrate inter-disciplinary similarities as well s intra disciplinary diffrences, providing evidence that linguisic variations of RAs are shaped by various factors rather than predomi nantly by disciplinary norms and conventions. The different profiles identified represent the strategy options for researchers to write RA discussions across disciplines and how these strategies are realized linguistically. Raising novice researchers' awareness of the options could help them monitor their own writing for the appropriateness of the context and the effectiveness of their goals. The options include emphasizing the practical value of research findings, properly ddressing altenatie or opposing views, citing existing literature for interpretation and justification, and minimizing the interpretive role of researchers. The potential existence of idio syncratic styles in RAs revealed by this study is encouraging as this affords novice researchers certain degrees of freedom to compensate for their limited knowledge of research writing. This study lends empirical support to the recent call for are-examination of the discipline-based framework in writing research and beyond. The increasing interdisciplinarity in today's research further blurs disciplinary boundaries and renders the exploration of discipline-specific writing practices impractical and unproductive. This study demonstrates an alternative approach to accommodate the inevitable trend of interdisciplinarity.

Despite the contributions, this study also has some limitations. While the study examined a corpus representative of both soft and hard discipline with istinctie characteristics, its rericted fous n four disciplines limits the geralizability of the findings. At the same time, given the small sample $\left( \mathrm { N } = 3 0 \right)$ ) from each subfield, this study may not have captured the diversity of writing styles in the (sub-)disciplines. Further research may adopt similar methods to explore a larger, more diverse sample. This study focuses exclusively on APPRAIsAL features, crucial i constructing authorial voice and academic persuasion. Further reearch is needed to explore more features serving distinct discursive functions for a comprehensive understanding of research writing across disciplines. This study proposes an approach motivated by the increasing interdisciplinary research and the blurring of discipline-specific writing conventions. However, it did not explitly examine linguistic features that characterize interdisciplinary reearch. This is dueto the lack of a widely agreed-upon defintion of interdisciplinary research. Future reearch may work towards uncovering how the actual interactions of different disciplines may shape writing practices.
