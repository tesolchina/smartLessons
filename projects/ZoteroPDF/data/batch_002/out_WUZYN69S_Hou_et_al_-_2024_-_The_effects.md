# ABSTRACT

Previous reading research on incidental word learning as product and process has largely employed computer- or paper-based delivery methods. The present study uses a novel combination of offline and online measures to examine the effects of mobile media (mobile phone and tablet) compared to traditional media (paper and computer) on incidental L2 word learning from reading at three stages: the acquisition outcome, the acquisition process, and the posttest recall. One hundred fifty-six participants were assigned to one of the four media conditions with their eye movements recorded. We examined the acquisition outcome using form recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall posttests. We examined the acquisition process using summed first fixation duration, summed gaze duration, and summed fixation time. We used response time to examine the posttest recall. Our results show that mobile-assisted reading yielded an equivalent performance in word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time compared with paper-based reading that still presents a small advantage. Lower performance in one dimension of accuracy and two dimensions of attentional allocation suggest less efficiency in word learning from computer-assisted reading. This study presents a new research direction and cognitive evidence of the effectiveness of mobile-assisted language learning in word learning. We critically discuss the limitations of this study and provide suggestions for future research.

# 1.  Introduction

Building word knowledge is crucial for L2 learners to achieve success in language proficiency (Nation, 2001). One long-established effective method to increase L2 learners’ lexical knowledge is reading. Empirical evidence has continually confirmed the positive effects of reading for (incidental) L2 word learning in significantly fostering the form-meaning mapping process through repeated lexical encounters. Its effectiveness for lexical development has been broadly examined within paper-based reading settings (e.g. Brown et  al., 2008; Heidari-Shahreza & Tavakoli, 2016; Horst, 2005; Hulstijn et  al., 1996; Laufer & Rozovski-Roitblat, 2011; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010; Pigada & Schmitt, 2006; Rott, 1999; Senoo & Yonemoto, 2014; Webb, 2008; Webb & Chang, 2015). More recently, however, eye-tracking studies have shed new light on the cognitive processes associated with L2 word learning during reading on computers (e.g. Elgort et  al., 2018; Godfroid et  al., 2018; Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016).

Continuous advances in mobile technologies have already facilitated a transition from reading on traditional media (e.g. paper and computer) to mobile media (e.g. mobile phone and tablet) (Stockwell, 2022). These technological affordances are allowing the learning contexts to be redefined (Leow & Cerezo, 2016). The redefinition involves determining the effects of new delivery methods on SLA as ones that show at least the same level of, or even better, efficiency in comparison to traditional delivery methods (Kukulska-Hulme, 2009). It, therefore, is becoming increasingly important to understand the differential effects, if any, of mobile media on the acquisition outcome (offline) and the associated cognitive processes (online) in comparison to traditional media. The present study, therefore, incorporates a series of online and offline measures to explore whether and how mobile technologies impact incidental L2 vocabulary acquisition from reading. Offline measures (e.g. accuracy posttests), which elicit the data after a task, examine the learning outcomes while online measures (e.g. fixation duration), which collect the data during the task, provide ‘an in-depth view’ on how the real-time learning processes are affected, for example, when reading on mobile media (Gutiérrez-Colón et  al., 2020, p. 7). This increases our current understanding of the cognitive impact of mobile technologies on word learning and provides new research perspectives to advance this emerging field.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Reading, word learning, and word exposure

Word learning occurs incidentally while L2 learners engage in reading for text meaning (Huckin & Coady, 1999). In other words, reading yields not only an information outcome, but also a linguistic outcome (Lee, 2002). This argument is well supported by a wealth of empirical evidence. Some early research has shown that reading benefits L2 learners’ full or partial knowledge of forms (e.g. Hulstijn et  al., 1996) and meanings of new words (e.g. Day et  al., 1991; Horst et  al., 1998) and that these lexical gains remain durable (e.g. Rott, 1999). In addition to form and meaning knowledge, more recent research has demonstrated its positive effects on other dimensions of L2 word knowledge, such as grammatical knowledge (e.g. Pigada & Schmitt, 2006), word class (e.g. Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010), word association (e.g. Chen & Truscott, 2010), and dictated spelling (Heidari-Shahreza & Tavakoli, 2016), but that different dimensions of lexical knowledge involve varying difficulty levels of acquisition (e.g. Mohamed, 2018) and also lead to different degrees of certainty (e.g. Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Although there is no formalised standard, researchers have usually examined word learning accuracy by using a combination of form recognition, meaning recognition, and/or meaning recall posttests. The logics behind this combination are the developmental phases of incidental word learning from reading. L2 learners first acquire initial/receptive knowledge of word forms and then their meanings. Lastly, L2 learners begin to acquire a recall/productive level of word knowledge (Pigada & Schmitt, 2006). The combined offline measures can efficiently document the lexical development in multiple aspects at both the receptive and productive levels (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2018; Laufer & Rozovski-Roitblat, 2011; Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016; Rott, 1999; Webb, 2008).

Based on the reviewed literature, one main finding from these studies is that lexical gains grow larger in relation to increased word exposure to new words. Even one encounter with new words can contribute to some receptive knowledge gains in word forms (e.g. $2 3 . 3 3 \%$ accuracy in Godfroid et  al., 2013). The value of word exposure (controlled or manipulated) for word leaning has been well established mostly in paper-based reading tasks across both various L2s and forms of target words. The research includes work on French L2 (e.g. Hulstijn et  al., 1996; Pigada & Schmitt, 2006), German L2 (e.g. Rott, 1999), as well as on Japanese L2 (e.g. Senoo & Yonemoto, 2014) and English L2 (e.g. Heidari-Shahreza & Tavakoli, 2016; Laufer & Rozovski-Roitblat, 2011; Webb & Chang, 2015). It also includes work on foreignised words (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010), pseudo words (e.g. Brown et  al., 2008; Mohamed, 2018; Webb, 2008), and mostly low-frequency target words.

Prior studies, however, have not yet agreed on the exact amount of word exposure that results in robust lexical gains. The number of word encounters needed ranges from around 6 for adapted/graded materials (e.g. Chen & Truscott, 2010; Horst et  al., 1998; Rott, 1999) to around 10 encounters for authentic materials (e.g. Huang & Liou, 2007; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010; Senoo & Yonemoto, 2014). These differences are also attributable to the functioning of other variables from research design. Uchihara et  al. (2019) concluded from a meta-analysis of 26 reading studies that the variability in number of word exposure, although its lexical effect is significant, can be accounted for by learner variables (e.g. age and vocabulary knowledge), treatment variables (e.g. spaced learning and visual support), and methodological differences (e.g. pseudo word use and posttest formats).

# 2.2.  Eye-tracking, cognitive processes, and word learning

In illustrating the cognitive aspects of incidental word learning, Schmidt (1990) claimed that L2 learners develop new word knowledge by noticing new words to varying degrees during reading. Different levels of attention contribute to varied learning outcomes. Therefore, repeated encounters with new words can enhance a learner’s attention to them. However, regarding Schmidt’s hypothesis on the noticing of words, it is difficult to test this assumption with retrospective protocols (e.g. think-aloud and post-survey). These cannot directly capture the attention allocated in real time without a second task’s demand (e.g. Godfroid & Spino, 2015). Eye-tracking, therefore, may be an attractive option to examine previously inaccessible information.

While well established in other disciplines, eye-tracking has recently been used to investigate SLA from reading using computers (Keating, 2014; see Latif, 2019 for a review). Unlike offline accuracy scores measuring the processing product, eye-tracking is process-oriented and is near synchronous with presentation of visual input (Godfroid, 2020). It allows us to obtain fine-grained data on how learners allocate visual attention to parts of visual input in real-time during reading. This concurrent technique can precisely capture the cognitive processes associated with language learning (e.g. Lee et  al., 2020; Lee & Doherty, 2019; Pellicer-Sánchez et  al., 2020). The close connection between attentional allocation and its cognitive representations is based upon the Eye-Mind Hypothesis (Just & Carpenter, 1980; also known as the Eye-Mind Link, Reichle et  al., 2006). The hypothesis asserts that there is no appreciable lag between what the eyes fixate upon and what the brain processes (Rayner, 2009). This is a foundational concept for the application of eye-tracking in language processing research.

Further, recent research has started exploring learners’ cognitive processes underlying word learning from reading using computers and has shown that L2 learners spent significantly more time processing new words than L1 learners (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Initial encounters with new words yield significantly longer processing time (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2013). Reading speed increases as a function of increased word exposure reflected in shorter processing time (e.g. Elgort et  al., 2018). Cumulative processing times on a target word indicate the total allocation of cognitive resources into its form-meaning mapping process (i.e. more allocated visual attention associated with deeper cognitive processing). Combining offline and online results, these studies have also reported a significant and positive relationship between the summed amount of allocated visual attention and the degree of word learning gains (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2013, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Despite no one single agenda, researchers investigating this real-time word learning process have mostly utilised three eye-tracking measures (i.e. first fixation duration, gaze duration, and total fixation/reading time) (e.g. L1: Joseph et  al., 2014; Juhasz & Rayner, 2006; Rayner & Well, 1996; L2: Elgort et  al., 2018; Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). The term first fixation duration refers to the duration of the first fixation made in an interest area. The term gaze duration refers to the sum of all fixation durations recorded from the first entry into an interest area until the eyes leave it in any direction. The term total fixation time refers to the total sum of all fixation durations recorded in an interest area. The validity of these measures in learners’ cognitive processes associated with word learning has been extensively examined in the literature (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2013, 2010; Juhasz & Rayner, 2006; Libben & Titone, 2009; Rayner & Frazier, 1989). Early-stage measures (e.g. first fixation duration and gaze duration/first-pass time) reflect the cognitive processes in lexical access (i.e. triggering the identification of word forms), while late-stage measures (e.g. total fixation time) reflect the cognitive processes in semantic integration (i.e. assigning a meaning to word forms) (Elgort et  al., 2018; Keating, 2014; Libben & Titone, 2009; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Along with eye-tracking measures, other L2 processing researchers have also incorporated another online measure (i.e. posttest response time) to further investigate the cognitive processes associated with knowledge recall to gain a better understanding of the cognitive effects of specific interventions on learning performance (i.e. faster response associated with higher efficiency in cognitive retrieval of the learnt knowledge stored in working memory) (e.g. Lee et  al., 2020; Lee & Doherty, 2019).

# 2.3.  Mobile-assisted reading, word learning, and eye-tracking

The effects of reading on incidental word learning as product and process have been largely examined either using computers or print materials (discussed in the earlier sections). Advances in digital technologies have already revolutionised the way we read, from computer- or paper-based to mobile-assisted reading as a function of digital features which can be accessed almost anytime and anywhere (Kukulska-Hulme, 2018). Mobile media have become ‘a familiar part of the everyday routine of the user, and this in itself increases the chance for learning to take place’(Stockwell, 2013, p. 205). This offers enormous opportunities for changes in learning contexts to mobile technological ones. Researchers have reported positive results for integrating mobile media into in-/ out-of-class instructions (e.g. Ahmed & Al-Marzouqi, 2015 for engineering; Kantar & Dogan, 2015 for physics; Song et  al., 2012 for math; Katz-Buonincontro & Foster, 2013 for art). For language learning, much research, mostly centred around word learning, has also been carried out to examine, and has recognised, the effectiveness of mobile-assisted language learning in various aspects of L2 learning (for reviews, see Chen et  al., 2020; Lin & Lin, 2019). This research in word learning includes work involving SMS (e.g. Suwantarathip & Orawiwatnakul, 2015), emails (e.g. Thornton & Houser, 2005), multimedia instructions (e.g. Kim & Kim, 2012), mobile dictionaries (e.g. Rahimi & Miri, 2014) and applications/programs (e.g. Li & Hafner, 2022; Stockwell, 2010). All these findings show the potential of the active incorporation of mobile technologies in language learning and education.

Far fewer studies, however, have investigated the effects of mobile-assisted reading on learners’ lexical development. Previous research has found that learners reading on mobile and traditional media could have different levels of cognitive demand (e.g. Jeong & Gweon, 2021), engagement (e.g. Ballenghein et  al., 2020), metacognition (e.g. Ronconi et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020), strategies (e.g. Yu et  al., 2022), and behaviours (e.g. Liu & Huang, 2016). That is, mobile-assisted reading probably differs in the underlying nature compared with reading on a computer or paper. The cognitive differences might, in turn, affect learning across media. In a recent meta-analysis of digital reading research, Kong et  al. (2018) found that the medium’s effects narrowed in magnitude from the post-2013 research and pointed that the medium’s familiarity (experience) could play a role in the reading process to cognitively influence learning accuracy, which most research failed to control. The accuracy performance, among the research, has mostly focused on the information (comprehension) outcome (Clinton, 2019; Delgado et  al., 2018; Kong et  al., 2018; Singer & Alexander, 2017). Although reading also has another important outcome (i.e. incidental word learning), this linguistic outcome awaits to be further explored in mobile-assisted reading research. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, two studies are particularly relevant to our own. Fisher et  al. (2012) compared the effects of reading under three conditions: a mobile phone e-book application with a built-in dictionary, the same application with an adaptive learning system, and print materials. Thirty-nine Japanese L2 learners of English read three books for six weeks under all three conditions. The results confirmed the lexical development from pretests to posttests (definition supply), albeit small $( 3 . 1 7 \% )$ , and showed overall similarities in word learning accuracy across the three reading conditions. The main reasons for the low word learning rate that Fisher and colleagues noted are due to the selection of overly difficult reading materials and a lack of word exposure. More recently, Lin (2017) carried out a study to examine the effects of reading using tablets on learning performance. He had ninety-four high school L2 learners of English read English e-books with interactive built-in digital features either on a tablet or using print materials for three weeks. He reported no significant difference in word learning gains in the accuracy posttests (meaning recognition and blanks filling) between the two reading conditions, but he did not provide further information about the scoring methods for these posttests. Although the two studies present some evidence that reading on mobile phones (e.g. Fisher et  al., 2012) or tablets (e.g. Lin, 2017) may be as beneficial for learners’ lexical development as reading on paper, our review also points to the necessities of more fine-grained accuracy measures, strict experimental control, and comprehensive comparisons, which, however, are absent in the extant literature.

Compared to the wide use of accuracy posttests to measure learning performance, the application of eye-tracking measures to gauge cognitive processes is a recent phenomenon. To date, no research has examined whether reading on mobile media affects the real-time cognitive processes during incidental L2 word learning. Although a little research has compared the cognitive effects of mobile-assisted reading with paper-based or computer-assisted reading on text processing, the mixed results using the text-level processing measures (e.g. mean fixation duration, fixation count, saccadic amplitude, or regression, among others) have been reported (e.g. Delgado & Salmerón, 2022; Jeong & Gweon, 2021; Miranda et  al., 2018; Siegenthaler et  al., 2011, 2012; Zambarbieri & Carniglia, 2012). Due to the differences in research foci and measures, the research renders it difficult to gain some insights into whether there are differential effects of reading on mobile and traditional media on L2 learners’ cognitive processing patterns for word learning. Using online measures can help us address questions about whether and how mobile-assisted language learning influences the acquisition process. It can also provide online information about whether and how mobile-assisted language learning influences posttest recall. These help us gain insights into L2 learners’ cognitive processes during word learning and recalling to further explore the effects of mobile media on word learning, which offline accuracy measures cannot do.

# 2.4.  The present study and research questions

In the current study, we compared the effects of reading using mobile media (mobile phone and tablet) with traditional media (paper and computer) on incidental L2 word learning at three stages: the acquisition outcome (word learning accuracy), the acquisition process (allocated visual attention), and the posttest recall (response time). The independent variable of this study was medium. The dependent variables were word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time. As the medium’s familiarity (experience) could affect learners’ reading performance (Chen et  al., 2014; Kong et  al., 2018), we assigned 156 participants to one of the four reading conditions: mobile phone (41), tablet (39), computer (38), and paper (38), who read on a familiar and preferred medium for reading. For each of the four reading conditions, we had 20 pseudo words of up to 6 occurrences as the lexical targets of acquisition (c.f. Rott, 1999). We examined the acquisition outcome by using form recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall posttests (c.f. Godfroid et  al., 2018). We examined the acquisition process by using a sum of allocated visual attention of first fixation duration, gaze duration, and total fixation time (c.f. Godfroid et  al., 2018; Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). We also examined the posttest recall by using response time (c.f. Lee et  al., 2020; Lee & Doherty, 2019). Based on a critical review of the above literature, the following research questions guided our study.

1. Does mobile-assisted reading (mobile phone and tablet) impact the acquisition outcome in comparison to reading using computers or print materials, measured by form recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall?   
2. Does mobile-assisted reading impact the acquisition process in comparison to reading using computers or print materials, measured by summed first fixation duration, summed gaze duration, and summed fixation time?   
3. Does mobile-assisted reading impact the posttest recall in comparison to reading using computers or print materials, measured by response time?

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Participants

The participants of the present study were 156 (female $= ~ 1 2 6$ , male $=$ 30) non-native speakers of English whose mother tongue is Mandarin. They were all voluntary participants enrolled across a variety of programs and majors in a large public university in Australia. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision with contact lenses. Each participant completed an adapted version of the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q; Marian et  al., 2007) focusing on demographics, L2 exposure and L2 proficiency, and digital usage (see Appendix A). The results of the questionnaire revealed the commonalities in the profile of the participants. They were familiar with digital media for learning and reading. They had an average age of 23.25 years ( $\mathbf { \nabla } S D = 2 . 0 1 ,$ ) and had lived in Australia for an average of 1.86 years ( $\mathrm { \Delta } S D = 1 . 7 1 \mathrm { \Omega } ,$ ). They started learning English at an average age of 9.10 years ( $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { S } } \boldsymbol { D } = 2 . 8 4 ,$ ) and had an average vocabulary size of 8847.10 words $\mathrm { ^ { \prime } } S D { = } 1 7 4 4 . 4 7 \mathrm { ^ { \prime } }$ ) with self-reported IELTS overall band scores of 6.70 points out of 9 $\prime S D = 0 . 3 4 )$ . Moreover, they self-rated their English proficiency on a six-item Likert scale, averaging at 3.72 points $\left. S D = 0 . 8 5 \right)$ for listening, 3.76 $\left. S D = 0 . 8 3 \right)$ for reading, 3.28 $\prime S D = 0 . 8 4 )$ for speaking, 3.21 $\left. S D = 0 . 6 3 \right)$ for writing with $^ { \cdot } 1 , ^ { \cdot } 2 , ^ { \cdot } 3 , ^ { \cdot } 4 , ^ { \cdot } 5 ,$ and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } 6$ (option)’ indicating ‘bad’, ‘very basic’, ‘ok’, ‘very good’, ‘advanced’, and ‘native-speaker-like’, respectively. Pairwise comparisons from ANOVAs demonstrated that participants across the four conditions formed a homogenous group in the aspects of age, age of acquisition of English, exposure to English, English proficiency (IELTS band scores and self-reported proficiency), and vocabulary size (see Appendix B).

# 3.2.  Instruments

# 3.2.1.  Vocabulary size test

To confirm that students’ vocabulary size matched the experimental reading material, a vocabulary size test was administered prior to the experimental session (e.g. Mohamed, 2018). This test evaluates the receptive knowledge of the 14 most frequent lists of 1000-word families in the British National Corpus (Nation & Beglar, 2007). It contains 140 multiple-choice items with ten words from each 1000-word family level from K1 to K14. The percentage of correctly answered items, multiplied by 100, forms the estimate of a learner’s vocabulary size. The vocabulary size test is free and publicly available on http://my.vocabularysize.com.

# 3.2.2.  The treatment text

We used the first two chapters of a short novel, The Elephant Man by Tim Vicary as the treatment text (Oxford University Press, Oxford Bookworms series for ESL/EFL learners). The novel is available on Compleat Lexical Tutor (https://www.lextutor.ca/conc/graded/) with the warning that the page contains ‘these are copyright materials – use only for research or pre-purchase viewing’. The novel is rated as level one and its first two chapters have a token count of 1,932 (267 word families and 336 word types). This number of tokens is similar to that in other L2 processing research (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2013). The lexical coverage of the novel is at the 4000-word level within the lexical range for the participants. It is important to note that the word ‘shopkeeper’ (four tokens) in the treatment text appears in the K6 word list. According to researchers’ knowledge, we treated it as a known word because the words ‘shop’ and ‘keeper’ are both high-frequency words in the K1 word list. Proper nouns were considered known words (about $0 . 3 1 \%$ ). Twenty target pseudo words with 64 occurrences (tokens) constituted about $3 . 3 1 \%$ of all running tokens in the text. Therefore, the treatment text with the pseudo words provided a lexical coverage of above $9 5 \%$ known tokens in the text, which is suitable for word learning in the text $\mathrm { \Delta H u }$ & Nation, 2000; Mohamed, 2018). All participants reported having no prior knowledge of the novel or its corresponding movie.

# 3.2.3.  Target pseudo words

Pseudo words (also called non-words) are made-up words which are orthographically legal and real word-like in following the English spelling rules (Rastle et  al., 2002). As Webb (2005) pointed out, using pseudo words ensures no prior knowledge of a word and eliminates the need of an accuracy pretest whose administration could, to some extent, alert participants to the target words of interest. In this sense, the incidental word learning design will be undermined to varying degrees. In the present study, new words were presented as pseudo words in the text which replaced real words in the text as in previous research (e.g. Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Twenty target pseudo words appeared throughout the text with a total of 64 occurrences. All were either nouns or verbs. They were orthographically possible in English, consisted of two syllables, and contained five to seven letters. Their initials were different from the substituted real words. Given the large number of pseudo words needed (20 targets and 60 distractors), we selected the targets mainly from other word learning studies (Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016; Webb, 2008). We selected the distractors from the ARC Non-word Database (http:// www.cogsci.mq.edu.au/research/resources/nwdb/nwdb.html) developed by Rastle et  al. (2002) and from the Non-word List by Meara and his colleagues available from Compleat Lexical Tutor (https://lextutor.ca/ freq/lists_download/pnwords.html). Overall, the target pseudo words were evenly spread throughout the treatment text. Their positions were carefully examined so that all these items were not in an initial or final position on a page across the four media. A sample of the target pseudo words is provided in Appendix C.

# 3.2.4.  A norming test on contextual transparency

To estimate the contextual transparency, an independent norming study was created whereby the target pseudo words were removed from the treatment text. We asked another 11 L2 learners of English as assessors to make predictions based on contextual information. Lexical prediction score was calculated as the percentage of correct responses for a target item. There were 64 token-gaps for 20 target words that appeared 1–6 times in the text. On average, the prediction scores for lexical items produced a mean of $8 3 . 3 7 \%$ $\left( 5 4 . 5 5 \% - 1 0 0 . 0 0 \% \right)$ . From the reviewed literature, this indicated a medium-to-high level of contextual predictability (Rayner & Well, 1996). Performing this procedure ensured that the treatment text was transparent in its contextual information for inferring the meanings of the target words.

# 3.2.5.  Word learning accuracy posttests

We used three word learning accuracy posttests to measure form recognition, meaning recall, and meaning recognition of new words (e.g. Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). In form recognition, participants were asked to choose the word that they saw in the treatment text. Each item had four options in addition to the ‘I don’t remember’ option to minimise guessing. The test consisted of 80 lexical items including 20 target pseudo words in the text, and another 60 pseudo words (distractors) outside of the text. The scoring for the test was based on accuracy of selection of the pseudo words that appeared in the text. In meaning recall, participants were asked to recall the meaning for the given items or write down $\mathrm { ^ { \circ } X } ^ { \mathrm { \prime } }$ to indicate they did not know the answer. The scoring method for this test was based on the supply of word meanings in L2 (English) for the target pseudo words. Full credit of one point was given for provisions of an accurate meaning. Partial credit of half a point was given for provisions of a related meaning partially accurately fitting the context. For instance, the pseudo word galpin referred to money in the context. Participants writing money, pence, or monetary unit received full credit while writing something which can buy at the shop was given partial credit. The pseudo word toker referred to room in the context. Participants who wrote building, prison, or dungeon were given partial credit. Three researchers were involved in this case-by-case evaluation process. In meaning recognition, participants were asked to select the meaning for the given items. Each item had four meaning options in addition to an ‘I don’t know’ option to reduce the amount of guessing. All options were semantically possible to avoid the biasing effect. A sample of offline accuracy posttests is provided in Appendix D.

# 3.2.6.  The medium’s settings

We utilised the same and fixed layout for the texts presented across the four media (Georgia, 13.00 pt, and 1.50 times line spacing). The texts were presented using Amazon Kindle (https://www.amazon.com.au/ kindle-dbs/fd/kcp) for participants reading either on a mobile phone (iPhone 6), tablet (iPad mini 4), or computer (HP Elite E232) with $5 0 \%$ screen brightness or using print materials for those reading on paper (A4 sheet) with amble lighting. The texts were presented on 29 pages (67 words each) for mobile phone, 14 pages (138 words each) for tablet, and 7 pages (276 words each) for both computer and paper conditions. The display area was $1 0 . 4 0 \times 5 . 8 5 \mathrm { c m }$ for mobile phone, $1 6 . 2 0 \times 1 2 . 4 0 \mathrm { c m }$ for tablet, $5 0 . 9 2 \times 2 8 . 6 4 \mathrm { c m }$ for computer, and $2 7 . 1 6 \times 1 8 . 4 6 \mathrm { c m }$ for paper conditions, respectively.

# 3.2.7.  Eye-tracking devices

According to our piloting, the Moiré patterns/flickers (technical interferences in display, e.g. nonlinear waving lines) did not allow us to use the tracking glasses to accurately record word-level eye movements on computers. We, therefore, used two eye-tracking devices (e.g. Zambarbieri & Carniglia, 2012) to record eye movements: Tobii Pro X2-60 computer-attached eye tracker and SMI (SensoMotoric Instruments) tracking glasses. The computer-attached eye tracker has been widely used in SLA research to record L2 learners’ eye movements when doing a computer-assisted learning task. We used a conventional Tobii Pro X2-60 computer-attached eye tracker to capture eye movements of the participants reading on a computer. The device had a sampling rate of $6 0 \mathrm { H z }$ and binocular accuracy between $0 . 4 0 ^ { \circ }$ and $1 . 2 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The fixation tracking range spanned $3 6 ^ { \circ }$ horizontally and $7 2 ^ { \circ }$ vertically, which allowed for a range of free head movements required for the study. Its precision was rated at $0 . 3 4 ^ { \circ }$ . Allowing for more freedom of body movements, the tracking glasses (e.g. SMI and Tobii), which are wearable and non-intrusive, are used typically in a context where the medium of delivery is beyond computers. The tracking glasses have been used as an effective tool to document learners’ eye movements and provide accurate and reliable results in various studies on language processing and human behaviours (e.g. Ballenghein et  al., 2019; Delgado & Salmerón, 2022; Miranda et  al., 2018). We used a pair of SMI tracking glasses to capture eye movements of the participants reading on a mobile phone, tablet, or paper. The device had a sampling rate of $6 0 \mathrm { H z }$ and binocular accuracy at $0 . 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The tracking range spanned $8 0 ^ { \circ }$ horizontally and $6 0 ^ { \circ }$ vertically, which allowed for a greater degree of free head movements. Its precision was rated at $0 . 1 0 ^ { \circ }$ . The latency for both eye-tracking devices was below 2 frames (35 milliseconds). And their eye-movement measures needed in this study were also the same. Considering the similarities in the sampling rate, precision, accuracy, latency, and measures between the two eye-tracking devices, we expected to obtain overall the same measurements from SMI tracking glasses as Tobii Pro X2-60 computer-attached eye tracker.

# 3.3.  Procedures

# 3.3.1.  The experimental session

Before the experimental session, we collected the consent form, vocabulary size, and LEAP-Q of each participant. In our language processing lab, participants were tested individually. We assigned them to a familiar and referred reading medium based on their LEAP-Q reports. We first familiarised them with the lab environment and described the associated activities. We then asked them to read a short paragraph as a warm-up exercise to become familiar with (wearing) the tracking devices while reading. We used standard methods to calibrate the eye-tracking devices: three points for the tracking glasses and four points for the computer-attached eye-tracker. We used the flexible holders to fix the mobile phone, table, and paper for eye-tracking accuracy, but they could be adjusted based on individual reading habits prior to the experiment and could be put in hand in the reading process. When participants reported that they were ready, the treatment text reading begun. They were unable to return to the previous page after entering the next page of reading by pressing the $\hookrightarrow$ key on the keyboard, swiping on the screen, or manually turning the page. The reading session lasted approximately 10–20 minutes. After that, they took the surprise accuracy posttests on a computer. These lexical questions were displayed individually. Responding by choosing an answer (a mouse-click) moved them on to the next question. The posttest session lasted approximately 30 minutes.

# 3.3.2.  Data preparation

For eye-tracking data preparation, we performed a visual inspection of target words’ tracking rates for each of the 156 recordings from 156 participants. We manually created the boundaries for the areas of interest based on a space of dynamic $2 . 1 2 \mathrm { m m }$ (left, right, top, and bottom) surrounding the target words in the text for each recording as this allowed for the inclusion of eye-movement data only attributed to the target words and the exclusion of other irrelevant online data. We only included the recordings that had more than $9 0 \%$ of fixation data on these target words due to tracking loss (e.g. fixation drift and violent movements) and then had a pool of 116 recordings for later fixation analysis. For both online and offline data preparation, we removed outliers of 2.50 standard deviations from the mean and inspected the boxplot for each dependent variable (see Figure 1). Assumptions of normal distribution and equal variance were assumed. We reported summed first fixation duration, summed gaze duration, summed fixation time, and response time in milliseconds (ms) throughout. The threshold of statistical significances was set at $p = . 0 5$ and all values were reported to three decimal places in Results section. Bonferroni adjustments were applied to all post-hoc multiple comparisons. We exported raw data from SMI Begaze (version 3.7.60) and Tobii Pro (version 3.3.2) to EXCEL for data preparation and then to SPSS (version 26) for statistical analysis.

We then performed Bonferroni corrections to post hoc pairwise comparisons. The results revealed a significant difference between the computer-assisted reading condition and the paper-based reading condition. Participants reading on a computer achieved significantly lower accuracy scores in form recognition $M = 1 1 . 0 7 9$ , $S D = 3 . 4 3 6$ , $p = . 0 1 5 ,$ ) than those who read on paper $( M = 1 3 . 6 3 2$ , $S D = 4 . 0 5 6 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ).

# 4.2.  Allocated visual attention

Descriptive statistics for the time the participants took to process the target words, when they read on the four media, are presented in Table  2. We performed a one-way ANOVA test for summed visual attention allocated to the target words with Medium as the independent variable, respectively.

We found significant effects of Medium on summed first fixation duration, $F ( 3 , 1 1 0 ) \ = \ 4 . 7 1 2 , \ p \ = \ . 0 0 4 , \ \eta ^ { 2 } \ = \ . 1 1 4$ and on summed gaze duration, $F ( 3 , 1 1 2 ) \ = \ 3 . 9 1 7$ , $p \ = \ . 0 1 1$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ . 0 9 5$ , but not on summed fixation time, $F ( 3 , 1 1 0 ) = . 3 6 3 , \ : p = . 7 8 0 , \ : \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 1 0$ . We then carried out Bonferroni post hoc tests on Medium to identify where significant differences occurred in summed first fixation duration and in summed gaze duration. We found significant differences between the computer-assisted reading group and the other two groups (i.e. mobile phone- and paper-based reading). Participants reading on a computer allocated significantly less visual attention to process new words reflected in summed first fixation duration and summed gaze duration $M = 1 4 3 6 2 . 4 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ , $S D { = } 2 9 5 1 . 0 0 7$ ; $M = 2 4 5 9 8 . 3 5 2$ , $S D = 5 8 9 8 . 2 8 8$ , respectively) than those who read on paper $( M = 1 7 0 0 3 . 6 6 7 $ , $S D { = } 2 6 5 5 . 2 1 0$ , $\boldsymbol { p }$ $\qquad = \ . 0 0 4$ ; $M = 2 9 8 8 2 . 7 5 3$ , $S D { = } 6 5 7 8 . 6 9 2$ , $\mathnormal { p } \mathnormal { = } \ . 0 3 8 )$ ) or on a mobile phone ( $M = 1 6 6 2 3 . 8 2 8 .$ , $S D = 2 4 4 1 . 5 6 4$ , $p = . 0 2 0$ ; $M = 3 0 5 9 0 . 9 4 4$ , $S D { = } 7 2 0 9 . 3 5 5$ , $\boldsymbol { p }$ $\ c = ~ . 0 1 2 )$ .

# 4.3.  Response time

Descriptive statistics for the time the participants spent in selecting or writing the answers in word learning accuracy posttests on form recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall, after reading on the four media, are presented in Table 3. We carried out a series of one-way ANOVAs for posttest response time with Medium as the independent variable, respectively.

We found that Medium had no significant effects on response time for form recognition, $F ( 3 , 1 4 5 ) ~ = ~ . 5 5 5$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p \ = \ . 6 4 5 } \end{array}$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ . 0 1 1$ , meaning recognition, $F ( 3 , 1 5 0 ) ~ = ~ . 6 6 4$ , $\mathit { p } = \mathit { . 5 7 6 }$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .013, or meaning recall, $F ( 3 , 1 3 6 ) = . 3 1 7$ , $p = . 8 1 3$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 7$ .

# 4.4.  Summary

The summary of the results of statistical analyses is presented in Table 4. It highlights statistical differences in nine dimensions of word learning across the four media. The results show statistically significant differences in word learning accuracy and allocated visual attention, but not in response time, across the media. Computer-assisted reading led to significantly less word learning accuracy in form recognition than paper-based reading, and significantly less visual attention allocated to new words than reading on a mobile phone and paper in summed first fixation duration and summed gaze duration. The results also show that mobile-assisted and paper-based reading yielded an equivalent performance on word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time.

# 5.  Discussion

# 5.1.  Word learning accuracy

Our first research question addressed whether and how mobile-assisted reading affects L2 learners’ word learning accuracy. Accuracy was measured by form recognition, meaning recognition, and meaning recall. Our results show that the accuracy performance from reading on mobile media was as good as reading on traditional media while paper-based reading produced more word knowledge gains than computer-assisted reading in form recognition. Overall, these findings corroborate those of prior mobile-assisted reading research that reading on mobile media is also effective for the acquisition of L2 word knowledge (e.g. Fisher et  al., 2012 for mobile phone; Lin, 2017 for tablet).

The findings of the current study expand on those of prior studies to the mobile technological context. A great deal of previous works have shown that L2 learners can acquire L2 word knowledge through encounters with new words in the traditional reading settings (paper-based or computer-assisted) (e.g. Eckerth & Tavakoli, 2012; Heidari-Shahreza & Tavakoli, 2016; Horst et  al., 1998; Horst, 2005; Huang & Liou, 2007; Hulstijn et  al., 1996; Laufer & Rozovski-Roitblat, 2011; Pigada & Schmitt, 2006; Rott, 1999; Webb & Chang, 2012, 2015). Our results indicate that mobile media (mobile phone and tablet) can also be useful reading tools and lead to considerable gains in word knowledge by improving word learning accuracy. Table 4 demonstrates that mobile media groups vs. traditional media groups achieved an overall equivalent performance in all three accuracy dimensions and as shown in Table 1, yielded good knowledge gains of new words (form recognition: $5 5 . 4 0 \% { - } 6 8 . 1 6 \%$ ; meaning recognition: $4 1 . 8 0 \% - 4 8 . 6 5 \%$ ; meaning recall: $8 . 9 8 \% - 1 1 . 5 0 \% )$ .

Notes. The symbol $' > '$ indicates the direction of statistically significant differences.

More than $5 0 \%$ of new words were improved to varying degrees in different dimensions of accuracy across the media. The variances in learning rates from the three accuracy dimensions (form recognition $>$ meaning recognition $>$ meaning recall) also corroborate those of earlier studies showing that L2 lexical development is inconsistent across different aspects of word knowledge (e.g. Godfroid et  al., 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2010; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016; Webb, 2008). The increasing cognitive resources required for form-meaning integration may account for the decline in learning rates across the three dimensions of word learning accuracy (Mohamed, 2018).

# 5.2.  Allocated visual attention

Our second research question addressed whether and how mobile-assisted reading affects L2 learners’ allocation of visual attention to new words. Attentional allocation was measured by summed first fixation duration, summed gaze duration, and summed fixation time. These online measures mirror how much visual attention readers are allocating to lexical items. Processing times are an indicator of the amount of cognitive resources being allocated to the form-meaning connection process that reflects the levels of learners’ depth of processing in the brain (Godfroid, 2020; Godfroid et  al., 2013, 2010; Juhasz & Rayner, 2006; Keating, 2014; Libben & Titone, 2009; Rayner & Frazier, 1989). Table 4 shows significant differences between the computer-assisted reading group and those who read either on paper or on a mobile phone in summed allocated visual attention of first fixation duration and gaze duration. Table 4 also shows no group differences between mobile-assisted reading and paper-based reading in all three dimensions of attentional allocation.

The findings of the current study confirm previous research using eye-tracking technique indicating that learners allocate visual attention to new words in the acquisition process during computer-assisted reading (e.g. Elgort et  al., 2018; Godfroid et  al., 2018; Joseph et  al., 2014; Mohamed, 2018; Pellicer-Sánchez, 2016). Our findings also extend the previous research to a variety of delivery methods and show that L2 learners reading on a computer impacted, to some extent, the allocation of visual attention to new words. Learners reading on mobile media allocated comparable visual attention to new words as those reading on paper. That is, mobile-assisted reading led to a similar level of the depth of cognitive processing in lexical access and semantic integration of new forms with their meanings. These findings of comparable online processing patterns from reading on mobile media to paper may be explained by that fact that mobile technologies have greatly evolved to create a reading effect that is cognitively similar to reading on paper (Delgado & Salmerón, 2022; Kretzschmar et  al., 2013; Siegenthaler et  al., 2011).

# 5.3.  Response time

Our third research question addressed whether and how mobile-assisted reading affects L2 learners’ response time to word learning accuracy posttests. Response time represents another cognitive dimension of mobile-assisted reading effects on L2 learners’ word learning. Different from the accuracy posttests measuring the learning outcome, this measure examines cognitive retrieval to provide additional insights into the acquisition quality (e.g. Felser & Roberts, 2007; Lee et  al., 2020; Lee & Doherty, 2019; Pellicer-Sánchez & Schmitt, 2012). Response time was measured by the time participants took to choose or write accuracy posttest answers. Our results showed no between-group differences in posttest response time for the three accuracy dimensions. Mobile media groups either chose or wrote the answers as quickly as traditional media groups. In other words, mobile-assisted reading produced equivalent cognitive efficiency in recalling word knowledge. These findings, through posttest recall, extend those of previous studies showing that reading on mobile media is as effective as reading on paper or on a computer in knowledge gains (e.g. Fisher et  al., 2012; Margolin et  al., 2013; Sackstein et  al., 2015; Sage et  al., 2019).

# 5.4.  Summary

The results of this study show the effectiveness of mobile-assisted reading at three stages of word learning compared with reading on traditional media. Our results also show the medium’s effects on both the acquisition outcome and process. Reading on a computer resulted in significantly lower accuracy in form recognition than paper. And it resulted in significantly shorter processing time in summed first fixation duration and summed gaze duration than paper and mobile phone. The first potential explanation may be due to the different eye-movement patterns in the reading process. Learners reading on a computer tend to skim the text (i.e. more fixations landing on the upper and left side of the text), which could produce a shallow level of information processing in the brain (e.g. Jeong & Gweon, 2021). That is, failures to pay attention to global textual details could negatively impact both encoding and decoding of the new words. Another possibility could be ascribed to the different interactions between the reader and the text when using different media (e.g. Ballenghein et  al., 2020). Reading on a computer could limit learners’ postural movements which could decrease their cognitive engagement with the text and influence the learning performance. Despite these effects, our results show that reading on a computer only impacted word learning accuracy at the receptive level and attentional allocation at the initial cognitive stage of word recognition. In other words, the medium’s effects on the product and process of word learning from reading were limited.

Our results also present other findings which should not be ignored. Despite being not significant in terms of statistical outcomes, the paper group outperformed the other groups in most dimensional comparisons (seven out of nine) in word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time (see Table 1, 2, & 3). That is, L2 learners had a small advantage when reading on paper in that relatively, they responded more accurately, engaged more deeply, and answered more quickly. These findings support those of previous studies reporting the overall benefits of reading on paper in learner’s learning accuracy and cognitive processes (e.g. Clinton, 2019; Delgado et  al., 2018).

# 6.  Limitations and future research

Whereas the present study provides a new research direction in mobile-assisted language learning, some limitations need to be acknowledged and further research needs to be done. The tracking glasses represent the latest eye-tracking technology which expands beyond a sole computer-assisted learning setting. Our method for tracking accuracy by using flexible holders was not able to fully simulate a real-life learning setting although participants were allowed to hold the media in hand. It might influence ecological validity of the present study to some degree. Another issue could be ascribed to the differences in eye-tracking devices in this study. Eye-tracking glasses could not accurately track word-level processing behaviours on computer screens due to the Moiré patterns according to our piloting. One possible alternative is to use the emulators of mobile media displayed on a computer screen (e.g. Kabugo et  al., 2016), which, however, presents a new issue of differences between the virtual and the real which might drive fixation differences (e.g. Levulis & Harris, 2015). Despite the overall similarities of the two $6 0 \mathrm { H z }$ eye-tracking devices we used in configurations (the sampling rate, precision, accuracy, latency, and measures), their subtle differences do exist and, as such, our results from comparative fixation analyses need to be interpreted with some caution. Moreover, the treatment text used in our study was contextually rich (medium-to-high) and relatively short (1,932 tokens). Future research, therefore, could use a less contextually rich and longer novel in order to determine whether it would impact L2 learners’ both offline and online performance of mobile-assisted reading in word learning. Finally, we suggest that future research continue to incorporate these online measures and include additional measures (e.g. second-pass time and regression-in/out) to further examine the acquisition process.

# 7.  Conclusion

The present study uses a novel combination of offline and online measures to examine the effects of reading on mobile (mobile phone and tablet) vs. traditional media (paper and computer) on incidental L2 word learning at three stages: the acquisition outcome (word learning accuracy), the acquisition process (allocated visual attention), and the posttest recall (response time). Our results lead us to the following conclusions. Mobile-assisted reading is also useful for L2 word learning as it leads to an equivalent performance in word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time compared with paper-based reading that still presents a small advantage. Lower performance in one dimension of accuracy and two dimensions of attentional allocation suggest less efficiency in word learning from computer-assisted reading. Our results have shown that mobile-assisted reading facilitates L2 learners’ lexical development and its associated cognitive processes. That is not to say, we attribute a complete transformation of our reading practice to mobile-assisted reading. Rather, recognising mobile technological benefits, we advocate that more advantages of mobile technologies be taken to supplement traditional reading approaches in order to facilitate L2 learning at its best.

# Notes

1. Offline results/performance refer to the data elicited after a task from learners by offline measures (e.g. word learning accuracy posttests). Online results/performance refer to the data collected from learners during the task by online measures (e.g. fixation duration and response time).   
2. Learners’ familiarity (experience) with a specific medium could be a confounding variable in learning accuracy (Chen et  al., 2014). This familiarity effect would probably interplay with learners’ reading strategies and cognitive demand during reading, thereby affecting learning accuracy (Kong et  al., 2018). Controlling this variable means that each participant would read on a familiar medium which he/she referred to read with in daily life and that the differences, if any, in word learning accuracy, allocated visual attention, and response time could be attributed to the effects of the independent variable, medium.

3. We inspected the standardised residuals scatterplots to confirm that the dataset fulfilled the assumption of equal variance. We evaluated the normal P-P plots of standardised residuals, boxplots, histograms, and symmetry (- $\cdot 1 <$ skewness and kurtosis $< + 1$ ) to confirm that it fitted a satisfactorily normal distribution. The ANOVA is robust to tolerate a mild violation against this assumption given a large sample size (Field, 2013). We further compared the results produced by ANOVAs and Kruskal-Wallis tests and found no statistical disagreement.

4. We conducted further statistical analyses with an exclusion of the computer group, as one anonymous reviewer suggested, considering the differences in eye-tracking devices and their possible effects on (fixation analysis) outcomes. Our results showed no significant differences in allocated visual attention [summed first fixation duration: $F ( 2 , 8 6 ) ~ = ~ . 9 4 8 ,$ $\textstyle P \ = \ . 3 9 2$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 2$ ; summed gaze duration: $F ( 2 , 8 7 ) = . 3 5 7$ , $p = . 7 0 0$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 8$ ; summed fixation time: $F ( 2 , 8 6 ) = . 0 5 2 $ , $ { p } = . 9 4 9$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 1 ]$ between the participants reading on the mobile phone, tablet, and paper. And neither did differences reach significance in word learning accuracy [form recognition: $F ( 2 , 1 1 5 ) = 2 . 3 4 7 $ , $p = . 1 0 0$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 3 9$ ; meaning recognition: $F ( 2 , 1 1 4 ) ~ = ~ 1 . 5 1 6 { } _ { ; }$ , $p \ = \ . 2 2 4$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 6$ ; meaning recall: $F ( 2 , 1 1 2 ) = 1 . 1 6 9$ , $p = . 3 1 5$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 0 ]$ or response time [response time for form recognition: $F ( 2 , 1 1 2 ) \ = \ . 8 3 5$ , $p = . 4 3 7$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 1 5$ ; for meaning recognition: $F ( 2 , 1 1 3 ) = . 6 7 0$ , $p = . 5 1 4$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 1 2$ ; for meaning recall: $F ( 2 , 1 0 4 ) = . 4 2 1$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 6 5 8 } \end{array}$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 8 ]$ .
