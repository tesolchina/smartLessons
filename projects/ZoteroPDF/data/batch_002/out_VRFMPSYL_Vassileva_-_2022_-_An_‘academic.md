The aim of the case study is to look at the argumentation strategies (or schemes) used by writers belonging to two different schools of linguistics in their attempt to refute the theoretical, methodological, ideological, etc. approaches of the opponents' group in order to promote their own viewpoints instead. The corpus consists of 12 texts, containing altogether 70,771 words - reviews and review articles of specific publications - and constitutes a chain of opinion exchanges. The research methodology is based on the modern theory of argumentation schemes with special focus on refutations as main carriers of critical argumentation and confrontation. The expression of criticism is analysed in terms of the premises it is based on and the topoi employed by the writers. The discussion of the critical argumentation schemes considers the language means employed for their realization and is supported by examples. The results demonstrate domination of epistemic argumentation, but also a high degree of usage of deontic argumentation, of personalization and thus of ethical argumentation more than in any other academic genre. A distinctive feature of the means of argumentation observed in the corpus is the employment of numerous metaphors and irony/sarcasm that often go beyond the generally accepted ethics in academia in their interpersonal pragmatic effect.

# 1. Introduction

Although nobody would deny that academic criticism and confrontation are inherent features of academic communication, most of the existing studie assume that, owing to the predominantly evolutionary nature of the development f science, collaborative rhetoric is intrinsic to academic discourse and criticism is an exception rather than the rule. This is most probably the reason why there is relatively littl research on the problem. At the same time, th issue has become worth exploring in the era of globalization and the ensuing ever-increasing competition and struggle for power and high esteem among scholars from all over the world.

Academic book reviews present a suitable genre for the study of criticism not only because they belong to the traditional, well established academic genres having existed \*for almost 2000 years" (Hyland, 2004, p. 42), but also because they possess a func. tionally determined, highly evaluative character. Two basic features of the review follow from Wills (1997: 136) concise definition. (1) The discourse of the review is not independent and self-sufficient, but i closely related ideationally to preceding texts and practices, forming a wide and complex network of intertextual links. (2) The two basic communicative functions of the review are the informatie and the evaluative. From the point of view of systemic-functional grammar (Halliday, 1985), the first point rflects the intertextual function of language, while the second point focuses on the ideational and the inerpersonal functions. The prevalence of the one or the other function depends on factors such as: the field of research, the reviewer's motivation for writing the review, the equirements of the journal, the cultural environment, among others.

Book reviews represent not only one of the most intertextually and interdiscursively loaded genres in academic communication (Hyland, 2004), but aso one of the most dialogic (in terms of Bakhtin, 1981) genres, as the present study will demonstrate. With ther addressie' character they contribute considerably to the establishment of the discipline's identity as a whole and to the status of the individual members of its discourse community.

The analysis of book reviews has ben approached from disciplinary, cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural as well as historical per spectives, but practclly ll inestigtions have been based on socio-pragmatic thries and disuss he ssues within spech act thery (Etaywe, 2017, Alcaraz-Ariza, 2011), Appraisal Theory (Nayernia & Ashoori, 2019; Khosravi & Babaii, 2017) and politenesstrategies frameworks. Thus, linguists have tried to establish what linguistic means are used in order to exercise or avoid criticism though the uthors oice- vague language, heding, oosting, among ther ealuative means (i.,Kapp-Potoff, 1992; Pagano, 1994; Patold, 1984; Hyland, 2004, 2005; Hunston, 2005; Hyland & Diani, 2009; Tse & Hyland, 2009; Wang & Nelson, 2012). Sociologists, on the other hand, regard academic criticism mainly as an expression of the ever-increasing competitivenessfor professional recognition in the modern world (Hutz, 2001; Wiegand, 1983).

As the cursory look at the (by no means exhaustive) literature above demonstrate, the interest in book reviews seems to have increased of late. The approaches are similar and repetitive which makes them comparable, but they fal to grasp certain specific aspects of the rhetoric of reviews, such as to go beyond individual words/phrases and consider larger stretches of discourse and their intertextual relationships with previous texts. Therefore, the methodological approach used in the present study, which is based on modern rhetoric, is expected to throw new light specifically on the confrontational strategies employed by review writers.

Essentially, there exist two contradictory views on the role of academic confrontation: 1. Confrontation in academic communi. cation is dangerous and unproductive (Ventola, 1998; Tannen, 2002, among others); 2. Confrontation in academic communication provides impetuses for advance and further development (Wunderlich, 1972; Knapp-Potthoff, 192). However, thee two views vary in their implications across disciplines. The type of confrontation to be discussed in the present study is mainly typical of the soft disciplines where, in contrast to the hard ones, argumentation is predominantly of verbal character, since experiences and phenomena are rarely strictly measurable, and their analysis is thus of a much more interpretive nature (Hyland, 2005).

Hence, soft disciplines scholars are forced to rely much more on language and rhetoric than on other (for instance visual) semiotic means containing data, respectively evidence, such as graphs, tables, charts, etc., for the presentation of their results, beliefs, and convictions, which on its part leads to exploitation of rhetorical resources that may sometimes seem to go beyond the generally accepted boundaries of what is considered to be 'ethical' in academic communication.

This is the main reason why this paper willexamine the language of linguists who are also expected to be flly aware of th effects of their writing and argumentation strategies on their discourse community and on the further development of the field in general.

The aim of this case study i to analyse the argumentation strategie (schemes) used by writrs belonging to two different schoos of linguistics in ther attempt to refute the theoretical, methodological, ideological, et. aproaches of the 'enemy' group in order to promote their own viewpoints instead. Hunston (205:2) refr to such publications asconflict articles. I have chosen to callthi tye of exchange metaphorically an academic war' since the fierce debate has been going on for years, in corroboration with Hunston (2005:2) who states that the conflict exchange has no defined end; any number farticles may respond to each other. Besides, as the analysis below will show, the language used by the respective proponents of the two schools may often be considered to diverge significantly from the general understanding of collegiality in academic communication.

# 2. Theoretical background

The research methodology is based on the modern theory of "argumentation schemes' defined by Walton, Reed, and Macagno (2008:1) as:

Forms of argument [..] that represent structures of common types of arguments [..]. They include the deductie and inductive forms of argument that we are already so familiar with in logic. However, they also represent forms of argument that are neither deductive nor inductive, but that fll into a third category, sometimes called defeasible, presumptive or abductive.

The latter type of arguments was treated as fllacious by logic for a long time. However, such arguments transpire as to frequent nd successful to be ignored by labelling them fallacious. They are defeasible, or fallible in the sense that new evidence may be Jrovided showing that the conclusions do not hold true.

In their comprehensive study of argumentation schemes Walton et al. (2008) present a detailed analysis of a wide variety of schemes and offer a compendium of 60 schemes, some of which are used in the current investigation as being relevant to the analysis of academic communication. Of special interest here is Walton et al.'s (2008: 220-275) \*pragmatic theory of refutation which is directly related to the investigation of confrontation.

The authors distinguish among \*attack, oposition, reuttal and refutation (Walton et al. (2008), p.220) that ae all basic notions to critical arumentation. he need for critical argumentation arises where there is conlict of opinions between two (or more) parties.

A refutation is defined as a sequence of dialogue moves in which an argument is used by one party to atack and defeat an opposed argument put forward previously by the other party. [..] A rebuttal is an argument that is opposed to another argument [..] but it does not necessrily refute that argument. Refutation is something more powerful in that] it overpowers the original argument and knocks it down (defeats it). (Walton et al. (2008), p. 220)

The \*three-ways hypothesis" states that \*there are only three ways of attacking (and refuting) an argument. [1] to argue that the premises are not true; [. 2] toargue that the conclusion does not follow from the premises; and [3] to argue that the conclusion is false" (Walton et al. (2008), p. 22). In the first case one may argue that the premisei false or may cast doubt on the premise by questioning it (p. 272). Refutation is considered to be successul if the opposed argument is sringer than the original one" (p. 268)

Rebuttals may be combined to achieve an "additive effect, thus forming "a refutation that can be stronger than any of its component rebuttls (Walton et al. (2008), p. 263). To put it succinctly, \*A proposition is strongly refuted if proven to be false A proposition is weakly refuted if not shown to be true (Walton et al. (2008), p. 267). Thus, this modern approach is much more fine-grained as compared to traditional and widely accepted models such as Toulmin's (1958), or Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's (1969), which makes i better applicable to the analysis in the resent study. Besides, in contrst t the purel semantic definitions of argument as a set of statements (propositions) with a particular structure (premises - conclusion), within the pragmatic approach suggested by Walton (1996) and further developed in Walton et al. (2008:269), \*argumentation is defined as a chaining together of statements in a sequence of reasoning used for some purpose in a context of dialogue".

Another notion playing a crucial role in this discusson is that of topos (topic): Common topoi are general principles or rules of human inference which serve to guarante the transitionfrom the premises to the conclusion (McElholm, 2002, p.77). There are two main types of topoi: those based on everyday-logic generic premises and those with conventionalized conclusions, which are further divided into subgroups (see Appendix 2, \*Classification of topoi").

The topoi will serve as methodological instruments for the analysis of argumentation in academic publications.

# 3. The empirical context: the 'academic war' around CDA

At the onset of the academic war under consideration came Norman Fairclough's extremely influential book Discourse and Social Change"' (Polity Press, $1 9 9 2 ) ^ { 2 }$ which set the grounding principles of a whole new school in modern linguistics, namely 'Critical Discourse Analysis' (hereinafter CDA). The book was viciously criticised in a review by Henry Widdowson (1995a), fllowed by an article-length criticism of the whole enterpris of CDA in the same year (Widdowson, 1995b). A year ater (in 1996) the two authors exchanged views in the same issue of the "Language and Literature" journal (Fairclough, 1996a, 1996b; Widdowson, 1996). In 1997 Toolan offered acritical but supportive lengthy overview (10,00 words of the developments in CDA theory and practice. In the meantime, CDA found numerous followers, which led to the publication of a number of articles and several books. The latter were unfavourably scrutinized by Widdowson (1998) in an extensive review article. In 200 Blommaert and Bulcaen provided an exhaustive survey of CDA and pointed out some problematic ssues concerning the necessty for CDA to widen the scope of analytical instruments and theoretical sources. Provoked by Widdowson's (200) article in \*Applied Linguistics (not included in the analysis here), Robert de Beaugrande (2001) struck back with an interpretation of \*the Discourse of H. G. Widdowson'" (2001, p.104.

With the publication of his book Text, Context, Pretext: Critical Issues in Discourse Analysis (Oxford: Blackwell) in 2004, Widdowson beame himself atarget f criticism - the oo incitd a number of reviews beides being positively quoted in astill arger number of other publications), tarting with de Beaugrade's (2004) excoriating review article and followed by more descriptive but still critical reviews by Tian (2006) and Hauser (2006). The last article considered in the present study \*examines the theoretical foundations of Fairclough's CDA" and "summarizes and evaluates arguments put by critics of CDA" (Poole, 2010, p. 137.

This brief chronological overview demonstraes that the academic war' under investigation strted in 1995, and it is sill going on. Of course, the present analysis does not pretend to be exhaustive in terms of the material included - there are certainly other published reviews and the issues have been discued in other types of publications as well. The corpus includes publications by prominent representatives of the two opposing camps, on the one hand, and such that have been published in leading international journals, on the other. The two books mentioned above (Fairclough's 1992 and Widdowson's 2004) are not directly subjected to analysis here but frequent references to them are unavoidable.

# 4. Methodology

The corpus consists of 12 texts, published between 1995 and 2010, containing altogether 70,771 words - reviews and review articles of specific publications, as wellas overview articles - and constitutes a chain of opinion exchanges. The two schools of linguistics involved are among the leading ones at present and have attracted a large number of followers both in their theoretical orientation and in their practical applications. Therefore, it seemed of importance to attempt at an analysis of this academic war without aiming at any predictionsa to its outcome or taking side, since parallel and ofen contradictory trends in the feld have always existed but have rarely fought for a place in the sun with such viciousness.

In what is to follow I shall briefly present the general statistical data concerning the length of the articles, their authors, and the distribution in terms of belonging to the two camps, which I shall cll here "pro-CDA" (6 articles) and \*anti-CDA" (6 artcles).

As the data in Tables 1 and 2 show, despite the equal number f articles in each group, the opponents of CDA have been much more prolific, with H.. Widdowson having been the lone fighter for the frt 5 years. Of cours, this may be attributed to the appearanceof many other books and articles by followers of CDA where the respective authors have substantiated their theoretical and practical approaches, thus making special publications in answer to attacks on CDA redundant.

Noteworthy, the longest articles (Toolan, 1997; Bloomaert and Bulcaen 2000; Po0le, 2010) represent extensive overviews of existing trends in the field rather than criticism pure. The lattr observation holds true for the shortest articles which are book reviews

per se (Tian, 2006 and Hauser 2006).

Nevertheless the importance of the discussion around CDA is demonstrated not only because the above texts were published in some of the most prestigious journals in the field, but also by the fact that despite their 'review' character, they have (almost exclusively) article-length, which is an exception to the usual practices of the respective journals. Besides, as the time and order of publications shows, the authors were given immediate acces to publication without the customary long waiting periods.

The methodology for the identification of the critical argumentation schemes (hereinafter CAS) used in this study stems from the accepted theoretical framework (Walton, 1996; Walton et al., 2008) where each CAS was considered to be a stretch of discourse withn the overall texts of the reviews which: 1) has a clearly negative character; 2) is part of a chain of argumentative statements that are related to the same or similar/related premises in the intertextual world of the overall discussion; 3) may consist of a single phrase/sentence or a much longer section of a text.

After deciding on these parameters, the CASs were nnotated by hand i terms of the types of premises they were based on, s wel as in terms of the types of topoi they repreent. riginally, more CAs were identified by the author. The next step was to ensure inter. coder reliability. In order to achieve this aim, a group of ten MA students taking a course in Discourse analysis were instructed in the coding process and is parameters and were aked to do independent coding. Following a discussion of the discrepancies (stemming mainly from the analysis of the lengthy CASs), $1 0 \%$ of the CASs initially identified by the author were discarded as being controversial and were not considered in the analysis.

# 5. Results and discussion

This part f the study will frstbriefly diss the typef prmiss criticism  reviw articles is base n and will then focus on the types of CASs and their realization.

# 5.1. Premises

The expression of criticism may be based on different premises - theoretical assumptions, methodological falure, relevance of data, etc. The academic war corpus contains oly part of the premises discussed above. From the form-oriented premises there are only several occurrences f criticism of expresson, while there are no refereces to typography, lyout, or stuctre. As to the conten-oriented premises, only three types were observed, namely theory, terminology, and analysis. Graph 1 shows the distribution of the four types of

Graph 1. Distribution of the premises.

premises in percent.

The data demonstrate that in almost half of the instances $( 4 7 \% )$ the CASs refer to contentious theoretical issues. Problematic definitions and use of terminology account for another $2 0 \%$ of the cases. Thus, it is obvious that the main differences between the two camps' li in discrepancies of theoretical character, which is no surprise considering the fact that the analysed authors are repre. sentatives of different schools of linguistic thought that struggle for recognition and domination.

The CASs related to problematic analyses $( 2 4 \% )$ are primarily concerned with proving the analyses of the opponent(s) wrong and, in some case, suggesting right interpretations of the same data or theory. Example of the frst three types of premises are given in the respective sections below.

Criticism of ways and means of expression, which is an almost compulsory part of an academic book review, are seldom in this corpus $( 9 \% )$ and are of a basically different character:

(1) Compared to assume, the contextual range of the Noun and Verb stem claim', at 19 attestations, i even more drastic. Not only it is never used with Widdowson as agent, but the claims' are unsubtly made to sound phoney, especially in: [..] de

What de Beaugrande criticises here is the meaning invested in certain linguistic devices used by his opponent, not the form or th style of expression.

# 5.2. Analysis of CASs

# 5.2.1. CASs - overview

The overall number of instances of openly CAs in the whole corpus (afer discarding the controversial cases) is 292, where 119are used by the representatives of the pro-CDA group and 173 by the anti-CDA authors. The disribution of the schemes is unequal and depends both on the length of the particular article and on individual style. Table 3 lists the number of CAss for each author in chronological order.

In view of the definition of \*argumentation scheme" adopted in the present study, namely as chain of arguments, one should keep in consideration that some of the above schemes consist of phrases or clauses only, while others are longer than a paragraph. Moreover, the critical force of an argumentation scheme depends strongly on the language means employed for its realization, as will be demonstrated by the detaled analysis and examples below. Table 3 demonstraes that there i littl correlation between the length of the text and the number of CAs - individual author's aims, degree of commitment to a cause, authorit in the field and idiosyncratic manner of expression are the predominant factors playing a role in the representation of criticism.

# 5.2.2.Types of CASs

Graph 2 shows the percentage of the various types of argumentation schemes found in the corpus.

As the graph demonstrates, the refutations (false premises, questioning the premises and/or the conclusion, the conclusion does not follow the premises', 'probation', and 'personal attack') constitute $7 5 \%$ of the argumentation schemes established in the corpus. I have added a new category to the refutations enumerated by Walton et al. (2008), namely personal attack', since the corpus contained instances f criticism that could hardly be named argumentative, consisting solely of assults (often sarcastic) on the enemy, as in the following example:

(2) Imagine if you will a most peculiar game of bowling. [..] Such a game seems to me a not altogether unfitting metaphor for H.G. Widdowson's (2004) latest and largest - and, one ardently hopes, last - assault on \*(Critical) Discourse Analysis". Some of the targets are familiar from his \*past ten years' (page x) of fulminations, which he esteemed highly enough to have collected in a special volume, Controversies in Applied Lingusic (Seidhofer [ed.], 2003); and he frankly calls the new book "confrontational and uncompromising" ("waspish" would have been my word). (de Beaugrande, 2004:1)

Both the metaphor at the beginning and the lexis used in the extract sound not simplycritical but truly aggressive. Atthe same time, none of the traditionally recognized argumentation schemes is employed to endow the author's claims with credibility.

Graph 2. Types of argumentation schemes.

In what is to follow I shall discuss in detail the argumentation chemes enumerated above, beginning with those with the lowest frequency outside the group of 'refutations'.

5.2.2.1. Rebuttals. Starting off with the reutls (weak forms f rutation), unlike in other academic gnres, they account for only ${ 3 \% }$ of the argumentation schemes in the corpus. Practicall all of them appear in the articles of the general review' type, and refer to theory or terminology. The statements are hedged (underlined here) and have the function of a recommendation rather than criticism:

(3) In Chapter 1 Widdowson argues for a conceptual distinction to be made between 'text' and discourse'. While one cannot disagree with the necessity of making this distinction, the definition of the two terms is not entirely convincing. (Hauser, 2006:813)

Thus, rebuttals play a minor role in the present discussion, and one may conclude that these argumentation schemes are not typical of the discourse of an 'academic war' due to the weakness of their claims.

2.2.2. Defeasible argumentation schemes. Since these argumentation schemes presuppose that new evidence can be provided to refute neir conclusion, they come second in terms of low frequency $( 5 \% )$ in the corpus:

(4) I cannot help suspecting that some of the objections from stylisticians have emerged for the very particular reason that provocative sociological CDA seems to threaten to make stylistics - even the new stylistics - obsolete. (Toolan, 1997:84)

Similarly to rebuttals, defeasibles demonstrate an abundance of hedging devices such as the verbs seem/appear, as well as nantically indefinite determiners and adverbs.

Argumentation schemes whose premises are merely assumptions.

Voicing assumptions $( 1 7 \% )$ comes next in terms of strength of the argumentation scheme. These schemes usually express doubt and Joint to inconsistencies/insufficiencies in theory and use of terminology and definitions without claiming the ultimate truth'.

(5) Nor would I be so confident, when it comes to changing peoples atitudes or patterns of reading, about what means to use and what kinds of text to interrogate. (Toolan, 1997:88)

The example above concerns the manner of analysis and is an exponent of a topos from the person, which is clearly indicated hrough the first person singular, also acting as a hedging device. The following example shows some different characteristics:

(6) Van Dijk notes that the metaphor here explicitly signals where the paper stands on the issue of immigration, and confirms it right-wing position. Nobody, I imagine, would want to quarrel with that. However, there are features of the text following the headline which, on the face of it, are not consistent with this bias. (Widdowson, 1998:143)

Here, the author uses a topos from the contrast and a topos from the person simultaneously to suggest adifferent analys of the data rovided. He also engages the audience in the processof argumentation, thus looking for confirmation of his own point of view. Another example by the same author ilustrates his inclination to engage the readers by addressing them directly:

(7) But if you know the provenance of a particular text (the Sun newspaper, for example) you will obviously, as a matter of rudimentary pragmatic fact, position yourself accordingly and be primed to find confirmation of your own prejudice. Your analysis will be the record of whatever partial interpretation suits your own agenda. (Widdowson, 1998:148)

Of course, the second person pronoun could also be treated as standing for one, but the very fact that Widdowson chooses to use it repeatedly suggests his desire to trigger interactivity with the audience, which is,as a rule, afeature of spoken rather than written academic discourse (see, e.g., Vassileva, 2006 on spoken academic discourse).

5.2.2.3. Refutations. A refutation may be realized by proving that:

1. The premises of an argument are either not true, or are questioned;   
2. The conclusion does not follow the premises;   
3. The conclusion is false (termed 'probation').

The corpus includes cases of questioning the premises $( 1 7 \% )$ , declaring the premises false $( 1 7 \% )$ , claiming that the conclusion does not follow the premises, including the cases of false conclusions $( 2 2 \% )$ , and probation $( 8 \% )$

5.2.2.4. Questioning the premises. In the preailing number of cases the premises that are questioned are of theoretical character. Often the questions are 'piled up' one after the other, as in:

(8) The three aspects obviously invite comparison with Halliday's three macrofunctions of language. [..] What theoretical grounds there might be for the finer distinction is not made clear. And what of Halliday's third function, namely the textual? This, says Fairclough, can be usefully added to my list'. ..] Why is i useful? List of what? This function surely needs some theoretical justification. Are there then four, and not three, aspects? And if the textual function is not an aspect, what is it? Where does i ft in? I is surely not a matter of the function being usefull aded to a lit, but of being esentially integrated into a theory. (Widdowson, 1995a:511)

In the above paragraph, the majority of the sentences are interrogatory, demonstratig the author's disagrement with theoretical ssues in the reviewed book. The use of such rhetorical questions' has also been noticed by Hunston (2005:3), as well as "overt :eference to the writers themselves (we, us)" (Hunston (2005) as means of securing interaction with the readers.

Question-raising may also be combined with sarcasm:

(9) Meanwhile, bleary-eyed readers might ask with mounting frustration: if ll these would-be \*discourse analysts' have got it wrong, when is Widdowson going to present his own method that sets matters aright? This does not expressly occur, as far as I can see, until pages 169-171 (the book has $\mathbf { X } + 1 7 4$ pages): [...] (de Beaugrande, 2004)

In this complex argumentation scheme the author also involves the readers, as in the examples above, but in a different, sarcastic ay, at the same time using a topos from the person in his 'answer' to the question..

Notably, the arumentation cheme of question raising does not appear in all texts under discussion. That i, some authors, such as Widdowson, make use of an abundance of these schemes while others avoid them altogether.

5.2.2.5. False premises. Refuting the premises of the discussed author is almost exclusively confined to theory/theoretical premises This scheme may be realized by using a topos from the authority as in:

(10) Widdowson merely remarks in passing that some linguis, of course, never acepted them anyway' The field is thus being radicall reduced and impoverished by ignoring its venerable traditions of research in close contact with the reality and actual experience of language' ...]. Wenker, Wrede, Winteler, Guilleron, Jaberg, Kloeke, Schuchart, Schmeller, Gamillscheg, Ellis

Kurath, Sapir, Whorf, Firth, Pike, McDavid, Longacre, Chafe, Grimes ..some linguists indeed! (de Beaugrande, 2001) Iere, again, irony, or rather sarcasm, comes into play as well.

More often, however this scheme is realized by an explictly stated topos from the person, sometimes combined with topoi from the authority and contrast.

In certain cases, refutations of false premises may concern the analysis. The following example sounds very trong, also employing a topos from the contrast and a question-raising argumentation scheme plus audience involvement:

(11) The dfficulty is that i i hard to see how such an analysis can ever be systematically undertaken. For ifall language is so loaded, so ideologically saturated', then there is no redundancy - [..]. So how do we know under what textual or contextual conditions one feature takes on particular saliency and overrides the others? How do we know when a particular transformation', or particular word or collocation [..] has such a covert ideological force that it overrides other linguistic features [...]? (Widdowson, 1998:146)

Hunston (2005:6), who investigates a very similar corpus of partly the same articles using, however, a corpus investigation soft are, treats cases like the one above as creating both conflict with the criticised author and consensus with the readers: \*In a single hrase, Widdowson positions his readers in alliance with himself and against de Beaugrande." (Hunston (2005)

5.2.2.6. The concusion does not follow th premises theconclusion is false. Theseare the most frequent CASs observed in the corpus- a fact that seems natural considering the kind of textual sequences under consideration, namely, to refute the arguments/claims of the opposing camp at al costs. The scheme refers most frequently to theory, defintions/teminology or analysis and is based on the topos from the contrast:

(12) Rather than providing a sound explanation or a definition of pretext, Widdowson illustrates the relevance of this concept by pointing out how the focus of attention on meaning is regulated in different communicative events. (Hauser, 2006:814) 1e same review concludes with a definite refutal of the book as a whole:

(13) In this sense, Widdowson's book is to be seen as an important contribution to the critical study of language. However, Widdowson mainly focuses on what he identifie as the theoretical and methodological shortcomings of CDA and offers ittle in terms of solutions to the mentioned problems. Therefore, I would not recommend the book to readers [.. (Hauser, 2006:815)

In the following example, the reviewed author i straightforwardly accused of ignorance as the reason for drawing false conclusions one of the most powerful means of refuting scientific claims:

(14) These, Widdowson vows, are all the computer can cope with', [.. (6f, 14) he is obviously several generations behind on his knowledge of software for automatic parsing and lemmatising. (de Beaugrande, 2001)

Claiming false conclusions is ften done from the I-perspective, i., by employing atopos from the person together with the topos from the contrast:

(15) It i not open to critical discourse analysts to reply that specifying how things might be more equitably cast, discoursally is no necessary part of their agenda. I believe, on the contrary, that it has to be part of the agenda, if the following broad set of claims is being espoused. (Toolan, 1997:89)

As the discusson gradually becomes more heated, the two parties start accusing each other of 'misinterpretation':

(16) His reply indicates that all I uceeded in doing was to misrepresent him.[..] And by the same token, my own text is subject to misrepresentation. One example. I am charged with being too liberal in supposing that the social is'a voluntary association ofre individuals', that I disregard social conditions [.] I should be interested to know where there is textual warrant in my work for this bizarr interpretation of my position. You cannot study discourse in disregard of social factors and ! do not know of anybody who claims you can. (Widdowson, 1996:57)

Besides, the debate tends to develop into a highly controversial and very personal dispute - in the above example Widdowson not nly makes abundant use of the first person singular but also involves a wider audience beside the readers (anybody/you.

5.2.2.7. Arguments with a probative function. This is the case where the author employs the premises of the opponent to prove the conclusion(s) false. The scheme is not very frequent in the present corpus - authors obviously prefer to use their own premises/arguments to provide contrast. Perhaps the best example of probative argumentation schemes is de Beaugrande's 2001 article that even has the subtite: \*The discourse of a recent position by H.G. Widdowson is analysed by the methods criticised' in that very paper." In other words, the whole paper is built upon the textual and, respectively, argumentative features of the opponent's publication withthe aim of proving him wrong:

(17) With no evident sense of irony, he oversteps the boundaries of his discipline to castigate another discipline for overstepping its boundaries - just when, as I noted, the journal's editors are welcoming a broad range of research paradigms'. [. (8, 23f).

I have studied and applied the trends he discusses, and I confess myself unable to recognise them in Widdowson's portrayals least of all in the 'assumptions' and 'claims' and he consigns to them [...]. (de Beaugrande, 2001)

De Beaugrande's perspective is personal, but the argumentation is based exclusively on the opponent's own text. In some instances, de Beaugrande becomes rather sarcastic, not to say aggressive:

(18) A keyword in the case against all three trends, and also against linguistics as a whole, turns out to be reality. This potentially abstruse term becomes vital once applied linguistics is defined to be intimately concerned with 'reality' and the 'real world' (samples 1, 2, 6, 8-9). [examples from the text under consideration]

As evidence for the key role of reality, I would cite it 31 occurrence in Widdowson's paper, plus those of real' (20), relly' (6) and realize/realization (always in the sense of 'make real, put to use, peform') (13). The same stem is thus attested a remarkable 70 times, like an ominous ostinato. If the term \*real' indeed is often used freely as a general stamp of commendation' (5), then Widdowson plainly follows suit. (de Beaugrande, 2001)

As the discussion gradually turns into a war, de Beaugrande (2004) continues using probative argumentation schemes which. however, as the example below shows, already border on what I have called here 'personal attack':

(19) These are the sorts of discursive issues that CDA seeks to bring to light and confront without our own \*counter-discourse" and therefore see sight value, if not actual handicap, in the sort of academic window dressing Widdowson's rebukes us for lacking. He recognises this objection, but patronisingly enlightens all us ignoramuses that "[.. (de Beaugrande (2004) 173).

5.2.2.8. Personal attack. With the later example as a starting point, in what is o follow I shall try to justify my decision to add an argumentation scheme to those enumerated by Walton et a.(2008) through examples that hardly demonstrate logical argumentation but are rather critical satements directed to the opponent as a person and a scholar. As Hunston (2005:1) note, \*the writer of such articles ften attack individuals rather than outcomes of rearch". This argumentation scheme is most typical of the publications of H. G. Widdowson and R. de Beaugrande and is practically missing from the more general overview artices. This fact could be trated as authors idiosyncrasy, but i alsodemonstrates who the most committed representative of the respective parties are. De Beaugande's 2004 review begins with the "bowling" metaphor cited above. Another scathing metaphor comes later in the same text:

(20) But Widdowson's book shies away from data bearing on these large social ssues, despite the bold avowal in [10]  like nailing one's colours to the mast of the ship and then disembarking before it sails. So his book turns out as his own rather miscellaneous and rambling "critical analysis' (or more precisely "meta-analysis') of particular flaws in very different (C)DA projects and methods, like a laundry-list of clothes hung up on a public clothesline according to how each individual item seems torn or stained.

Widdowson, on his part, states directly that there are disagreements between himself and N. Fairclough and that those dis. agreements are more of a personal than professional character:

(21) Norman Fairclough and I disagree about a lot of things. That much is obvious. (Widdowson, 1996:57) And further:

(22) So i is that this present exchange between Norman Fairclough and myself is not between political values or ideological positions, Marxist versus Liberal or whatever, but between him and me, his views, sensitivities, prejudices, and mine. These are, of course, formed in part by our social history and political allegiance, expressive to some degree of the different discourse communities we belong to, but esentially this discourse we are pragmatically engaged in is a personal matter. (Widdowson, 1996:59)

In reply to thatFairclough (1996a, 1996b):53) exclaims:

(23) However, this stil leaves an apparently major difference between CDA and Widdowson with respect to politics: Wid dowson has no overt political commitments. But the fact that political commitments are not overt does not of course mean that they do not exist!

In the same issue of ,Language and Literature\* Widdowson (196:69) sems to make a peace proposal by finishing his article with the vords:

(24) And him against me? I think the discourse we are here enacting is a matter of individuals arguing against each other....] And so if we feel frustrated and affronted, we might be tempted to reduce each other to social subjects discursively determined and constructed' and I cry Marxist! and he cries Liberal and we resentfully go our separate ways. But that would be apity. Our positions are not as polarised as al that. I am no apologist for greater linguistics and totally reject the intertextual implication of the term. I agree that we need to take an interdisciplinary perspective on language study. I agree that people should be alerted to language abuse, and made aware of the ways in which it can be used to persuasive and manipulative efect. You do not have to subscribe to CDA to believe these things, and you do not have to be a critical linguist to have a social conscience. So I think there is a good deal of common ground between Norman Fairclough and myself, which both of us ought to be wiling to explore.

Unfortunately, the war does not come to an end. With the publication of his 2004 book, where CDA is again in th focus f criticism, Niddowson provokes the above-quoted viciously aggressive review by de Beaugrande (2004).

Others follow suit and join the dispute in favour of Widdowson's viewpoint:

(25) Widdowson has been a persistent critic of CDA in recent years, directing most of his fire at Fairclough's work, and apparently irritating some of those who subscribe to, or sympathize with, the CDA project. To Beaugrande (online) Widdowson is a bowler seting up human pins in the gutter where he cannot fail' to knock them down. According to Wodak (2006: 606), criticism of CDA seems to be on the top of Widdowson's agenda and has been for years'. She also accuses Widdowson of being patronizing, and alludes to his lack of expertise' on CDA (p. 607). Exasperation and name-calling, however, do not of themselves invalidate Widdowson's arguments. (Poole, 2010:147)

As the examples above demonstrate, the argumentation schemes based on 'personal attack' often go beyond the standard means of argumentation and especially lingustic expressin commonly accepted by scholarly discourse communities as belonging to the ethics of scientific communication.

5.2.2.9. Other argumentation schemes. Under this heading I shall inroduce some argumentation schemes found in the corpus that, firs, are ifficult to classif under any of the goups discussed above and, second, are very rare in writen academic discourse anyway. The first extraordinary case is the concluding paragraph of Widdowson's (1995b:171) article:

(26) You have (dear reader) been busy interpreting the text of this article, deriving from it your own discourses, authenticating it in your own terms, referring it to your reality. And naturally the discourse of your interpretation may not match the discourse of my intention. There is not much I can do about that: imperfect communication is a pragmatic fact f life. ll I can hope is that in your piecing out my imperfections with your thoughts, we have arrived at some shared understanding, some mutual accommodation and convergence of worlds.

Here, Widdowson initiates a dialogue with the reader addressing them directly (you' perspective) from the T perspective and finalizes the dialogue by assuming the reader's involvement and conformity with the suggested arguments (we perspective). Itis true that there is a note at the end of the article pointing out that: \*This article is aslightly modified version of apaper given at a seminar [..". Stll,the very decision of the author to keep those finishing thoughts in the published version can hardly be incidental. The highly personalized and interactive paragraph is evidence for Widdowson's desireto attract more fllowers by simultaneously playing down his own claims and giving his readers more freedom of interpretation.

Another example of an argumentation scheme that is hardly to be expected in a review article are Widdowson's (1998:150) contemplations on the ethics of \*intellectual enquiry", which serve as a conclusion (for reasons of space I have shortened the two paragraphs):

(27) And here we come up against a general and very tricky problem about the accountability of intellectual enquiry. One can accept it as a matter of fundamental principle that scholarship should be turned to social account and engage with moral isues, but the question is how far this can or should be done without compromising the very principles of scholarship which provide the authorit for this engagement. [..] My view would be that f a cause is just then we should loo for ways of upporting it by coherent argument and well-founded (as distinct from well-funded) analysis. And I would indeed argue that to do otherwise is to do a disservice to the cause. [Criticism of the CDA approach]. And here I think, is the central problem with CDA, and the reason why it is so influential while being so obviously defective. It carries conviction because it espouses just causes, and this is disarming, of course it conditions the reader into acceptance. If you can persuade people by an appeal to moral conscience, you do not need good arguments. But such persuasion deflects attention from questions of validity. It thus inhibits intellectual enquiry and ultimately undermines its integnty in the interests of expediency.

Actually, with the above words Widdowson accuses the CDA practitioners of some of the worst possible sins in academic en. deavours from the point of view of scientific ethics - namely of "compromising the very principles of scholarship", and of being manipulative both with the data they base their investigations on and with the conclusions they draw from these data, thus manip. ulating the audienceas well. uch allegations, beies being very strong, eentuall dismiss as worthless, untstworthy, and futile the whole theory and practice of CDA, respectively the work of all its adherents.

This and similar statements in Widdowson's 2004 book provoked de Beaugrande (2004) to react ferociously:

(28) The Preface demurely trivialises his verbal sallies of aggression, which he prefers to call "reservations" and the like: "no offence is intended, and I hope to be forgiven if any is taken' (ix). Yet much of it is hard for me to see as inoffensive; and the colleagues he attacks and I have corresponded with did not sound exactly forgiving. Here is what just one of them e-mailed me after reading a draft of this piece: [...] (John Sinclair)

And that's not all he wrote. Some responses from other prominent victims were, erm, considerably les adaptable to public citation.

In the same very emotional review, de Beaugrande resorts to another argumentation scheme that is quite unusual for academic writing - he'tell a story' about his personal communication/relationships with the main participants involved in the debates under consideration:

(29) Evidently without afecting him, I have deconstructed his criticisms of Halliday, Sinclair, and Fairclough and their three respective fields of inquiry (Beaugrande 1998a, 2001). Curiously, I am (or was) a friend (and sometime boozing buddy) of all four gentlemen, though of course never at the same time and place; in a relaxed environment, they are genial chappies you wouldn't imagine in combat. [.. esides, I am a practised and long-term synthesizer of work by broad fields and researchers (e. g. Beaugrande 1980, 1984),some of whom were not even on speaking terms with each other nor allowed any merit to each Other's approaches.

Such reminiscences add a personal touch to the argumentation and position the author as a mediator between opposing parties - a mediator who is tolerant and "determined to judge for myself on each one's own merits" (Beaugrande 1998a, 2001). However, as he goes on to say, \*The razors of my own polemics were aimed precisely at those who revelled in unfair or over-the-top polemics" (Beaugrande 1998a, 2001) and this justifies his attack on Widdowson.

The "boozing buddy' language transforms drastically into a razor-sharp choice of vocabulary that forebodes (being at the beginning of the article) the devastating criticism that is to follow. Such sudden changes of perspective and style in general are most probably intended, among other purposes to grab the reader's atention and guide them through the process of argumentation.

# 6. Conclusion

To summarize the most important observations from the study, I should point out to the following characteristic features of the 'academic war':

The longitudinal study demonstrates domination of epistemic argumentation, which is only natural for academic discourse, bu also a high degree of usage of deontic argumentation, of personalization and thus - of ethical argumentation.

The premises criticism is based on are of primarily content-oriented, theoretical character or are concerned with the validity of the analysis. Obviously, form-oriented premises are of litle or no interest to the authors, the language/style is not discussed at all in contrast to traditional academic book reviews. One of the reasons is most probably the fact that all scholars involved here are outstanding writers in the field. However, the focus on content isprimarily directed by the aim of the publications, namely, torefute crucial theoretical claims put forward by the opponent(s).

The language is highly personalized, I dare claim, more than in any other academic genre, where especially some of the authors resort not only to the frt person singular, thus laying emphasis on their own opinion, but also constantly try to involve the audience through extensive use of the inclusive 'we' and, even more untypical of the written mode of knowledge presentation - the direct address you'. Switching between pronouns and thus engaging the readers in a dialogue is another distinctive feature that reminds one of the styles of conference presentations and discussion sessions.

Turning now to the argumentation schemes analysed in the study, the fact that the refutations dominate overwhelmingly is not surprising at al, considering the goals and nature of the discourse. Noteworthy is the abundant use of questions/questioning the premises and/or the conclusions'. This is another feature of discourse that is more typical of the spoken mode of academic communication. Besides, unlike in other geres, the questions are very seldomly rhetorical, but rather of the kind that really expect answers. Semanticall, however, they expres criticism, and th peupposition i usuall that thre are no answers but only als clams. Inthis sense, the debate again comes close to a spoken exchange of opinions and arguments - an exchange that is further realized through subsequent publications. Therefore, intertextuality plays an ever-increasing role with the development of the debate over time.

Another distinctive feature of the means of argumentation observed in the corpus is the employment of numerous metaphors and irony/sarcasm that often go beyond the generally accepted ethics in academia in their interpersonal pragmatic effect.

And last but not least,the authors make use of other argumentation schemes such as personal attacks, direct interaction with the reader, preaching ethics of inellectual enquiry, story-telling elements, etc., all f them being quit far from logical argumentation proper which is conventionally expected in academic publications. This i another fact in support of the assumption that the discourse of an academic war' has some specific characteristic features that make it stand out among the standard genres in academia and therefore deserves special atention. Therefore, genre theory should be extended to also embrace such deviations from the widely accepted norm and explain their structure, language used, and function in the community.

From a theoretical perspective, the argumentative schemes approach employed in this research proved useful for a longitudinal study including the examination of ublications related to one another intertextuall, whereas other approaches, as mentioned above, remain at the level of the individual argumentative token and its rhetorical/linguistic analysis. Nevertheles, a critical ssue of this approach turned out to be the highly inferential character of the identification and categorisation of the CASs and, consequently, the operationalisation of the model. The problem was resolved by using multiple judges in order to ensure inter-coder reliability. till, the refinement and/or the employment of a different solution may present a fruitful subject for future research.

Other directions for further investigations would be the establishment of confrontational rhetoric and its realization in related, as well as totall diffent fiedsf rearch, in an effort to deterine similarities and diferences and characteristc feature of the gnre. Besides, contrastie studies between different languages may be expected to bring to light cross-cultural variations in view of the examined phenomena.

In terms of pedagogical implications it might be useful to teach the basics of argumentation theory and practice to MA and PhD students so as to facilitate their ailitie to both interpret and produce adequate aadmic text. The reults of the study may be used in EAP and ESP/LSP courses at a more advanced level (for instance, PhD students to create awarenes of the existence of confrontation in academia, foster critical thinking and understanding of genre specificities. Students should thus be able to discern the delicate boundary between critical evaluation of sources in order to establish a niche for their own research, on the one hand, and confrontation, on the other, both in terms of authors intended meaning and in terms of the language means use. Along these lines, contrastive studies, on their part, would also be helpful to scholars - non-natie speakers who wish to publish in English, especiall such that come from almost totally non-confrontational academic backgrounds.
