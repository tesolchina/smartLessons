# Abstract

Getting papers published in the (largely English-language) international literature is important for individual researchers, their institutions, and the academic community, and the resulting pressure is being felt increasingly in China as a result of top-down policy initiatives. For many researchers, reaching this goal involves two intersecting aspects: developing very specific skills in English as an additional language, often from an initial intermediate proficiency level; and learning to meet the discipline-specific expectations of English-speaking journal referees and editors. This paper describes and evaluates workshops, designed to improve the publication skills of researchers in the agricultural and environmental sciences, which seek explicitly to address both aspects. Key features include a collaborative presentation team consisting of an EAP practitioner and practising scientists who are experienced referees, and methodology based on research findings from genre analysis and EAP. The paper analyses evaluative data from four workshops in China during 2001–2003. Findings include high satisfaction levels of participants, strong endorsement of the value of the collaboratingcolleague presentation team, and significantly increased confidence to write a paper in English for international submission. The only participant characteristic associated with best benefit was a completed higher degree. Implications are presented for future practice.

# 1. Introduction

Getting published in the peer-reviewed international literature is a goal that is becoming more important for researchers worldwide from an early stage of their career. In China, both scientists and bureaucrats are keen to enhance the degree to which Chinese research is known internationally. Similarly, it is of concern to the scientific community more broadly that substantial amounts of research conducted in Asia, and particularly China, are not accessible to them (Gibbs, 1995). The vast majority of the journals in which this research is communicated internationally is published in English (Ammon, 2001; Swales, 1990). Recent research has highlighted some of the particular challenges faced by researchers for whom English is an additional language (EAL), in seeking to publish in these journals. Although there is no universal agreement about the degree to which EAL researchers in general struggle to get published in English (Canagarajah, 1996; Flowerdew, $1 9 9 9 \mathrm { a }$ ; Wood, 2001), EAP practitioners who work to support novice researchers from EAL backgrounds are clear that the difficulties for them are considerable (Burrough-Boenisch, 2003; Flowerdew, 1999a, 1999b, 2000; Gosden, 2003). The situation for non-native-Englishspeaking scholars researching in the area of applied linguistics in Hong Kong has been investigated in some depth by Flowerdew (2001), and that of researchers in a range of fields in Spain by Burgess (2004). Researchers in the agricultural and environmental sciences have not been a focus to date, although in these fields access to the widest possible range of information is extremely important.

In the Chinese context, inducements have been put in place to encourage scientists to pursue publication of their results in English. For example, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) supplements the salaries of researchers who have papers accepted by journals indexed in the Science Citation Index (SCI) of the Institute of Scientific Information (workshop participants, personal communication, 2001). Similarly, many highly ranked Chinese universities have recently stipulated that their Ph.D. students must have a minimum of one paper accepted for publication in an international SCI journal before the award of the degree (Li, 2002). Thus, there is considerable demand for access to skills and strategies for writing papers that are likely to meet the requirements of international gatekeepers. That such requirements are often not met by EAL authors is clear from a perusal of the websites of the major journal publishing houses; advice to have papers checked by a native English-speaker before submission is common. Concern is also expressed that issues of non-standard English can overlap with issues about the rigour of the science being reported (journal editor, personal communication, 2003). The resolution of both sets of issues in the context of refereed journal articles lies with the journal editors and reviewers. These form a particular kind of expert informant for applied linguists working on the research article genre, and one whose voices have not often been included in our analyses or the development of our practice. As Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002) acknowledged, working with, rather than for, specialists in particular fields of academia has been a stated goal for EAP, but one which is often difficult to realise. The work we report here makes a start on including this fresh perspective in the context of teaching publication skills; we are an EAP practitioner from an applied linguistics background, and an environmental scientist who referees regularly for international journals in his field, and we are two members of the presenting team for the collaborating-colleague workshops of the title.

For us, the motivation to conduct research on the teaching of the research article genre arises from a need to provide the most effective support possible to novice scientific writers in Asia as they seek to develop the skills to publish their articles successfully. To achieve such a goal Swales (1990) suggested exercises in genre analysis (GA) to raise novice writers’ awareness of features of the genre and the language used to realise them. Flowerdew (2000) recommended that apprentice professionals be brought together to interact with their peers, receive some formal instruction in writing, and be mentored by both language and subject specialists. Both these sets of strategies are features of the workshop described and evaluated below.

Our aims in this paper are first to describe our collaborating-colleague workshop approach and locate it within relevant theoretical perspectives. We then present an analysis of evaluative data on four workshops in research contexts in China during 2001–2003. Going beyond the satisfaction ratings received, we focus particularly on two sets of data: open-ended responses about what participants found most helpful and what they thought could be changed to make the workshop more useful (all workshops); and a statistical analysis of paired data on participants’ confidence levels for writing in English (2003 only). Our aim here is to tease out the particular contributions to the success of the workshops made by the collaborating-colleague approach we employ, and characteristics of workshop participants that relate to the achievement of best benefit. The final section discusses some specific issues related to improving access for Chinese researchers to international publication and roles in this endeavour for EAP/ESP practitioners working in collaborative teams with publishing/refereeing researchers who are native speakers of English.

# 2. The Improving Publishing Skills workshops

The workshops are designed for groups of researchers working in a coherent discipline which matches the knowledge and experience base of the scientist members of the collaborative presentation team (2 or 3 per workshop). We use a team-teaching approach based on previous work together in teaching that integrated content with academic language development. The workshops are described below in terms of their four key features.

Task-based approach (Brinton, Snow, & Wesche, 1989): Participants bring with them a complete set of results ready to write as a paper, or an early draft manuscript, and are expected to write or revise their own manuscript as part of the workshop process.

Basis in genre pedagogy (Cope & Kalantzis, 1993): Our aim is to provide participants with an analysis framework arising from GA and EAP pedagogy, and basic skills in applying the framework to well-written published articles in their own discipline as a lifelong learning tool. One or two example articles are selected by the presenting team and sent to participants before the workshop. A diagrammatic representation of IMRaD (Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion) article structure is presented early in the workshop (Weissberg & Buker, 1990) to facilitate identification of similarities to and differences from it in the example articles. Then, as each article section is discussed, moves and steps as identified in the GA literature (e.g., Gosden, 1992; Hyland, 1996; Samraj, 2002; Swales, 1990) are presented as a descriptive exercise (rather than prescriptive teaching) and participants compare these with what they find in the example article/s. The sections are dealt with in the order Results, Methods, Introduction, Discussion, followed by Abstracts. For Results sections, the content experts also present relevant aspects of data presentation, such as preparing tables and figures that highlight the point made by the data and contribute clearly to the story of the paper. We emphasise that the Results section drives the paper and should therefore be written first.

Class discussion follows of possible reasons for variations found between the GA outcomes and the example article/s; these are often discipline-specific issues which are pinpointed by the content-expert presenters. In-class writing time is provided for participants to draft or revise the relevant section of their own paper. The presenters are available for individual consultation on issues as they arise, calling on language and content expertise as appropriate.

Referee criteria as the overarching point of reference: A composite set of referee criteria is presented, constructed from relevant sets available to the content-expert presenters. These criteria are used alongside the GA results, using questions such as ‘‘Where in the article do you think a referee would expect to find evidence on this criterion?’’ and ‘‘Where in the English sentences do the authors make it clear that they are presenting evidence relevant to this criterion?’’ In addition, one workshop component focuses on the process of submission and subsequent negotiation with editors around referee reports. Categories of referee comments are presented, along with strategies for responding to each and examples of possible response wordings, based on an analysis of available editorial correspondence (O’Connor & Cargill, 2006).

Developing sentence-level English and discourse strategies for expressing researchers’ meanings: Our approach to English language development is presented explicitly to participants early in the workshop. Wall charts are used for vocabulary and structures identified during analysis of example articles or individual consultations. Sentence templates are included (sentence structures that could usefully be reused with different noun phrases inserted). Aspects of English usage particularly relevant to specific article sections are taught or reviewed when that section is discussed: e.g., passive constructions with Methods, use of definite and indefinite articles and the placement of given information before new information with Introductions, modal verbs of certainty and tentativeness and hedging with Discussions. In addition, participants are introduced to a simple concordancing programme (ConcApp, http://www.edict.com.hk/concordance/) and the concept of constructing a corpus of articles from their own discipline to use as a source of data for ongoing language learning (Cargill & Adams, 2005).

The EAP team member takes the lead in analysing article structure and language teaching, and the scientists for data presentation and refereeing and publication processes.

# 3. Evaluation of four workshops in China, 2001–2003

# 3.1. Method

The questionnaire items and the purpose of the evaluation (to improve the workshop for future Chinese participants) were in English but further explained in Chinese. The questionnaire designs differed slightly between the 2001 presentations and the two later workshops because of contextual factors and as we refined our understandings of what we needed to know, but in all cases contained items with 5-point Likert-scale responses and open-ended questions. In 2003, a separate non-anonymous questionnaire was also administered before and after the workshop to investigate changes in participants’ confidence levels in the two key areas of writing and dealing with the publication process. All results were analysed using SPSS Version 10.

To investigate features of the workshops which could help explain the numerical results obtained, we conducted a thematic analysis of the participants’ responses to relevant openended questions, in which the frequency of each of the identified themes occurred for each workshop was recorded, and the most commonly occurring keywords within the major themes were tracked to their sources (Cargill, 2004). Responses to two questionnaire items were analysed in this way for the 2001 workshops: ‘‘What were the three most useful things in the course?’’ and ‘‘Overall how useful did you find the course in assisting you to write a research paper?’’ For the 2002 and 2003 presentations, the relevant item was ‘‘What were the most useful things in the workshop for you?’’

# 3.2. Results and discussion

# 3.2.1. Mean evaluation scores

Mean evaluation scores represent two measures of satisfaction with the workshop (usefulness of materials and methods, and appropriacy of English level used) and a selfperceived outcome, increase in confidence (see Table 1). High mean satisfaction scores were recorded for usefulness for all workshops (mean $\geqslant 4 . 3$ where $1 =$ strongly disagree and $5 =$ strongly agree). In addition, for the 2002 and 2003 presentations, mean scores of 4.2 and 4.3 were received for the item ‘‘I would recommend this workshop to a colleague who had to pay for it himself or herself’’ (not used in the earlier workshops). Participants generally found the level of English used appropriate (mean $\geqslant 3 . 8$ ). The lower score for this item in 2003 relates to a greater number of participants who were Ph.D. candidates and had not yet reached the English score required for graduation.

# 3.2.2. Contribution of the collaborative team

Participants recognised the collaborating-colleague team as being highly effective. In 2001, the 1:1 interaction with the Australian trainers was rated one of the two most useful components (along with the teaching sessions), with mean scores of 4.8 (Beijing) and 4.9 (Nanjing). Alerted by open-ended responses in 2001 to the potential contribution to participants’ satisfaction of the make-up of the teaching team, we included a new item in the 2002 and 2003 evaluation questionnaires: ‘‘The teaching team (scientists plus English teacher) was suitable to help me develop publishing skills.’’ For both workshops, this item received the highest positive endorsement of any item (means of 4.8 and 4.6, respectively).

# 3.2.3. Participants’ confidence to write for publication in English

Confidence was measured by self-report post-workshop in all years (see Table 1), and by an additional paired pre- and post-workshop questionnaire in 2003 (see Fig. 1). Confidence for writing a paper for submission to an English language journal is used as a surrogate measure for outcome from the workshops, because any direct measure of acceptance of manuscripts for publication will be confounded by a range of factors. These include the standard and novelty of the science being reported (Gosden, 1992), the level of the journal to which the manuscript is submitted, the post-course effort of participants to write and publish their research findings (e.g., some participants may move to career paths which do not encourage or require publication of scientific research), the amount of assistance in writing and publishing in English which is available from other sources after the course, and the level of input graduates of the training workshops actually make to multi-authored papers. Differences between pre- and post-workshop confidence levels were tested for significance using a paired sample $t$ -test, and demographic and experience factors were tested for correlation (Pearson’s product moment correlation test) with participant confidence level at the beginning and end of the workshop.

In the pre- and post-workshop surveys conducted in 2003, participants’ mean confidence scores $( n = 3 0 )$ ) showed a significant increase $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , from 2.6 to 3.7 ( $1 =$ not very confident, $5 =$ very confident) with an almost uniform increase for all participants (Fig. 1). This reported increase in confidence was from a base (pre-workshop) position which was already relatively confident, in line with the findings of Li (2002). There was a significant correlation before the workshop between an individual’s confidence to write for publication in English and the number of papers they had had accepted by Chinese language journals (corr. 0.410; $p = 0 . 0 2 4 )$ . This correlation was not present after the workshop, with or without initial confidence as a co-variate. Thus, the workshop seems to have neutralised the effects of experience level on confidence to write for publication in English. Post-workshop confidence to write was correlated with holding of a Master’s or Ph.D. degree, but this relationship was not present before the workshop. Participants who have completed post-graduate training are likely to have more highly developed research skills, greater experience in reading research results published in English, a set of publishable results which could be shaped during the training course, and more experience of confronting the limitations of research which can require the most deft writing skills.

Confidence to write for publication at the end of the workshop was not correlated with previous overseas experience, nor with post-workshop confidence to deal with the publishing process, the mean score for which was 3.6 $\scriptstyle 1 = \ n \ o t$ at all confident, $5 =$ very confident). This finding indicates that participants were reasonably confident of their ability to negotiate with referees and editors even if they were aware of limitations in their ability to write the manuscript. No gender differences were found (14 females, 16 males). Two participants reported being less confident to write for international publication after the workshop than before. A possible explanation could be that the workshop improved their understanding of the full dimensions of the challenge involved, but did not improve their self-perceived writing abilities to the same extent.

# 3.2.4. Analysis of open-ended responses

To contribute to future improvements to the workshop, and to the teaching of paperwriting more broadly, it was important to investigate which aspects may have contributed to the high participant satisfaction and the reported increase in confidence. For the purposes of this paper it was of particular interest to interrogate the contribution of the collaborating-colleague presentation team. Our analysis identified six themes in the data: features of the target genre, language use, paper-writing process, workshop components/ style, affect-related, and general approval. Table 2 records the keywords which clustered under each theme, and the percentage of responses that fell under each.

For each workshop the themes occurred in the data in the same order of frequency (see Table 2), with the most common theme being Features of the Target Genre. The percentage of responses falling under this theme was markedly higher than that for the next two categories, language use and paper-writing process, and workshop components/ style and affect-related comments occurred in smaller numbers. The common order of frequency identified suggests that participants in all workshops recognised value in similar aspects of the workshops, and that Features of the Target Genre was the strongest focus of their evaluative comments.

3.2.4.1. Key features for participants: structure of the article and its sections. Within the theme features of the target genre, article structure was very frequently mentioned as a useful aspect, in particular the hourglass-shaped diagrammatic representation of an IMRaD article: the diagram for a manuscript is also important (Beijing, 2003); how to write the introduction from the broad to the narrow (ACIAR, 2002). This diagram (Weissberg & Buker, 1990) facilitates a clear initial focus on the relationship of the sections of the research article to each other and to the context in which the article is to appear. Our use of this hourglass shape elicited an insightful response in small group work from one participant in the western China workshop. She drew in the air her own contrasting idea of the shape of a Chinese research article, with a very large and bulbous middle and short narrow columns at the top and bottom for Introduction and Discussion parts (A. McNeill, personal communication, 2002). This shape reflected her perception of an emphasis in Chinese research articles on presenting large amounts of data, rather than on the context and interpretation of the study. As a result, our workshop materials now describe paper writing as ‘‘not presenting data but contributing to the collaborative construction and legitimisation of knowledge.’’ A comment on the same (ACIAR, 2002) workshop is relevant here: The most useful thing to me is that it clarified the difference between international journal and native journal of China, and it encouraged me to make effort to submit papers to international journal. This clarification of difference is strongly enhanced by the presence of experienced referees/editors who can reinforce the importance for publication success of the genre features highlighted by the workshop methodology.

Other commonly mentioned aspects were how to write Introductions and Discussions: linked the discussion and conclusion session to the introduction (Beijing, 2001); The most useful part of this course is that I know how to write an introduction and discussion related to my research work (Beijing, 2001).

Introductions and discussion sections are generally regarded as difficult to write, especially by novice researchers from non-Anglophone countries (Burrough-Boenisch, 2005; Flowerdew, 1999a, 1999b). One cause of the difficulty for novice authors working in China can be their isolation: from access to literature published in English (Canagarajah, 1996, 2002), and from the rhetorical tradition that requires that their work be justified in terms of what has gone before. As Gosden (1992) summarises from responses by science journal editors:

The broad term ‘‘isolation’’ covers many causes, for example: not carefully reading ‘‘Instructions to Authors’’; unfamiliarity with the journal and its academic level; not reviewing previous literature well and relating to others’ work, possibly due to a lack of literature/library facilities; a lack of awareness of what constitutes publishable research; and unfamiliarity with the broad (and unwritten) ‘‘rules of the game.’’ (p. 115)

Collaboration with an NS co-author was reported to have contributed effectively to the writing of these sections by Cho (2004), who researched the experiences of NNS doctoral students in the USA—but this resource is not generally available to our workshop participants, nor to many researchers in China and elsewhere. Similarly, many such authors cannot afford professional editing by native speakers, such as is now often offered via the internet (Burrough-Boenisch, 2003; Luellen, 2001). The confident assertions of our workshop participants that they have developed skills for tackling these sections suggests that our goal of equipping them to write independently has been achieved in their own estimation.

An important contribution to this development seems to be in the area of negotiating the strength of scientific claims. The way in which results are summarised and claims for their meaning expressed in English is an ongoing area of study (Burrough-Boenisch, 2005; Hyland, 1998; Myers, 1992). The hedging language used to express the exact degree of certainty or tentativeness with which the claim is being made is often adjusted by referees or others asked to comment on manuscripts (Burrough-Boenisch, 2005; Gosden, 1995); often amendments involve tense or the addition or deletion of modals such as ‘‘may.’’ A crucial aspect of this negotiation of meaning, and one usually beyond the competence of non-specialists in the research field, is the relationship of the words used to express the claim and the actual strength in scientific terms of the results on which the claim is based. It is exactly in this domain that our collaborative workshop team can be especially helpful to novice writers, moving from basic teaching of the hedging and boosting forms, to examples in the published articles we analyse, to examples in the draft discussions of participants, and including input from the point of view of prospective referees. Some participants have noted the usefulness of this component, listing it as tense analysis for scientific English writing (Beijing, 2001); or using the correct verbs in a sentence (Beijing, 2003).

3.2.4.2. Key features for participants: insights relevant to their future practice of science. The extended focus in the workshop on writing a paper for scrutiny by external referees had implications beyond writing for some participants. Aspects of scientific method were highlighted: No much speculative statements extrapolated from results, conclusions just on ground of results you have secured. In a word, any statement should be put on given facts. (Nanjing, 2001). Similarly for a Beijing 2001 respondent: From the aspect of attitude to science, the trainers are very strict, I should learn from them. This reinforcement is seen to carry over into the research work itself: It improves my ability y to collect data (Beijing, 2001); The course makes me understand y how to search literature (Beijing, 2001); How to find references and how to design my experiment and to organise research result (Beijing, 2003).

The inclusion in the presentation team of research scientists experienced in refereeing resulted in the opportunity for individual consultation on the scientific content of participants’ papers as well as the language used to express it (Gosden, 1992), and for clear demonstration of the relationship between the two spheres. This had outcomes which were clearly both recognised and valued by participants. It enabled a strong and effective focus on the complete process of writing and submission: The most useful things for me is to learn the whole process of drafting a research paper. To know some skills and strategies about submitting a research paper (Beijing, 2003). Mention was also made of learning to think differently about writing a research article: Learned how to develop a scientific paper in a way the paper may be accepted by international journals. Learned how to think, not to write a specific paper for this workshop. (ACIAR, 2002). In addition, the CAS Head of Section responsible for encouraging the ongoing presentation of these workshops in China has reported that the key outcome he has observed and wishes to see strengthened is that the focus on what is required of the written text serves to highlight for participants the need for their science to be innovative (Jinghua Cao, personal communication, November 2003).

3.2.4.3. Key features for participants: learning through analysing examples of relevant genres. The analysis provided above suggests that learning from analysing authentic examples, following a genre-pedagogy approach, was effective for participants, although the theme which aimed to capture this contribution (Workshop components/style) accounted for a smaller percentage of responses. This discrepancy may be explained by issues with terminology: asking how the workshop was useful elicited responses focussing both on learning outcome (taught me how to write introductions) and the method by which the outcomes was achieved, and comments suggested these ideas were blended in participants’ responses. Analysing examples was nevertheless highly congruent with participants’ expectations. One participant in western China quoted the proverb ‘‘If you read and recite 300 poems, you can be a poet yourself,’’ and a Nanjing (2001) participant wrote: Analysing the examples will help us. Examples analysed, alongside complete articles, were of referee guidelines, covering letters to editors, response letters from editors to submitters, referees’ reports (cf. Gosden, 2003), and letters from submitters responding point by point to referees’ comments and seeking to negotiate a revised version of the paper that responded to referees’ criticisms while maintaining the author’s main points. These represent what Swales (2001, p. 49) referred to as contingent genres, within which the standard research article is situated and by which it is influenced. They are also occluded genres, in that researchers, teachers and students usually have little access to them (Gosden, 2003). As Gosden (2003) and Canagarajah (2002) have pointed out, a lack of cross cultural awareness of review and publication procedures may contribute to the difficulties experienced by novice EAL submitters. In our workshops, insider perspectives on these contingent and occluded genres were available from the presenters who were authors, referees and editors for scientific journals, to be added to those of the EAP outsider analysis. Thus the scientists provided a closing of the genre circle; the value of this for the participants was reflected in frequent evaluation responses which coupled how to write it with what the referee will think of it: How will the editors or referees think about which paper is good enough that can be published in their journals (Nanjing, 2001).

# 3.2.5. Participants’ suggestions for workshop improvements for the Chinese context

Participants were also asked how the workshops could be improved to make them more useful to Chinese scientists, and the results analysed for insights into effectiveness. Almost half of the changes suggested by participants $( 4 9 . 6 \% )$ related to adding more of features already present. Specific requests include more examples to be analysed (of all types used), more writing time, more one-to-one consultation on draughts, and more work on sentence structure and vocabulary. However, for all workshops some participants also wanted less work at the sentence level—the contrast reflects differing levels of initial English proficiency and of research writing experience. Proficiency levels of participants have varied widely, although IELTS 6 or equivalent was stipulated in the pre-workshop communications as the expected prerequisite level for optimal outcomes. The dilemma created by disparate participant proficiency and experience levels needs to be dealt with in the recruiting of participants, but our experience has been that the pressure to publish internationally leads to enrolment of some participants who lack the English proficiency and/or research experience needed to benefit optimally from what is offered.

The next most common category $( 2 5 \% )$ was changes to the presentation of the workshops; many of these suggestions sought a closer match between the research fields of the scientist presenters and those of the participants. This again reflects problems with recruitment of participants most able to benefit from the workshops, but also validates the usefulness of including scientist presenters in the collaborating-colleague team. Others sought a more even level of experience and proficiency in both English and research among participants. For some participants, the example papers had been too complex. Some comments reflected outcomes commonly desired by scientists worldwide, though elusive: The skills to submit manuscript and get it published easily and quickly (Beijing, 2001).

Follow-up options were the main focus of suggestions to operate after the workshop $( 1 5 \% )$ . Participants in all workshops expressed a wish to keep in touch with the presenters and have help with finishing and revising their papers. Such ongoing contact would contribute to the mentoring alluded to by Flowerdew (2000), or the ‘‘conduit scholar’’ notion of Canagarajah (2002), but is not a feasible option for us given the number of participants. To date we have focused on two approaches to help equip participants for ongoing development: (1) teaching and practising self- and peer-editing skills within the workshop, and training participants in using well-written examples of papers in the relevant field as sources of data for language learning; and (2) ensuring participants are aware of resources to support their publishing, such as bibliographic software and registering to receive emailed alert notices from journal publishers. These issues are clearly relevant to all contexts where novice authors are being inducted into the world of international publishing.

# 4. Implications for EAP/ESP teaching of novice manuscript submitters

Implications can be drawn for scientists, science administrators and EAP practitioners wanting to develop the skills of researchers for publishing in English-language international journals, in China and other countries sharing significant features of the Chinese situation. The general principles are likely also to be relevant for language professionals of all kinds working with novice writers of research articles in other contexts. From the analysis of the evaluation data, several features have been identified that relate closely to the success of the workshops.

# 4.1. Key conditions for optimising the effectiveness of a collaborating-colleague workshop

Given that conditions and curriculum are as described in the earlier parts of the paper, the characteristic of participants that appears to predispose them to best benefit is a Master’s or Ph.D. degree completed. This factor equates to a moderate level of research experience and a rigorous research training, and it is noteworthy that improving participant selection to ensure a comparable level of research experience across the cohort was one improvement suggested by participants in their evaluation responses. A recent study of Japanese authors similarly suggests that junior and more experienced researchers may need different types of assistance with paper writing (Okamura, 2006).

Another set of salient participant characteristics is those we have incorporated into the workshop design and whose importance has been reinforced through participant evaluations. These include, first, that each participant comes to the workshop with a set of results completed and analysed. Without this, participants cannot take full advantage of the workshop emphasis on refining their key messages and adjusting the way they are organised and expressed to meet the expectations of the audience, represented by the target journal and its editor and referees. Secondly, participants must be working in discipline areas which match the knowledge and experience of the scientist presenters. Where this has not been the case (e.g. presenters covering plant physiology, ecology and soil science and participants from atmospheric physics and chemical engineering) participants have been less satisfied.

The third of this set of characteristics is English proficiency at a level to enable comfortable operation within the workshop milieu. Although mean scores for the suitability of the English used are relatively high (see Table 1), open-ended evaluation responses have indicated that some participants have found the English too difficult, while others have been frustrated at the amount of time spent on sentence-level issues. Our most recent approach to ensuring participants have an appropriate level of English to benefit, rather than referring to test scores that may or may not be available or relevant, is to explain in some detail in the advance publicity material what people will be expected to do in the workshop, and allow self-selection on that basis. The information provided includes that all teaching, interaction and materials will be in English; that participants will read full papers which may be from sub-discipline areas other than their own; and that participants will engage in writing and revising their own draft during workshop sessions. As noted earlier, however, the current pressure for Ph.D. students to publish has sometimes overridden any qualms about suitability suggested by this information, and where this has been the case satisfaction and outcomes have been at a lower level. A co-component of this proficiency issue has been identified through our post-workshop reflections. It is that, for best benefit, participants need to be willing to engage productively with the methodology we employ, even though it may be different from what they are used to. In particular, this involves our focus on the learning of skills as superordinate to the production of a single successful product. Thus, participants need to be willing to move beyond any expectation they may bring that the presenters are available simply to correct an already completed draft—this expectation has often emerged during workshops, especially from high-status participants. We do, of course, engage with enthusiasm in commenting on draft sections once the participant has revised them in the light of the workshop teaching.

# 4.2. Broader implications

Publication skill development is an important need for both Ph.D. students and practising researchers in the sciences in China. In the university milieu, the collaboratingcolleague approach described here could serve as a methodology to help cover ‘‘the gap between the language in the classroom and the real world’’ identified by Xu (1999) in ESP courses. For Chinese scientists already working in research, the need would seem to be to develop skills and provide resources for lifelong independent learning of the disciplinespecific English needed for successful submission to international journals. This learning would of course incorporate wherever possible the collaboration with English-speaking researchers and the mentoring and coaching advocated by Cho (2004), Flowerdew (2000) and others, but this will not always be possible. Collaborating-colleague workshops based on genre pedagogy, such as those described and evaluated here, could form a keystone component of such a lifelong learning approach. In a context where ‘‘[o]verall, it would seem that genre study and genre skills are typically a necessary but not a sufficient condition for interpreting and creating academic discourse’’ (Swales, 2001, p. 53), we have demonstrated the value that is added to the teaching of publication skills through an collaborating-colleague approach between an EAP practitioner with genre expertise, and expert members of the target scientific discourse community.

The concentrated focus in these workshops on the production of text in the presence of representatives of the gatekeepers who will judge its acceptability for international publication clearly has the potential to encourage creative reflection on the practice of science as well as its communication, as demonstrated by the analysis we have presented. Taylor and Chen (1991) showed for article introductions that variation between AngloAmerican authors and Chinese authors writing in Chinese and in English was affected by ‘‘significant variations in both regional and disciplinary cultures’’ (p. 332), and our participants have highlighted that the workshops helped them appreciate salient differences between the requirements of Chinese and Western articles in their own disciplinary locations. It may well be that this type of workshop could make a contribution to aspects of scientific training in China beyond publication skills.

The effectiveness of this workshop approach in other EAL contexts remains to be investigated, but it is our expectation that the pedagogical structure described in this article is likely to be generally applicable if details are adapted in line with the levels of research and publication experience and English proficiency of the workshop participants. A barrier to the further development of the approach may be a general lack of awareness among scientists of the potential contribution to publication skill development that can be made by people with applied linguistics/academic literacies expertise. Further research is clearly needed in a range of institutional settings to investigate how to build effective collaborating-colleague teams such as the ones involved in this initiative. Nevertheless, a clear potential exists for this workshop approach to contribute to an important ultimate objective: that more science conducted in countries where English is a foreign language gets ‘‘a respectful reading’’ (Shashok, 2001, in Burrough-Boenisch, 2003) from international editors and referees, and that more researchers working outside the centre are able to successfully negotiate the international publishing process.
