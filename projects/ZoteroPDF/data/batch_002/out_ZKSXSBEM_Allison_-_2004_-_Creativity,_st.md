# Abstract

Creativity is widely invoked in certain educational and other public discourses, and has been quite extensively theorised and investigated in some circles, but still receives little attention in EAP discussions of students’ academic writing. After outlining likely reasons for this avoidance, my paper explores what students and teachers in one setting had to say about creativity and related topics as they commented upon academic writing in a university English Language degree programme. Data are drawn from questionnaire responses and interview transcripts, starting from keyword searches. The discussion relates participants’ comments and concerns to themes more commonly found in the EAP literature, especially questions of accommodation, content and writing task. A case is made for renewing attention to creativity and to what this may involve in EAP pedagogy, particularly but not exclusively when working with present or future teachers of English Language in multilingual settings.

# 1. Introduction

‘. . .there is no room for originality. . . there is no room for creativity’ (a student interviewee)

‘. . .not exploring creative writing, for heaven’s sake!. . .’ (a JEAP reviewer)

This section briefly examines how creativity is treated across different discourses and traditions that might be related to academic writing and EAP. It then introduces a study that explores comments alluding to creativity made by students and teachers about academic writing in one university degree programme.

# 1.1. Invocations in public discourses

Creativity is widely referred to in contemporary public discourses on education. In Singapore, the setting of this study, persistent governmental and managerial calls for teachers and learners to aim to develop learners’ creative as well as critical thinking abilities have been reported and discussed (Allison & Wu, 2001; Chew & Kramer-Dahl, 1999; Quah & Ho, 1997). Exhortations of this nature in contemporary societies are commonly aligned with the assumed needs of a rapidly developing and innovative knowledge economy that relies increasingly on information technology and on adaptability in working lives and practices. Critics, however, sometimes associate such messages with questionably utilitarian views of the purposes of education and with unduly optimistic accounts of the liberating effects of new technologies (Fairclough, 1992).

# 1.2. Academic discussions of creativity

Academic treatments of creativity have been mainly associated with psychology and philosophy, sometimes with special reference to education. This is not the place for a full review, but it is useful to extract some points of interest:

. Creativity eludes simple definitions, largely because of its ‘multiple’ nature and its often paradoxical relationship with key variables such as novelty, knowledge, intelligence and personality characteristics (e.g. it needs them, but needs also to be free of their constraints). See Cropley (1999); this account draws in part on what Gardner (1993) has to say about multiple intelligences.   
. Creativity in a ‘small-c’ sense is widely and perhaps normally distributed throughout a population. See Ripple (1999), for comments on the legacy of work by Guilford (e.g. Guilford, 1967, 1968).   
Creativity can be encouraged through suitable forms of teaching (Ripple, 1999), or inhibited through less suitable ones. The picture is complex because the same practices can be helpful at some stages (or for some forms of creativity, or for some people) yet become inhibiting at (or for) others. See especially Amabile (1996) on creativity heuristics and on formal education.   
. Most models of creativity include ‘phases’ for planning and preparation, ideation, verification and communication (Amabile, 1996). This implies a need for different kinds of ability at different stages (Cropley, 1999), such as finding novel solutions and verifying that they work.   
Theories of creativity remain diverse, but research appears to have become less exclusively humanistic and more empirical (Runco & Albert, 1990), as well as

more social (Amabile, 1983, 1996). Earlier theories already included a social element in the validation of creative work by some group (Stein, 1953, cited in Amabile, 1996; Purser & Montuori, 1999). More recent research trends approach all phases from a social-psychological perspective, in addition to other perspectives.

# 1.3. Possible relevance to academic writing

This sketch of points from related literature suggests many possible connections between creativity and academic research, including work by students. Examples include:

. Different task phases that may need different abilities to come to the fore.   
A notion of ‘small-r’ research as insightful enquiry that is common to many, rather than exclusive to a few.   
Ambivalence over teachability. Growing awareness of social contexts for research activity, of research as a social activity, and of research writing within and for a discourse community that validates findings and ideas.

The concept of creativity also seems relevant in principle to academic writing and its acquisition by students, especially if such writing is conceived and pursued as a means of encouraging students’ legitimate peripheral participation in researchminded activities (borrowing from Lave & Wenger, 1991), rather than as mere accommodation towards the expectations of academic teachers in reproductive assignments (Horowitz, 1986). To the extent that it may involve such activities as the insightful posing of problems, making unusual but fertile connections across concepts or across fields of enquiry, and proposing original but well grounded solutions, creativity in research and academic writing appears to deserve attention. For a number of reasons, however, connections with creativity are not always made or welcomed (Nandwani, 2000). I shall outline two possible associative factors that may lead to scepticism, or at least strong caution, about links with academic writing.

# 1.3.1. Associations with ‘creative writing’

This term is typically reserved for literary writing (‘poems, stories, novels’, as noted by Elbow, 1981), despite a more recent trend towards ‘creative nonfiction’ that is ‘at once factual and literary’ (Forche´ & Gerard, 2001: p. 4, editors’ introduction). Creative writing tends also to be associated with resistance (especially in departments of English) towards what is seen as a narrow focus on academic discourse (Elbow, 1991) and perhaps towards the constraining power of audience expectations on the development of ideas in writing (though Elbow, 1987 makes it clear that ignoring audience constraints would apply only at certain stages in his pedagogy). Advocacy of creative writing generally favours supposedly personal explorations of literary forms of writing, within an expressivist writing pedagogy.

Johns (1995) acknowledges that the expressivist tradition has been one influence upon process approaches to writing pedagogy, and comments positively on what process approaches have achieved. Johns goes on, however, to discuss serious, exclusionary limitations for the teaching and learning of academic writing in English. For example, she argues that process approaches (and undoubtedly the expressivist tradition as well) tend to ignore linguistic and organisational form, and in practice to overlook the distinctive linguistic, discoursal and cultural backgrounds and expectations of nonnative speakers of English, by comparison with L1 speakers learning to write in predominantly L1 settings.

# 1.3.2. Associations with ‘creative thinking

This term has tended historically to be linked with cognitivist and individualist perspectives on learning and education, and more specifically on problem solving (Flower & Hayes, 1977; Guilford, 1977; Nandwani, 2000). It may also be associated at times with more widely marketable publications (e.g. popular volumes devoted to enhancing the brainpower of consumers or their children), and with the public discourses alluded to in Section 1.1. While the latter cases offer evident grounds for caution, the connections with problem solving—and also with problem posing—are not inevitably individualist, and there are some interesting signs of renewal of connection between academic writing and creative thinking within a more social constructionist perspective (see also Section 1.5).

# 1.4. Neglect in EAP?

Within EAP, discussions of students’ academic writing seem to have had little to say about creativity—certainly far less than about critical dimensions of writing and writing pedagogy. Absence of comment is easier to assert than to demonstrate, but this impression of the literature receives some descriptive support from an inspection of keywords chosen for inclusion in subject indexes of seven texts (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Benesch, 2001; Candlin & Hyland, 1999; Flowerdew, 2002; Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001; Hyland, 2000; Jordan, 1997) relating in part to EAP and academic writing. ‘Creative’ and ‘creativity’ do not occur. ‘Create’ is attested twice (Benesch, Jordan), but only in the particular case of ‘create a research space’, following Swales (1990). ‘Critical’, in contrast, features in five indexes (Belcher & Braine, Benesch, Candlin & Hyland, Flowerdew, Hyland), and in one title (Benesch). Relevant entries include critical discourse analysis, critical EAP, critical linguistics, critical thinking, and critical writing. By comparison, creativity in EAP appears as a concept whose time has either passed, or not yet come.

Probable reasons for neglecting creativity within EAP were outlined in Section 1.3 (see also a reviewer’s remark, cited initially). Critics of EAP as accommodationist (following, e.g. Benesch, 1993, 2001) might also be tempted to renew suggestions that the EAP discourse community is more concerned to show students how to follow conventions than to encourage them to be creative in research terms. It is, however, hazardous to interpret negative evidence speculatively, and it becomes especially interesting to note occasional instances where creativity is discussed.

# 1.5. Comments on creativity

Considering writing in general (so including academic writing) from a social constructionist standpoint, Candlin and Hyland observe that writing ‘is also a personal and socio-cultural act of identity whereby writers both signal their membership in what may be a range of communities of practice, as well as express their own creative individuality.’ (Candlin & Hyland, 1999: p. 2) They resume:

To understand the extent to which writers may be seen as independent creative beings, it is not sufficient to ground such an understanding simply on a mentalist analysis of writers’ inner feelings and beliefs. Any comprehensive explanation of such creativity must incorporate all elements of the rhetorical situation. . . (Candlin & Hyland, 1999: p. 9).

The need to go beyond a solely mentalist account is taken up again by Hyland (2000), in an introductory section entitled ‘the social creation of knowledge’ (Hyland, 2000: p. 5). This social (rhetorical, socio-cultural) dimension stands in contrast with conventionally individualist accounts of creativity, but is in line with research aspirations towards a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes a social perspective (but is not confined to it: see again Amabile, 1996).

A concern for the social dimension follows the tradition of much EAP and TESOL pedagogy in rejecting the illusory freedom of leaving individuals just to be themselves as they write, especially when these individuals may lack access to established understandings of how to write and perhaps how to innovate acceptably in writing (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Delpit, 1988). What is acceptable is, of course, particularly likely to be constrained in the case of students’ academic writing.

Comparable arguments arise in genre-based pedagogy (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Johns, 1995; Kress, 1987). Bhatia (2002) describes subtle ways in which genre insiders can ‘manipulate’ generic forms to combine their own writing purposes with those of institutional discourses. Less experienced writers, however, might fail to master such ways of writing, or might for other reasons not be authorised, by powerful readers, to adopt them. (Consider the varying acceptability of short narrative asides in an academic exposition.) Concerns such as these reinforce a widespread distrust of invocations of creativity when students’ writing and writing pedagogy are discussed in EAP contexts. To anticipate, would-be creativity also appears to be seen as a problem in students’ writing in several comments in the study that follows.

Some related pedagogic controversies over academic and other forms of writing have turned around the supposed development, invention, or suppression of ‘voice’ or of ‘identity’ in students’ writing, with implications for authorship and creativity. While I cannot discuss these matters extensively (see Ivanic, 1998; Tang & John, 1999; criticism of ‘voice’ in Stapleton, 2002), we can note that a social constructionist approach towards authorship and creativity is likely to be intertextual and polyphonic, following Bakhtin (e.g. Bakhtin, 1986), offering a more integrated view of writing as engagement with both content and dialogue in rhetorical situations.

A measure of scepticism regarding ‘creativity’ in academic writing has certainly been true of my own earlier EAP experience and adoption of EAP discourse in several settings. However, we need look no further than ‘genre’ itself to find a concept that carries potentially negative associations for some writers and discourse communities, yet has proved powerful and useful to others. Negative appraisal of past associations with particular kinds of pedagogy ought not to dictate the concepts that we are prepared to examine and discuss in relation to students’ academic writing. There may, then, be reasons to sidestep traditional but restrictive appropriations of ‘creativity’ in writing pedagogy, and to review its potential relevance to academic writing in EAP.

# 1.6. The case of English Language studies

The possible relevance of ‘creativity’ appears particularly worthy of attention when we consider the academic writing of students of English Language (EL). EL students are likely to encounter ‘creativity’ as a highly valued term somewhere in their school or university lives, and perhaps even in the English class, as well as in other public discourses that they should be learning to critique. How this term may figure in their own discourse, and in that of their EL teachers, remains to be ascertained in particular circumstances.

In first-language, ESL, and some EFL settings, all students at school normally study EL as one school subject. In contrast, EL university students and staff are not typical of university students and staff in general. In many societies, nonetheless, including Singapore, EL degree courses are an important source of future EL teachers in schools, among other professionals, so the views and values of EL university students and staff again have wider implications for English language education. The immediate focus of this study will be on comments made by EL undergraduate students and academic staff in a university department in Singapore.

# 2. The study

# 2.1. Aims

This study investigates what EL students and teachers in one university had to say about creativity in academic writing in the course of an extensive earlier investigation into writing development within an EL degree curriculum (Allison & Wu, 2001, 2002). My aims are to characterise and discuss what these respondents and interviewees were saying when they directly mentioned ‘creativity’, cognate terms such as ‘creative’ or ‘create’, and a few closely associated concepts and issues in connection with the development of students’ academic writing.

The approach, while not fully ethnographic, is essentially a ‘listening’ one (Fiumara, 1990). Rather than looking through the data for perspectives that I had decided in advance were relevant, I wanted to find out what students and teachers were talking about when they alluded to some notion of creativity, and what this appears to have meant to them. If this sometimes results in material that is ‘tangential’ to the theme, as one reviewer has suggested, I believe this is a price worth paying, so that we can hear what aspects of the ‘creative’ are of explicit concern or interest to student writers and their English Language subject teachers. Wider implications for EAP are taken up in Section 3, where the main findings will be related to earlier themes and their extensions.

# 2.2. Setting

The data were originally collected on a voluntary basis from students and teachers in the undergraduate curriculum in English Language at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1998/1999. Most students seeking to graduate at that time in English Language did so as part of a ‘double major’ that included another selected subject. All had experience of academic writing at university in at least one subject besides English Language. Several teachers also taught graduate courses, and several were previously students in the department.

# 2.3. Procedural outline

An account of the procedures, rationale, instruments and main findings of the original investigation at NUS is found in Allison and Wu (2002). This study analyses selected aspects of the questionnaire and interview data collected by those investigators (used with permission).

An open-ended questionnaire was originally designed principally to elicit the views of teachers and students about what constituted good writing (question 1), whether students’ (own) writing improved during the EL programme (question 2), sources of information on good writing (question 3), usefulness of guidelines and of feedback (questions 4 and 5). There was no reference to creativity or to cognate terms in the questionnaire wording. The eventual dataset comprised 88 student responses (44 from a first-level module and 44 from third-level modules) and 18 teacher responses. These were retyped when necessary (some teacher responses came electronically). Searches were made at the time for a wide range of selected lexical items, which included ‘creative’ and its cognates.

Follow-up interviews were planned with 14 students and 14 teachers who had consented to this in principle. Not all of these respondents agreed to be audiorecorded for transcription. Some preferred that the researchers take notes, or eventually found it more convenient to be ‘interviewed’ in an e-mail exchange. The present dataset comprises all interviews that were recorded and transcribed (9 students, 11 teachers). Again, these data were electronically searched at the time for a wide range of lexis, including the items of present interest. Occasionally, transcripts show that the interviewer rather than the interviewee made the first reference to creativity or a related term. Any such cases are reported.

A difficulty in reporting on chosen themes in questionnaire or interview data is always the basis for selection. This study concentrates on keyword searches for creative and all cognates (including creativity, create, creation, and morphological variants, not all of which were attested in the data). This has provided an important element of operational systematicity, prior to selection of points to emphasise in discussion. In more impressionistic readings, I looked for related themes and for related lexical items that might not have been listed in advance (such as ‘a fresh approach’ or ‘captivating topics’, found in student questionnaire data). Cautious interpretation is important for both kinds of search. What is attested in data is demonstrably possible but not necessarily typical, for either method of selection.

# 2.3.1. Notation

Questionnaire responses were typed up for research purposes (or occasionally were already typed), and their reproduction below poses few problems. One ‘?’ in parentheses denotes an unclearly written word. Boldface as here is added to responses to pick out specified keywords. Conventions for presenting interview data include use of square brackets [. . .] for short intercalated turns, typically signalling listener feedback as in $[ \mathrm { m m } ]$ or [right]; use of brackets around normal font (as here) for elements of transcription that are tentative because the recording was indistinct; use of brackets around italics (as here) for comments that do not form part of the transcript but are included to assist the reader in some manner; use of boldface to indicate where a specified keyword has occurred. Transcripts are presented in written text and not phonemic script, and omit paralinguistic and pausal features. Punctuation is also designed primarily to assist reading rather than to show all pauses.

# 2.4. Findings and discussion

Only a small number of comments included the word creative or a cognate term. This makes it possible to report all data selected on the keyword basis. The absence of widespread reference to creativity in the data potentially renders the few instances that occur all the more interesting (as was remarked earlier for the EAP literature). Some related themes, such as the extent to which respondents see students’ academic writing as having to conform to what teachers want rather than approaching a topic in their own ways, occur more widely in the data, and can only be reported selectively.

# 2.4.1. Questionnaire data

Creativity is mentioned in two student questionnaires (both from the third-level modules), and creative is used by one staff respondent. Responding to the prompt about what counts as good writing (question 1), one student wrote ‘Creativity, articulatory skills’. This is hard to interpret (and unfortunately this respondent was not among those interviewed), but it could suggest that creativity is linked to presentation. A distinction between content and presentation emerges in other data to follow.

A teacher’s comment on question 1 was more elaborate:

Good writing is well focused and aimed at the appropriate audience. There should be a clear sense of organisation, and should also be interesting and polished. Good writing could also be creative (though not overly so) and avoid cliche´s and tired ways of writing and thinking. And of course, good writing should be grammatical and use consistent spelling.

Creativity is seen in this response as a possibility rather than an essential expectation. It is also presented as potentially problematic, and (more speculatively) it seems to be linked to fresh thinking as well as writing.

On a question about the use of guidelines (question 4), one student wrote:

The guidelines are often inadequate/vague. This is good as it gives quite a lot of room for creativity in answers but on the other hand, poses quite a serious problem for those with (?) no idea of what to do. Perhaps more details. Model answers could also be circulated.

Vagueness in guidelines for academic writing has been discussed in the literature (e.g. Lea & Street, 1999). This student’s comment is interestingly ambivalent, suggesting that greater latitude can benefit those who already do have an idea of what to do, but that others will need more support. An implied view that tighter guidelines would constrain creativity in a negative sense—i.e. cramping, rather than focusing—comes up again much more forcefully in another student’s interview remarks, below.

The only other lexical search items related to suggested mechanisms for feedback (question 5). One third-level student proposed ‘Maybe create conferencing like what we do in [one module]. . .’ and one staff member thought that ‘. . .checklists (teacher-created as well as student-created ones) are useful because you can cover quite a lot of aspects. . .’ This serves as a useful (tangential) reminder that creativity is relevant to course design as well as to aspects of writing.

Occasional wording in other questionnaires, such as ‘fresh approach’ or ‘captivating topics’ (noted earlier), raises comparable issues (e.g. stands in contrast with ‘tired ways of writing and thinking’), but such connections are subject to the researcher–reader’s interpretation. I have chosen to extract one comment from a lengthy reply on whether students’ writing develops in the undergraduate curriculum (question 2), in which a teacher reflects on past experience as a student in the department:

. . .towards the end of my four years as a student here, I began getting very tired of being overly concerned about what others were saying about a topic. I remember that in the process of writing one of my honours year essays, I suddenly thought, ‘I’m sick of this collation of sources and material. I’m just going to write what I think.’ I don’t know if you would consider this ‘development’, but I would.

The comment evokes what sounds to have been a defining moment for this writer. It does not invalidate curricular concerns over care over academic sources, but strongly and expressively conveys a sudden insight that such concerns are not sufficient for the development of one’s academic writing. Adapting and echoing the comment, I do not know whether readers would consider this assumption of writer responsibility and choice as a key element in academic creativity, but I would.

# 2.4.2. Interview data

The keyword searches for creativity and cognate forms yielded a single instance in interviews with students, briefly cited at the start of this paper. This student expressed a dislike of guidelines for writing tasks (a relatively unusual stance, compared with trends in questionnaire data) and much preferred:

. . .the type of questions that make one think you see $[ \mathrm { m m } ]$ instead of just giving you a straightforward question and okay, do this, do this $[ \mathrm { m m } ]$ . Twenty other people will be doing this with you [right]. It, there is no originality, there is, there is no room for creativity [right]. And even if you talk to each other when, when you are doing the same assignment, you’ll be talking about the same stuff and people will be reproducing what you think. . .

These comments suggest an interesting mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic motives for ‘originality’ and ‘creativity’ in scholarly work. They value questions ‘that make one think’, but not assignments where ‘people will be reproducing what you think’. Creativity is positively valued, though not elaborated or defined. Comparable remarks from another student also mentioned ‘original thought’ as something ‘you have to have’ to get an ‘A’ grade, but then went on to value ‘independent learning’ intrinsically, as ‘it leads to better ability than just mugging for the subject and getting the $\mathbf { A } '$ .

Four staff interviews yielded keyword or cognate data for creativity. Here, in contrast, being creative in academic writing and in writing at school was not usually represented in positive terms, or at least gave rise to reservations, for reasons partly prefigured in Section 1 of this paper (note the reference that follows to ‘this notion of creative writing’). One teacher commented on the importance of explicit genre and task expectations in the following way:

. . .but I think we’re doing them a disservice if we just leave it, I mean it’s like this notion of creative writing er, creative, creativity [mm] you know let them do what they like you know (and then) at the end of the day I mean if, you know especially with children in the say primary school or high school, I mean you know they’re writing all this stuff and at the end of the day they’ll be penalised for it $[ \mathrm { m m } ]$ because that’s actually not what is rewarded [mm] within academic institutions, so that’s what I mean [mm, yeah, yeah] by making it explicit.

If creativity is associated with ‘creative writing’ and with ‘let[ting] them do what they like’ until eventually ‘they’ll be penalised for it’, then it is likely to be seen as a problem rather than as a teaching goal.

From related comments, several teachers associate extravagances of style, sometimes attempted in the name of creativity, with a lack of clarity in many students’ writing. Responding to an interviewer’s prompt about ‘what people are saying about clarity in student writing and what people are saying about creativity, flair, originality. . . style of students’ writing. . .’, one teacher observed:

. . .clarity. . .(that’s) sort of a baseline [hmm]. If you can’t achieve clarity then there’s no point having style and creativity [hmm]. . .. I think of the other bit of this as, as added extra icing on the cake as it were. . . good students will not only be able to express their, the ideas clearly but. . .will be able to take it, take that extra step . . . that much more creativity.

This teacher expresses reservations about ‘some people who try very hard. . . to sound different’ but whose writing consequently lacks clarity. Creativity is seen rather as an optional, perhaps presentational extra that adds some value once a good student has achieved basic clarity in writing. The interviewee had earlier written the questionnaire response about good writing that ‘could also be creative (but not overly so)’.

In an interesting and important contrast, a third interviewee places creativity at the heart of intellectual activity rather than separating it from intellectual content. This teacher mentioned intellectual creativity in the context of learning philosophies (a theme neglected in my opening review), and suggested that Dennett’s evolutionary approach to philosophy of mind could be valuable to discuss, in order to help students understand why teachers sometimes exhort them to think more critically:

. . .the philosopher Daniel Dennett. . . in talking about philosophy of mind actually talks about different kinds of creatures along the evolutionary scale. . . (Outlines how Darwinian and Skinnerian creatures are selected by environment / respond to environmental stimuli). . . Then you’ve got Popperian creatures. . . who are able to form hypotheses and test them. Then you’ve got Gregorian creatures who (are/act?) perhaps more creative(ly?) er in a certain sense with respect to hypothesis forming. . . et cetera. . . (so as a teacher one could) tell the students ‘Look, if you (don’t do) this you’re going to forever remain a Popperian creature. . . or a Skinnerian creature and you want to move up the evolutionary scale’. .

On one level, taking such an approach with students may evoke the strongly competitive ethos found in parts of Singapore society and semi-official discourse (sometimes seen in posters carrying messages such as ‘The guy in front of me is there to be overtaken’). More importantly, though, it seeks to offer students a serious motivational reason for trying to think and talk in new ways. Dennett’s account, which includes thinking about how to think about a problem (Dennett, 1995; Gregory, 1981), has induced this teacher to invite students to pursue academic enquiry more reflectively, creatively and critically for their own intellectual growth, and not just in response to whatever teachers want.

The relationship between creativity and academic content was extensively developed in another interview. Responding to a question that had referred to ‘creative use of words’ and to showing ‘some originality in the writing’, the interviewee reflected on two senses of creativity in academic research and writing, both for students and professional academics. This teacher explicitly distinguished between being creative in form and creative in content, saw the latter as important, and elaborated on reasons why it might be problematic to invoke or favour creativity in the form of students’ writing. Extracts from this extended commentary are now presented and discussed:

. . .Originality in writing, erm, I would say it will be better if it’s originality in the content of the writing not in the form of it. Some students, I, when they think it’s creativity, they think it’s creative use of words [mm] and creative use of genre which unfortunately is not accepted in academic circles. You know you cannot, if you want to get published in a respectable journal, you have to write within very narrow confine(s) in terms of your linguistic er expression [mm]. Creative, creativity is in the content not in the form. . .

These comments link creativity to originality, another complex and problematic term (Pennycook, 1996), but relate this to research more than to writing. The observations imply that students’ preoccupation with aspects of ‘form’ disguises from them the greater importance of creativity in ‘content’, and suggest that innovation in form, whether as lexical display or generic variation, actually militates against academic acceptance for students and even for publishing scholars. As seen earlier, e.g. Bhatia (1997, 2002) places rather more emphasis upon an assumed greater freedom of genre insiders to innovate, but accepts that this freedom remains limited, and that outsiders do not share it.

Other remarks by the same teacher suggest that the powerful conventional constraints at work are not arbitrary, but reflect community values that help people to write well. Students need to understand this:

And so I don’t know what, what the students mean when they say you need to be creative in writing, and they typically say ‘I have my own style, this is me, and don’t try to tell me how to write.’ [mm]. And I think that attitude is bad because it really prevents them from writing well. There is a, however elusive this ideal is, there is some academic ideal of academic writing $[ \mathrm { m m } ]$ that appear to be kind of er adhered to practically by every practitioner. . . So then if you write in that way, then your paper is more likely to be accepted. . .

The remarks testify to the speaker’s recollections (or reconstructions) of occasions when students resisted being told how to write, invoking creativity and style as part of this resistance. The teacher thinks that such resistance is misguided ‘because it really prevents them from writing well’. Students need to become more involved in how an academic community goes about its business in writing, and to pursue creativity in terms of content and ideas, while working within the usual writing constraints. Implicit in this view is that the writing constraints help to preserve attention to the issues of content (in contrast to Elbow, 1987, where constraints over stylistic matters at least are isolated from the more fundamental intellectual practices of academic discourse). Without having been asked or challenged about ‘accommodation’ in the teaching of academic writing, the speaker sums up this extended response:

I don’t know whether that’s repressive or not but the academically accepted style is very confining in some ways. . . I think that probably creative in content is good, but creative in form of writing may actually encourage an attitude of er kind of er.. unnecessary er.. kind of aloofness from, from what the rest of the academic commun. . . community is doing.

In the student interview data, the few expressions of resistance to teachers’ comments are not, in fact, particularly emphatic with regard to what teachers had to say. Rather more reservations were expressed about the infrequency, delay, and limited extent of feedback at university. Interestingly, occasional comments on feedback as an imposition upon students’ writing have more to do with ideas than with form, as in the following interview data from a student on a third-level module:

. .most of the time. . . probably some staff are more imposing in their views [right] rather than they are interested [right] in what we are writing. . . So sometimes you er think you wrote certain good points but you get back your stuff you realise that it was not commented on but rather er you get a lot of comments on what the person who marked the script think[s] about the topic.

To the extent that it occurs, feedback of such a nature would seem unlikely to encourage ‘creativity in content’ on the part of students.

Besides possible reticence during interviews, one reason that more students are not more openly critical of teacher feedback may be that many still just try to do whatever teachers want (recalling Horowitz, 1986). One first-level student put it this way:

I think that is one of the, one of the major erm constraints that students feel [mm] because I think we always want to please our tutors about what, what they expect [right] instead of, instead of really voice out what we really feel sometimes.

Comments by several teachers indicate awareness of constraints that students feel, and of undesirable effects on students’ writing. One teacher described how even MA students kept reverting to ‘an academic essay’ despite explicit instructions to write in some other genre:

. . .there is that fear [right] of, of being, and obviously I don’t know this as a fact but it seems to (me) that they must at some period, certainly at school or possibly university have been severely penalised for stepping outside the accepted framework or the expected framework [mm]. There must be some reason for this, this excessive fear [mm]. And it’s always expressed negatively, not positively. It’s not ‘Well, I’m thinking of doing, saying it this way, do you think that’s a good idea?’, it’s ‘Am I allowed to?’ ‘Will I be penalised?’

On the face of it, such a climate seems not to bode well for creativity of any kind, whether in content or form, process or product, or attempted integration of these elements.

# 3. Concluding discussion

This section reviews the main themes in the study, relates them to issues in EAP, and suggests implications for theory and pedagogy.

# 3.1. Two views of creativity?

References to creativity were fairly few and fragmentary in the questionnaire and interview data, including one more sustained interview discussion, and were interestingly varied. The concept appears elusive and multiple, not just in terms of precise sense, but of value. Some comments were too cryptic to support any developed interpretation of what creativity may have meant to a respondent. An example is the student who clearly expressed a minority view that task guidelines left ‘no room for creativity’, strongly implying a positive evaluation of creativity, but did not elaborate. Some staff comments were a little fuller, however, providing sufficient scope for an overview.

There appear to be two broadly contrasting conceptions of creativity in evidence. One view, usually attributed to others, is largely expressivist and resistant to constraints upon how to write academically. Attempts to show creativity in this sense may occasionally inspire lexical and other stylistic tours de force when successful, but are more likely to result in unwelcome extravagances when unsuitable. This view of creativity in academic writing appears liable to separate form from content, and perhaps to subordinate content to form. It is found particularly, though not exclusively, in negative staff constructions of one manifestation of student resistance towards expectations of how to write, and is presented as something for teachers and student writers to overcome, or at least to keep under control.

A rather different view, however, presents creativity as something that should be integral to substantial academic work. Most indications of this position in the data represent creativity as important in terms of ‘content’ or thinking. Comments during one sustained interview discussion suggest that academic writing should aim to bring out the value of what has been attempted, and not distract from it. Good academic writing, in this view, is tailored to its content and purpose through the adoption of existing conventions. This is done (or advised) largely in order to increase the chances of having one’s work accepted, but partly also to show that one is not aloof ‘from. . . what the rest of the academic. . . community is doing’. Similar, though not identical views are implied in another teacher’s remarks about the need for clarity as a baseline.

Some of these comments appear to subordinate form to content. An alternative interpretation, introduced here for argument’s sake (but attested in staff data in the wider investigation: Allison & Wu, 2001), would challenge the separation of form and content in academic writing. It is widely argued in EAP that generic forms in academic writing are designed for, realised through, and fused with the presentation of matters of substance within a particular teaching or research discourse community. A fully integrative view of the place of creativity in research (going beyond views expressed in the data) might be more effectively developed in this light.

Although the data include several comments about research communities, a socially constituted view of research is not strongly evident. Most allusions concern expectations affecting the communication of outcomes, rather than research activity itself, which still seems to be represented primarily in individual terms in the EL setting of this study. One teacher, nevertheless, briefly related creativity to processes of academic enquiry, specifically to hypothesis-forming, that reflect widespread, purposeful and in some respects conventional academic research practices. A fully integrative view of creativity (as an enriched social constructionist view, subsuming rather than excluding cognitivist perspectives) in research would need to develop its account of relationships between research processes and outcomes, and between researchers and research communities.

# 3.2. Implications for EAP

In this discussion, I shall try to advance the possibility that creativity could become a useful concept within EAP pedagogy, including academic writing pedagogy. This is not, however, something to offer as an article of faith. My intention is to encourage EAP professionals to examine the idea and perhaps investigate its applicability in various circumstances if it appears to merit this. We begin with brief remarks on the two senses of creativity just outlined.

An expressivist sense of creativity seems to evoke forms of writing theory and pedagogy that EAP has found good reason to resist (see Sections 1.3 and 1.5). I would not dispute this, but would argue that an effective and ethical EAP pedagogy aims to help students to channel their expressive impulses purposefully and constructively, not to suppress or eradicate them in the name of conformity to authority. This could have important implications for the kinds of task set in the name of academic writing.

It seems best to relate this discussion directly to the second sense of creativity that was outlined above, which points towards a more integrative view of research content and communication. The potential value of creativity as a concept within EAP writing pedagogy would be most fully realisable within the diverse contexts of thinking, enquiry, interpretation, verification and argumentation that constitute the substance of academic work, not as some form of ‘extra icing on the cake’. An integrative view of creativity in academic writing could suggest multiple efforts and opportunities to encourage freshness, variety and vigour of intellectual enquiry and communication in an academic curriculum, and in EAP pedagogy. Two implications to take up are (a) the importance of involving students in understanding the reasons for academic expectations, and (b) the possibility of varying task expectations more widely within an undergraduate curriculum.

It is critically important in EAP, and throughout an academic curriculum, to seek, specify and question explicit reasons for research and rhetorical practices that are being advocated and followed in the name of an academic education. Comments by some students and teachers in this study (and the wider investigation)

bear witness to the constraining force of conventional expectations about academic writing, and about educational practice. What is most disturbing about these expectations, in my reading, is not that they are seen to exist, but that they can too easily appear to be arbitrary manifestations of power. Consequently, educators face a persistent challenge not only to explain to students the rationale for prevailing expectations, but to work with students over time to develop a genuine and independent understanding of practices, and of opportunities these practices still offer for successful innovation.

This argument requires care. The aim should not be to convince anybody that conventional practices are optimal or even right—there is no reason to assume so much—but where possible to argue and demonstrate that they embody certain values, such as concerns for evidence, that research and other communities find to be worth taking seriously. ‘Student-as-ethnographer’ approaches in EAP (Johns, 1990) can prove valuable here. Ethnographers aim to view a culture from the perspective of its participants, and this may often involve temporarily suspending (but not abandoning) existing judgements and beliefs as ethnographers work with others in new contexts. As a goal for EAP teachers to promote among students, a sympathetic attempt to understand reasons for academic practices is strongly to be preferred to an unthinking or cynical acquiescence in ways of writing. This is not only for ethical reasons, but also for prospects of academic and educational effectiveness in the longer term.

Turning to the implication about variety in task expectations, it may be desirable, without going back to ‘exploring creative writing’, to create more space in EAP pedagogy for students to experiment in different ways of writing about academic issues. A danger that narrowly fixed academic writing expectations are imposed too early on students, perhaps even to the detriment of their writing development, has been identified and discussed by Littlewood (1996), among other commentators. Most students are not yet autonomous researchers, and many do not aspire to be, as study interests and future goals vary widely. The immediate writing opportunities and constraints they face are largely constructed by academic curricula themselves (Horowitz, 1986) rather than directly by the scholarly expectations of research communities. This again brings us back to questions of what professors should require of students in their academic writing, and for what reasons.

There ought in many circumstances to be prospects for broadening the kinds of writing students are asked to undertake. This certainly applies in the context of the EL curriculum seen in this study. Depending on interests, course goals, and other situational factors, some possibilities range from spending time in online discussions of academic topics and tasks, e-mail consultations, and conceivably some kind of class journal, to individual or group diaries reporting project work in progress, occasional attempted contributions to semi-academic newsletters, and so forth.

Some of these possibilities have been locally attested. Various tasks within the EL curriculum were designed to encourage student initiative, both in academic enquiry (e.g. student topic selection) and communication (writing tasks that differed from the conventional academic essay). Interestingly, one constraint upon such activities proved to be students’ own reluctance to write in different ways. Comments by students and teachers relate this reluctance predominantly to a fear of being penalised, rather than to other forms of resistance. Various speculative lessons might be drawn from this reaction about (for example) socio-cultural constraints affecting responses to unfamiliar pedagogic initiatives, inconsistencies in practice among staff, discrepancies between pedagogic messages and real or perceived assessment practices, and conservative student views as one source of ‘accommodationism’ in class practices.

Whatever the precise constraints may be among students in different circumstances, it seems likely (and investigable) that more exploratory and innovative kinds of academic investigation and writing could be developed, in ways that involve students as well as teachers. There are already some accounts in the literature of students learning, and sometimes explicitly being taught to negotiate their academic writing tasks in order to shape them to their own needs and interests (Benesch, 2001; Currie, 1998; Leki, 1995). Greater variety in academic task design ought also to facilitate such efforts.

Innovation and variety are not necessarily virtues, however, as much depends on their purpose. Novelty alone does not guarantee creativity: the relationship is more paradoxical and interesting than that (see again Section 1.2). This brings us back to the crucial issue of reasons for whatever is being advocated or done. It again suggests the value of an integrative notion of creativity in academic writing as insight that enhances the content and processes of academic enquiry, not as a separate optional embellishment (or, worse, a pretext for not bothering to understand the reasons for genre expectations of academic communities).

Finally, when is it the right time for a student to ‘just. . . write what I think’? The balance between encouraging student writers to take risks and speak out, or to play safe and follow rules, is often a point for concern in a curriculum, and in EAP teaching. Some of the best educational responses, in my judgement, involve finding ways to falsify that dichotomy, and to help students learn how to take risks and speak out in ways that a questioning academic community will recognise and respect. Greater attention to creativity, perhaps including greater provision (and tolerance) for experimentation in both enquiry and writing tasks, may help to reduce the common student reactions of fear, dependence, or token compliance that continue to challenge EAP educators in many circumstances.
