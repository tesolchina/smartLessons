# Abstract

Designing an EAP course requires collaboration among various concerned stakeholders, including students, subject teachers, institutional administrators and EAP teachers themselves. While needs analysis is often considered fundamental to EAP, alternative research methodologies may be required to facilitate meaningful collaboration between these parties. This article argues that soft systems methodology (SSM), a research methodology developed in Management Studies, can serve to meet this requirement. SSM is a learning system by means of which collaborative pathways are developed in a systemic way in order to better understand complex human problem situations. This article begins by discussing some issues in needs analysis, and then proceeds to a description of the nature of SSM. Finally, it describes one way in which SSM was applied to an EAP course design project. In doing so, we hope that the article reveals how SSM can add a new perspective to research methodology in EAP.

# 1. Introduction

[EAP] begins with the learner and the situation, whereas general English begins with the language. (Hamp-Lyons, 2001, p. 126).

As is suggested in the above citation, a good starting point for designing an EAP course is an understanding of students’ needs. To do this, a research method called needs analysis is most commonly used (see Brindley, 1989). Flowerdew and Peacock (2001), for instance, state:

There is a general consensus that needs analysis, the collection and application of information on learners’ needs, is a defining feature of ESP and, within ESP, of EAP. . Needs analysis is the necessary point of departure for designing a syllabus, tasks and materials

It is true that needs analysis has been ‘a key instrument in course design’ in ESP (West, 1994, p. 2). Given that ‘EAP has emerged from the larger field of [ESP]’ (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 3), it is not surprising that ‘needs analysis is fundamental to an EAP approach to course design’ (Hamp-Lyons, 2001, p. 127). It is important, however, to recognize that a needs analysis alone may not provide a sufficient basis for EAP course design, if there is a desire or requirement that a wide variety of perspectives be built into a course specification (see, for example, West, 1994).

In this paper, we will discuss the use of soft systems methodology (SSM), an action research methodology primarily used in business contexts, as a way to accommodate disparate elements within a decision-making process as it might apply to EAP course design. We hope to show how this methodology could engender meaningful collaboration between participants involved in a course design effort who might initially approach the problem with divergent or conflicting agendas.

Prior to an exploration of the application of SSM to EAP course design, however, we will need to discuss some issues in needs analysis and outline the conceptual basis of SSM.

# 2. Issues in needs analysis

The initial focus of needs analysis was syllabus specification. Traditional intuitive selectional criteria, such as simplicity, utility and coverage, usually with a strong appeal to the preferences of teachers and material writers, were superceded by attempts to objectively identify needed linguistic material from sociolinguistic analyses of the contexts in which the language would be used. However, the limitations of an exclusive focus on target situation analysis soon became apparent. For example, Hutchinson and Waters (1987, p. 54) observe, with the benefit of hindsight, that Munby’s (1978) watershed Communicative Syllabus Design, “. illustrated, in effect, not how much could be learnt from a ‘scientific’ needs analysis, but rather how little”. Characteristic of the field of needs analysis since Munby’s work is an ever-broadening definition of the concept of needs.

Hutchinson and Waters (1987) extend the definition of needs from the target situation that Munby had focused on to the learning needs of the students. Richterich and Chancerel (1980) emphasize the importance of investigating the competencies, strengths and weaknesses that students have prior to the beginning of a course of study, and provide a range of devices that could be used for this purpose. Allwright (1982) pioneered a focus on learners’ wants and lacks and how these may be accommodated when implementing language programs, while Holliday and Cooke (1982) use means analysis to identify constraints that may be encountered in implementing a language program in a particular local situation. Dudley-Evans and St John (1998) contend that besides focusing on learners’ needs and wants, their current skills, and their competencies and lacks, analysts should recognize the importance of learners’ cognitive styles and learning preferences. Jordan (1997) argues that the legitimate demands of the institute have to be recognized and that teachers and course designers also have their own purposes, priorities, needs, strategies and constraints.

Another notable area of growth in needs analysis has been in terms of the sophistication of the linguistic analysis applied to real-world situations. Work in sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and other cross-disciplinary approaches to language (e.g. Fairclough, 1992) has broadened the definition of language from that of an isolated linguistic system to be mastered, to a social and cultural object which is embedded in the workplace, the classroom and all aspects of social inter-course. This leads to a heightened awareness of what it means to know a language, and extends categories of linguistic knowledge beyond structural ladders and vocabulary lists to more dynamic and strategic competencies needed to effect, maintain or change roles and relations within particular contexts or domains of discourse.

Other aspects of needs analysis have similarly received attention from theorists. Jordan (1997) notes the diversity of ways in which the data informing decision-making may be collected, for example, through questionnaires, interviews, tests, audits, self-assessment forms, diaries and case studies. Masuhara (1998) suggests that the very diversity of frameworks, guidelines, and taxonomies available to course designers seems to be leading to the emergence of a new course design paradigm in which administrators or teachers select suitable teaching materials from readily available pre-designed published materials, while leaving the job of fine-tuning the material to the preferences of the students to classroom practitioners. The steps of needs analysis, goal specification, syllabus design, and choice of methodological procedures are assumed to have already been carried out by the materials writers.

The very diversity of factors that have been identified in the work discussed above suggests that any needs analysis will necessarily be limited to particular questions or issues. The framing of those questions and issues will have a direct impact on the methodology used, the data examined and conclusions drawn by the project. In pointing out the non-uniqueness of needs analysis, Dudley-Evans and St John (1998) state:

The findings [of needs analysis] depend on who asks what questions and how the responses are interpreted. What we ask and how we interpret are dependent on a particular view of the world, on attitudes and value. Berwick [1989: 56] makes the point that ‘our perceptions of need develop from what we believe is educationally worthwhile, that needs are not simply ‘out there’ waiting to be counted and measured’

The result of these diverse innovations in needs analysis is that the process has become multi-disciplinary. Munby’s original work offered a more rigorous approach to syllabus specification than had hitherto been common in general ELT theory, and was received as groundbreaking in a way similar to how Chomsky’s more mathematical approach to grammar in Syntactic Structures (Chomsky, 1957) was greeted by grammarians. And, as was the case with Transformational Grammar, descriptive frameworks multiplied. Needs analysis has thus provided an increasingly sophisticated array of perspectives through which to view the course design problem. Of value would be procedures that uncover the differing perspectives and value systems of those making course design decisions. Such a framework of procedures would go some way toward ensuring that data gathering and needs specification efforts, rather than defining in advance the sorts of results to be expected, would themselves be products of an emerging shared vision of the course by those involved in or affected by the design process.

# 3. Soft systems methodology

While meaningful collaboration between concerned people in an educational project may be the ideal, developing such collaboration may not be as easy as is often assumed. For example, the reality has often been that EAP specialists tend to ‘work for rather than with subject specialists’ and be reluctant to ‘critically engage with the values of institutional goals and practices’ (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 3). SSM, which will be described below, can provide one way of exploring and accommodating differing but equally valid perspectives. Holliday (1990, p. 77) argues that ‘[t]here are clear uses for soft systems methodology (SSM) in ELT projects’.

# 3.1. The nature of SSM

SSM was first developed in the 1970s by Peter Checkland and his colleagues at Lancaster University, UK. It is an action research approach to problem situations by means of which the processes of enquiry and learning are organized (Connell, 2001). Since it is an action research methodology, SSM procedures not only lead to intervention in problematic situations but also provide feedback loops to facilitate learning from that intervention. The techniques used to implement SSM can vary widely, but the conceptual basis (e.g. Churchman, 1971) remains constant. In SSM, systems models of purposeful action, which can be interpreted in multiple ways, are used as devices for providing a structure or framework through which discussions can be held to find and create accommodation among potentially conflicting perspectives. Such discussion then leads to action to improve the situation. The SSM approach recognizes explicitly that different individuals and groups have different, personally relevant, interpretations of the world, regarding them as human activity systems consisting of a set of activities linked together in a logical structure to constitute a purposeful whole.1 Intrinsic to this system are ‘emergent properties’. According to Checkland (1983), these are:

properties which are meaningful in relation to the whole entity, not in relation to its parts. The smell of ammonia is an emergent property of that gas which has no meaning at the level of the nitrogen and hydrogen which make up ammonia molecules. (p. 669)

When applied to the ELT context, an image that teachers may have of a particular class would be an emergent property since it cannot simply be attributed to any single factor such as the language proficiency or personality of a particular student.

SSM assumes that any complex set of behaviors has unique emergent properties better seen as characteristic of the system as a whole rather than any particular aspect of it. In this way, SSM is a systemic (rather than systematic) methodology: its focus is the whole, rather than the parts. Unlike hard systems thinking, which may be appropriate for well-defined technical problems, SSM (i.e. soft systems thinking) is usually applied to ‘fuzzy ill-defined situations involving human beings and cultural considerations’ (Checkland & Scholes, 1999, p. 10). The former, hard approach assumes that goals can be attained through hypothesis-testing experiments in the manner of natural sciences, whereas the latter, soft or interpretive, SSM approach aims to explore how we make sense of our perceived world so as to bring about improvement. From an SSM perspective, an EAP course can be regarded as a human activity system, a set of ‘linked activities which together could exhibit the emergent property of purposefulness’ (Checkland & Scholes, 1999, p. A7).

As an illustration, we may follow the processes shown in Figs. 1 and 2. These figures do not show a concrete process that should be followed, but rather attempt to clarify the conceptual basis of the SSM process. While various permutations of Fig. 1 could be used, Checkland (2001a) suggests that novice SSM practitioners follow the seven-stage model as shown in Fig. 2. The seven-stage model consists of two types of activities: real-world activities (Stages 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7) and systems thinking activities (Stages 3 and 4). It should be noted, however, that not all of these stages need to be followed.

As Fig. 2 shows, SSM identifies problem situations (Stages 1 and 2), formulates from them a set of root definitions of relevant purposeful human activity systems (Stage 3), builds up conceptual models of the systems (Stage 4), compares the models with reality (Stage 5), makes changes that should be systematically desirable and culturally feasible (Stage 6), and undertakes actions to improve the situations (Stage 7). The root definitions and conceptual models can be formulated by considering the elements of the mnemonic CATWOE: Customers, Actors, Transformation process, Weltanschauung (Worldview or value system), Owners, and Environmental constraints.

Among the CATWOE elements in Fig. 3, T (the transformation process) and W (i.e. the worldviews of the concerned people) are crucial to SSM, since both root definitions and conceptual system models elaborate on T, which depends on W.

# 3.2. SSM and ELT

Over the past three decades there has been a remarkable development of research in SSM in the field of Management Studies. SSM has already been applied to more than 150 cases concerning management issues in private companies (see, for example, Ferrari, Fares, & Martinelli, 2002), non-profit organizations (e.g. Luckett, Ngubane, & Memela,

# Formulation of Root Definition (Checkland and Scholes 1999:35)

![](img/53c525d9dd3929583e279cb9ecac36fc5150d40d41bfbdf802475c7d10898d1e.jpg)

2001), and health care services (e.g. Atkinson, Eldabi, & Paul, 2002; Checkland, 2001b), mainly in the UK and Europe.

However, SSM has received relatively little attention in ELT. This is perhaps due to a belief that its appropriate role was supplementary to other course design procedures. For example, Holliday (1990, p. 77) suggests that ‘SSM may provide a useful means for structuring ethnographic findings’. This modest view of SSM may explain why the approach itself is unfamiliar to ELT researchers and practitioners. In addition, some of the terminology used in SSM remains rather alien to EAP and certainly ELT generally, so there is a need to more clearly illustrate the concepts and procedures of SSM in terms that are relevant and understandable to practicing teachers. On the other hand, not all procedures used in the study are unique to SSM; some are no doubt familiar to EAP practitioners already. In these cases, SSM offers additional theoretical justification for their use and helps to meet Holliday’s (1990, p. 83) requirement that ‘until something can be expressed conceptually, in terms that can be communicated precisely, and has achieved the status of a discipline or a technology, it cannot be reported, researched or developed’.

Despite the paucity of studies applying SSM to EAP course design or ELT contexts generally, two studies may be worth noting: Chambers (1997) and Tajino (2002). Chambers’ (1997) study is a good example of applying a systems approach to coursebook evaluation (although he does not specify it as an SSM approach). Chambers shows how to establish and use criteria for coursebook selection from a business management perspective. Tajino (2002) borrows the transformation process model from SSM and investigates the cause of a problematic Japanese EFL team-teaching situation. He argues that transformation process models can help uncover the ‘honne’ or true feelings of nonnative EFL teachers towards their team partners, the native English-speaking teachers.

Section 4 will examine how SSM can be applied to EAP course design, by examining a real EAP teaching situation.

# 4. Applying SSM to EAP course design

[The modern-day field of EAP] draws on a range of interdisciplinary influences for its research methods, theories and practices. It seeks to provide insights into the structures and meanings of academic texts, into the demands placed by academic contexts on communicative behaviors, and into the pedagogic practices by which these behaviors can be developed. (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 3).

In designing an EAP course, an EAP professional would need to consider not only learners’ needs but also the perspectives and needs of the subject teachers, EAP teachers and the goals of the institute they work for. As discussed above, SSM can offer a series of steps or stages that could be followed in addressing these requirements. Here, we shall discuss how SSM can be applied to EAP course design through a real-world study that sought to apply the classic seven-stage SSM model to EAP (or more specifically, EGAP) course design at a Japanese university.

# 4.1. Stages 1 and 2: finding out

This study was carried out by one of the authors in 2002. It concerned a one-semester (15 weeks) EAP course given for second, third, and fourth-year students from different faculties such as the Faculties of Agriculture, Economics, Engineering, Law, Letters, and Science at a national university in Japan. Twenty-nine students regularly participated in the course.

For Stages 1 and 2, the problem was viewed as being centered on the objectives of the course, which presented two conflicting views: ‘English to enrich the students’ general education’ and skill-oriented practical English’. Difficulty resolving such conflicts between objectives in EAP programs (i.e. the debate over academically based vs. skillbased instruction) is common in Japan (see, for example, Sasajima, 2003). In this particular case, the lack of coherence was also related to the ambiguity of the General English Education course title determined by the university. The title in Japanese was Zengaku Kyotsu Kamoku Eigo,which can be translated as A Common English Curriculum for All Faculties. The vagueness of this course title was reflected in a multiplicity of teaching approaches and content selection decisions taken by individual teachers.

Our study included the following interpretations of objectives:

The EAP course is a system through which— (1) From the students’ perspectives:

a. Students can improve their listening skills in English so that they can understand and enjoy TV/radio news and movies in English.   
b. Students can improve their scores on tests such as TOEFL, TOEIC, and IELTS.   
c. Students can enjoy the learning of English.

(2) From the subject teachers’ perspectives:

a. Students can learn English in order to enrich their education and deepen their understanding of other cultures.   
b. Students can learn study skills and oral presentation techniques.   
c. Students can learn subject-specific English vocabulary.

(3) From the EAP teacher’s perspective:

a. Students can deepen their understanding of current international issues.   
b. Students can improve their communicative skills in English.   
c. Students can learn about the cultures of English-speaking countries.

It is important to note that we are not claiming that one of these interpretations of course goals is correct or worthier than any other. We are purely concerned with the worldviews and interpretations that are relevant to the course under consideration. It is in this respect that SSM differs from a traditional needs analysis that focuses primarily on the student needs or perspectives (see the above citation from Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001).

# 4.2. Stage 3: formulating root definitions

By referring to the above interpretations, root definitions were worked out using the CATWOE elements. An outcome of this exercise for our example is shown in Fig. 4. The outcome shown in Fig. 4 then led to the following accommodated root definition:

Accommodated root definition. A system controlled by the EAP teacher, which allows a productive combination of English for general educational content (e.g. other cultures and international issues) and practical English language skill-building, which can meet the requirements of concerned people, and which can be implemented with the resources available in the EAP course.

The critical point to be made is that this root definition could support not only the needs of the students, but also those of an EAP teacher as well as subject teachers. It should also be mentioned that we cannot always expect to reach accommodation at this stage. It is quite possible that for each relevant root definition a conceptual model can be constructed separately; that is, accommodation may be obtained as a merged conceptual model at the next stage. It would depend on the situation.

# 4.3. Stage 4: building conceptual models

The root definition was then described in the form of a diagram so that a conceptual model could be built. Compared with the root definition, the conceptual model places an emphasis on the process of an input–output transformation: activities whereby input can be transformed into output. Such a model-building process, as is shown in Fig. 5, involves ‘assembling the verbs describing the activities which would have to be there in the system in the RD [i.e. root definition] and structuring them according to logical dependencies’ (Checkland, 2001a, p. 77).

Fig. 5 illustrates an input–output transformation for the EAP course, with arrows showing the contingent relationships: an arrow from Activity A to Activity B indicates that B is contingent upon A. It should be noted that this illustration is only an example and so alternative conceptual models would also be possible for the accommodated root definition. It is important to note that emergent properties were expected to appear in the course of these activities.

This stage involves the higher-level function of ‘monitoring and control’ to clarify ‘the operations and take control action to change and/or improve [the activities]’ (Checkland,

1989, p. 90). The system was evaluated by means of the ‘three Es’ criteria that are often used in standard course evaluation. These criteria are, in order of importance: (1) effectiveness (i.e. Is this the right thing to do?); (2) efficacy (i.e. Does the means work?); and (3) efficiency (i.e. Is there a minimum use of resources?).

To summarize, the conceptual model constructed at this stage worked as a device that could enable the concerned people to explore changes to create a better situation.

# 4.4. Stage 5: comparing models and ‘reality’

This stage provides a comparison between the model and the real world. The model that expressed the worldviews of the participants was purely conceptual, and needed to be compared with the real world so that possible changes that could bring about improvement in the situation would be better identified.

Our example included the following questions addressed through the model/real world comparison.

(1) How can we integrate academic learning and language-skill learning?   
(2) How can we help students develop listening-skill proficiency in the context of a type of course (EAP) which is often approached as a reading/writing course at Japanese universities?   
(3) How can we help students improve their scores on the TOEIC test?

In this way, by comparing the conceptual model with the real-world situation, debate was stimulated so as to encourage mutual understanding among the concerned people towards a better situation.

# 4.5. Stage 6: defining changes

We were then concerned with the question of whether the debate about changes was coherent. To do this, the following two questions were posed:

(1) Is the ideal potential change ‘logically desirable’? (2) Is it ‘culturally feasible’?

Desirability is important because successful innovation often requires commitment beyond that which is ‘. motivated to implement change which is justified merely by logic’ (Checkland, 1989, p. 97). The question of feasibility is concerned with the matter of whether or not the potential change we would make is worth pursuing. Cultural feasibility is considered primarily significant in SSM, and culture is not assumed to be static.

# 4.6. Stage 7: taking action

At this stage, some action was taken to achieve the objectives. Three textbooks were used as course materials; one which discussed British life and culture, one which explained current international news in articles on politics, economics, arts and sports in English; and one which was intended to prepare students for the TOEIC test. Thus, two or the coursebooks were chosen for the educational value of the content and the other aimed at improving students’ language skills. All the coursebooks came with cassette tapes.2

In a 90-min lesson, the first 30-min period was used to enrich students’ education and deepen their understanding of British life and culture; the second $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ were given to help students improve their listening skills with a textbook on current international news; and the last $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ were used for TOEIC test-taking skills. A listening skill-building exercise known as ‘shadowing’, in which students repeat the words of an audio text while listening to the text, was used for all these three coursebooks. Shadowing is often used at training schools for interpreters in Japan as it is claimed to help improve the trainees’ listening skills (Tamai, 2003)3 .

At the end of the course, the students completed a progress test given by the EAP teacher and a questionnaire administered by the university. The questionnaire contained one open-type question inviting student comments on the course, and nine questions addressing student satisfaction in such areas as attendance rate, the comprehensibility of lessons and course organization. Responses to the latter questions were marked on a 5- point Likert scale, from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied).

The questions addressing student satisfaction included two questions that were specifically related to the course design: how academically interesting the course was to the students and how useful it was for them. The average rating for student satisfaction with the level of academic interest in the course was 4.7, and that for student satisfaction with the practical usefulness of the course was 4.8. The results of the questionnaire survey thus showed that the course design was quite satisfactory to the students.

Among the responses to the first, open question, one student commented that she enjoyed the shadowing practice and was happy that her score on the listening section on the TOEIC test improved. Another suggested that the teacher should assess their progress regularly through quizzes. Some complained that the tape recorder used for shadowing was not so helpful—they preferred to use a CALL classroom. These suggestions and complaints are considered important resources in SSM, in that participants can continue beyond the formal duration of any course design project, to traverse the exploratory pathways provided by SSM, in order to further refine their understanding of their own goals and those of their colleagues.

# 4.7. Difficulties in applying SSM to EAP course design

While an SSM approach to our course design was of some success, its application was not without difficulties. First, it took time to decide which views of the various participants should be considered primary, because in our course the students were from different faculties and their views and expectations for the course were not similar. An EAP course for a group of students with similar needs and views obviously would have been less problematic. Second, accommodating different views required knowledge and experience on the part of the EAP teacher; luckily he was able to consult with an SSM expert and valuable advice was available when necessary. Third, some of the final decisions were made according to the EAP teacher’s intuition, and these might not have fully satisfied all concerned people. These difficulties, however, may be considered in future research aimed at utilizing SSM in EAP situations.

# 5. Conclusion

Designing an EAP course is a complex process. While accepting the claim that an analysis of students’ needs is essential, reality suggests that we should consider a diversity of views and perspectives in order to achieve maximum support and cooperation from those involved with the course. This creates the need for a way in which different views of concerned people can be accommodated in a systemic way. We have argued that SSM, an action research methodology borrowed from the field of business studies, can be a useful research tool for this purpose.

Our example has shown that SSM provided a framework by which the diverse perspectives of the concerned people were mutually understood and accommodated in such a way that they could all make contributions towards a better EAP course design. Without SSM, the EAP course would likely not have been so successful because the EAP teacher knew little about how the different views of students and teachers could be incorporated into the course design; nor did the EAP teacher know how conflicting views concerning course objectives could be taken into account.

It should also be noted that through the process of accommodating teachers’ and students’ views a better mutual understanding was formed. This understanding seemed to facilitate reaching a consensus regarding course objectives and to enhance course management. We found it important for students to recognize why the teacher was teaching a particular area of the content in a certain way; and for the teacher to recognize why the students were responding in a particular way. This mutual understanding seemed to encourage classroom participation (e.g. in the shadowing exercises) and to positively affect student motivation.
