Keywords: Sentiment analysis Research articles Subdisciplinary probe Emotion variation

Sentiment analysis has garnered significant attention in the academic field lately, which gives academic scholars a full comprehension of how emotion states are communicated in texts and how it works as a powerful persuasion strategy for academic writers. Based on a large dataset of over five million tokens, this study examined specific emotions in research articles across 18 subdisciplines of medicine, aiming to reveal the emotions presented by medical writers in academic writing. The results showed the following: (1) four emotions with positive valencedtrust, anticipation, joy, and surprisedwere observed; (2) the tendency of emotion represented by trust $>$ anticipation $> \mathrm { j o y } >$ surprise was identified, with the first (trust) being overwhelmingly dominant and the rest indicating minor presence; and (3) subdisciplinary emotion variation was found and the contributing variables were identified as research methods and paradigms, research objects, interdisciplinary features, and disciplinary status in knowledge accumulation. The findings contribute to our understanding of emotion strategy applied in academic writing and genre characteristics of medical science. This article concludes with pedagogical implications for EAP teachers and suggestions for possible future research.

# 1. Introduction

Sentiment analysis is systematically detecting, extracting, and classifying the subjective information and affective states represented in a text using statistical and machine-learning algorithms and computer technologies (Lei and Liu, 2021). Retrieving emotional information, analyzing opinionative/sentimental online data, and categorizing sentimental patterns are all made simpler by sentiment analysis in a variety of contexts, which has attracted great interest from the research community. With the aid of sentiment analysis, we can determine the strength or weakness of the emotions presented in unstructured texts and categorize them as either positive, negative, or neutral. Today, sentiment analysis is widely used to track public opinion and support decision-making across a wide range of industries. This analytical method has also achieved widespread popularity among governments, institutions, and businesses in addition to scholars.

Numerous fields, including business and finance, politics, health and medicine, and entertainment, have engaged in sentiment analysis. In the domain of business and finance, the application of sentiment analysis can identify key factors for the success of startups (Saura et al., 2019), provide business insights, and help make better decisions (Birjali et al., 2021), understand the voice of the customer (Gallagher et al., 2019), and provide effective investment recommendations for investors in the stock market (Sun et al., 2018). In the political field, it can be used to examine public sentiment for presidential campaigns (Groshek and Al-Rawi, 2013) and monitor public opinion for supporting the decisions of policymakers (Ceron and Negri, 2016). In the area of healthcare and medicine, its application can help doctors assess clinical outcomes and judge the impact of medical conditions on a patient’s well-being (Denecke and Deng, 2015). Furthermore, in the entertainment domain, sentiment analysis of movie reviews can present effective insights from audience feedback (Thet et al., 2010). It is evident that opinions are very important to businesses, governments, medical establishments, and other agencies for policy design and decision-making. Sentiment analysis, in this case, generates great benefits and remarkable convenience in identifying target opinions.

In recent times, sentiment analysis has gained leverage in the academic field (Cao et al., 2021; Fekete and Haffner, 2019; Umer et al., 2021; Vinkers et al., 2015; Weidmann et al., 2018; Wen and Lei, 2022). These studies explored sentiment in research articles (RAs), abstracts, in-text citations, academic tweets on social platforms, etc., paving a new way for investigating academic texts. Admittedly, the notion of sentiment analysis is closely related to other notions in academic writing such as affect (Ochs, 1989), attitude (Halliday, 1994), stance (Conrad and Biber, 2000), appraisal (Martin, 2000), evaluation (Hunston and Thompson, 2000), and metadiscourse (Hyland and Tse, 2004). Among the current studies on this topic, it can be noticed that only a limited number of disciplines were covered, such as biomedical science (Cao et al., 2021; Vinkers et al., 2015) and political science (Weidmann et al., 2018). As MacDonald (2002: 447) has once emphasized, few fields of discourse have attracted so much attention as that of medicine. However, in the sentiment analysis concerning the medical field, it is noteworthy that the studies of Vinkers et al. (2015) and Cao et al. (2021) were confined to a very small set of predefined words, including 50 adjectives equally divided into positive words and negative words. Additionally, they merely examined the two polarities in academic writing and did not refer to specific emotions in texts, which leaves scope for future investigation.

Adequate emotion expression, as one of the potent strategies in academic writing, can greatly assist writers in establishing their authorial identity (Ivanic, 1998) in effective writing. In order to effectively assimilate into academic communities and gain acceptance, writers should have the requisite abilities to form suitable identities and integrate linguistic conventions associated with their target disciplinary discourse communities (Is¸ ık-Tas¸ , 2018). These abilities encompass not just the proficient use of the target language, but also the construction of credible authorial presence in their RAs that is consistent with the identity of their disciplinary communities (Hyland, 2002). Prior investigations into various linguistic resources employed in engaging with potential readers and constructing authorial identity have provided valuable insights into a range of linguistic strategies. However, the examination of emotion expression remains an overlooked aspect in the studies of academic discourse. As a more specialized subcategory of sentiment analysis, emotion analysis involves examining more specific emotions such as “anger”, “anxiety”, “disgust”, “fear”, “joy”, and “sadness” (Giuntini et al., 2020). Investigating the distinct emotions conveyed by writers in academic writing within the realm of current research on academic discourse represents a novel endeavor that warrants further promotion and in-depth examination.

To advance the current sentiment analysis in medical science, this study explores the specific emotions expressed by writers in RAs across typical subdisciplines of medicine, aiming to scrutinize how writers use rhetorical devices of emotion in academic writing. It is posited that an examination of emotions in medical RAs might elucidate their role as a typical strategy in discourse construction, offering suggestions for pedagogical approaches to teaching academic English within the medical domain. It will also enrich the understanding of the medical academic genre and contribute to the advancement of current research in English for Specific Purposes (ESP). The following three research questions (RQ) guided this study:

RQ1: What are the specific emotions expressed by writers in medical RAs? RQ2: How intensive are various emotions expressed by writers in medical RAs? RQ3: Is there any sub-disciplinary variation of emotions in medical science? If so, what is the variation?

# 2. Methodology

This section describes the data and the methods used in the present study.

# 2.1. Corpus data

In this study, a corpus of English RAs was compiled, covering 18 medical subdisciplines including Aging (AGE), Anesthesia (ANS), Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (LAB), Dermatology (DER), Emergency Medicine (EMG), Imaging and Nuclear Medicine (IMG), Internal Medicine (INT), Neurology (NEU), Obstetrics and Gynecology (GYN), Oncology (CAN), Ophthalmology (OPH), Otolaryngology-Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT), Pain Medicine (PAN), Pediatrics (PED), Psychiatry (PSY), Rehabilitation (REH), Sports Medicine (SPO), and Surgery (SUR). It comprises research papers published in the period between 2015 and 2017 from three to five top-ranking journals of each subdiscipline in reference to Journal Citation Reports (JCR), with a total size of 5,051,958 tokens, 1,186 texts, and 190,753 sentences. For this study, the additional information such as title, author information, abstract, keywords, figures and tables, references, appendix, etc., were all removed. Accordingly, Table 1 presents the specific corpus information of the 18 aforementioned subdisciplines.

# 2.2. Analytical tool for emotion mining

In this study, the National Research Council (NRC) Emotion Intensity Lexicon (version 1.0) (available at https:// saifmohammad.com/WebDocs/Lexicons/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.zip), created by the National Research Council Canada and released on March 2020, was used to mine specific emotions in academic writing.

The target terms of the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon were chosen from three sources: Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1986), General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), and WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004). In the process of creating this lexicon, the researchers used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service as a platform to obtain large-scale emotion annotations. The maximum likelihood probability of agreement on the emotion questions between each annotator were calculated. They also used Fleiss’s k to measure inter-annotator agreement. A collection of approximately 10,000 English words, which potentially represent the eight basic emotions of anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust in context, were eventually included. Besides, the words were assigned with real-valued scores of affect intensity (ranging from 0 to 1) by using the Best–Worst Scaling (BWS) technique. A score of 1 indicates that the word conveys the highest intensity of emotion, while a score of 0 indicates the lowest (Mohammad and Kiritchenko, 2018). The terms included are associated with emotions of varying degrees in this crowdsourced lexicon, which serves as an effective tool to identify affect intensity and difference. Recently, NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon of different versions have been used to explore emotion features from textual content across diverse domains (e.g. Malik and Hussain, 2017; Arku et al., 2022; Sarsam et al., 2022).

# 2.3. Data processing and statistical analyses

The data was processed in the following steps:

First, all the emotion words of the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon were retrieved in the corpus and every concordance was checked manually to ensure its reflection of the writer’s emotion in the context. In this study, the emotions were narrowed down as writer-oriented in texts and other emotion words were excluded. To guarantee the validity and reliability of the results, an inter-rater reliability test was carried out in data screening, with every kappa value reaching more than 0.85 and all disagreements were subsequently resolved through discussion. A total of 34,145 concordances that meet the needs of the current investigation were eventually obtained. By summarizing the results, the present study attempts to answer RQ1 with a detailed presentation of specific emotions revealed in medical RAs.

Second, to answer RQ2, the raw frequency of every emotion word was first calculated and normalized to avoid potential text length bias. Specifically, the raw frequency of every emotion word was summed and then divided by corpus tokens of each subdiscipline, and the quotient was multiplied by 1,000,000 (see Formula 1). The normalized frequency of each emotion word was then multiplied with its intensity score to obtain the total emotion value. In this way, the total emotion value of other words was calculated in this manner in each subdiscipline. The total emotion value of each word was next added in the same category to obtain the general score of a specific emotion. With this score, we can identify the degree of each emotion as they manifested themselves through words in the corpus.

Sum of Frequency of Emotion Word Normalized Word Frequency $=$ Tokens

Finally, to answer RQ3, each emotion was compared with its total intensity score across the 18 subdisciplines of medical science. Through statistical comparison, the variation of each emotion can be revealed.

# 3.1. Common emotion words in medical RAs

Four emotions, out of the total eight basic ones, were detected in medical RAs. It was observed that the emotions of trust, anticipation, joy, and surprise appeared to be common emotions of writers. In contrast, the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, and sadness were rarely found. Table 2 shows the top ten words of each emotion along with their intensity scores.

Trust is an essential emotion for effective management and social systems (Bazerman, 1994). It can exist between individuals, groups, and institutions and can represent either a global belief in humanity or a situation-specific and/or trusteespecific attitude (Butler, 1991). In prior literature, trust has been studied and defined across different disciplines such as economics (Williamson, 1993), sociology (Gambetta, 2000), and psychology (Rotter, 1971). By referring to the definition of trust by Dunn and Schweitzer (2005), I defined it as the following: Trust is the willingness to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations about research-related knowledge, information, and achievements. The two examples given below demonstrate how the emotion of trust manifests itself in writing.

Among the top ten emotion words of trust, the word “found”, as a common item used to inform readers of the research findings in texts, was ranked in the top place. Despite its relative low intensity score of emotion, it plays an indispensable role indicating the writers’ affirmation of their research. Notably, the emotion word of trust with the highest score was “fact”, which was in seventh place with an intensity score of 0.727. Collectively, these words indicate the assurance and certainty of writers when presenting their research findings or evaluations in support of their research. In academic writing, this emotion can persuasively gain their support and acceptance. To a large extent, the convincing stance of the writer can significantly enhance the reliability of the research.

The second emotion of anticipation detected in our study has normally been regarded as the way we perceive how we will feel about a future event (Mellers et al., 1999), which then allows us to prepare for possible outcomes of situations (Gaylin, 1979). Anticipation is developed by previous experiences that are remembered and related to the current situation (Gaylin, 1979). In scientific research, this emotion gives researchers the opportunity to get excited about the upcoming results, findings, and investigations (see two examples below). It indicates an emotion of anticipating rewards triggered by the feeling that something rewarding is coming (Kalat and Shiota, 2007).

Joy, the third emotion examined in the present study, has been widely accepted as an emotion that is most frequently experienced by people (Trampe et al., 2015). Moreover, it is also the main positive emotion that has received scientific attention since the early days of emotion research (Van Cappellen, 2020). It has been commonly conceptualized as the emotion of joy arising from an event that is appraised as highly relevant and highly conducive to the attainment of one’s goals (Ellsworth and Scherer, 2003), which is triggered when someone registers progress toward a goal at a rate higher than expected (Carver and Scheier, 1998). In academic writing, this emotion explicitly reveals the writers’ satisfaction and praise of academic achievement in meeting or exceeding their expectations, as demonstrated in example (5) and (6).

In the list of words expressing joy, the word “good” was found to be at the top, in spite of its comparatively low score (0.547). The outstanding words with a higher intensity score than others turned out to be “exciting” and “excellent”, with 0.853 and 0.812, respectively. In scientific research, the findings and the achievements obtained, whether minor or big, are of great comfort and encouragement for researchers.

In the family of emotions, the surprise emotion can be seen as an interruption mechanism (Mellers et al., 1997). It is elicited by unexpected events, interrupting ongoing thoughts and activities, and motivating people to pay attention to the unexpected stimulus (Noordewier and Breugelmans, 2013). Unlike other basic emotions, surprise is cognitive in nature and results from the discrepancy between an actual experience and an entertained expectation (Scheffler, 2010). When surprise is triggered, we are not only informed of the expectation–experience discrepancy, but also motivated to find an explanation for it (Tsang, 2013). In this sense, feeling surprised is intrinsically related to the acquisition of new knowledge (Hu and Chen, 2019). In academic writing, the representation of surprise emotion by writers highlights the deviation of expectation and motivates their exploration of new knowledge (see examples below).

In this last type of emotion, I found it includes emotion words with a generally higher score of intensity. The top word in the list was marked as “unexpected”, with an intensity score of 0.711. Dramatically, the emotion word with the highest score among the words listed in the above table was noted as “surprise”, which was in sixth place with an intensity score of 0.930. This emotion shows the reaction when writers encounter unexpected results and consequences. In most cases, research develops in an expected way. However, some anomalies in results will occasionally occur. Throughout the history of scientific research, these anomalies have often brought up surprising new findings or prompted researchers to investigate other novel issues. Undoubtedly, readers tend to reflect on the issues when writers show the emotion of surprise in texts.

In summary, the emotions of trust, anticipation, joy, and surprise were found to be the prevailing emotions expressed by academic writers in medical science. Meanwhile, the top ten words of each emotion have well demonstrated the manner in which writers conveyed their emotions through linguistic expression in academic writing. The subsequent two sections focus on the degree of emotion intensity and the subdisciplinary variation.

# 3.2. Emotion intensity in medical RAs

The overall intensity score for each emotion identified in this study is shown in Figure 1. With a total score close to 50,000, the overwhelming emotion of trust stands out as the most remarkable emotion. This figure indicates the important role of authoritative and trustworthy representation of writers in academic writing, which contributes to the effect of influencing potential readers. The emotional expression of trust not only helps to build an image of reliability for writers, but also effectively pulls the audience close to them, encouraging a close relationship with their readers. In contrast, the other three emotions only had minor gains in the realm of emotion in medical RAs with their total reaching just over a fifth of the trust emotion. Among the three minor emotions, the general score of anticipation emotion surpassed those of the rest with a score close to 10,000. In comparison, the emotion of joy was found to have a score of less than 5,000. However, the emotion of surprise, identified as the weakest writer emotion presented in the texts, had only about $1 \%$ of the general score of the trust emotion.

Figure 1. General intensity score of four emotions.

Although only four emotions were detected in the present study, the degrees of intensity contrasted dramatically. The most popular emotion of trust, as a leading emotion shared by medical writers, indicates the most common emotion while compiling their work. In the field of academic writing, it is the most fundamental emotion that writers would express occasionally in the process of textual construction.

# 3.3. Subdisciplinary variation of emotions in medical science

It has been well established by the results that emotion expressions generally follow the tendency of trust $>$ anticipation $> \mathrm { j o y } >$ surprise in academic writing of medicine. The results obtained from the subdisciplinary investigation also confirmed a general agreement with this tendency. Accordingly, Table 3 demonstrates the general score of every emotion in each subdiscipline. Regardless of the mainstream tendency of emotional expression, two of the subdisciplines (CAN and SUR) stood out with a notable deviation from this trend. From both subdisciplines, the emotion ranking first was observed as anticipation instead of trust, with relatively higher scores of the former in contrast to the latter. The emotion of trustdan emotion tagged as the leading emotion in medical sciencedturned out to be the second one in these two subdisciplines.

Notably, certain subdisciplinary variation of emotion intensity was observed in the results of the present study. Figure 2 is a representation of emotion intensity indicating this variation.

For the emotion of trust, a significant feature is that its intensity degree remained quite stable in most subdisciplines, as compared with those of other emotions. It is obvious that the intensity scores are close to the mean value in almost 15 subdisciplines. Among all the subdisciplines, LAB was found to have the highest intensity, reaching close to 4,000. In CAN and SUR, the intensity appeared to be the weakest, with a score of only 305.1 and 240.2, respectively. Although the scores of these two subdisciplines are far lower than the mainstream scores, the general fluctuation of scores among the other subdisciplines is less differentiating in contrast to that of the other three emotions.

For the rest of the emotions, an observable characteristic is the greater variation against the emotion of trust. In the subdisciplines of EMG and DER, the emotion of anticipation was relatively stronger than in others, with the strongest in EMG (731.0). While in SPO, SUR, INT, and REH, it was weakly conveyed, with the weakest presentation in REH (276.5). A notable phenomenon that deserves our attention is the low intensity of both trust and anticipation emotions in the subdiscipline of SUR.

The results for joy highlighted that the intensity score was below the mean value in over half of the subdisciplines. In contrast to the weak presentation in AGE and INT (106.9 and 114.4, respectively), the strongest expression of joy was detected in the subdiscipline IMG, with a score of 404.3. The subdiscipline of LAB, with the highest intensity of trust emotion mentioned above, was found to have the second strongest intensity of the joy emotion.

As the weakest emotion revealed in medical academic writing, the surprise emotion still varied to a certain degree across the subdisciplines. Two subdisciplinesdSPO and CANdstood out from the rest with the strongest degree of surprise emotion. SPO has been labeled as a subdiscipline with a very weak expression of anticipation emotion and CAN with the least expression of trust emotion. Contrary to this, INT and IMG had the lowest intensity score of surprise emotion. It seems to be an interesting phenomenon that writers of INT adopted a more cautious approach in expressing the emotions of anticipation, joy, and surprise as revealed by low-intensity scores of these three emotions. Additionally, a similar result is that the intensity score in over half of the subdisciplines was less than the mean value, as compared with the intensity of joy.

# 4. Discussion

The specific emotions in academic writing across 18 subdisciplines of medical science were examined. To the best of our knowledge, the systemic subdisciplinary examination of specific emotions in English RAs based on a large corpus of full texts (more than 5 million) is probably the first attempt of its kind in the study of academic discourse. The results of the study can be summarized in three main points. First, the four emotions of trust, anticipation, joy, and surprise were observed in medical RAs; among them, the trust emotion showed unparalleled dominance. Second, the intensity of the four emotions varied dramatically, following the pattern of trust $>$ anticipation $>$ joy $>$ surprise. Third, subdisciplinary variations of the four emotions were discovered in the findings, with some subdisciplines contrasting with the mainstream emotions revealed in medical academic writing. Unquestionably, adequate way of academic persuasion involves the adoption of emotion strategy. Effective and successful persuasion has also been greatly consolidated with the aid of emotion presentation in textual construction. In general, the source and feature of knowledge, the subject of research, and the elements related to research methods and paradigms can all be held responsible for the variation of emotions.

Academic discourse has its own features, contrary to other types of discourse, and it facilitates communication within the academic environment. The way in which individuals collaborate and compete with others to create knowledge is regarded as the heart of the academic enterprise (Hyland, 2009). In the promotion of knowledge and the establishment of reputation, effective communication is absolutely the most useful method utilized by academia. To encourage discoveries and provide innovative insights and updated information, scholars should frame their views within a context that is already accepted in their respective academic fields and carefully tailor their arguments for a particular audience. To achieve this goal, academic writers must offer a credible representation of themselves in textual construction by using appropriate discourse, thereby ensuring successful communication with their peers and potential audience.

It is indisputable that the credibility of texts depends on a couple of elements, among which effective interactions through the systems of stance and engagement have contributed significantly (Hyland, 2005). As Hyland (2009: 74) has stated, stance can be referred to as a community-recognized personality. It indicates a speaker’s or writer’s personal attitudes, emotions, and assessments (Gray and Biber, 2012). In fact, Hunston (1994: 192) also claims that persuasion is the primary goal of experimental research and the writer’s primary purpose is to persuade the academic community to accept the new knowledge claims and to adjust its network of consensual knowledge in order to accommodate those claims. In academic writing, successful persuasion calls for various linguistic devices to realize the acceptance of the writer’s viewpoint or research findings. Therefore, emotion representation is an indispensable strategy in promoting the acceptance of research.

As Rocklage et al. (2018) has stated, the intent to persuade can lead people to spontaneously communicate with greater emotion. To achieve successful persuasion of academic readers, medical writers have also realized that emotional communication in texts is of great significance for them, and thus developed an association between persuasion and emotion. Serving as an important way for doctors and medical researchers to present valuable findings and build their academic reputations, medical RAs share such similar features as authority, objectivity, reliability, and trustworthiness in the general scientific disciplines, which highlights the representativeness of medical discipline in the field of science. These features contrast themselves significantly with those of soft-pure disciplines (e.g. literature) relying heavily on subjective evaluations and judgements. To meet the needs of qualified journals and promote acceptance by their scholarly peers, medical writers recognized that appropriate expression of authorial emotions is an effective and potent rhetorical strategy in building academic texts and consolidating their academic authority. Hence, presenting emotions with negative valencedsuch as anger, fear, disgust, and sadnessdis the last option they tend to choose, which aligns with the prevalent strategy of using positive emotion in academic discourse. To a large extent, these emotions will undermine and impair the authoritative temperament of writers, thereby causing doubt and mistrust from their readers. In view of this, the most highly regarded medical writers are those who strive to increase the veracity of their elaborative research and valuable achievements with a positive valence of trust, anticipation, joy, and surprise. It is certain that positive emotions dramatically promoted acceptance by readers, as articles that positively presented research outcomes tend to receive more citations (Lerchenmueller et al., 2019). For academic writers, a high citation rate is a serious and valuable consideration they will never overlook.

The prevailing emotion of trust expressed by medical writers highlighted the significance of this strategy in academic persuasion. It is widely accepted that affect can be a critical factor in influencing how people trust others (Lount, 2010). In the application of affect in academic writing, the expression of trust has been accepted by medical writers of most subdisciplines as the prior strategy. In their mind, trust makes the interaction with their potential readers easy. Furthermore, fostering trustworthiness in readers is consistent with the demands of constructing textual reliability in medical RAs. By reviewing the degree of expressing trust emotion by medical writers across 18 subdisciplines, I suggest research tool, method, and paradigm adopted significantly contributed to the presentation of this emotion. The subdiscipline of LAB, in which trust emotion has been observed to be the strongest affect strategy applied by writers (see the two examples below), significantly differentiated itself from the other subdisciplines in terms of research method and paradigm.

In the medical field, LAB is a branch that heavily relies on various equipment, instruments, and labware to provide laboratory information needed for clinical diagnoses, which deeply affects the degree of trust expression by researchers. According to Guyatt et al. (1992), evidence-based medicine de-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic clinical experience, and pathophysiological rationale as sufficient grounds for clinical decision-making and stresses the examination of evidence from clinical research. Among the variables that influence medical decisions, laboratory tests are considered to be among the most important and frequently used (Ngo et al., 2017). As a provider of direct evidence for other medical needs, LAB uses a wide range of clinical research laboratory equipment to assist the research needs for optimal diagnostic decisions. In the area of this subdiscipline, subjective judgment lacking direct evidence has been devalued while reliable data obtained from the analysis of clinical specimens has been foregrounded. Based on the typical characteristics of research approaches and techniques, a kind of explicit or unconscious expression of trust emotion by the practitioners of LAB was easily revealed in the academic writing as contrary to their peers involved in other medical subdisciplines. Notably, the presentation of trust accordingly indicates their confidence in the results from scientific testing on samples.

In the subdisciplines which rely less heavily on equipment and instruments, the revealing of trust emotion by writers has been decreased to a certain degree. Judging from the features of the subdisciplines whose writers expressed a weak emotion of trust, as specifically seen in CAN and SUR, we can still recognize some micro-level elements that influence the expression of this emotion. In the subdiscipline of CAN, with regard to a specialty dealing with the treatment of cancer, what challenges researchers is that cancer is a major burden of disease worldwide (Ma and Yu, 2006). According to the GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators (2016), it has been regarded as the second leading cause of death worldwide. Researchers engaging in cancer treatment are still seeking ways to conquer this seemingly intractable disease. Moreover, new achievements and innovative treatments are waiting for further verification and validation as well. The comprehensive elements collectively impact the expression of trust emotion. Besides, the uncertainty generated from the research findings in this area is more likely to trigger the surprise emotion among researchersdanother emotion that will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

In the subdiscipline of SUR, it is observed that a large proportion of surgical literature is of questionable value, as most surgical research resides in the case series and the study design is the most vulnerable to criticism (Horton, 1996). Based on the research paradigm applied in this area, it is suggested that small, uncontrolled case series, case reports, and expert opinions represent the weakest level of evidence (Athanasiou et al., 2010), which to some degree accounts for the phenomenon of weak trust emotion in this field. From these accountable factors, it can be concluded that the expression of trust appeared not to be a suitable rhetorical way for writers of CAN and SUR. It is also not surprising to note that both have adopted the approach of expressing anticipation emotion as their prior sentiment strategy. In addition, the characteristics of SUR mentioned above have also caused the weak expression of the anticipation emotion by writers of this specialty, a type of emotion that will be covered below.

In terms of the other emotions of anticipation, joy, and surprise revealed in medical articles, some subdisciplines merit special attention in our results. This is notably seen in EMG with anticipation, IMG with joy, and SPO with surprise (some examples are listed below). Due to the low intensity score of emotion, it is not safe to categorize what subdisciplines deeply involve these emotions and whether their writers intentionally take these sentiment tools as an important rhetorical strategy. However, some disciplinary elements can partly account for the use of these emotions.

research is forwarded with more time dedicated to it. In this case, the anticipation emotion was rooted in the mind of the practitioners of this specialty and may be revealed in their articles. With IMG and SPO, certain remarkable disciplinary features distinguishing it from other subdisciplines can be identified. A notable feature of IMG is its heavy reliance on a couple of technologies such as roentgen and magnetic resonance (Scatliff and Morris, 2014). The advanced technologies applied in a diagnosis tend to bring exciting findings to researchers and increase their emotion of joy. In the subdiscipline of SPO, what should not be overlooked is its short history of development and interdisciplinary features across the fields of medicine and sports (Ergen, 2016). Owing to these features, the newly obtained findings tend to be inconsistent with existing knowledge, leading to surprise among its practitioners.

Although it is not easy to extract the common feature of the subdisciplines with lower emotion scores, the phenomenon of expressing weak emotion by writers of INT and SUR is apparently not a coincidence. In addition to the trust emotion, the anticipation emotion was also the last strategy adopted by the writers of SUR. While in INT, anticipation emotion, together with joy and surprise, were all found to have a weak presentation. It suggests that some elements existing behind absolutely govern this phenomenon.

It is certain that the disciplinary statuses of INT and SUR are of great weight in the medical field. As Aggarwal (2010) has stated, there are two branches of medicine: the less invasive medical methods and the more invasive surgical methods. Given this, INT and SUR are apparently posited at the two poles, representing general medical knowledge. In these subdisciplines, the disciplinary trait of INT deserves special attention. According to Britannica (2013), the specialty of INT, which deals with the entire patient rather than a particular organ system, is in effect the parent of other medical specialties. Most other subdisciplines, whose names reflect the activities that their practitioners undertake or the patient population with whom they provide professional medical diagnosis and treatment, originated from INT, and based their development on its knowledge. In fact, because of its governing position and history, INT has an incomparable advantage in knowledge accumulation. Influenced by the wealthy experience and the abundant prior knowledge reserved, researchers of INT tend to follow more standardized procedures and objective presentations when reporting research findings in their textsdwhich is also true in SUR. Therefore, the strategy of using diversified emotions seems unnecessary in academic persuasion. In particular, the emotions of joy and surprise go against the stylistic features of INT. Based on these factors, it is reasonable that a generally lower emotion intensity was detected in INT and SUR.

Sentiment analysis in academic discourse, to a large extent, might be seen as a valuable advancement of the exploration of metadiscourse. The expression of emotions by writers in their texts unquestionably serves as a potent tool for helping regulate the level of personality and engaging with potential readers (Hyland, 2019). By taking explicitly involved and personal positions, writers effectively engage in an imagined dialogue with others in the interactional dimension. Contrary to prior metadiscourse investigation, sentiment analysis provides insights into the emotional elements incorporated in the interaction with readers, guiding and prompting academic writers to pay attention to more vibrant and expressive ways of authorial presence. Besides, it is worth noting that the current repertoire of metadiscourse in the interactional dimension lacks a certain number of lexical items pertaining to emotions, although some of them fall into the categories of hedges, boosters, and attitude markers. By depicting the emotions expressed in texts and uncovering linguistic items used in the realization of these emotions, sentiment analysis can greatly enrich the tools of metadiscourse, offering considerable benefits in academic discourse studies.

# 5. Pedagogical implications

The current findings allow for several specific recommendations to be given to EAP teachers concerning the implementation of emotion strategies in medical academic writing. First, teachers should instill in their students an awareness that academic writing in the field of medicine is not an impersonal presentation of medical facts. Authorial presence, whether explicitly presented or not, holds significant rhetorical efficacy in the realm of academic writing (Walková, 2019). As a key element of successful academic writing, it is a potent means for writers to express their identities by asserting their claims to speak as an authority (Hyland, 2002). It should be noted that authorial presence encompasses not just the use of first-person pronouns but also their emotion presentation, both of which serve as impactful rhetorical strategies in academic discourse. In fact, the former is to project their identities in discourses while the latter deals with what characteristics of their identities are constructed. To better facilitate the writer’s presentation in consolidating textual persuasion, the use of specific emotions can undoubtedly provide writers with a unique rhetorical strategy. In the conventional teaching of medical academic writing, there has been a significant reduction in emphasis on discourse strategies, as opposed to the predominant focus on lexical resources. In light of this, EAP teachers should make it a point to include the strategy of expressing specific emotions in textual organization in teaching activities. Developing an awareness of textual strategies in academic writing would be highly advantageous for medical students.

Second, EAP teachers should meticulously design the course of academic writing with a particular focus on the linguistic repertoire of emotion words. It is important to consider that the selection of emotion words in academic writing is not arbitrary. Our research results suggest a prevalence of positive authorial emotions expressed in medical RAs, which aligns with the previous research of Yuan and Yao (2022) that highlights the increasing trend of positivity in academic writing. In response to this fact, emotion words with positive valence should be included as valuable teaching materials for EAP teachers. As the specific emotions detected in medical RAs in this study were sorted in the order of trust $>$ anticipation $\mathrm { \ p j o y { > } } $ surprise, EAP teachers should instruct their medical students to be consistent with the writing convention concerning the use of emotion words shared by the medical academic community. Besides, EAP teachers should consider what emotion words in each category are more frequently used and accepted by medical writers, as well as how powerfully each word expresses this emotion. Guided by a fine course design centered on the specific linguistic resources of emotion, medical students can significantly enhance and fortify their proficiency in employing emotional strategies within academic writing.

Additionally, it is imperative for EAP teachers to implement targeted teaching methods for medical students, taking into account the findings of our study which indicate the presence of emotional differences across some subdisciplines of medicine. With a fixed and entrenched approach to teaching medical students with diverse subdisciplinary backgrounds, there is no assurance that their pedagogical methods will adequately fulfill the needs and anticipations of the general students. The findings of this study indicate that writers of some subdisciplines exhibit distinct patterns in their utilization of the emotion expression way in RAs, as opposed to the majority of others. This prompts us to consider a modified instruction to accommodate medical students with these subdisciplinary backgrounds. In the context of specific teaching activities, the necessary adjustments to teaching with consideration of students’ knowledge structure can significantly enhance their acquisition of methodologies and strategies for proficient academic writing.

# 6. Conclusion

This study investigated various emotions revealed in medical RAs across 18 subdisciplines. It confirmed that the application of emotion was a pivotal rhetorical strategy for medical writers in constructing their texts and certain variations of emotion existed across medical subspecialties. To be specific, emotions with positive valence were commonly observed, while those with negative valence were rarely detected. Among the positive emotions, trust emotion was found to be dominant, with the other emotions of anticipation, joy, and surprise occupying the remaining three places. The prevailing emotion of trust shared by medical writers indicated the stylistic feature of building up credibility and authority in medical RAs. In addition, the intensity degree of each emotion varied to a certain extent, highlighting some subdisciplines with stronger or weaker presentations. A couple of factors governing the variation of emotion can be summarized. It is suggested that research methods and paradigms applied in medical exploration and the research objects involved in research significantly influenced emotion presentation. Besides, the disciplinary nature also contributed to emotion variation. On the one hand, emotion presentation in traditional subdisciplines (notably seen in INT and SUR) varied significantly from those that had originated from them. On the other hand, in the subdisciplines with interdisciplinary features and a short history of development, emotion revelation was also different from that in other subspecialties.

Effective textual strategies in academic discourse involve the use of various linguistic resources, in which emotion expression as a pivotal tool surely holds a significant position. This study effectively broadens and enhances the application of sentiment analysis in discourse study by examining the presentation of specific emotions in RAs. It also sheds lights on the hitherto disregarded aspect of academic discourse, providing us with refreshed knowledge and understanding of academic genre. In addition, the findings derived from this study can enrich teaching content for the instruction of medical English as well. By expanding the focus on textual cohesive devices in conventional teaching to such higher-order strategy as emotion presentation, EAP instructors can greatly promote the persuasive skills of medical students in academic writing. Pedagogical implications of instructing emotion strategy in teaching English for medical purposes are self-evident in this sense.

It should be noted, though, that some limitations exist as well. On the one hand, only three to five journals were selected for each subdiscipline, making the present investigation confined to a relatively small sample size of journals. On the other, some subdisciplines had significantly fewer texts than others, notably seen in DER, which affected the study of this subdiscipline to a certain degree. Besides, articles published in recent years were absent in the corpus of the present study, which potentially decreased its robustness. In light of the above limitations, future research should include more journals and more recent publications to make the data robust.
