# 1 INTRODUCTION

In this media review, we leverage Hubbard's (2021) framework for computer-assisted language learning(CALL) to examine the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 (fourth-generation generative pre-trained transformer), as a tool for teachers to provide their students with feedback on writing. This tripartite framework consists of an operational description of the technology, and how it fits learners' and teachers' needs and abilities. This review is therefore divided into three main components: a description of generative AI and how GPT-4 could be used in an English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) teaching context, an evaluation of how well this technology fits the teacher's needs in providing feedback, and an evaluation of how well it provides useful feedback to students in order to meet their needs.

# 2 OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION

GPT-4 is a large language model (LLM) that users can interface with through the chatbot ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/). GPT-4 is trained on massive amounts of text data and has been fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (https://openai.com/research/gpt-4). It can be accessed on mobile devices, PC, or Mac through a browser, as well as through an app for Android and iOS users. While there are LLMs that are free to use (GPT-3.5, PaLM 2), we prefer to use GPT-4 for generating feedback because it currently has superior reasoning capabilities and we have found its feedback to be more accurate, concise, and detailed. Use of GPT-4 does require a "Plus" membership (20 USD per month). Users can interact with GPT-4 by submitting a prompt (a question or request) to ChatGPT, to which the chatbot will respond. Because of high demand, prompts to GPT-4 are currently limited to 50 every 3hours. To get the most from LLMs, effective prompt engineering is essential. Ingley and Pack (2023) offer a useful framework: assign a role or identity, define an objective, specify the context and constraints, and refine the output through continued conversation. Carefully crafted prompts will help the AI to generate more suitable and useful output. Prompt engineering is a process and a skill, and we underscore the need to refine prompts and output through continued conversation in order to increase the accuracy and appropriacy of AI-generated feedback.

We utilized GPT-4 in our university-level general English for academic purposes (EAP) classes in order to provide students with feedback on weekly writing assignments. We began by engineering our prompt; this was an iterative process as we tested the capabilities of GPT-4, and as we considered what kind and amount of feedback we wanted to provide our students. Using our judgment as experienced language educators, we stopped iteratively developing once we found a prompt that generated feedback we believed to be accurate, useful, and understandable by English language learners. The final prompt we settled on, along with sample feedback, can be found in the appendices. Once we had finalized our prompt, each week students submitted a first draft of a writing assignment. We then read the students' responses to ensure they contained no identifying information and utilized GPT-4 to generate feedback for each student. This feedback was then emailed to the students. Students reviewed the AI-generated feedback, revised their writing accordingly, and submitted a final draft.

# 3 TEACHER FIT

This technology offers multiple affordances that make it appealing to English language teachers. First is the amount of time and energy saved when providing feedback. Once a suitable prompt has been crafted, teachers can quickly generate high-quality feedback for students in a number of areas, as determined by the prompt. Second is the amount of feedback that teachers can provide to each student. The feedback can be as thorough as you ask it to be, so students can get a very detailed analysis of their writing in a variety of categories (e.g., content, coherence, language use, evidence, and sources) that ideally align with a writing rubric used for the class. The ability to quickly and automatically generate high-quality feedback can empower teachers to provide students with feedback on writing that is meaningful, manageable, constant, and timely, which are highlighted in the literature as being important for both teacher and student (Hartshorn et al., 2010).

Teachers considering using GPT-4 for writing feedback should be aware of a few challenges that may arise when incorporating this technology into their practice. First are the limitations mentioned previously, namely the cost of a subscription (20 USD per month) and the cap on prompt submissions (50 every 3hours). Second, teachers must maintain student privacy and be careful with what information they provide to the LLM, as the companies that make and manage the LLMs often store these data. Providing identifying information or student work may violate educational rights and privacy regulations. As such, we recommend that teachers be aware of these laws in their respective countries, engage transparently with students and obtain their consent, design writing assignments that discourage the use of personal information, and scrub student writing of any personally identifying information before including it in any prompt for AI-generated feedback. Furthermore, teachers should be aware of AI bias and the possibility for AI algorithms to perpetuate biases inherent in their training data (Roselli et al., 2019), as well as the tendency for LLMs to sometimes \*hallucinate" or make up information. For example, AI systems might show bias towards a particular writing style or cultural references. More research is needed to understand if and how LLMs might exhibit bias in assessing learners' writing. Lastly, depending on class sizes, the copying and pasting of student work into prompts, prompts into ChatGPT, and feedback into student emails can be tedious. Perhaps one of the most concerning drawbacks, however, is the potential for AI enfeeblement, which occurs when humans become "completely dependent on machines" (https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk#Enfeeblement). If teachers rely too heavily on AI-generated feedback, without paying sufficient attention to the feedback or students' work, teachers may become disconnected from their students and their needs. To remedy this, we suggest that teachers carefully read the writing and the AI-generated feedback. Not only does this help teachers to stay involved in their students' progress, it also allows for them to catch any inaccuracies that there may be in the feedback.

# 4 LEARNER FIT

As for learner fit, AI-generated feedback has benefits and drawbacks for students as well. With regard to benefits for students, AI often generates more feedback than teachers are typically able to provide, and that feedback can potentially be more specific than the feedback that many teachers are willing to offer. Students are also able to receive the feedback sooner, giving them additional time to read it and incorporate it into their revisions. The structured organization of the AI-generated feedback (e.g., the table in the feedback provided in Appendix A) is another advantage, making it easy for students to understand. In addition, with proper training, students could use ChatGPT on their own to produce feedback. Once teachers have engineered a prompt that generates acceptable feedback, they can share the tested and approved prompt with their students, thereby enabling their students to be more autonomous.

As for drawbacks, if teachers solely rely on AI-generated feedback and opt to not have face-toface interaction, such as in-person tutoring sessions or writing conferences, students may experience a decline in motivation and engagement. However, using the technology does not exclude teachers from providing opportunities for students to meet in person in order to ask questions and receive additional help. Another potential drawback is the risk of AI-generated feedback being too verbose and/or complicated for the students. Careful adjustments made to the prompt, however, can resolve these issues. For example, early versions of our prompt resulted in feedback that included words we thought to be too difficult for our students to comprehend. As part of iteratively engineering our prompt we decided to add the phrase using simple language to each request (see Appendix B) in order to get simplified wording in the output. Lastly, exposing students to AI-generated feedback may result in them turning to their own use of AI, which, if not used properly, can become a metaphorical linguistic crutch. There are several ways to avoid this, including having the writing done in class, as well as using AI detectors to review students' work, although these have demonstrated varying degrees of success (Alexander et al., 2023).

# 5 CONCLUSION

We suggest that teachers interested in using AI to generate written feedback for their students consider doing the following: (1) prepare specific prompts with care; (2) avoid enfeeblement by staying connected to students and their writing by reviewing each students' writing and the associated AI-generated feedback; (3) allow for opportunities for students to ask follow up questions; (4) be transparent about their use of AI in generating feedback; and 5) consider refining the feedback and including a signed statement at the end of the AI-generated feedback, such as "I have read through your writing and the AI-generated feedback. I have refined and approve of the feedback." While we have found AI to be a useful resource to increase our productivity in providing quality feedback, the needs of teachers and students differ across contexts. As such, we encourage other language educators to explore how generative AI can be utilized to meet their needs and the needs of their students in their respective contexts. Finally, sharing best practices locally and globally is essential for the language education community as we continue to grapple with how to leverage this new technology.

# A PPEND1X A: Sample student writing and GPT-4 generated feedback

# A.1 |Description of Assignment:

For this assignment students were expected to answer a prompt by writing a $^ { 3 0 0 + }$ word paragraph that includes a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a conclusion. Here is the writing prompt given to the students: Is having a good memory valued in your culture? Why or why not?

# A.2 Example Student Writing:

Having good memory is valued in culture. I still remember when my grandpa used to tell us how simple life was before technology came. Back then grandpa one of his hobbies with his friend is to play a guitar when the sunset comes and serenade through out the evening, He always told us that he wishes that he could turn back on the time when he's still young and go back to all the things that he loves before he passed away. My grandpa throughout his life always keeps telling stories in His day. As I get older, I was there are the things that I used to when I was a kid that right now, I can even do it again. For example, I liked to play with my friends throughout the day and I feel like I have infinite energy to do whatever I want, and it was a good feeling to remember. But right now, I feel like I'm exhausted every time and don't have the courage to do what I want. Memories are all thing that we can have after this life so why not treasure it and record it? So that in the generation to come they still remember you and tell your stories to your descendants.

# A.3 GPT-4 Generated Feedback:

Feedback on the quality of the topic sentence: The topic sentence "Having good memory is valued in culture' is a simple and direct statement. However, it could be more specific to clearly set the tone for the rest of the paragraph. Right now, it's unclear which culture you're referring to. You might specify the culture or provide more detail about how memory is valued. For a different topic, an improved topic sentence could be: "In many urban environments, public transportation plays a critical role in daily life.".

Feedback on the development of ideas throughout the paragraph: The paragraph develops the idea of the value of memory through personal stories and reflections. However, these stories seem to focus more on nostalgia and the past than on the importance of memory in your culture. When you use personal stories, remember to tie them back to the main idea. You might explain how these stories reflect the value your culture places on memory. For example, if storytelling is a common practice in your culture, how does this show the importance of memory?

Feedback on the academic quality of the language: The language used in this paragraph is more conversational than academic, which can make the paragraph seem less formal. For example, phrases like "I feel like I'm exhausted" and "why not treasure it and record it?" are more casual. More academic language might be "I often experience exhaustion" and \*it is important to cherish and document these experiences." Using more academic phrasing can make your argument seem more authoritative and persuasive.

Feedback on the transitional phrases: Transitional phrases help guide the reader through your ideas, but there are few used in this paragraph. Phrases like "For example," "But right now, and "So that' are used, but more could be added to help the flow of ideas. Consider phrases like "Furthermore," "In addition," or "As a result' to make the progression of your thoughts clearer.

Feedback on the use of sources and evidence: This paragraph relies on personal anecdotes and thoughts as evidence. While personal experiences can be powerful, they may not be enough to fully support your argument. You might consider incorporating external sources, such as cultural studies or societal observations, to further support your point about the value of memory in your culture.
