# ABSTRACT

Using both corpus and survey data, this study examines a hitherto uninvestigated issue: the use of the null article (i.e., the nonuse of the definite article the in referencing definite/specific nouns) in academic research writing. Specifically, the study consisted of three parts: a small corpus analysis of research articles (RAs) written by well published L1 English scholars in applied linguistics, a survey of members of the academic community, and a large corpus analysis of RA abstracts. Results of the study indicate that null article use is fairly common in RAs, but the number of nouns used with the null article is very limited, restricted to only three small groups of nouns commonly found in empirical studies involving human subjects. Furthermore, null article use is confined almost exclusively to the abstract, methodology, and results/discussion sections. Also, null article use is quite well accepted by members of the academic community across all ranks, ranging from well-published professors to instructors and graduate students. However, there are variations in null article use across-/within writers and across academic disciplinary divisions. Pedagogical and research implications are also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Articles (e.g., a/an and the) are an important part of the English language system, for they help enable speakers/writers of the language to make their meaning clear when referencing persons, objects, r ideas. However,articles are simultaneously very difficult for English language learners to grasp, epecially for those whose irt language does not have articles (Ionin & Montrul, 2010; Leroux & Kendal, 2018; Master, 1997, 203; Yo0, 2009; Y00 & Shin, 2020). As such, articles along with th lerning of article have long been and remained an important research topic in linguisics and English language teaching (e.g., Chesterman, 1991; Christophersen, 1939, Leroux & Kendall, 2018; Liu & Gleason, 2002; Liu & Lu, 2022; Master, 1990, 1995; Shin et al., 2018; Yoo, 2009; Yo0 & Shin, 2020). Yet, thus far, itleattention has been paid to one aspect of the English article systm, the nll article, i. the nonuse of the deinite article the in referencing a definite or specific referet. An example can be found in the following sentence from areseach article (RA): "Participants wre required to read a group f ntes , where the noun artcipants" i not preeded by the defte article, but it clearly refers specificlly to the participants in thestudy being decribed. This lack ofattention to null article use in academic writing is evidenced by Yoos (2009) finding that no student textboos on English grammar touched on this topic. More importantly, as we will show in this study, the existing diussion or dintion of th nl artice actually doe not cover the kind of nll article use frequently found in acadmic rarch writing. To fil this rearch gap, this stuy uss both corus and licited da  inetigato what extent the null article is used in academic research writing, in which sections of the RA it is used mostl, and if/how its use varies across academic disciplines and authors. The rest of the article is organized into the following sections: a review of relevant literature, a description of the research methods, data analyses, and results of the three parts of the study, and finally a conclusion.

# 2. A brief review of relevant literature and research purposes/questions

# 2.1. The English article system

In student English grammar boos (e.g., Azar, 1999, 2003; Greenbaum & Quirk, 1990; Huddleston et al., 2022; Leech & Svartvik, 2003), the English article system is generally described as consisting of two articles: the indefinite article $a / a n$ and the definite article the. In simple terms, the indefinite article i used befor singular count noun that ither references a nonspecific countable rferent e. 8., I need a watch) r generic countable referent (e.g., A tiger i a large canivore). The definite article, on the other hand, is used mostly before a noun (either singular or plural) that rferences a specific referent known to both the speaker/writer and the listener/reader involved (e.g,  really like the lcture that] we attended yesterday"), but it can also be used before a singular noun as a generic noun (e.g., The tiger is a large carnivore"). Hence, the difference between the two articles centers largely on whether the referent noun is specific or nonspecific to the two parties involved in acommunication context. However, it is imperative to note that this differentiation is not always simple and straighforward. In other words, research has shown that the differentiation betwen definiteness and indefiniteness is a complex matter requiring close book-length studies see Hawkins, 1978; Hewson, 1972; Lyons, 1999. Yet for lack of space and since it is not the main purpose of our study, we will not explore this isue further here.

In addition to where and when the definite and indefinite articles are used, student grammar textbooks oten also discuss when and where no article should be used before certain nouns, such as no indefinite article before a nonspecific noncount noun (Water is essential for lfe") or before a nonspecific plural noun (e.g., "Apples are my favorite fruit). Many comprehensive reference or pedagogical grammar boos (.g., Biber t al., 199; Larsen-Freeman & Celce-Murcia, 2016; Quirk et l., 1985 label such nonuse f an article before a noun as a zero article. According to these grammar books, the zero article use also covers the nonuse of the definite article the before a definite noun as shown in Simon Burns is [the] chairman of the appeal fund (Biber et al., p. 262). However, some linguists (.., Chesterman, 1991; Christophersen, 1939; Yotsukura, 1970) believe that there are two different types of ro articles, i. e., the nonuse of the should be differentiated from the nonuse of $a / a n$ because while the former indicates definiteness, the latter signifies indefiniteness. Hence, they argue that there are actually two different types of zero article: one $( \varnothing _ { 1 } )$ that appears before indefinite nouns (typically mass or noncount nouns or plural nouns) and one $( \emptyset _ { 2 } )$ that is used before definite nouns (typically "singular proper nouns and some singular count nouns") (Chesterman, 1991, p. 2). To help clearly and explicitly distinguish the two zero article types, Chesterman (1991) names the latter $( \emptyset _ { 2 } )$ null article, a practice that has been embraced by some applied linguists, such as Master (1997, 2003) and Yoo (2009), and which is also adopted in this study.

# 2.2. The null article: its use and function

Based on Chesterman's (1991) and Master's (1997, 2003) analyses, the null artcle is used with the following types of singular nouns listd in Table 1 adapted from Master (2003) but llutrated with example taken from Davies (2008-) Corpus of Contemporary American English (C0cA). According to Chesterman (1991), in the English article system, the null article and the zero article are at the two ends of a continum scale of definiteness, with the null article being the most definite while the zero article being the most in. definite as shown in Fig. 1 adapted from Chesterman (1991, p. 182). Our adaptation consisted of the removal, from this continum scale, the word some, which Chesterman included as part of the English article system placed between zero and a on the scale (i. being presented as the second most indefinite article). This removal of some was based on the prevalent practice in existing grammar books and student textbooks, but i must be noted that, beides Chesterman, some other linguist (e.g., Lyons, 199) also consider some

to be an article.

It is also very important to note that this study does not deal with null article use before proper nouns and set phrases for the following reasons. Firs, as Master (1997, p. 223) explains, the null article use before such nouns and phraes has a unique ut complex rule (e.g., the null artice is used before parks and lakes, such as Lake Tahoe, but the is used before rivers like the Misssppi River. Second, the nll article before most proper nouns incuding names of individuals and many places is usually obligatory, .., we cannot use the before them. For example, we cannot say \*the Chicago or \*the President Biden. On the other hand, the null article before non-proper nouns is often optional. For instance, for the examples Thanks for lunch" and \*Father and son were both wounded in Table 1, one can also say \*Thanks for the lunch' and \*The father and the son were both wounded. Of course, as we will show in the results of the study, when to opt for the null article or the before non-proper nouns depends on context and other factors.

Regarding why the null article is considered more definite than the, Chesterman (1991) and Master (1997, 2003) provide a convincing explanation based on the ollowing two interrelated perspectives or theories: 1) discourse participants familiarity with the referent in question (proposed by Christophersen, 1939) and 2) their locus in relation to the referent (posited by Allen & Hill 1979) The event/place/time relate examples in Table 1 can help best illstrate this explanatio. Let us first lok at the utterance Thanks for lunch. This utterance is tpically made right afe the lunch in questio. This s beause the onger th time has passed since th unch the lesslikely, the speaker will use this utterance; insted, the speaker may more likely say Thanks for the lunch r Thanks for the lunch yesterday/last week" if uttered the next day/week rather than \*Thans for lunch because the lunch was no longer close and hence les "familir." The utterance \*We wil review it next week" provides an even clearer example. This is because "'next week" without the definite article the refersto the week immediately ater the current week when the utterance is made. On the other hand, the next week" as in They met the next week" refers to the week after a time in the past that was referenced. In other words, "next week'"i in reference t now and here (which is closer and more familiar) whereas the next week" is in referenceto then and there" (which is farther away and les familiar. In short acording to Allen and Hll (1979), the null article is used when the speaker and listener are in the coding locus (i.e., the coding temporal/spatial location) enjoying the insider's view" whereas the is used when the speaker and listener are in the predicated locus having only the "outsider's view.

While such a delineation of the use of the null articleisinformative and quite comprehensive, it has, unfortunately, let out the use f the null article before plural count nouns, for, as noted above, Chestman (1991, p. 2) posits that the null article i used only before singular proper nouns and some singular count nouns, a point also supported by Master (1997 p.223; 2003, p. 4). However, as will be shown in this study, speakers/writers actually do use the null article before specific plural nouns, especiall in academic research writing. Below are examples from four diffrent RAs published in leading applied linguistics journals by well-published L1 English authors. For brevity purpose, we omitted some words in each example that were nonessential for understanding it use of the null article. The underlined nouns are each preceded by the null article symbolized by the $\mathbf { { \boldsymbol { \phi } } } _ { 2 }$ sign.

1. "The current study investigated the spoken output of English L2 learners ... $\mathbf { { \boldsymbol { \phi } } } _ { 2 }$ Results demonstrated that $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { { \delta } } } } _ { 2 }$ lower level L2 learners produced more ..." (Crossley et al., 2019, p. 721)   
2. ${ \ " } \partial _ { 2 }$ Subjects were tested individually. They were assgned one or other version of the SM task ...Following the SM task, $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { { \delta } } } } _ { 2 }$ subjects took the written GJ task."' (Duffield & White, 1999, p. 144).   
3. "Experiment 1 required about $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in total. For Study Phase 1, $\mathrm { { \Phi } } \mathrm { { } } \mathbf { { \Lambda } } \times \mathrm { { \Lambda } } \times \mathrm { { \Lambda } } \times$ participants were instructed to listen carefully while following the sentence items on the study sheet ..." (Pennington & Ellis, 2000, p. 380)   
4. \*Although sensitivity to test-taker accents seemed to occur naturally in the rating process, $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { { \delta } } } _ { 2 }$ findings suggest that when raters have learned or know ..." (Winke & Gass, 2012, p. 762)

Clearly, the underlined nouns are each a count noun referencing a definite referent (often in the plural form, e.g., findings, items participants, and results) in the research study being reported by is author(s). For instance, \*results" in Example 1 were the results of the authors' \*current study" while "participants" in Example 3 were the participants in Experiment 1 of the authors' reported study. For this reason, the authors could certainly have used the definite article the for each of the definite plural nouns. What motivated the authors opt for the nl article in these cases, we ague, was the forementioned notion of familiarit/coding lous. This is because, to both the authors and the readers, the null article-governed noun in each case was clearly referencing things in the study being discussed by the authors. In other words, in using the nul article, the authors were able to assume that heir readers knew which specific referent was being referenced.

# 2.3. Research purposes and questions

Given that there has been no research on nullaticle use thus far and that previous research has repeatedly shown that L2 learners including advanced learners, have difficulty with the use of the definte article, often displaying both overuse and underuse problems (Liu & Gleason, 2002; Master, 1995, 1997; Shi t l., 2018; Y00 & Shin, 2020) it is hus of both interest and importance to investigate the extent and contexts of this typf nl article se fined as he nonuse of the deinite article the efore  noun or noun phrase that references a specific or definite referent in a study being reported on. Specificlly, this study aims to answer the following research

questions:

1. What are the typical nouns used with the null article in RAs?   
2. In which sections of the RA is the null article used most frequently?   
3. What are academic research professionals' attitudes towards null article use?   
4. What is the extent of null article use in RAs?   
5. Does null article use vary significantly across academic disciplines?

# 3. The present study

To gain a sound understanding of null article use in academic research writing, this study includes the following three parts, with each part designed to answer one or two of the above research questions: i) a close manual examination of asmall corpus of eight published RAs in full to obtain a preliminary understanding of the typical nouns that may be used with the nll artce and of the sections of the  whre the null articl is usully used (to aswer rearch Questions 1 and 2), i) a urve f aadmic rearchers and English intructors to understand their atitude towards nullartile us (to answer Question 3), and ii) a large corpus analysis of RA abstracts to determine to what extent the null article i used and whether there is a significant variation of is use across major aca demic disciplines (to answer Questions 4 and 5). Our reason for analyzing RA abstracts rather than entire RAs was that, as willbe shown below, the identification of instances or tokens of null article use involves manual coding and is hence labor intensive and mentall taxing. In other words, a large corpus analys of full RAs is beyond the scope and ability of this study while a large corpus analysis of RA abstracts can stil provide valuable and valid findings. It is important to mention that because the survey item selection in Part 2 and the corus query item selection in Part 3 of the study deended on the results of the first part of the study (i. the smal corpus analysis, we wil irst preent the ntire Part f the study, inuding not ony its methodoogy ut als ts daa analysis, reults, and discussion, before we move onto the entire Part 2 and Part 3.

# 3.1. Examination of a small corpus of RAs

# 3.1.1. Method and procedure

As a preliminary exploration and because of the intensive close reading required, a small corpus of eight full RAs was compiled with the RAs selected from eight derent leading journals i applied linguistics with a focus n language acquisition/learning information of the articles provided in Table 2). These RAs each met the following selection critri that we adopted: 1) it was an empirical study, 2) it was authored by well-published L1 English authors, and 3) it was published in the last 25 years (to ensure its contemporariness). In fact, as shown in Table 2, most of the authors of the elected articles are renowned scholars in applied linguistics and all the eight journals included are highly ranked in the 2022 impact-factor ranking of journals in lingustics in Web of Science's Social Science Citation Index, i.e, sScI. Our rationale for including only empirical RAs was that our observations and preliminary informal research showed that the null article was used mainly in such articles. Our reason for icluding RAs authored by well-published L1 English authors was that their writing might be considered the most representative of the established mainstream RA writing in terms of Ianguage use. It is also important to note that two of the eight included journals, Computer Assted Language Learning (CALL) and Journal of Second Language Writing (JsLw), diffr from the other six in that they are each devoted to a specific area of applied linguistics. We included these wo specialized journals to help ensure a more diverse content range of the journal articles being examined, and our rationale for selecting these two specific specialized journals was that they each enjoy a top five impact-factor ranking (ranked 4th and 5th respectively) in the 2022 sscI impactor-factor ranking of journals in linguistics.

Then, based on the defintion of the null article mentioned above, i., the nonuse of the definite article the in referencing a definte noun or noun phase, the first two author collectively read through each of theeght RAs closely to identif the null article tokens (i. instances) in the noun phrases in these RAs. In the process, we excluded nouns i section headings/tables/figures and those in quo tations because the former are gnerally used without articles and the ltter are not actually the article authors own words. ur reason for using this manual idntfication method was that, to our knowledge, this was the first ever study on null article use in RAs or in any speech and writing. In other words, no prior knowledge was available about the patterns of nul article use e.g., with what nouns the null article may be used and in which ections of the RAit typically aears and hence there was no established useful machine corpus query procedures and technique. Of course, ater this study, i.e, with the patterns of ull article use found in this study (reported below), future analysis can become more automated by using, for example, part-of-speech tagging followed by pattern matching

Our identification process went rather smoothly. The only noun tokens that presented some difficulties were those used with the zero article, rather than the null article. If we recall, both the zero $( \emptyset _ { 1 } )$ and null $( \emptyset _ { 2 } )$ articles refer to nonuse of articles, but the former is. the nonuse of the indefinite article efore an indefinit oun whil the atter i the nonuse of the definite article efore efinite noun. Here is an example of azero-article use (before the word \*reuts) . hose [tudies] that used trained raers, thus producing results that are most generalizable to language testing situations .. (Winke & Gass, 2012, p. 767). In this example, the authors were discussing the type of tudies that use trained raters" and which produce \*reults that ae generalizable to language testing situations" i. e., the authors wr refrcin eults fa tye of stdis in gral rather than the reults of spcific stdes. The fllowing is perhaps an even clearer example taken from the academic sub-corpus of COcA: "Results from very large samples reduce the influence of sampling error, where the authors were referencing results from studies with large samples' in general, rather than from some specific studies. In both examples, "results is an indefinite noun. We had some discussons about zero article tokens during the identification process and made sure that we did not include zero articl uses as null article tokens. Finally, to help answer research Question 2, we also coded, for each null article token, the section of the RA in which it occurred, including the abstract, introduction/literature review, methodology, results/discussion, and conclusion.

# 3.1.2. Data analysis, results, and discussion

To begin with, it is necessary to note that the results should be interpreted with caution because of the small size of this corpus composed of just eight RAs from applied inguistics only. A total of 210 tokens f the nullarticle used with 12 diffrent nouns were identified in the eight RAs. The results are presented in Table 3, including the 12 nouns used with the null article and their frequency distributions across the eight RAs. The nouns included in the other" column are those that were used in only two of the eight RA, ., they had a low dispersion.

The first and most important finding here is that the number of nouns that were used with the null article in RAs is very limited. restricted to only thre small groups of nouns commonly found in empirical studies involving human subjects: 1) those referring to research participants incding partcnts, subjets, instructors, lers, raters, stdnts, and spkers with the later fie likely used only in applied linguistics and education while other participant nouns specific to other research fields may also be used, such as patients and physicians in medicine), 2) those pertaining to research participants' performance (including accuracies, erors, performances, and responses), and 3) those related to research results (including results, findings, analysis, and data).

Another finding is that null article use varied noticeably acros both the nouns and RAs. For example, in terms of variation across nouns, while ticiants boste 68 otl tokens, occurring acos a eight RAs, findng rstered only 7 tl okens pperng across just four of the RAs. Difference in reeach topics appeared to hae been a rason for this variation. For instance, the topic ofWinke and Gass (2012)'s study was the influence of second language experience and accent familiarit on raters' oral proficiency rating; as a result, the noun raters was usd wth the ll article 16 time n reerring to the sific ratr in the study or in the tude riewed. In contrast, raters was used only once in the remaining seven articles (in Ellis 206) and, equally importantly, it was not used with the null articl. In terms of variation across RAs or authors, whereas Jackson (2008) had 5 total null article tokens, Hyland (2013) and Poole (2022) each used merely two. This finding sems to suggest that writers use of the nullarticle varies substantially.

The distributions of the total 210 null article tokens and their normalized (er 100 words frequencies aross the sections of the RAs are shown in Table 4. It is cer from the table that in raw frequency, the Method and Results/Discussion sections were where the null article was used most followed by the Abstract section and then the Introduction/Literature Review section. Yet, in normalized frequency, the abstract section boasted by far the highest rate,followed by the Method and Results/Discusson sections. These three sections also enjoy the widest dispersion of nll article use across the eight RAs with its use found in 6 or 7 of them. In contrast, nul article use is rare in the Intoduction/Literatre review and Conclusion sections, a finding that we would expect beause it is much les likely for aors toss te sifis of thr ste in the stons. n short, the ets indicate tht  article e s conined almost exclusively to the Abstract, Method, and Results/Discussion sections.

One other intresting finding is that there was also some within-author variation in null article use, i.e., an author used the null article in referencing a specific referent in one place but used the in another or vice versa. Here are two examples:

5. ".. the results suggest that $\underline { { \boldsymbol { \theta } } } _ { 2 }$ L2 learners are not 'stuck' with the feature values of the L1; the L2 learners do not treat infinitival constructions as having a weak V-feature, even though the L1s (French and English) do" (Duffeld & White, 1999, p. 155). 6. ${ \ " } \partial _ { 2 }$ Participants were assigned to the intermediate L2 speaker group if .... $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { { \delta } } } } _ { 2 }$ Participants who scored 20 or more points ... were assigned to the advanced L2 speaker group. The participants also completed a vocabulary task to measure their knowledge of the words ..." (Jackson, 2008, p. 885).

In Example 5, the authors were clearly talking about the2 leaners in their tudy, but they first used the nul artice and then the in the next clause. The same practice is also shown in Example 6. However, such inconsistency or variation in null aticle use is fully understandable if we reallthat in any instance f the nl article, the se of the i aso allowd beause ther of the two isrerring to a definite/specific referent.

Then, how can we account for such within-writr and the aforementioned cross-writer variations in null articl use? One possible reason might be individual preference, which could partl explain the large variation in the total number of null atcl uses acrossthe eight RAs (ranging from 2 to 55). Diffrences in research topics might also explain some of the variations. One more possible explanation might be the difference in RA writers perceived level of familiart of the referent in question to the reader since authors are more likely to opt for the nullarticl if the referent is considered better known or more familiar to the reader in the discourse context. However, to gain a comprehensive valid understanding of the motivations behind the variations will require empirical research on RA authors' decision-making in specific instances of null article use via think-aloud verbal protocols, interviews, and/or surveys, something that we plan to do in our future research.

Stiland more importantly, it i necessary to point out and emphasize that these cross-/within-writer variations do not suggest that null article use in RAs is a matte of free variation with any nouns or in any context. On the contrary, there are specific pattern-based rules for its use according to the reults from the analysis of the eght RAs reported above. Specificall, the number of nouns used with the null article is very limited, restricted to only thee small groups of nouns: 1) those referring to research participants, 2) those pertaining to rearch participants peformance-related things, and 3) those relate to rearch reults. Furthermore, null article use is confined almost exclusively to the abstract, methodology, and results/discussion sections. These patern-based rules have important pedagogical implications, which we will discuss in the \*pedagogical implications" subsection of the conclusion section.

# 3.2. Survey

# 3.2.1. Instrument and procedure

We first developed a survey with 3 demographic questions and 15 questions regarding null article use (provided as Supplementary Material A). Specifically, the three demographic questions were respectively about the participants' native language (two choices: English or Other language), field of study (two choice: Applied Linguistics/Education/Social Science or Natural Science/Engineering/ Medicine), and academic position (four choices: university faculty member/researcher, instructor/teacher, doctoral student, and master's student). The native language question was included because, in this study, we were interested in only L1 English speakers attitude and opinions. This is because research has repeatedy shown that article use is extremely challenging for 2 English speakers/ writers, even for those at an adanced level (.g., Lroux & Kendall, 2018; Liu & Lu, 2022; Master, 997, 2003; Shin et al., 2018; Yoo, 2009; Yoo & Shin, 2020). Hence, an inclusion of L2 writers might create a potential confounding variable (but we plan to include L2 English writers in future research on this topic). The question about the participants' academic positions was intended only to un. derstand their research and publication experience because university faculty members/researchers generall have more experience in research and publication than teachers and graduate students.

Each of the 15 null article questions contained asentence or a short passage in which one nullarticle use was marked. Participants were asked to rate the cetability of its use based on 1-5 Likert scl. All the sentences and passages used in the survey came from four of the eight RAs used in the small RA corpus examination discussed above. It is necessary to note that in some of the question sentences there were more than one null articleuse, but only one was marked. Our reason for doing so was that it allowed us to have more different sentences and contexts without including to many nullarticl items in the survey that would make the survey require too much time tocomplete. The survey was sent, via mail or alink, to 48 of the first authors colleagues and other contacts working in academia, including thee f the authors of three of the eight RAs used in the small corpus analysis.? Out of the 48 contacted, 27 (including two of the three RA authors) completed the survey, i.e., a total of 27 completed surveys were received.

# 3.2.2. Data analysis, results, and discussion

Regarding the three demographic questions, the participants' answers show that all the 27 $. 1 0 0 \%$ participants were L1 English speakers; 26 $( 9 6 . 3 \% )$ of the participants were working in education/applied linguistics/social science with only one working in natural science/medicine; and 22 $( 8 1 . 4 8 \% )$ were university faculty member/researchers with only 3 $( 1 1 . 1 1 \% )$ being English instructors/ teachers and 2 $( 7 . 4 1 \% )$ being graduate students (one doctoral and one master student).

The detailed results of the participants' answers to the 15 null article questions are presented in a large table as Supplementary Material B. This large table contains allthe participants' answersto each of the 15 questions along with the calculated mean scores for individual questions and individual participants as well as the group mean statistics for both questions and participants, including mean range and standard deviation. The group mean statistics are summarized in Table 5 and the distributions of the mean score ranges are illustrated in the pie charts A and B in Fig. 2 below to help highlight the main results of the survey.

The group mean results in Table 5 show that while there was variation in the participants' response across both questions and participants the cross-item variation indicated by a mean range of 1.56 and an SD of 0.46) was substantially smaller than the crosparticipant variation (marked by a range of 3.3 and an SD of 0.89). More specifically the question items mean score range indicates that the mean scores for all the questions were between 4.56 (the highest score for Question 4) and 3 (for Question 9). Furthermore, only three questions' mean scores ( $2 0 \%$ of the 15 questions shown in Chart B in Fig. 2) fell below 3.67 (3.33 for Question 7, 3 for Question 9, and 3.3 for Question 12), a core range stil slightl higher than a position of being neutral (3). This fat together with the overall mean score 3.94, indicates that 12 $( 8 0 \% )$ of the 15 questions were rated in the fairly to completely acceptable range. In contrast, the participants mean scores range shows that the highest mean score was 5 (for two participants) and the lowest individual mean score was only 1.67 (for one participant).Clearly, the response variation across the participants was much higher than that across the questions.

However, with the overall crossparticipant mean score also being 3.94 and a standard deviation being 0.89 (not really a very large one considering the ull score being 5), acloser examinatio of the variations across participants suggests that the larger variation was the result of a few low scores as evidenced by the fact that there were only five participants $( 1 9 \% )$ whose mean scores were below 3. As shown in Chart A of Fig. 2, the remaining participants $( 8 0 \% )$ all had a mean score between 3.07 and 5, with twenty-two percent having a score in the 3.07-3.8 range, twenty-six percent showing a score in the 4.0-4.47 range, and thirty-three percent (the largest group) boasting a score between 4.57 and 5. Furthermore, of the five participants with a mean score under 3, four had a mean score between 2.6 and 2.87 with only one below 2. In other words, excet for the one participant with a score below 2, the remaining four had a mean close to 3, indicating that they were quit neutral on the 15 null use tokens, i., they would accept either the use of the null article or the definte artice the. In short, the results demonstrate that while the participants overall found null article use acceptable in RAs, there was variation across the participants in the degree of their acceptance.

One may wonder whether the participants' academic field and publication experience were factors influencing their survey an. swers. As noted above, all except one of the 27 participants were working in applied linguistics/social science and 22 $( 8 1 . 4 8 \% )$ were university faculty members/researchers. Hence, the number of participants in natural science/medicine and the number of instructors and graduat students were too small for their response to be representative or reliable. Stil, i may be of some interest to report that the sole natural science participant's mean score for the 15 questions was 2.6 (one of the five below 3 mean scores) while the three instructors mean scores were 4.47, 2.73, and 4.13 respectively and the two graduate students were 4.87 and 4.53 respectively. In other words, whereas the sole natural science participant's mean score was noticeably lower than the group's overall mean of 3.94,the instructors and the graduate students mean scores wereall above the group mean. These results could suggest that there might be a difference between natural and social sciences in null article use (something that the large corpus analysis of RA astracts below would help test), but no noticeable difference across university faculty members, teachers, and graduate students.

A final point worth noting is that quite a few of the participants commented in their emails that they found the use of the null article in RAs an interesting topic but simultaneously a topic of which they had not been aware until they did the survey. For example, one participant (an author who published one of theight articles used in the smallcorpus analysis) wrote, Inteesting urvey. I have never really thought about the use of null articles in academic method and results sections." Another participant, a senior professor and seasoned researcher, stated, \*Your current study is very interesting (of course!) and concerns something that hadn't ever occurred to me! In short, the survey results also confirm that null article use in research writing has not been studied thus far.

# 3.3. Analysis of a large corpus of RA abstracts

# 3.3.1. Corpus and search procedure

Because the purpose of the corpus analysis of RA abstracts was to investigate whether and how the use of the nullaticle varies across academic disciplines, a balanced corpus of 2o,o0o RA abstract (boasting nearly five million words) was built by obtaining abstracts from the journal articl database PLOs ONE (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/ using Laurence Anthony's (2021) corpus generation tool AntCorGen (https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antcorgen/). More specificall, we obtained 500 abstracts from each of the following four academic discipline divisions: social science, natural science, medicine/biology, and engineering/ technology. The social science sub-corpus included disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, psychology, sociology, etc. The natural science sub-corpus consisted of chemistry, material science, physics, etc. The medicine/biology sub-corpus also included health science and ife cience. Our rationale for incuding three hard science divisions, but n humanities (which also happen to be not included in the PLs ONE datase), was that most RAs in hard science are mpirical studies where as shown above, the nll article is used most frequently. On the other hand, RAs in humanities, such as arts and literature, often do not involve empirical data analysis. Detailed information about the corpus is presented in Table 6 below.

Then, we queried and retrieved al the tokens of the following four nouns that our small corpus examination found to be ften used with the null article: participants, subects, result, and findings. We did not include learners and speakers, the other two nouns that were also found to be frequenly used with the nl article in the mall corpus. Thi is because, ulike the former four nouns, hich are words used in RAs across almost all academic divisions, learners and speakers occur mostly in aplied linguistics and education, i.e, they are rarely used in the three hard science divisions.

Afer al the tokens of the four nouns were retrieved from the abstract corpus, we imported them into Excel and then annotated each token with one of the following codes: 1) a noun used with the nullartice, which consisted of two subcategories with 1a being a noun used with the null article without a postnominal modifier, (ee Examples 7 and 8) and 1b being a noun used with the nullartice along with a postnominal modifier (Examples 9 and 10); 2)anoun used with adeterminer, which also has two subcategories with 2a being a noun used with the definite the e., Th results show.. and 2b being a noun used with a determiner other than the such as our, their, and many (e.g., our/many/Smith's reuls show ..) and 3) anoun used with the zero article, whose use already decribed clearly above in both the literature review (Section 2.1) and the methodology subsection in the small corpus analysis (Section 3.1.1)

# 3.3.2. Data analysis, results, and discussion

Since the focus of this study is on the extent of the use of the null article in RAs, when tabulating and analyzing the results, we computed the frequency of only the three main categories (i. 1. null atice, 2. the/ther definitive determiner, and 3. zero article) without separately counting those of the subcategories, e.g., not tabulating 1a and 1b separately since both were instances of nul article use. The frequencies of the nouns used in the three categories across the four academic divisions are reported in Part A of Table 7. Because the number of tokens of the nouns varied substantially across the four nouns and the four academic sub-corpora as can be seen in Part A of Table 7, we also computed the percentages or proportions of the three categories to help make the comparisons across the nouns and academic dvision more valid and easier to understand. The percentage results are resented in Part of Table 7.

The results in Table 7 show noticeable variations in several aspects. First, the overall tokens or frequencies of the nouns in the abstract corpus varied substantilly acros the four nouns and academic divisions. Of the four nouns, reults boasted the highest total frequency (8,650), fllowed by findings (3,186). More importantly, the frequency of rsuls was more than four times that (1,910) of subjects, the noun with the lowest frequency. The substantially higher frequency of results and findings is understandable, though, beauseall empirical studies ned to reort resuts, ut not allstudies may incude participants and subject. In terms of cross-division variation, social science had the highest total number of noun tokens (5,710), which almost doubled natural science's 2,851, the lowest inthe four divisions. Furthermore, the null article use was noticeably consistently more in social science across the four nouns. Second and more importantl, there was aso aparent variation in the thre article use categories across the four nouns and the four academic divisions both in raw frequency and proportion. For example, in nullartice use, whil particpants boasted the highest raw frequency and proportion, findg rster the owest. As anthr example, of the thre article use catgories, the zro-artice us had y far the lowest frequency, one that was extremely miniscule across allfour academic divisions with not a single token for participants.

To help determine whether the variations were statisticall significant, we conducted a hierarchical configural frequency analysis (HCFA) of the frequencies of the first two article uses, i.e, nllvs. the/other determiners. We excluded zero-article use because of its extremely low frequency, which, if included, would undoubtedly result in very high statisically significant difference even if there were no significant difference betwen the first two use categories. In other words, its inclusion would unduly affect the reults of the HCFA test. We decided to conduct an HCFA test, rather than a Chi-square test, because HCFA is a more powerful and yields more informative results than the Chi-square test in that, in addition to producing a Chi-square value indicating whether there is an overal difference in the frequency distributions of the variables in a contingency table, it also determines which frequency cell in the contingency table are statistically significantly higher than expected and which ones are significantly lower than expected.

The detailed HCFA results including Chi-quare values, raw/expected frequencies, and significance levels, are included in a table as Supplementary Material C. The common simplified reporting of the HCFA test results in acontingency table is as follows: a frequency cell that is significantl higher than expected is labelled a Type (T) while a frequency cell significantly lower than expected is an Antitype (A). Afrequency cell without either T or A is hence not significantly higher or ower than expected. The results of the two article uses of the four nouns across the four academic divisions are presented in Table 8 where ull article use i abbreviated as "null" and the use of the/other determiners is abbreviated as \*the/det' for simplicity purposes.

As shown by the HCFA results in Table 8, of the four nouns, participants and subjects were used significantly more with the nul article thn us ad indn. Thi is bse ul tice seor bh prics and suect s  e acoss al aic dvisions except for participants null article use innatural science and subjects null article use in engineering/technology. Furthermore, even in the latter two cases, the nullaticle use was not an antitype (i., its frequency was not lower than expected but as expected). In contrast, null article use for both results and findings was an anttype acros al four academic divisions. One may wonder why the/det use was also an antitype or resuls and findins in social science and medicie/biology, i., why both nllaticl and the/et uses were antitypes in social science and medicine/biology simultaneously. To answer this question, we need to recall that the HCFA test takes into consideration the totl frequencies ofall the variables (the nouns and the academic divisions in thi study) and thir frequencies in all the cell. As noted earlier, social science and medicine/technology had the highest and the second highest total number of tokens among the four nouns. Yet, in the/det use of rsults, the social science's and the medicine/biology's numbers of tokens (2045 and 1582 respectively) were lower than that (2,161) of engineering/technology, a division which had a lower overall number of tokens of the four nouns than the former two.

# 4. Conclusion

# 4.1. Summary of the main findings

Via a small corpus analysi of full RAs, asurvey of members in academia, and a large corpus analysis of RA abstracts, this study has yielded the following important findins regarding null article use. First the null article is inded used fairly ften in RAs, but the number of nouns used wth the nl article is ery limte, retricted tooly thre small groups of nouns: 1) those referring to research participants, 2) those pertaining to participants' performance, and 3) those related to research results. Second, nullaticle use is confined almost exclusively to the abstract, methodology, and reults/icussion sections. Third, there are variations in nl articleuse across/within writers and across academic disciplinary divisions as well as some variations among members of academia about the acceptability of nll article use as shown in the survey results. However, despite these variations, when viewed together, th overal results indicate that nll article use is a ractice governed by the pattern-based rules found in the resuts of the study reported above, rather than a matter of free variation.

# 4.2. Pedagogical implications

Given the fairly common use of the null article in RAs and its largely rule-governed nature (despite some cross/within author variations) as well as the serious diffculty that research has shown learner face in learning the use of the definite article, more coverage of null article use, especially its pattern-based usage rules, should be provided in both student grammar and reference grammar books and in EAP writing courses considering especiall that the topic has been left out entirely in existing student grammar and writing textbooks (Yoo, 2009). EAP writing instructors should also be made aware of null article use and its pattern-based rules. Considering that previous research has found both overuse and underuse f the definite article the, correctly understanding null article use willenable AP witing instructors and students todifferentiat it use i., a pemissible nonuse of th with crtain definite nouns in restricted contexts) from erroneous or impermissible omissions of the, hence helping L2 EAP writers to avoid both overuse and underuse of this article simultaneously.

In actual teaching, EAP instructors can first inroduce to students the null article concept by using specific examples from RAs, provide a clear definition, and discuss its function and, most importntly, its usage rules. After students have gained a basic understanding of ull article use, instructor can have students seach and identify tokens of the nullarticl in one or two Rs or in a corpus via corpus query procedures. In teaching the pattern-based rules for null article use to EAP writing students, instructors should also emphasize to them that nouns not in the three small groups generally canot be used with the nll article and ull article use usual does not ocur in the inroduction, literature review, and conclusin section. This is because it is pivotal for EAP writing students to understand not only where, when, and with what nouns the null article is used or permitted but also, and more importantl, where, when, and with what nouns itis not allowed so they will be beter able to avoid both overuse and underuse problems in the use of the article the.

# 4.3. Limitations and future research

There are a few limitations with the present study and hence future reearch studies are needed to address the issues resultin from the limitations. First, the RAs examined in the small corpus analysis were all those in applied linguisics. Although the large corpus analysis of RA abstracts included publications from four diffrent discipline divisions, they were just one section of the RA. Future research may need to examine full RAs from various main academic divisions. Survey studies on this topic should include more members of academia from a variety of disciplines, especially from engineering and natural sciences since the survey in this study included only one natural scientist. Second, this study, including its survey (which only asked the participants to judge the accept. ability of ll article uses), did not investigate the motivations behind the cross/within-thor variations in null article use. Researchis thus needed to empiriclly examine this sse by using think-aloud protocols, interviews, and/or surveys that will ask writers to explain their nll article use decisions. Third the small corpus analysis in this study focused eclusively on RAs written by L1 English writers and the survey also included only L1 English-speaking members of academia. Future studies should also examine L2 writers' use and understanding of the null article in RAs to identify whether and what pecific areas of instruction or help that L2 writers may need in order to successfully grasp null article use and the use of the definite article in RA writing in general.

# Notes

1. It is necessay tonote that there are ther factors governing where and when to use \*next .." or \*the nex .." and their respective functions and meanings. For more information about this issue, see Yoo (2007, 2009).   
2. To save participants' time, when the survey was sent to those whose information about the three demographic questions was known, these three questions were not included.   
3. It is imperative to note that although the distinction between 1a and 1b was not necessar for the purpose of data analysis in this study, it is, however, important for pedagogical purposes and for the next phase of our research involving L2 writers' RAs.
