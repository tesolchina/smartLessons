# Abstract

The language in which to publish is a complex issue for academics in Poland. With the growth of English as the global lingua franca it may appear to be the obvious language of choice. Yet, publishing in English inevitably brings with it linguistic challenges. It also raises concerns of a social and ideological nature. Choosing to publish in Polish may be more straightforward for most academics, but at the same time it limits the accessibility of the research to a much more confined readership. This paper provides some background information on the current situation of academic publishing in Poland. It then reports the results of a survey of academics from the fields of applied linguistics and foreign language studies, psychology and medicine which set out to determine Polish academics’ attitude towards and experiences of publishing their research. It looks at the issue of language choice and the perceived advantages and difficulties experienced as a result of selecting one or other language. The findings suggest that although many Polish academics face similar difficulties to those reported elsewhere when writing in English, the decision as to which language to publish in is complex. There appears to be a tension between becoming recognized in the wider academic world which has access to academic literature in English, and the need to publish in Polish, thus making one’s work better known locally and resisting the total dominance of English.

# 1. Introduction

The common adage ‘publish or perish’ circulates in academic environments irrespective of their language, domain of knowledge or local conditions for research. Today it has acquired a new meaning arising from a growing interest in issues relating to the language of academic publications, and, in particular, the role of English as the academic lingua franca. The dominance of English, however, cannot be seen ‘simply’ as a choice of language. It is rather the result of a complex and multifaceted process of decision making, shaped by social actions, practices, ideologies and the resources available to those who wish to publish.

The dominance of English as the academic lingua franca has emerged at a time of notable changes in language use and style. Fairclough (1995), for example, draws attention to the technologization of language in social institutions and the conversationalization of styles; Benwell and Stokoe (2006) discuss the commodification of all discourses. Such changes have not been equally accepted by all academic communities. In traditional academic environments where research continues to be perceived as an elitist activity and academic communications the purview of the few, there appears to be a tension between maintaining traditional values and accepting newly emerging ideologies. Poland is a country where such a tension is evident. Recent social and communication changes have been radical (see the next section for more detail), dividing academics as well as society at large.

There is little doubt that the use of English for international communication can facilitate networking and the exchange of ideas among academics. Yet, the choice of which language to publish in is often not a straightforward one. On one hand, publishing in English is a way to gain international recognition. On the other, non-native speakers may face numerous linguistic, formal, organizational and ideological barriers which may influence their decision to look to the local market for publishing opportunities. (For an account of one academic’s experiences in getting published and the barriers he had to overcome, see Flowerdew, 2000). In any debate concerning English as the lingua franca of publication, therefore, it is necessary to take into account the nature of the barriers that academics are likely to encounter.

Much of the initial research in the 1980s and early 1990s exploring potential barriers in academic communication focused on contrastive rhetorical analyses. It explored cultural patterns in texts, particularly in written texts. As a result, ample evidence was collected on the nature of the differences that exist between different languages, linking these to intellectual traditions, cultural value systems and structural conditions of particular language systems. The literature in this area is all too well known to recall here. It should be emphasized, though, that such descriptions were used to presuppose difficulties that writers would have when switching between languages and intellectual styles.

Early attention to preferred style markers and intellectual values gave way to critical discussions of academic communities influenced by social debates about globalization and localization. Today the scope of interest has broadened widely to include issues going beyond language and academic ideologies, tending to language-external factors, such as lack of access to up-to-date publications and technologies or insufficient funds to carry out ground-breaking research. Publications have largely focused on data collected from Asia (see, for example, Canagarajah, 2002; Flowerdew, 1999), and much less has been heard from the Central/Eastern European perspective (see however the next section). It stands to reason, however, that potential authors in this region may face similar problems of under-funding of research and technological limitations. This is, for instance, what follows from a study carried out by Sahakyan (2006) at the American University of Armenia, who found that Armenian scholars do face many of the same difficulties in having articles accepted in international journals as those identified by Canagarajah (2002). Sahakyan’s work is relevant also in that it challenges Swales’ (2004) claim that success in terms of getting published is determined by experience, with SRs (more experienced senior researchers) being more successful than JRs (less experienced junior researchers). In Sahakyan’s study JRs appeared to be more proficient in English, more flexible and more willing to move away from using Russian and therefore equally or more likely to be successful in getting published in English-medium international periodicals.

Another factor affecting the scope of research into writing for publication is the growing interdisciplinarity of research in general coupled with its side effects: the development of mixed competences and hybridized languages of science. Whereas early claims on cultural patterns in academic texts paid little attention to differences in style that could follow from disciplinary or methodological proclivities of research, growing attention is now being given to disciplinary discourses within and across national boundaries (e.g., Gotti, 2003; Gunnarsson, Linnel, & Nordberg, 1994; and Taylor & Chen, 1991 on specialist discourses). This move towards discussing specialist discourses rather than academic discourses in general and to looking at instances where data of written and spoken communications in professional settings are combined (e.g., Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2005) has its advantages in that it allows us to locate specific areas of ease or difficulty for ‘‘translating’’ them into English.

By and large, for the purposes of this paper we shall take a discourse perspective on publishing in English. This means, first of all, a process rather than a product view on the discursive construction (and dissemination) of knowledge. Publishing naturally entails writing, and perhaps less obviously, reading as well. All scientists are ventriloquists (in the sense of Bakhtin, 1986), and all texts are caught in osmotic circles of re-reading and re-writing, building up their potential for unending intertextuality within and across local and global discourse worlds. This has important consequences for the issue of our immediate concern. Writing in English is not only a matter of field competence or rhetorical skills. Publishing in English is also an ideological choice: academic writing is an act of identity as is any other form of language use. This explains why so easily the spread of English as an academic lingua franca leads to debates in terms of values rather than skills, and highlights national and cultural loyalties rather than ‘simple’ academic solidarity. Publishing in English may be a symbol of one’s entry into a supranational community, but its advantages need to be weighed against the risks entailed from the perspective of the local community. Hence there are no global answers to what it means to publish in English for a non-native speaker of that language. Interpretations couched in specific environments and related to concerns of particular academic communities are needed.

In an attempt to interpret decisions relating to academic publications in one specific environment, this paper reports on the first part of an in-depth study investigating the attitudes of Polish academics towards publishing. In particular, it looks at the results of a questionnaire survey investigating scientists’ choice of language for publication and their success in getting published. Before presenting the details of this study, however, it is first necessary to contextualize it within post-1989 social, political and educational realities in Poland.

# 2. The Polish situation

The fall of communism in 1989 and Poland’s entry to the EU on May 1st 2004 impacted significantly on all walks of life in Poland. Linguistic changes began to emerge not only in the attitudes towards and uses of English, but also in the way in which the native language e Polish e was used. Both development strands need to be considered here.

Prior to 1989 learning English was seen as a counterbalance to learning Russian e a compulsory language at school (Duszak, 2005). Since then, English has become much more readily available and is seen as necessary to succeed: its ideological position has changed and there is now a great demand for opportunities to learn and practice English. English is considered an ‘easy’ language among Poles. Nonetheless, there are good reasons to believe that even those who speak the language well encounter difficulties when writing academic English, and writing in English for publication understandably creates challenges. Difficulties at the performance level may result from the typological distance between the two languages (positional versus inflectional), and differences in what makes style natural (unmarked) (cf. end weight versus front weight in informational loading of the sentence, ‘linear’ versus digressive flow of argumentation). In addition, writers need to take account of differences in preferred textual formats for research articles and ways of marking authorial presence, as well as of different style sheet policies or even how citations and glosses should be introduced (for an overview see e.g., Biniewicz & Starzec, 1995; Duszak, 1994; Gajda, 2001). As already emphasized, textual patterns that are individually adopted find their validation in cultural values that underlie a given conception of scholarship and language of research dissemination. The adopted patterns become the accepted norms of writing for a given academic community, while at the same time shaping that community’s beliefs about academic communication. In the case of Polish, the canon of academic writing owes a lot to German intellectual tradition, which may explain why Poles remain largely ill-prepared for the purposes of adopting the very different, English-style of writing (cf. Duszak, 1998).

Polish academics have always looked towards the West to some extent, often adhering to German/French academic traditions. This tendency has been recently strengthened with academics looking towards the English-speaking world, primarily to America. At the same time, however, a defensive attitude towards Polish predominates. Poland has always been rather nationalistic and the Polish language has been seen as important for the nation’s survival and unity (which may be explained in terms of Poland’s long history of partitions and long periods in which it was deprived of its independence). Today, the dominance of English evokes mixed feelings, with some academics cherishing its positive aspects, and others fearing the consequences its widespread adoption may have for Polish. Attitudes towards English or what is attributed to the influence of English are polarizing many local academic communities. Publishing in English is not a central issue in this debate. However, it may be a concern as demonstrated by the open resistance towards the new benchmarking practices adopted by the National Research Commission for the evaluation of publishing outputs of individual scholars and institutions as they rely on the Philadelphia List which, it is believed, privileges publications in English. Such concerns relate mainly to publishing on topics for which English would not appear to be the language of choice, as when research addresses languages other than English and/or is designated for a specific readership. Arguments of national loyalty have also been raised, though less frequently, as noticed by Gajda (1999a). Such arguments are driven by traditional purist attitudes to ‘‘language culture’’ and their emphasis on national interests in how canons of knowledge are discursively validated.

Despite some purist attitudes to language use in Poland, it must be acknowledged that Polish academic discourse is changing as a result of the prevalence of English. Modern academic Polish is said to imitate English when it comes to text formatting, level of interactiveness and style, leading to a more ‘feuilletonic’, easily accessible, essay-like, style of writing. These changes are likely narrowing the differences between the two languages. However, the new discursive values are often negatively perceived particularly by the older generation of academics. They are linked to a lowering of the quality of research and a loss of methodological rigor: hence, the discussion about sloppy style and pathological phenomena in academia1 (Gajda, 1999a, 1999b; S1awek, 2002; see Duszak, 2005 for some discussion). It is in our view significant that such discussions focus on issues of ethics, standards of research, identity and autonomy of scholars and academic institutions. They highlight the differences between the past and the present of Polish universities. Naturally, therefore, such debates are located on the boundaries of sociology and philosophy of science (cf. Goc´kowski, 1999; qadyzyn _ ´ski & Rain´czuk, 2003; S1awek, 2002) or educational politics (Antonowicz, 2005; Ja1owiecki, 2002).

Looked at differently, this trend to popular formats for disseminating research may be welcome as an alternative to the ’pathological‘ texts in the Teutonic tradition, when the imperative of ‘scientificness’ led to syntactic and conceptual obscurities. More popular formats encourage closer synergy between teaching and research, and research and its dissemination. As a result, many local publishing houses have changed their policies and are more willing to publish textbooks, study guides, and translations of academic texts (usually from English) than theoretical analyses or narrowly specialized monographs. This seems to be socially welcome even though it may have its shortcomings in discriminating against valuable but small-interest and high-cost publications.

There is little doubt that attention to English in Poland is on the increase and the use of the language within academic spheres is also on the increase. It is also to be noticed here that quantity in academic publishing is increasingly seen as necessary but not sufficient, and where one publishes is a growing concern among academics. This makes publishing in internationally renowned English-medium publications a valuable yet challenging alternative, and particularly so, most probably, for the older academics who are generally less fluent in English and not as computer literate as their younger colleagues.

# 3. The study

Taking into consideration the reality described above, a questionnaire survey was conducted to find out how Polish academics view publishing their research and what difficulties they perceive when undertaking this endeavor in English. This is the first part of an ongoing study investigating Polish academics’ experiences of and attitudes towards publishing in English.

The questionnaire was in Polish and was made up of 14 questions, of which 12 were closed questions, while two were open-ended (Q. 8 and 14). Question 14 sought to elicit respondents’ own comments relating to the issue of publishing, especially their experiences in publishing in English (see Appendix A for the English translation of the questionnaire). The questionnaire sought to elicit the following information:

- Background information about the participants (Q. 1e5)   
- Respondents’ recent experience of writing for publication (Q. 6e7)   
- The language respondents valued for publishing their own works (Q. 8)   
- The type of publications they valued most (e.g., articles, chapters, books, etc.) (Q. 9)   
- Their experiences when publishing in English (Q. 10e14)

The questionnaire was sent out via email to academics in medicine, psychology and language studies. The choice of fields primarily in the social sciences was conscious in that we believed that these fields naturally invite localization and make communication in English an ideological choice. We were interested to find out whether this is the case and whether a field such as medicine, being largely independent of culture, more naturally lends itself to the dissemination of knowledge using English as a lingua franca.

# 3.1. Results and discussion

A total of 99 completed questionnaires were received (42 from psychology, 31 from languages or language related studies, 17 from medicine and 9 from other faculties in the social sciences). The majority of the respondents were young academics, 42 of whom $(42 \% )$ were aged between 22e35, and 20 $( 2 0 \% )$ were aged 36e45. This is more likely to reflect the fact that younger academics are more willing to respond to requests for data of this nature than to reflect a true profile of the age of academics in Polish institutions of higher learning. As for their highest academic qualification, most held a doctoral $(40 \% )$ or post-doctoral degree $( 2 6 \% )$ , with only $27 \%$ holding a Masters degree only, and 4 $\%$ holding a first degree in medicine (Doctor of Medicine). Given this profile, it was not surprising that in answer to question 5, $93 \%$ of the respondents indicated that they had published in the last 5 years. Those who had not published were generally junior academics in terms of degree obtained, and two were also young, that is, aged 22e35, most probably just starting out in their academic career.

Table 1 Languages of publication   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Language</td><td>No. of respondents</td><td>Percentage of those who publish</td></tr><tr><td>Polish</td><td>87</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>English</td><td>63</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Other:</td><td>23</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>French</td><td> 6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Russian</td><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>German</td><td>4</td><td>4.</td></tr><tr><td>Ukrainian</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> Italian</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 1 shows the languages in which the respondents have published in the last five years. It is evident from this table that the majority $(87 \% )$ publish in Polish, but this is only one of the languages used for publication. Most respondents use two or more languages to communicate their research.

Only 18 of those who publish do so only in Polish. Yet not all the 18 respondents who publish only in Polish see this language as the most important for their publications. In response to Q. 3, five of these 18 respondents indicated that English was the most important language for publication. All were aged 22e35: young academics presumably aspiring to publish in English with three specifically indicating that publishing in English is necessary to become a recognized academic. The lack of opportunity to publish in English was further echoed by three of the young respondents (aged 22e35) who noted that Polish was (till now) their most important language for publishing; two of this latter group pointed out that they need to establish themselves within the Polish research community in their own field, before venturing to publish in English.

In response to Q. 3, 18 $( 1 8 \% )$ of the respondents nominated Polish as their preferred language of publication, while an additional six respondents nominated Polish as equally preferred to another language (either Russian or English). Of these 24 respondents, ten were working in psychology, four in related social sciences, five in languages and only one in medicine. The comparatively high number of those in psychology who selected Polish, amounting to $24 \%$ of the total respondents from that field of research, leads us to question Strelau’s (2005) claim that $9 5 \%$ of all publications in psychology appear in English.

Fifty percent (i.e., nine of 18 respondents) who nominated Polish as their sole preferred language of publication have only published in that language. The remaining 9 respondents selected Polish even though they had published in another language/other languages. The most common reasons for nominating Polish as the preferred language related to the intended readership: three of the respondents indicated they were writing books for students, two others specified that they wanted their field of research to be more widely recognized within the Polish research community. These reasons appear in line with the changes to publication policies referred to earlier. It should also be noted that one respondent felt that within his area of politics he had a wider readership in Poland. Interestingly, one respondent (#17) considered he had a greater chance of getting published in Polish journals.

Despite the fact that the majority of respondents continue to publish in Polish, nearly two-thirds of our respondents $( 6 3 \% )$ indicated in response to Q. 2 that they publish in English with only one respondent indicating that he only publishes in English. The importance of publishing in English was reiterated in responses to Q. 4 where respondents were asked to rank order five most important types of publication for them. Only eight of the 99 respondents failed to rate publishing in English journals and 47 of the respondents ranked this type of publication as the most important for their needs (this compares with 19 respondents who failed to rank publishing in a Polish journal and two who ranked publication in a Polish journal as most important.)

The reasons nominated for publishing in English are shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Reasons for publishing in English   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Reason</td><td>Frequency of response</td></tr><tr><td>Most (renowned) periodicals are in English</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Widest possible readership</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Most widely accepted language of academia</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>English is my field of study</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Enables international cooperation</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>All important discussions in English</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>My area of research not widely developed in Poland</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Impact factor</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Avoids the need to translate</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Only way to become a recognized scholar</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fast turnaround from submission to publication</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>

What appears to motivate our respondents to publish in English is the perceived need to have their work more widely known by an international readership, which many respondents feel can only be achieved by publishing in English (Table 2).

Table 3 shows a breakdown of the 63 respondents who publish in English according to their field of research.

The result that the majority (i.e., $87 \%$ ) of those in medicine who publish do so in English was to be expected. The comparatively smaller percentage of those researching languages who publish in English $( 5 4 \% )$ was also not surprising since our survey included 12 respondents who specialize in Russian or Slavonic studies (Table 1).

Of the 93 respondents who have published in the last 5 years, 56 (i.e., $60 \%$ ) have submitted a paper to an international English-medium journal (Q. 5). It should be noted here that not all those who publish in English write for international journals. Of those who have written for international English-medium journals, 30 (i.e., $54 \%$ ) have had a paper rejected with 9 (i.e., $30 \%$ ) identifying the reason for rejection as relating to language problems. The other main reasons for rejection identified were that either the topic of the paper was not of interest or the paper did not fulfill the formal requirements of the said journal, with 11 and 14 respondents nominating these reasons respectively.

The fact that language is a problem for many of the respondents was also reflected in their responses to Q. 7. Of the 56 respondents who had submitted a publication to an English periodical, 33 (i.e., $59 \%$ ) indicated that they had difficulties with the language and ten $( 1 8 \% )$ identified difficulties associated with writing academic texts. Further difficulties identified were accessing current literature in their field (11, i.e., $20 \%$ ); difficulty with understanding reviewers’ comments (16 or $2 9 \%$ ) and technical problems (9 or $16 \%$ ). These results appear to echo those of Canagarajah (2002) and Flowerdew (2000) which suggest that potential authors face a range of both linguistic and non linguistic difficulties.

Table 4 identifies the percentage of respondents from each age group who had had a paper rejected from an Englishmedium journal. When the number of respondents who have submitted papers to English-medium journals is compared with the number who have received a rejection, it will be seen that the youngest scholars aged 22e35 seem to have been equally as successful as the scholars within the $5 6 { - } 6 5$ age group. However, since data was not provided on the exact number of papers submitted or rejected, it is possible that the higher percentage of rejections experienced by academics falling into the other age groups may be the result of their submitting more papers for review. This will need to be probed further in the next phase of the research.

Table 3 Breakdown of respondents who publish in English by field of research   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Field of research</td><td>No. of respondents who publish (N = 63)</td><td>No. of respondents who publish in English within the field (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>15</td><td>13 (87%)</td></tr><tr><td>Language</td><td>28</td><td>15 (54%)</td></tr><tr><td>Psychology</td><td>41</td><td>28 (68%)</td></tr><tr><td>Other Social Sciences</td><td>9</td><td>7 (78%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

These results suggest that Swales’ (2004) notion that success in terms of publication depends on experience may be an oversimplification when it comes to researchers from outside Kachru’s (1985) Inner Circle. As Sahakyan (2006) posits, the younger scholars may have better language skills and therefore may find it easier to get published in English-medium journals. Certainly, the success rate of our respondents seems to have been greater for the junior academics than the more experienced ones not only in terms of age (Table 4) but also in terms of highest qualification (see Table 5). Proportionally more older academics, with post-doctoral degrees, experienced having a paper rejected than did their less qualified counterparts. It must, however, be noted that the number of respondents with higher degrees was considerably larger in this sample.

Only 18 of the respondents added further comments in response to Q. 14. Most reiterated the points discussed earlier in the questionnaire. However, a few raised issues that warrant further discussion. One of the respondents questioned the quality of research in Poland.

# 8: In linguistics/humanities the level of research is often not worthy of international publication.

This view may reflect the limited funds available for carrying out ground-breaking research. It may, on the other hand, reflect the local nature of the research itself and the perceived relevance of such research for the wider, global audience.

Another respondent questioned the policy of many Polish publishers which do not encourage the use of English, and thus limit their readership to a Polish audience.

#61: I believe Polish publications should include an English abstract and I am surprised this is not a requirement and that many publications in Poland will not accept articles in English.

Where abstracts or papers do appear in English, it was noted that they are not necessarily well written:

#24: Publications submitted to Polish journals which appear in English are often poorly translated. This is also true of abstracts of Polish articles.. There is a need for more careful editing, in consultation with native speakers.

Table 5 Number of respondents who had a paper rejected (by respondents’ qualification)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Highest degree attained by respondents</td><td>No. of respondents who have submitted a paper (N = 56)</td><td>No. of respondents who have received rejection within each degree level (N = 30) (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Medical doctor</td><td>5</td><td>1 (20%)</td></tr><tr><td>M.A.</td><td>6</td><td>2 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td>PhD</td><td>25</td><td>13 (52%)</td></tr><tr><td>Post doc.</td><td>20</td><td>14 (70%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

A third strand that emerged from the open-ended comments related to negative perceptions of getting a paper accepted in an English-medium journal, as illustrated from the comments below:

# 9: In general, publications are not accepted unless the author is well known.   
# 60: I have only published in English if invited by an editor/publisher. Initiating a publication myself appears very difficult.   
# 74: The problem is often related to the country of origin of the author and not the topic.

# 4. Conclusion

The results of this study show that within the Polish situation the choice of language for academic publication is a complex one. It appears to be determined by a number of different factors such as age of researchers, previous exposure to English and one’s field of research. Even though there is evidence to support the thesis that publishing in English is growing in importance, this is not necessarily happening at the expense of the native language as would be the case in some other European countries such as Sweden and the Netherlands. This apparent tension between languages in Poland thus needs to be explained, as we suggested earlier, within the context of the local academic culture and tradition.

The survey shows that Polish remains an important channel for publishing in Poland. Authors choose to publish in their native language for various reasons with a number doing so to disseminate their field of study among Poles and ‘popularize’ their subject, through, for example, publishing textbooks for students. Yet, few publish only in Polish. The majority of our respondents indicated that they publish in at least one other language, usually in English.

Publishing in English seems to be increasingly important, with even some of the respondents who have not yet published in English aspiring to do so in order to enter the supranational community of the academic world. English is thus seen as the key to success, to becoming recognized as an academic of worth. It is also seen as an avenue for enhancing one’s resume and gaining promotion. In a field like medicine, it would appear that publishing is almost exclusively carried out through the medium of English e the ‘cases’ discussed are of interest to the wider global audience in the field of medicine. But in the other fields, such a psychology or language studies this may not necessarily be the case: issues being researched may be of a much more local concern. The choice of language, therefore, is not that simple e the decision is not only a linguistic one, to have one’s work read by others familiar with the field and the lingua franca, but also a social and ideological one as suggested at the outset of this paper. And it must be remembered that for the potential author the choice of language is only one aspect of the complex process of research communication and identity construction.

Many of the constraints that potential authors face when writing in English for publication seem to be the same as those identified in earlier literature (e.g., Canagarajah, 2002; Flowerdew, 2000). The respondents indicated problems with language, which is not surprising given the differences in academic style identified in previous rhetorical analysis. It would be interesting to find out whether the problems that respondents believe they experience are in fact the ones that have been discussed in the literature. This will be an issue addressed in the next phase of the study. Another related issue that needs to be addressed is the extent to which contextualizing research of a more local nature creates difficulties for authors when writing for English-medium publications. Contextualization is necessary for the research to be understood by a wider, ‘external’ audience. It would appear to us to require a great deal of skill and knowledge to achieve success and hence to be able to have one’s research published.

The comparative success in getting published in English of the less experienced researchers in terms of age and degree status in our study leads to questions about the applicability of Swales’ (2004) dichotomy of junior vs. experienced researchers in the Polish situation. As suggested earlier, it is probable that the younger academics, like those in the Armenian study (see Sahakyan, 2006), have had more access to English and are more proficient in the language, thus more confident in using it. If confirmed, these findings are a likely indication of a generational change within Polish academic institutions, one which will have a growing impact on academic communication within the country.
