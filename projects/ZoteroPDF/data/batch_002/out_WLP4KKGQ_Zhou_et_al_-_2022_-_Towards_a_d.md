# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Machine translation Transnational education (TNE) Translanguaging pedagogy English for academic purposes

This study aims to investigate the way in which Machine Translation is used in practice by students at a transnational joint venture in China. This is a mixed-methods study, involving a questionnaire and focus groups with Chinese students who are studying on an English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) programme in China. The findings suggest that the students are using the technology in strategic and nuanced ways in order to support their academic studies and enhance their abilities in the English language. The students do not cede complete control of their writing to the automated system, but take a critical and thoughtful approach towards how a combination of their own knowledge and technological assistance can support them in their academic endeavours. They translate shorter pieces of language to produce more accurate output and critically evaluate this output, especially when culturally related. When faced with time constraints, they translate paragraphs or whole texts, but then refine the grammar and logical transition within the output. Therefore, students appear to regard MT as an additional strategy with which to achieve communicative success as opposed to a substitute for their own writing skills. The authors discuss these findings and draw parallels between this and the idea of translanguaging, suggesting that students are incorporating the digital resources into the repertoire of linguistic resources available to them.

# 1. Introduction

With an increasing demand for international higher education, Transnational Education (TNE), or the mobility of an education program or higher education institution (HEI)/provider between countries" (Knight, 2016), has developed dramatically in recent decades. In the case of China, the rapid growth of the economy in China has bosted a tremendous demand for internationalized higher education (Cai & Hl, 2016) and, consequently, an increasing number f international branch campuses (IBCs), joint/dual/multiple (JDM) degree programs, and distance education programs, have emerged (Knight, ibid).

Second language learning is generally accepted as a major challenge for students. In most TE institutions, students need to reach a level of competence in the language of their target institution (usually English), often with a requirement to demonstrate this through an entrance proficiency test, such as ELTs. In addition, during thir courses they need to use receptive kills in that language to understand the input of their course, as well as productive skill to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding. Given that the university threshold for entry (typically around B2 on the CEFR scale) i far from mastery of the language, many students may be at a disadvantage, thus creating a need for preparatory and ongoing support.

This has led to the development of the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP), which aims at helping students develop ther abilities, not only in the area of general language competence, but also in the area of understanding and expressing complex ideas within the conventions of their target academic community. This involves a great deal of effort on the part of these student, as well as expense. There i also the issue of the disadvantages that students fce while on their degrees, given the need for ongoing language improvement.

In the last decade, however, a technology has developed independently from EAP, which may provide a supplement or enhancement. Machine Translation (MT) is defined as the proces of translating by employing computer programs and/or smart phone applications (Alhaisoni & Ahaysony, 2017). MT is fre, efectie, and almost universall ailable, being acessbl through personal computersas well as mobile devices, and has begun to be embedded acros many webservices, including academic ones, such as the Taylor and Francis journal database (Barrtt, 2015). Clearly, this has the potential to impact TNE. However, exactly what this impact will be and how far it will penetrate into the TNE space is, as yet, under-researched.

One way to conceptualis the use of this technology within the TNE space may be to consider paralls with the concept of translanguaging. For the purposes of this study, translanguaging will be defined as "pedagogical strategies used to learn languages based on the learners' whole linguistic repertoire' and "'spontaneous multilingual practices . used in a pedagogical way (Cenoz & Gorter, 2017, p. 314 in Liu et al, 2020). Translanguaging is a movement which aims to break down the ideas of ingustic barers; a translingal approach to EAP would gst encouraging stdents totiliseallof the linguisti rources at their dsposal. Thfre, it would seem a logical extension that these linguistic resources also include digital resources as wellas their interlanguage resulting from all past linguistic acquisition. In addition, given that students have been traditionally encouraged to take advantage of learning aids, from dictionaries to individual coaching, including MT in the students' reertore of tols seems natural. Within this study, we are not taking the term to mean a total refutation of language barrers ut rather as a blurring of these barriers, and questioning the value of the dominance of monolingualism in the EAP classroom.

This study situates itself within a critical pragmatic approach to EAP (Harwood & Hadley, 2004). It does not advocate mono. lingualism within EAP, or the wider transnational context. At the same time, it s aware that students in this context are expected to produce assessed work written in English and which adheres to the norms of anglosphere academic text. While the authors have reservations about the values embedded in this paradigm, this paper does not eek to challenge this. Instead, its aim is to question the assumption that monolingualism is the optimal tool to support students journey towards mastery of academic expression.

Within the area of EAP and MT, there is a small but growing body of literature around the use of MT. Much of this focuses on the quality and efficacy of the software, questioning whether MT can produce linguistic quality and semanticall effctive translations. There is also work around its place in the academic world (Groves & Mundt, 2021), and also whether i can be used to enhance student learning of language. However, there is a lack of research regarding the extent to which it is actuall used by students in writing assigments s such, this study aims to adres the shortall and produce recommendations to translingual assroms in ters of ter being useful when considering how this technology is ikely to impact the field of EAP and the wider community of TNE within which it is most often found.

This is a mixed-methods study with quantitative data involving a questionnaire and qualitative data from focus groups. The participants were all undergraduate students located in China and studying on a degre at a Joint Educational Venture hosted in a Chinese University but with academic content provided by a UK university. The students are all Chinese and the lectures and as. sessments ae all delivered in English. Entrance to the course depends on students demonstrating a lel of proficiency in their Go Kao exam - the national Chinese matriculation exam.

This study addresses the following two research questions about the use of MT by students in Higher Education:

1. How widespread is the use of this technology in students' writing assignments in this context? 2. What is the students perception of the capability of Machine Translation and how do they use the technology in their writing assignments?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Perceptions and usage of machine translation

Early voices on the use of MT in language education were highly critical, mostly due to the quality of the output (Rensburg et al., 2012; Precup-Stiegelbauer, 2013; Sheppard, 2011). However, in 2015, Groves and Mundt reported that from a purely grammatical standpoint, and measured through counting errors, the system was able to produce writing of asimilar level to threshold entrance to many universities. More recently, studies indicating less negative opinions on MT have begun to emerge. One such opinion is an awarenes of the strengths and weakneses of the output of MT. For example, Ducar and Schocket (2018) report that the system handes high frequency idioms wel, but i far less comptent with lower frequency ones. More recently, Lee and Brigs (2021) found that the system is able to help Korean students corrct their errors with prepositions and article, yet it is far less able to help with sentence fragments or text that is incomprehensible. They also express caution over the output when culturall-rooted idioms or polysemous words are involved. Chung and Ahn (2021) suggest that MT can help students with grammatical accuracy, but are much less enthusiastic about is abilit to improve students' lexical ability. This contrasts with previous studies that found that MT-assisted writing contained richer lexical resource than when students wrote unassisted (Crossley, 2018; Kol et al., 2018).

Lee (2021) produced a systematic review and meta-analysis of the growing body of itrature surrounding MT, and that study's analysis deerves some attention. Lee's conclusions are tre-fold firsty, the accuracy of MT has much improved, including the aility to deal with semanticlly opaque, or iiomatic anguage, and it now produces language of qualit in exces of the students wn output, although there are stil frequent ssues with discourse and formality secondy, useof MT for language leaning is geneally welliked by students, although students maintain a level of scepticism over its long-term use; finall, Le found that when language output, rather than student perceptions of long-term effects on their ability to learn a language, was examined, use of MT did have a measurable, positive impact on the language in students' output.

A final thread involves the need to addres the developments of MT, both in terms ofthe policies stated by universities and the ways that students actually use it. Mundt and Groves (2016) note the need for improved MT literacy among both students and the wider academic community. In a book length contribution, Bowker and Ciro (2019) advocate a disciplined aroach to training for the use of MT in research level writing to allow greater mutual understnding among scholars acros the globe. There isalso a consensus that students need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the technology, and be able to use it critically and with care (Chung & Ahn, 2021; Clifford et al., 2013; Groves & Mundt, 2015; Murtisari et al., 2019; Tsai, 2019).

In fact, in recent years, remarkable developments in the accuracy of MT outputs have greatly increased its viability as tol to support EAP, especily in the effrts targeting writing (Gritsay & Vodyanitskaya, 2021). MT has become a widely used source of reference (Chon et al., 2021), and there are several approaches in terms of using MT. For example, Bahri and Mahadi (2016) report very positive attitudes from their Malaysian students towards MT, and that students use it as a tool for selfstudy. Similarly, Vold (2018) claims that active EAP learners could draw upon MT as a learning too to facilitate them in terms of gaining linguistic knowledge of the target language. Garcia and Pena (2011) suggest that the technology could be integrated with more conventional pedagogy to allow students to reach their competency goals faster and more effectively. Perhaps most importantly, MT enables learners to elaborate more complicated and detailed ideas in academic contexts (Lee, 2020).

# 2.2. MT-assisted writing as translanguaging practice

Challenging monolingualism and hard boundaries between languages in language classes, translanguaging pedagogy suggests softening language boundaries and encourages 'spontaneous multilingual practices .. used in a pedagogical way" and pedagogical strategies drawing on leaners entire linguistic resources t facilitate their language learning (Cenoz & Gorter, 2017, p. 314; Cenoz & Gorter, 2020a). Regarding language boundaries as soft means that resources from multiligual learners' diffrent languages can be deployed in a dynamic manner in order to organize and mediate learners' mental process in learning and communication (Cenoz & Gorter, 2020b; Leung & Valdes, 2019). In addition to linguistic resources, multimodal resources contribute to learners' language development. In accordance with this multilingual and multimodal view, a pedagogical model leveraging bilingual, multimodal and cultural resourcesto expand learners' communicative repertoire and advance their academic reading and writing was introduced in an Asian tertiary EAP context (Lin, 2015). Students communicative repertoire involving L1/L2 everyday and academic language as wel as non-verbal resources is strategically and systematically drawn on at different pedagogical stages.

In the context of information and communication technology developments, bilingual/multilingual learners communicative repertoire has been enriched by digital tools and expanded ocial networks. Meaning-making resources not in their existing proficiency are also included in the reertoire through distributed practice (Canagarajah, 2018)Machine-assted translation is one strategy they deploy to learn languages in such context (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). Studies on machine-assted translation have predominantl been informed by monolingualism and regarded languages as autonomous structures (Buendgens-Kosten, 2020). This orientation considers translation to ental finding linguistic counterparts in the target language and positions this as a stage in the trajectory of reaching mastery of the target language (Horner & Tetreault, 2016). However, such a viewpoint fals t recognize the synergistic interaction of bilingual/multilingual resources, technological artifats, cultural resources and environmental afordances in the translation proces. In the process of producing and interpreting texts, MT software, as a socially shaped technological artifact, works with learners existing linguistic resources, cultural knowledge and other meaning-making resources as a communicative repertoire to generate meaning (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Vogel et al., 2018).

Emerging researchframes the discussion of machine-assted translation practces through the translanguaging pedagogy lens in the context of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) or English as an Aditional Language (EAL) writing. Two studies, conducted in Taiwan, investigated college students machine-assisted translation practices in ESP writing from the translanguaging perspective, with both employing research interventions (Chen et al., 2019; Tsai, 2020). In both studies, participants were instructed to follow prescribed writing steps in which they wrote parallel texts in English and Chinese and then used a machine translated version of the latter to improve the former. The analyses showed significant improvement of the English text in terms of content, vocabulary, and grammar when the students drew upon thir multiple linguistic resources and MT. Two other studies have examined middle school students' translingual practices involving MT. Vogel et al. (2018) conducted a case study of asingle emergent bilingual pupils writing for his English Language Arts clas in the United States. They found that the pupil drew on MT as part of his meaning-making repertoire, analysing MT outputs to produce accurate meaning. Similarly, Beiler and Dewilde's (2020) study featuring 22 multilingual pupil' writing practices during their English writing instruction in Norway found that machine-asisted translation was an important way for students to assemble MT together with their other communicative resources, forming an integrated repertoire to facilitate their EAL writing. These findings perceive machine-assted translation as a translanguaging practice drawing on students communicative repertoire, including bilingual/multilingual resources, MT software, image search tools, classmates and teachers.

Despite the research above, there is a dearth of research investigating Higher Education and Pre-Higher Education students perception and use of MT in their EAP writing from the translanguaging perspective. In the context of EAP writing courses, emergent bilinguals or multilinguals are often considered to be cautious about the extent to which they can deploy their 1 communicative resource in a particular situation (Canagarajah, 2011), considering the specificdiscourse community conventions which these courses expect the students toconform to and uilise t asses their writing products (McIntosh et a., 2017). Theefore, the current study aims to look into university students' usage and perception of MT in EAP writing from the translanguaging perspective in the context of a TNE Institute in mainland China.

# 2.3. EAP context

The study takes place within the context of English for Academic Purposes. There is a great deal of literature dealing with the difference between EAP and more general-purpose forms of language education, but it is perhaps summed up most succinctly by Hyland (2006, pp. 1-2) who observes

The communicative demands of the modern university, much like the modern workplace involve far more than simply controlling linguistic error or polishing style'.

EAP involves students coming to terms with a number of aspects of language and thought. This involves emphasis on syntactic features, such as complex sentences (Lu et al., 2020) and nominalisation (Biber, 2006). Further, students are expected to be able to manipulate sets of vocabulary, both for general and specific purposes (Coxhead, 2000; Yang, 2015). There is also an expectation that students wil usecertain discourse fetures in their output which will contrbute to the pervasive, but als slightly slippery concept of "academic style". This includes, among other things, alignment to the norms of metadiscoursal features, described by Hyland and Tse (2004).

Hyland and Tse's article also demonstrates a further challenge faced by learners of EAP - that of disciplinary specificity. Meta discourse i used differently between different fields, which means that students need to be aware of the norms and expectations of their discipline, for example a lab report as opposed to an esay. This includes the concept of intertextuality- or when and how external sources are incorporated into the students' writing (Hirvela & Du, 2013). Depending on the students' previous learning experience, intertextuality may also involve anumber f issues around academic integrity, since common practice in one educational context may be regarded as a serious transgression in another (Flowerdew, 2015).

It should also be noted that EAP is not a monolithic culture. Beyond the disciplinary variations mentioned above, there are also large contextual differences. For example, EAP focused on doctoral candidates is likely to be far more discipline specific than that focused on pre-undergraduate students. The ltter is the context of this study. Stazicker and Woods (2022) outline some f the key challenges facing this type of student - which include the need for overal language improvement, aculturation into the wider expectations of students in an Anglosphere university, and also building their confidnce in exerting and expresing their criticalit in the style expected in the target academic community.

It is important to note that only some of the above challenges exist at the level of the sentence - which is where MT can have the greatest impact. For example, a sentence that is written without hedging language (Hyland & Tse, 2004) in one language will not contain hedging language when it istranslated by the software. Therefore, the knowledge and skils that students need to acquire in their preparatory studies can only be partially, or even marginally, addressed by the use of MT.

# 3. Method

The target students are pre-undergraduate and undergraduate Chinese nationality students studying at a Joint Educational Institute (JEI) between a UK university and one in China. There are approximately 360 students in each of the four year of study, with the areas of study being Business Management, Accounting and Finance, and Tourism Management. All students take a year of EAP before moving on to their main degrees; all teaching and assessment are delivered in the English language.

The study used a mixed-methods approach. First after securing ethical approval, the researchers invited the foundation and frst year underraduate cohorts to voluntarily ill i a questionnaire delivered online exploting the multi-item cale approach described in Dornyei (2007). The programme is a four year one, with a shared foundation year focussed on EAP followed by years 1-3 of undergraduate study. Recruitment was undertaken via Wechat, a popular messaging application in China. The invitation included sufficient information about the project to enable students to give informed consent. The questionnaire featured seven multi-item scales, with the order of the questions randomised (see Table 1). The full questionnaire is available in Appendix one.

Table 1 Questionnaire scales and explanations.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Scales</td><td>Explanations</td></tr><tr><td>1. I use MT for words (WORDS)</td><td>This scale asked whether the students used the technology to translate individual lexical items.</td></tr><tr><td>2.

After the questionnaire urvey, the researchers invited both cohorts (also by Wechat) to voluntarily participate in one of two focus groups. Nine first year students responded to the invitation and took part in Group One, while 6second year students responded and participated in Group Two. The focus groups, which were semi-structured and conducted in English, were co-led by all three re. searchers and lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. The initil questions were based on questionnaire items; however, the researchers were keen to let the discussions develop in the directions the students took them. Therefore, richer and more student-led data came from the focus groups, and hence emphasis is placed on this aspect of the research in the results.

Before any analysis of the questionnaire survey took place, any incomplete questionnaires were eliminated, which is in line withthe informed consent statement at the tart of the survey. This left 235 responses. Cronbach's Alpha analysis was then caried out on the multi-tm scal to ensure internal reliability (Dnyei, 007). Items that confoundd intenal reliality were rmoved, with a targ of 0.70 established, in line with Dornyei's recommendations (Ibid). The scales of "sentences", "aceptable", and "quality" were lower than ideal and should be treated with caution. However, they were not discarded as a value of 0.6 can be seen as accetable (Ursachi et al., 2015). The scale of "Common" only reached 0.5, and this should again be treated with caution. Hower, i is not unprecedented to include a scale with this low level of reliability (q.v Dornyei & Chan, 2013).

The focus groups were transcribed using otter.ai, and then the three researchers each independently checked the transcription for accuracy. The reearchers coded the transcripts independentl, and then confirmed each ther's coding. Originall, the codes were the subjects of the 7 multi-item scales. Next, the researchers indeendently identified emergent themes, which they then agred upon as a group.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Widespread use

To address the first research question, it is clear that the use of MT in the cohort was widespread. The scale around translating individual words in the questionnaire had a mean score of 4.10 out of 5 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 8$ $\mathbf { n } = 2 3 5$ ), and for sentences it was 3.5 $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { S } D } = 6 . 2 , n$ $= 2 3 5$ . This finding suggests the use of translation software i common among the students. For the scale "Common', when students responded around their perception of other students, the mean was similar at 3.5( $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 7$ $\scriptstyle n = 2 3 5$ ), although this needs to be taken with caution (see above). The scale "Acceptable" showed generally positive results, with a mean of 3.6 (SD 0.69, $\mathbf { n } = 2 3 5$ ). Some students were happy to describe practices, such as the two below.

Excerpt 1 (Group 1)

Student 9: Firstly, I wil try to write by myself, ut when I use a word, oo many times, I don't know how to express i in another words, and I'd like to search it on Baidu or Youdao Cidian ((Dictionary - both of which are online translation software programs)), to express the word in another way, because our essay need to not, try not to repeat.

Interviewer 2: Yeah, you mean your teacher doesn't allow you to use one single word too many times.

Student 9: Yeah, but I don't know any synonyms of the word. So I like to try to find synonyms on Baidu or Youdao Cidian ((Dictionary - both of which are online translation software programs)).

Excerpt 2 (Group 2)

Student 5: I will form my essay or pre ((presentation) in Chinese to check my logic is okay or not. And then the main body, the sixty percent of the main body willbe translated into English by translation apps. And the rest of the main body will translate by myself. Because my English is not good.

The questionnaire data suggest that the use of MT is widespread, with these responses showing that the use of the technology is a common fall back strategy when students view their own linguistic resources as inadequate.

It is also worthy of note that when Pearson's correlations were run on the questionnaire data, no significant correlations were observed between the students use f the technology and ther atitudes to, or perceived abilities i, the English Language. The mean for liking English was noticeably higher at 3.9 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7 5$ $\mathbf { n } = 2 3 5$ ) than that for speaking well at 2.9 ( $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7$ $\mathbf { n } = 2 3 5$ J, suggesting, perhaps, a lack of confidence. However, the data do not support the speculation that this lack of confidence immediately leads to dependence on MT.

# 4.2. Quality of MT

The first emergent theme was around the quality of MT. In the questionnaire, the multi-item scale for Quality returned a mean of 2.93, with a standard deviation of 0.58 $( n = 2 3 5$ ), suggesting students are, at best, ambivalent over the quality. This is supported by examples from the focus group:

Excerpt 3 (Group 1)

Student 5: Ill try my best to completely write in English, but when you face some concept or some policies, and you don't know how to express in English, you have to use the Baidu (MT software)). And sometimes Youdao (MT software) is not trustful.

Student 3: Yes, I agree with you. It's not so, well yeah, translate Chinese into English, sometimes it's not, really not accurate, even ridiculous.

Excerpt 4 (Group 1)

Student 6 It's not match to our, what we want to expres. The translator gives the result, but what it mean may not fit our own expression. So just like a reference I think.

Excerpt 5 (Group 1)

Student 4: I'm about to say some of my clssmates, I dont think they have the abilit to tel if the translator is accurate, the result of the translator is accurate. So they don't even realize.

Interestingly, the third response suggests that there i no one single way of working with MT acros the student population, and that the students assume that there might be different interaction patterns depending on the student's English language proficiency. In the following example, the student gives a nuanced response:

Excerpt 6 (Group 1)

Student 1: Because translator doesn't know what's the background you're in.

Student 6: Yeah yeah yeah.

Student 1: Maybe you're saying a name, especially Chinese name. Someone clled Guan Guan, and guan in English it's meaning of the clothes. So although it's the name, but in the translator it will translate into clothes something. And nobody's name is clothes. ((students laughter))

It is also worth noting that these criticisms of MT seem to include an assumption of a general level of qualit, it would be surprising or astudent to focus on the system's handling of Chinese names if they felt it was unable to deal with other language in any effective ay. Student in Excerpt 6 focussed on a drawback of the system, yet in doing so suggested that the system as a whole works well he is Jicking up on a detail, not a macro-level failing.

# 4.3. Hybrid use

Both the quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that the students use of MT i one that entails hybridity, which in this study means drawing upon the techology to translate varied lengths of text together with other resources i their communicative repertoire and for dferent communicative needs when working on their writing assignments. As shown in Table 2, the average score in the multitem scales for the use of MT for words and phrases was 4.11 ( $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 7$ $n = 2 3 5$ ), and for sentences was 3.56 ( $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 2$ $n = 2 3 5$ These findings suggest thatit is quite common for the students to employ MT to translate a range of lengths of text, including individual lexical items, phrases, and sentences. In addition, it appears that using MT to translate vocabulary is more common than usin it to translate longer stretches of text.

Such usage of the technology is corroborated by the data from both focus groups. Furthermore, the students demonstrated that their way of using MT was based on their understanding of its capabilit and thus strategic decisions. The following excert exemplifies this; the four students in Excerpt 7 showed the shared understanding that the accuracy of MT output is higher when it is used to translate a word or phrase than when used for a sentence or paragraph. Therefore, the students choice of using MT to translate words and phrases more often is strategic, because it relies on their awareness of its affordances and limitations.

Excerpt 7 (Focus group 1)

Interviewer 3: So, what do you translate, a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph? What do you usually translate?

Student 2: A word.

Student 9: Yeah, maybe phrase, because sometimes when you translate a sentence, the order i expressi incorrect, yeah. So sometimes phrases.

Student 1: Maybe one word or one phrase is correct. and when (unclear) together, no.

Table 2 Results of what MT is used to translate.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Multi-item scales</td><td>(n = 235)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Multi-item scales</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>I use MT for words (WORDS)</td><td>4.11</td><td>0.67</td></tr><tr><td>I use MT for sentences (SENTS)</td><td>3.56</td><td>0.62</td></tr></table></body></html>

Student 3: A paragraph is not a good idea, really.

Participants in both groups acknowledged that they or some of their classmates did use MT to translate paragraphs or whole texts in certain situations, and this is especially the case when working to tight deadlines. They do so based on the situation which they find themselves in (overloaded) and their awarenessof the speed of the technology. For example, in Excerpt 8, the student described situations where she had imited time to complete her writing assignments and thus wrote whole passages in her first language and then resorted to MT to get the final work in English, although the student also mentioned that she would improve the grammar of the MT output. The student's actions reflect an awarenes that the technology ofers sed in terms of producing work in English and can thus be drawn upon when needed to finish English writing assignments quickly. She also knew that the grammaticl capability of MT was not completely reliable, so she needed to deploy her English language resources o refine the output. Thus, the student responded to the situation by straegicall aligning the technological affordance and her L1 and L2 resources in relation to her communication needs.

Excerpt 8 (Focus group 2)

Student 1: And sometimes, especially in the urgent time, I always write down allof in Chinese and, translate in English, and correct the grammar mistakes.

Interviewer 1: You said in the urgent times, what you mean. When you've got a lot of writing to do, and not enough time.

Student 1: Yes, but you know recently I need to write two thousand five words esays, within a week. And it's so urgent for m

The theme of hybrid use is also reflected in terms of using MT together with other resources in the students' communicative repertoire, and it is not used simply as a substitute for their own writing. Insted, the students align the technological affordance with their own inguistic resource and other environmentalaffordances in a strategic and critical way to construct meaning in writing. The following three excerpts illustrate this:

Excerpt 9 (Group 1)

Student 6: I will writ immediately in English. But maybe there's some, one or two sentence, I don't think my expression is good, maybe I willuse the translator to get a translate result. But that result is just a reference. Maybe there're some words, or something like that, the translated reult is better than my expression, and I wil relace my expresion into the translated result. But it's just something, one or two sentence, I won't use a whole paragraph, I don't like that.

Interviewer 2: So you mean you compared the translation, from the translation software and your original work and see,

Student 6: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think the whole copy is a good thing. Because that, through this method we can learn something, for example the better expression, and something like that. But if we just copy, we cannot improve ourselves by use a translator.

Excerpt 10 (Group 2)

Student 2: I willuse English to writ the topic sentence, then I will use Chinese to express what I want to say, then I willuse online translation, but I won't use it directly, I will orrect some grammar mistakes, and I need to say, I need to add some signposting languages. Because according to the Chinese writing habits, we used to use and, with a douhaoer (comma) bingqie ((in addition)), but it's a little strange in English, so I need to check.

Excerpt 11 (Group 1)

Student 3: You have to make sure the result, the translation result is what you want to say.

Student 5: And sometimes it's ridiculous.

((students laughter))

Student 3: Yeah, ridiculous. And not just Chinese to English or English to Chinese, and Japanese to English sometimes is also ridiculous. I think the translator, this is the biggest problem of the translator. Yeah.

[ ...]

Student 5: And sometimes you want to look for a concept, or anational policy, you can never use the translator, and you just can search it from the Internet and some articles.

Student 3: Yeah, that's a better way.

In Excerpt 9, the student described that she drew upon her own knowledge of English to write her essays and evaluate her own output. When dissatisfied with the meaning constructed by her own English inguistic resources, she said she deployed both her Chinese ingustic resource and MT to help her achieve meaning. However, she stated that he would not blindly accept whatever MT produced but would instead compare the MT output and her own output in terms of achieving meaning. When the MT output beter helped her, she embedded the MT-translated pieces with her own language. The student, thus, engaged in aligning MT with her bilingual resources to construct meaning based on her language awarenes and understanding of the affordances and limitations of the

technology.

The way that the student in Excerpt 10 stated she draws upon her bilingual resources and MT in writing iffers from that described in Excerpt 9. Specifically, the student in Excerpt 10 uses her English linguistic resources to write topic sentences in her essays and uss Chinese linguistic resource for the remaining parts. When obtaining MT-translated piees, she exploits her English literacy knowledge to refine the grammar and improve the transitions in an essay. Despite the variation in usage, this student demonstrated the ability to align the technological affordance with her bilingual resources and literacy knowledge in relation to creating meaning in writing essays.

In addition to manipulating linguistic resources, participants featuring in Excerpt 11 said that they draw on other mediational ools including reading materials and the Internet, when finding that MT and their own bilingual resource could not support them in communicating concepts. Such mediational strategies demonstrate their understanding of the affordances and limitations of various resources in their communicative repertoire, and their competence at aligning them to communicate concepts in writing.

Finally, in addition to the two aforementioned communication needs of producing texts quickly and achieving meaning succesfull, the data reveals that students use MT to meet other needs in writing, which form the last aspect of hybrid use: for different communication needs. The student in Excerpt 1 articulated that she uses MT to search for synonyms for her own words, while the student in Excerpt 12 below described that she uses it to verify her own L2 written output. The fact that students deploy MT o ulfil such varied communication needs means that they are aware of what the technology afords them in specific sitations and are able to align it with other meaning-making resources in their communicative repertoires to achieve meaning in writing.

Excerpt 12 (Group 2)

Student 4:I used to write my essay first with Chinese, and then I return it t the English. But I willalsouse the translation app to check if there is some problems and mistakes.

Interviewer 2: Okay. How do you check. How do you check.

Student 4: I will for example there are some words, and some sentences I think is, maybeI writ it is it is unogicl, and  will use the translation app.

Interviewer 2: Okay. So you compare your work with the result output from the translation software.

# 4.4. Facilitating English learning

The final theme that emerged from the focus groups and related to students usage of MT is facilitating their English learning, as opposed to substituting it Most of the students in the two groups expressed the view that MT was a too to help them learn English, rather than something that can replace the need for learning. For example, the students in the first two excerpts below described using MT to obtain new words they then learned or reviewed in order to improve their English. What is worth noticing in Excerpt 13 below is that the student's EAP teacher recommended using MT to look up new vocabulary several times to learnit, which suggests that not only students but als some teachers regard MT not just as a resource o support meaning construction in writing, but also as a mediational tool for earning English vocabulary. Furthermore, the student in Excerpt 15 mentioned that MT becomes the mediational means of improving English when students use i o learn vocabulary, as opposed to relying on it as asubstitute for their own writig (which is similar to what Student 6 expressed in Excerpt 9). This demonstrates the students' awareness that the potential of the technology to become a mediational means of learning English depends on students' usage of it.

Excerpt 13 (Group 1)

Student 2: As our teacher, maybe your teacher will ell you, if you don't know a word, you can check it in atranslator, and second time you seei, you didn't remember it. You check it twice, and you oh it's it i, so maybe the third time you remember the word.

Excerpt 14 (Group 1)

Student 6: Actually, I have learned a lot from the translator, because every time I get a bettr word or a better sentence, I will keep some note for it. So, and I find that I always have some similar expression in my esays. For example, can replace the word many into numerous. And this i a better word, and I can use this word in a lot of essays, ecause we have to expressthe meaning many for a lot of times. Many essays need this expression. So with this progres I think I can, the next time I want to express this meaning, I dont need to use the translator again. So I willbecome less rely on the translator. So I think it i a kind of progres, and the translator actually helped me improve my English, to some extent I think.

Excerpt 15 (Group 2)

Student 3: [...] And also I think there are still a lot of merits in using the translation apps.

Interviewer 1: Such as?

Student 3: Such as you can check out the words that you do not understand, and you learn them, the synonyms of them, and the usage in different context in different sentences. It depends on how you react to it I think. Yeah.

Interviewer 1: So what you're actuall saying there is that, the online translation i helping you get better, it's not a relacement for learning English. It's helping you get better at English.

Student 3: Part of it. But if you just copy what it provide you, that's not a good way for you to learn English.

# 5. Discussion

The results of the questionnaire offer a number of insights into the use of MT. This section first adresses the data gathered during the questionnaire and focus groups before considering the emergent themes from the focus groups, which are relevant to students practices. Next, some of the wider impacts of these findings for the EAP field are considered.

# 5.1. Widespread use

Firstly, it i clear that the usage of these technologies is embedded in studet practice. A large umber of students use them, both for looking up single words and also for translating longer stretches of language. While the questionnaire did not ask whether this was to translate into, or out of, the target language, students in the two focus groups confirmed that the translation happened in both directions, and this is clearly becoming a normalised student practice.

# 5.2. Student views and use of the technology

The students were clearly ambivalent about the quality of the output of MT technologies they normally consult, which were Baidu and Youdao in this context. They are aware that the software of both have shortcomings, especially when dealing with culturallyrooted idioms or polysemous words, which supports the previous findings of Lee and Briggs (2021). In addition to the dilemma of not finding accurate words or phrases in English to express Chinese idioms or polysemous words, participants reported finding MT's abilities to produce accurate English translations of specific policies or traditional cultural elements unreliable. Whilethis challenge could happen in the translation practice of any language, and this shortcoming could be improved by collcting more up-to-date data, establishing a system of regulation, and incorporating other technologies (Lee, 2020), Chinese students may need to be more critical and cautious when using MT output, not only due to the radicall different social and cultural stem between English and Chinese, but also because of the systematic differences between the two languages.

The students in this study reported being unwilling to cede complete control of their writing to the automated system by simply writing in Chinse for translation into English. In fact, they regard it as aesource that mediates their writing, so they engage with the technology strategicall to construct meaning in actual EAP writing. As demonstrated in this current study, the students deploy the technologicalaffordance in a hybrid way, which s eflected in three aspects, two of which are translating varied lengths of text and fulflling different communcative needs. tudents edto find advanced-level expressions for use in EAP writing, as well as search for synonyms for their own words, or verify their own English output. The data reveal that the students are aware that the technology features a breadth of lexis and that it produces more accurate output when translating shorter pieces of language. As such, they leverage the strengths of the system to translate words and phrases more ofe, but critically evaluate the output, especially when culturall related. This reflects compatibility with other studies finding that MT-asisted writing features richer lexical resources (Crossley, 2018; Kol et a., 2018). This study has produced evidence that as deadines of thir writing assgnments aproach, students take advantage of the speed of MT to produce paragraphs or whole texts. However, they then refine the grammar and logical transition within the output owing to a consensus that MT's capabilit is not completely reliable in terms of translating longer stretches of text Generall speaking, students apear to regard MT as a stratey with which to achieve communicative succes as opposed to substitute for their own writing. The students flexible deployment of MT seems to be for the expres purpose of fulilling thir situated communicative needs and is based on their awareness of the affordances and limitations of the technology. As such, their machine-asisted translation practices are strategic, which is compatible with previous studies investigating bilingual or multilingual pupils' MT practices in their production of EAL texts (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Vogel et al., 2018).

It is noteworthy that analysis of the data produces no correlation between students perceptions and use of MT and their English competence. It would perhaps sem intuitive to suggest that students with a lower language proficiency may use MT more regularly, but this does not sem to be the case when the questionnaire results are considered. There is also no apparent link between students positive (or not) atitude t learning English and their propensity to be more or les favourable towards the use of MT in an Englsh as a medium of instruction (EMI) context. However, the focus group data indicate that a number of external factors, including tight deadines or concen about low grades, may lead to a higher level of reliance and probably les critical use of MT. Therefore, students motivations to use MT, or the factors restricting its use, are not as simple as concerns about language abilit or attitudes to language learning.

# .3. Parallels between MT-assisted EAP writing and translanguaging practices

Students' aligning of MT with other resources intheir communicatie repertoires, covered here inthe theme of hybrid use, provides evidence of bilingual students translanguaging practices in actual EAP writing. A monolingual orientation towards MT-assisted writing practice fails to recognize the assemblage and synergistical interaction of resources within it, thus depicting them in a reductive way. Taking the lens of translanguaging pedagogy and communicative repertoire (Canagarajah, 2018; Cenoz & Gorter,

2017; Lin, 2015), the current study shows students practices of using Chinese and English in a dynamic and functionally integrated manner; legitimizes the meaning-making roles of MT, students' L1 and L2 linguisic resources and literacy, reading materials, and the Internet; and values the students' abilities of strategically deploying them as a communicative repertoire in order to fulfill hir communication needs in EAP writing. The students start their communication from the specific situations they find themselves in and reflect a clear understanding of their communication needs. They also seem acutely aware of the affordances and limitations of the linguistic resources, literacy knowledge, technology, and environmental factors in those situations. They manipulate resources from both their languages to organize and mediate their processes in meaning construction, which makes the boundary between the two languages seem softened in their writing processes, as suggested by Cenoz and Gorter (2020b) and Leung and Valdes (2019. Meanwhile, they adopt dynamic mediational means, aligning them with their bilingual resources to achieve meaning and fulfll thir needs. Their practice reflect their interpreting and ealuating activitie, strateic thinking and action, and adaptability in the process of EAP writing. This hows that what the students draw upon is not simply the propositional knowledge of grammar or vocabulary, but the competence of how to communicate in specific EAP writing contexts. This also reminds us that dynamically using resources in multilingual repertoires is a natural and fundamental part of the foreign language classoom where students wil inevitably use their own language at some point. From a practice point of view, it i a feature of the classroom that can be used to help students, rather than a feature to be suppressed (Canagarajah, 2011).

Students also connect learning with use in specific situations where input is embedded, thus developing their ability to commu. nicate in English through practice. In addition to aligning MT and other resources into a communicative repertoire to construct meaning in their EAP writing proces, the students in the current study alo reported using MT as a resource t facilitate their English learning. They are open to the English expressions, synonyms and usage which MT offers in specificontexts. This orientation towards MT leads the students to take opportunities to gain from its contribution, enabling them to develop their English repertoires through using MT in order to communicate meanings in their future EAP writing. Therefore, they learn purposefully and meaningfully when aligning MT and other resources to communicate in EAP writing. Their strategy of learning from practice assts them in advancing towards higher English proficiency (Canagarajah, 2013).

# 5.4. Wider considerations

Regarding students as translinguals involves a shift f emphasis in the classoom. Technological assistance can empower students to more rapidly manoeuvre past linguistic plateaus and move on to dealing with aspects of academic expression that demand greater understanding of the norms and expectations of the Academic Community (Hyland, 2006). The next section puts forward some recommendations for principles to be considered in the light of advances in MT during pedagogic development design stages.

# 5.5. Pedagogic adjustments

# 5.5.1. MT literacy

Students must develop a number of digital literacies as they advance through their academic carer. These literacies include the abilit to search efectively, maintain digital wellbeing, and navigate universt systems. On top of thee, this study recommends that students who do not share their first language with their institution also develop a set of literacies to deal with MT. Such iteracies include the abilit to understand where the outut ftheM ystem is ikely to be approriate as well as where i i likly toneed more care, such as with idiomatic or very culturally specific uses of language. Such action will nable the students to enhance their abilities as digital translinguals. A writer with strong T literacies should be able to produce texts in their own language whichi es likely to be mistranslated by a system and predict when the output of the translation is likely to have been misinterpreted by the software.

# 5.5.2. Understanding limits of technology

In addition, students should be able to understand that EAP writing is much more involved than simply putting the right words into the right grammatical structure. There are a number f aspects beyond the sentence level, from organisation to argumentation, from intertextuality to expression of levels of caution, which MT is at present not capable of dealing with efectively. At present, MT produces efective translation outut at the sentence level, but fals todeal with differences in ars such as metadiscourse Hyland & Tse, 2004). For example, MT flls short of functional language such as hedging devices, unles it is included in the input. As such, academic writers using MT must be aware of when the system is able to be a useful id and guide, but also when it is more likely to produce inappropriate writing.

# 5.5.3. Encouraging parallel, not serial use

Considering the above,it is important to consider the use of T technologies in EAP as a parall technology, as opposed to a serial technology. In other word, conventional learning should run alongside technologically enhanced learning, rather than one taking place until a certain time or stage, to then be relaced by another. To exploit the potential of this technology, MT must be viewed as an extra resource in the hands of the students, in the same way that bilingualism is viewed in translanguaging pedagogies as aresource for students and educators to draw upon, rather than something to be compartmentalised in the weekly timetable. Consequently, the aim of an MT enhanced pedagogy is not to separate the two uses, but to encourage students to become digitally enhanced bilinguals, where the technology and the personal side of the learning work together.

# 6. Conclusion

The use of MT was found to be widespread from the data pertaining to the students in the survey. However, the data also reflect the notion that the stdets do not uncriticly trust theoutut of the sstms, ethr in terms f linguistic qualit, o i the sense that T may allow them to circumvent the process f lerning English. What seems to come across from the data analysis i a more pragmatic and thoughtful useof this technology; it exist, and students are for the most part willing to use it ad allow it to help them reach long term academic goals.

This paper does not seek to suggest that the EAP students in thistudy are functioning as fulltranslingual. Instead it would seek to draw parallels between translanguaging theory and the use of MT. In addition, it would be very difficult to argue that the EAP community should ignore the impact, potential risks, and advantages of this technology. Instead, the EAP community can lern lessons from translingual pedagogy, as well as seek to understand how MT can be built ino existing pedagogy, to develop students who are digitally enhanced bilinguals capable of moving seamlessly between language communities, supported by the technology.

With this in mind, further research opportunities into this area abound. Fruitful avenues for enquiry could include speak-aloud protocols to investigate how students actually use MT while writing, among other such learner strategy oriented exploration. Such research could offer useful insights upon which a more MT based pedagogy can be developed.
