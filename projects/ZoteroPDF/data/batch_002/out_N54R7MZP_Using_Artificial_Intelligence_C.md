# Abstract

Self-regulated learning (SRL) has been integrated into English-as-a-Foreign Language (EFL) reading instruction to enhance students’ reading achievement. Evidence indicates that providing personalized support is critical to SRL. However, providing personalized support is time-consuming and challenging to implement in language classrooms. Although personalized support has been built into many online reading systems, the support is often delivered in a one-way manner, with little chance for follow-up discussions. This innovation in practice introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed to provide personalized SRL support for EFL students in reading. The AI chatbot was designed as a reading companion to facilitate active, out-of-class reading that expands in-class instruction. By giving autonomy to students to engage with appropriate reading materials and receive personalized self-regulated reading (SRR) guidance, the innovation empowered learners to overcome challenges in the reading process and facilitated their use of SRR strategies. The pedagogical values of the innovation were explored from students’ perspectives. Future pedagogical directions for AI-supported SRR instruction is also discussed.

# Introduction

Reading plays a crucial role in academic success and lifelong learning (Merke et al., 2023). However, it poses challenges for English-as-a-Foreign Language (EFL) learners, as reading involves complex meaning-making processes (Sashikala and Chye, 2023). Recently, self-regulated learning (SRL) instruction has been increasingly integrated into reading and has shown effectiveness in enhancing reading achievement (Horner & Shwery, 2002). SRL is a proactive and adaptive process by which learners plan and adjust thoughts, feelings and actions to attain their learning goals (Zimmerman, 2002). Readers with SRL skills tend to actively engage in reading comprehension processes by employing metacognitive, motivational and behavioural strategies (Zimmerman, 1990). They can set realistic goals, employ effective cognitive strategies, monitor understanding, evaluate progress and create optimal reading environments (Sashikala and Chye, 2023). Therefore, cultivating self-regulated reading (SRR) is essential for EFL students to become proficient readers and independent learners.

Self-regulated learning instruction refers to activities or events that aim to amplify and/or strengthen SRL skills (Araka et al., 2020). Personalized SRL instruction, tailoring learning experiences and strategies based on individual needs, is more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach (Jin et al., 2023). Research has shown that personalized SRL instruction enhances reading engagement and reading comprehension (e.g., Uçak and Kartal, 2023).

However, personalized SRL instruction is challenging for teachers to implement in practice due to the large class size and limited time. Although online/digital reading programs have started integrating personalized SRL support in the form of prompts, visualization and feedback, learners are positioned as the mere recipients of the information with little chance for further negotiation. Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) show potential as a pedagogical solution to these problems (Chang et al., 2023). AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are large language models (LLMs) capable of simulating human-like conversations. They have been leveraged for various educational purposes, including personalized instruction, concept learning, collaboration, assessment preparation and mental health support (Labadze et al., 2023). Researchers have underscored the promise of AI chatbots in facilitating SRL instruction in personalized feedback and scaffolding (e.g., Jin et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2022). Nevertheless, research on AI chatbots in this area is still in its infancy, and there is an urgent need to explore their pedagogical integration to support the SRL process (Chang et al., 2023). Moreover, limited studies have explored the effects of AI-supported SRL instruction in reading contexts.

To fill this gap, this innovation proposes an AI-supported chatbot, ReadMate, designed to provide personalized support for SRR, empowering learners to effectively engage with English texts outside the classroom. Supporting SRR outside class is important for language learning since in-class learning cannot provide language use experience that is sufficient or adequately diverse for language development (Reinders et al., 2022). This innovation aims to facilitate effective SRR outside the classroom to expand classroom instruction.

# The Teaching Context

The innovation was conducted at a faculty of foreign languages in a Chinese university with a compulsory course – Extensive Reading. The course aimed to foster strategic reading behaviour and develop proficient readers. It comprised modules covering various reading strategies, such as context clues, topic/main idea, cohesion and coherence, and text types. A team of five teachers, including the first author, taught this course to students majoring in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), Business English and English Translation. Students were required to receive 32 weeks of in-class instruction in an academic year and complete weekly out-of-class reading tasks. These tasks involved one or two texts with accompanying reading comprehension questions assigned by teachers each week. Students were also encouraged to engage in voluntary reading of self-selected reading materials. Students were asked to practise the reading strategies acquired in the course while completing out-of-class reading tasks.

This innovation was implemented in a TEFL class $( n = 4 1$ ; male: 5; female: 36) involving first-year students aged 18 to 21. Their English reading proficiency was at an intermediate level based on their scores on the reading section of the Test of English as Foreigner Language (TOEFL). The TOEFL, as a widely recognized international standardized placement examination, was utilized by teachers of this course to assess students’ reading proficiency at the beginning and end of the academic year. The first author, with five years of teaching experience, implemented this innovation.

# Reasons for the Innovation

Two main reasons drove the initiation of this practical innovation. Firstly, the innovation was prompted by our aim to address some obstacles faced by students in completing the out-of-class reading tasks. Students were observed to be challenged in the following aspects: (a) having difficulty locating and selecting suitable reading materials; and (b) lacking SRR strategies and personalized support to overcome challenges in English reading (e.g., lack of interest and too many unknown words). Secondly, the innovation responded to the call for instructional practices of incorporating AI into SRL support to empower students to become self-regulated and lifelong learners. Researchers have underscored the potential of chatbots in supporting students’ SRL process by providing personalized and interactive learning experiences and the necessity of exploring pedagogical approaches by utilizing chatbots to enrich the learning experience (e.g., Jin et al., 2023; Chang et al., 2023).

# The Innovation

# Phase 1: Needs Analysis

During the initial phase, a needs analysis was conducted to identify the common challenges students encountered in reading. The analysis involved reviewing related literature from peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Merke et al., 2023; Horner and Shwery, 2002) and interviewing four extensive reading teachers and nine students with diverse reading proficiency levels. As outlined in Appendix A, three domains of common challenges in reading were uncovered: motivational, behavioural and cognitive challenges. Motivational challenges arose from the struggle to manage affective states during reading activities (e.g., lack of confidence) (Schunk and Zimmerman, 2012). Behavioural challenges manifested in the difficulty of selecting, structuring and creating a positive social and physical environment for reading (e.g., distractions) (Zimmerman, 1990). Cognitive challenges involved difficulties related to accomplishing reading tasks using cognitive abilities (e.g., too many unknown words) (Zimmerman, 2002).

# Phase 2: Chatbot Development

ReadMate, a customized reading platform powered by ChatGPT 3.5, is an innovative tool to support students’ SRR. Within this platform, a ChatGPT-powered chatbot named Reade was embedded to support students’ selection of reading materials by recommending personalized reading articles that align with their reading proficiency and preferences, and to scaffold students’ use of self-regulation strategies to overcome behavioural, cognitive and motivational challenges in self-directed reading. The platform is currently under refinement to ensure optimal design and functionality before it becomes accessible to the public.

Scaffolding 1: Selecting Reading Materials. As mentioned above, the first obstacle students often face is difficulty choosing appropriate materials for their out-of-class reading activities. Due to limited reading experience, students were observed relying on superficial selection strategies such as book covers rather than considering interests and reading level, which were deemed as essential in reading material selection (Merke et al., 2023). As Attali et al. (2022) pointed out, AI text generation techniques provide a means to generate diverse and contextually relevant reading passages that align with the characteristics of the desired text output. For example, Lee et al. (2023) utilized AI technology to create reading materials based on EFL students’ preferences for genre and theme keywords to enhance their reading enjoyment. In ReadMate, to scaffold students’ article selection by offering more personalized content, Reade was designed to generate English articles that align with students’ perceived reading levels and reading preferences regarding the text genre and word length.

Figure 1. Article selection page.

Figure 2. Drop-down menu of: (a) text types; (b) reading level; (c) article length; and (d) self-assessment grid on reading comprehension.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of the article selection page. To generate appropriate English texts, ReadMate prompts students to select their preference for text types (Figure 2(a)), article lengths (Figure 2(c)) and their perceived reading level (Figure 2(b)). To facilitate their selection, students can click on the bubble icon next to each choice. The bubble icon for genre choice directs students to a website (https://www.lc.cityu.edu. hk/ELSS/Resource/Understanding%20Text%20(Genre)%20Types/) that delineates the communicative purposes, text structure and language features of different text types. This online resource is expected to guide students’ selection of genre preferences. The bubble icon accompanying the reading proficiency choice directs students to a self-assessment grid on reading comprehension (Figure 2(d)) adopted from the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for Language levels. Once students have chosen the genre, reading level and article length, they can click the ‘Article Discovery’ button to activate a researcher-engineered prompt (see Appendix B). This prompt has undergone rigorous validation by the researchers and has been carefully reviewed by two prompt engineering experts. It enables the generation of an article that meets students’ needs.

Scaffolding 2: Utilization of SRR Strategies. To scaffold students’ needs for support on SRR strategies and for personalized guidance during reading, existing literature has underscored the importance of providing timely and personalized SRL support (Uçak and Kartal, 2023). As suggested by Jin et al. (2023), AI has emerged as a powerful tool to scaffold complex SRL processes and deliver SRL strategies. AI tools that utilize Machine Reading Comprehension, a subfield of natural language processing, can understand and answer questions about a given text, and thus are able to provide contextualized SRL support based on a given text (Shin et al., 2022). To provide timely and personalized support, Reade allows students to interact with the chatbot, Reade, to seek SRR strategies to help them overcome the three domains of challenges in reading (i.e., motivational, cognitive and behavioural challenges).

![](img/f4457fff48e71a42eedd099cdd47f53680394fb0575e62a01f6777ab85338d5a.jpg)  
Figure 3. Overview of design principles, features, and functions.

Figure 3 provides an overview of the design principles, features and functions of the SRL support page. Following Chang et al.’s (2023) recommendation on the key principles of developing chatbots to support SRL in educational practice, ReadMate featured three aspects of SRL support: (a) goal setting and prompting; (b) feedback and selfassessment; and (c) personalized support. Goal setting and prompting was realized by prompting students to set goals and plan SRL strategies. Feedback and self-assessment were operationalized by engaging students to reflect on their use of chatbot-suggested SRL strategies in problem-solving. Personalized support was delivered through tailored feedback and guidance on SRL strategies that supported students’ individualized learning goals and preferences. As shown in Figure 3, the ‘Help and Ask’ buttons are AI-enhanced, while planning strategies and the self-checklist are not.

Regarding the SRL support process for this innovation in practice, students were prompted to set goals for SRR strategies that they planned to counteract their reading challenges. Figure 4 illustrates an example of planning strategies to overcome a challenge – lack of confidence. Clicking on the ‘Add One More’ button, students were directed to the planning strategies page, where they could select from a list of reading challenges and corresponding strategies. Using a drop-down menu, students could set up to six strategy goals that they wanted to experiment with. These strategies (see Appendix A) were created based on course teachers’ previous teaching experiences, as well as effective strategies recommended in existing self-regulated language learning and reading instruction literature (Wang and Bai, 2017; Zhang et al., 2014).

After planning the strategies, students started reading texts and utilizing the chosen strategies. They could take notes while reading by using the note-taking feature located at the bottom left corner of the SRL support page (Figure 5). Students monitored and reflected on their progress and performance by utilizing the self-checklist feature in the top left corner (Figure 5), where they were instructed to click on the Heart icon when they utilized a specific strategy. This feature allowed them to assess their implementation of the chosen strategies and evaluate their progress on a specific strategy.

Figure 5. Self-regulated learning support page.

Moreover, students could seek help from the ChatGPT-powered chatbot, Reade, for strategy utilization. The process was initiated by clicking the ‘Help’ button located on the right side of the page (Figure 5). Clicking the ‘Help’ button activated the predetermined strategies that students had planned before reading. Students could select the specific strategy that they needed help with. Upon selecting a specific strategy, a researcher-engineered prompt (see Appendix B) was communicated to Reade. Upon receiving the prompt, Reade provided elaboration on the strategy and illustrated how to employ the strategy with examples from the reading text. Students could seek further elaboration or clarification by inputting follow-up questions. Additionally, students could input queries related to the text and have a discussion with Reade by clicking on the ‘Ask’ button. Figure 6 demonstrates the support that students have access to once clicking on the self-regulated strategy – looking for context clues.

# Phase 3: Implementation

During the 2023 autumn semester, 41 students used ReadMate for two months to support their out-of-class reading. The first author conducted a 90-min in-class tutorial, introducing SRR strategies and the functions of ReadMate. Throughout the two-month period, students were expected to incorporate ReadMate into their weekly reading routine, reading at least one text per week with its assistance. However, we observed that many students were reluctant to integrate ReadMate into their learning routine due to various factors such as technical difficulties, unfamiliarity with SRR strategies and resistance to change. To address these challenges, we provided ongoing support and guidance to students. First, we offered technical assistance to students who experienced difficulties in using ReadMate. Second, we conducted regular check-ins and in-class discussions (see sample questions in Appendix C) to prompt students to reflect on their strategy utilization and evaluate the usefulness of the strategies using ReadMate. Third, we offered extra credit or rewards for students who consistently and effectively utilized ReadMate in their reading practice. At the end of the semester, student perceptions were elicited through open-ended survey questions and interviews.

# Reflection

Students generally had a positive perception of ReadMate. They appreciated the article generation function that provided texts tailored to their reading levels and personal preferences. This function motivated them to engage with the texts and enjoy the reading process. Some explained:

ReadMate allows me to choose texts that match my reading abilities and offers various genre options. I enjoy narrative texts as they make reading enjoyable and motivate me to read regularly. (Student 1).

Furthermore, students valued the feature of planning their SRR strategy to overcome practical problems:

ReadMate is helpful in addressing my specific challenges; I used to be unsure about which strategies could tackle my challenges, but the tailored list of strategies helped me address my individual needs. (Student 9)

Students further commented that the interaction with ReadMate was helpful in improving their reading skills:

ReadMate’s instant feedback and explanations when I have difficulties understanding a passage help me comprehend the text. (Student 6)

Additionally, students reported that this approach improved their awareness of the strategies to enhance reading achievement. The elaboration and examples provided by the chatbot provided valuable guidance in understanding and implementing those strategies:

ReadMate increases my awareness of strategies such as goal-setting, using context clues, and positive self-talk. ReadMate offers detailed examples and instructions within the texts, which helped me to understand and use these strategies effectively. (Student 8)

However, after an extensive analysis of data from multiple sources, a few limitations exist. Firstly, Reade may not generate reading passages that fully align with their individual interests. This restriction is because Reade currently offers choices of text types and word length but not the topics that they are interested in exploring. Secondly, students may not be able to assess their reading level accurately through using the self-assessment grid based on CEFR levels, which was a crude measure of reading proficiency in reference to the CEFR framework. Thirdly, the list of common challenges outlined in Appendix A may not have covered all the difficulties that students face when reading outside of class. Future researchers and teachers should work collaboratively to address these limitations and refine AI-powered systems such as ReadMate to optimize their effectiveness in supporting SRR.

# Future Pedagogical Directions

This innovation paper proposed an AI-supported SRR approach and presented ReadMate, an AI chatbot system designed to enhance students’ SRR by scaffolding their article selection and needs for personalized SRL support. A customized chatbot named Reade was developed within this system, powered by LLMs, to provide literature-informed field-collected reading challenges and strategies tailored specifically for EFL students’ self-directed reading. The positive feedback received from students indicates the potential of the customized chatbot to offer more catered SRL support to address their reading challenges. However, students also reported some limitations of the system. To address these limitations, it is important for future development in AI-supported SRR systems to consider the following aspects: first, there is a need to expand the scope of personalization that AI can support. This could involve leveraging LLMs to customize reading materials based on personal interests. Second, integrating performance-based measurements of reading proficiency or adopting a more fine-grained framework for self-appraisal of reading levels would enhance the capability of chatbots to generate appropriate reading materials that cater to individual reading proficiency. Third, it is important to provide space for users to input their own challenges, allowing the chatbot to better address the specific needs of individual learners.

In conclusion, the innovation was implemented successfully and perceived as useful in supporting SRR. Despite some limitations, ReadMate presented its potential to enhance students’ awareness and utilization of self-regulated strategies to improve their reading achievement. We hope our innovative practice encourages teachers to embrace AI chatbots as a valuable tool for enriching students’ English language learning and SRL in general.
