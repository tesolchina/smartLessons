# ABSTRACT

Keywords:   
Western-trained teachers   
Western L2 writing pedagogies   
EFL writing instruction   
Tensions   
Emotion   
Agency

In response to the need for more attention to teachers of writing (Lee, 2024), this collaborative autoethnography (CAE) aims to explore the lived experiences of Western-trained teachers teaching EFL writing in the tertiary-level educational context of Vietnam. Drawing upon the concepts of systemic tensions, emotion, and agency from an activity theoretical perspective, we report on tensions we encountered between our Western-based TEsOL education and our local activity of teaching EFL writing as well as on how we emotionally and agentively responded to these tensions to allow for practices compatible with the local context. Our CAE unveiled a host of intricate tensions between multiple components of our activity systems. These tensions triggered our emotional responses, which in turn spurred us to exercise our pedagogical and relational agency to reconstruct our pedagogical cognition and implement adaptive pedagogies. Notably, the dynamic interplay between our tensions, emotion, agency constituted critical experiences which fostered the emergence of participatory pedagogical content knowledge of writing, and in turn, of situated possibilities for learning and teaching EFL writing. The study provides implications for Western-based TEsOL teacher education and relevant stakeholders regarding how to better support teachers like us in our transition from learning in the West to teaching in the East.

# 1. Introduction

Alongside transnationalism in the field of TEs0L (Zhu & McKinley, 2021), a snowballing number of teachers from non-native English-speaking countries,colloquiall referred to as the East, have sought professional training and pursue their graduate TESOL studies in the West, encompassing Europe, North America,Australia, and New Zealand (Hong & Pawan, 2018). This phenomenon extends to our country, Vietnam, where a plethora of scholarship schemes, such as the U.S. Government's Fulbright Programme, Australian Awards Scholarships, New Zealand-ASEAN Scholarships, and Vietnam's domestic funding initiatives (Nguyen & Walkin. shaw, 2018), have enabled teachers' pursuit f education in Western academic institutions. An ssue pertinent to this phenomenon is the post-return endeavours of these Western-trained teachers to apply their knowledge and skill whils navigating the intricacies of cross-cultural knowledge transfer into teaching in their local context (Hong & Pawan, 2018; Li & Edwards, 2013; Liyanage & Bartlet, 2008).

Research in relation to the East-West interaction has been conducted in various EFL contexts, such as Saudi Arabia (Barnawi & Phan, 2015), Malaysia (Macalister, 2016), and notably China (Gao, 2018; Hong & Pawan, 2018; Li & Edwards, 2013; Lin & Shi, 2024; Lu & Ares, 2015; Lu & Moore, 2018). A thread in this line of research is that teachers struggles lie amidst educational discrepancies between the Eastern context, where teaching tend to be normatively structured, subject-centred, and curriculum-oriented, and the English-speaking West, often characteried by leaner-centred, skills-based aproaches, and curricular flexibility (Holliday, 1994; Zhang, 2016). However litte attntion has bee paid to how Western theories and practice are transplante in Vietnam In this EFL context, scant research to date has documented only a few issues such as teachers' agency in applying knowledge and experience acquired overseas and their curriculum-related autonomy (Nguyen & Walkinshaw, 2018) and teachers' identity dynamics (Phan, 2007). Given the potentia of the Vietnamese context contributing a local account of the ssue to the intenational literature, greater attention needs to be given to Vietnamese teachers' transitional experiences.

Therefore, our autoethnographic research delves into the East-West dynamics in Vietnam, an underrepresented EFL context in the extant literature. As insiders who have undergone formal TEsoL training in the West and hold a particular interest in EFL writing, we are personally driven to share our instructional experiences in the local context, thus expanding the current limited literature on L2 writing tachers (Lee, 2024) and especiall the complex interaction between Western L2 writing pedagogies and the ocal realities of EFL writing instruction. Our goal is to unravel the potential tensions experienced by Western-trained teachers like ourselves in a non-Western setting and their emotional responses to and agentive negotiation of these tensions to make locally meaningful ense of Western pedagogies in their instructional practices.

Practically, our study is expected to contribute to current understandings of Western-trained L2 writing teachers' transitional experiences and provide implications for supporting these stakeholders in navigating their tensions, managing their emotions, and exercising their agency-an interplay that contributes totheir professional learning, practice, and development (Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024; Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). It is also expected that the insights gleaned from our study will encourage relevant stakeholders whose experiences may paralle ours to become more attuned to the contextual sensitivity of L2 writig (Casanave, 209; Seloni & Le, 2019) and more critical of the applicability of Western pedagogies. This, in turn, could inform local policy-making regarding EFL writing instruction and facilitate the construction of locally sensitive teaching practices.

Theoretically, we contribute to the scholarship on Western-trained language teachers by highlighting the potential of activity theory to shed light on the intricate interrelationship between East-West tensions, emotion, and agency. Exploring this interrea tionship through the lens of activity theory--a powerful analytical framework for studying teachers' professional learning and development (Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024; Dang, 2013; Feryok, 2012; Nguyen & Ngo, 2023), and collaborative autoethnography-a potential method of exploring teacher agency (Zhu et l., 2024), our study is anticipated to unravel unique emic experiences in activity in relation to the tension-emotion-agency interplay that might not be discovered from an etic perspective.

# 2. Research background

# 2.1. Western L2 writing pedagogies and EFL writing instruction

Approximately three decades ago, Pennycook (1994) noted the West is etter ideology both in teaching and teacher education, and this notion has persted in L2 writing. This dominance however fails to acknowledge the cultural specificity of L2 writing (Xu, 2016) and the idiosyncrasies of EFL writing practices (Reichelt, 2019). Indeed, much of the empirical iterature has highlighted the misalignment between Western pedagogies and EFL writing instruction, along with diverse contextual factors responsibl for this discrepancy.

The related literature has documented teacher factors such as teachers' cultural beliefs in opposition to Western pedagogies (Clachar, 200) and deficient training and professional development (Saenkhum, 2019) as roadblocks to their implementation. Unaldi et al. (2019) aditionally identified teachers limited written communication skils as mitigating their confidence in teaching, presenting the need for localised training to accommodate teachers reflection on rather than uncritical adoption of Westen pedagogies. Other contributing factors include teachers' overwhelming workloads (Leki, 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Reichelt, 2019), time constraints (Almutwakil & Alshakhi, 2022), intolerance of learner mistakes (McCarthey, 2019) and accuracy-oriented, teacher-centred instruction (Miao et al., 2006; Reichelt, 2019).

Moreover, student factors account for the East-West clash in EFL writing intruction. For instance, implementing Western peda gogies can be chllenging due to students limted writig experiences (Leki, 2001), restanceto innovations, lack f real purposes and motivation for writing (Liu et al., 2004; Reichelt, 2019), varied abilitie Seloni & Le, 2019), and minimal use of English in the classrom (McCarthey, 2019). More recently, Almutwakkil and Alshakhi (2022) examined EFL teachers' challenges in adopting a negotiation-for-meaning pedagogy and also identified students' low proficiency level and reluctance to engage in online essons as barriers to implementation.

The East-West discord in writing pedagogies has also been inluenced by broader contextual constraints. Notable among these is the influence of exam-driven educational ideologies, policies, and curricula (Hiroe & Harwood, 2019; McCarthey, 2019; Reichelt, 2019; You, 2004), resulting in accuracy-based, language-centric instruction contrasting with meaning-oriented Western approaches. Top-down mandates on teachers professional development and instruction (Reichelt, 2019; Seloni & Lee, 2019), currcular emphasis on spoken proficiency (Saenkhum, 2019), the dissonance between pre-service and in-service practice (Seloni & Lee 2019), and insufficient resources and technologies (Reichelt, 2019)all present obstacles to the adoption of Westen theorie and practices. At a broader sociocultural level, Wester pedagogies also collide with distinctive local beliefs and practices and the local attitude towards the sociolinguistic status of English (Leki, 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Reichelt, 2019).

These studies indicate that local factors potentially render Western L2 writing imports counterproductive, leading FL teachers to question their transferability and/r prompting pedagogical adjustments i line with local realities. Despite this, this literature focused extensively on teachers' perceptions and reported practices shaped by contextual factors through an etic approach. This may have overlooked the particularities of the East-West dichotomy of writing pedagogies, which would potentially unfold through an emic perspective embedded in our autoethnographic research. Additionally, the reviewed studies did not delve into the particular chal. lenges Western-trained teachers encountered in their everyday L2 writing activities and practices within local contexts (Seloni, 2022), nor did thy explily adds tchr tional ctions ther ative ole the fnt manfttions f thir gtive bhaviours in addressing these obstacles, as well as how the interplay between contextual barriers, motion, and agncy shapes thir professional learning and practice a growing area of inquiry in TEs0L (e.g, Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024; Dang, 2013; Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). This necessitaes our adoption of activity theory, a potential tool for analysing teachers' tensions, emotions, and agentive behaviours in activity (Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). Although activity theory has been used to elucidate L2 writing teachers identity development (Lee, 2013) and cogntion-practice (mis)matches (Soleimani & Rahimi, 2021), our study is one f the firstattempts to utilis it to explore the dialectics between Western L2 writing pedagogies and local EFL writing instruction through an autoethnographic approach towards understanding teachers experiences of tensions, emotion, and agency. Our adoption of activity theory also responds to Seloni's (2022) call for a shift of focus from teacher knowledge and skills to \*network of activities" (p. 1 original emphasis involved in teaching L2 writing. In what follows, we will elaborate on activity theory as the analytical framework for our study.

# 2.2. Activity theory and systemic tensions

Underpinning our autoethnographic research is culturalhistorical activity theory (CHAT), a theoretical framework with its roots in Vygotsky's (1978) conception that an individual action towards an object is mediated by semioticresources. This individualistically oriented CHAT was subsequently remodelled by Leont'ev (1978), who converted it into acollective activity system. This system, as delineated by Engestrom (2001), encompasses six components dynamically interacting with one another:

: Subject: the participant (teacher) that operates the activity (teaching).   
. Object the subject's goal or a problem shaped by various mediating artefacts and transformed into an outcome (Johnson & Golombek, 2011).   
Mediating artefacts: material and cultural instruments mediating the subject's action towards its goal (Greno & Engestrom, 2014).   
: Community: groups with a shared general objective that distinguish themselves from others (Johnson & Golombek, 2011).   
. Rules: explicit and implicit rules and conventions that define the boundaries and opportunities for interaction within the activity system (Johnson & Golombek, 2011).   
Division of labour: responsibilities and distribution of power among participants (Engestrom, 2001; Johnson & Golombek, 2011).

CHAT has evolved into a third generation equipped with conceptual ools for comprehending dialogue, diverse points of view, and networks of interacting activity systems (Engestrom, 2001) serving as the unit of analysis (Fig. 1). For our study, we adopted this generation as it enabled us to look into our activities ssciated with our past, present, and future across ifferent spaces (Feryok. 2012). Importantly, one of CHAT's tenets pertains to systemic tensions, defined as historically accumulating structural tensions" (Engestrom, 2001, p. 137) or historicall evolving tensions" (Engestrom & Sannino, 2010, p. 4) that occur within or etween activity systems. These tensions energise the systems, but they also cause disruptions and coflicts as wellas spark innovative eforts to alter the activity, thereby acting as catalysts for change and development (Engestrom, 2001). In our research, we used a CHAT lens to problematise how our pedagogical cognition, shaped by our exposure to mediating resources in our Western-based education, came into conflict with prevailing local EFL writing practices and stimulated our emotional and agentive responses to shape our pedagogical adaptations.

# 2.3. Language teacher emotion and agency

Language teaching has been recognised as a not only rational but also social activity (Richards, 2022), where emotion plays an important role in shaping teachers thinking and practice (Golombek & Doran, 2014). Emotion is a social phenomenon, as evidenced by Nguyen's (2018) finding that it influences and is influenced by teachers interactions with their school community. Richards (2022) defines emotion as a sociocultural phenomenon influenced by individual characteristics as wel as by social environments and re lations. From a CHAT perspective, teachers' emotions are shaped by sociocultural factors inherent in their activity systems, especially tensions and dramatic events, and importantly these experiences stimulate the teachers actions towards change and development (Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024; Dang, 2013; Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). Teachers' emotions are therefore \*not merely something that [they] have' but something that [they] 'do' (Richards, 2022, p. 226).

Indeed, recent literature has brought to the fore the role of teachers' emotions in driving their intentional choices and purposeful actions that reflect their goals, values, and beles and that shape their professional practice and work environments e., Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024; Ga0 & Cui, 2023; Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). We refer to these intentions and actions as teacher agency. For our study, which is premised on CHAT, rather than viewing agency as merely one's personal intention to take actions to make things occur from a socio-cognitive perspective (Bandura, 2001), we took a sociocultural perspective on agency, considering it as \*the socially mediated capacity to act (Ahearn, 2001, p. 112). This capacity, from a CHAT perspective, i fuelled by ongoing disruptions and challenges arising from historicall accumulated contradictions within and between activity systems (Engestrom & Sannino, 2021). In agentively dealing with tensions in activity, teachers need to navigate ther agentive capacity in acordance with the affordances and hindrances in their particular context (Feryok, 2012).In adition, according to Edwards (2017), engaging in activities with agency entails making intentional decisions and performing deliberate actions, taking responsibilit for and evaluating these actions, and having the capability to interpret realities with greater insight and respond accordingly.

In our CAE, we aim to use a CHAT perspective to explore how our emotions stimulated our strategic actions in negotiating our East West tensions, navigating our emotional experiences, and reconstructing our instructional practices to make locally appropriate sense of Western L2 writing pedagogies. In accordance with our research aim and theoretical framework (i.., CHAT) introduced above, our study seeks to answer these questions:

1. What tensions did we encounter between our activities of learning in the West and teaching in the East?   
2. How did we emotionally and agentively respond to these tensions and adapt Western pedagogies?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Participants

Sponsored by a fullride scholarship, Author 1 completed his two-year MA studies in TEsOL, including courses such as Teaching Methodology, Teaching L2 Reading/Writing, Identity/Ideology in Multilingual Seings, Teaching Practicum, etc. at Forest University in the USA. Prio tothis milestone, he had taught test preparation course at a private nglish centre whilst holding no formal teaching qualifications. Upon returning to Vietnam, he has taught EFL writing as an associate lecturer at River University, a large public university in the Mekong Delta, where he focuses on teaching Writing I (paragraphs) and  (essays) to English majors. These courses aim to develop students academic writing kill inpreparation for their xit IELS-based examination, and thus using published IELTS textbooks, such as Mindset for IELTS, as the primary course materials.

Regarding author 2, he completed his BA and MA studies in English Teacher Education and then taught English at River Universty in Vietnam before starting his four-year doctoral studies at Mountain Universty in Belgium. His doctoral research centred on investigating Vietnamese teachers implementation of tak-based language teaching (TBLT), and besides this major endeavour, he took a summer course on advanced academic research writing. Since he returned to River Universt, he has assumed a managerial role as a department head whilst resuming his teaching focused on TEsOL methodology and EFL writing for undergraduate students. Post. doctorally, his teaching experience has expanded through Writing I and II courses also taught by Author 1.

Our EFL writing intruction at River University has been quite a journey,filled with a multitude of challenges. We have found ourselves grappling with the task of applying our expertis obtained overseas to the university setting. This experience piqued our interest in delving more deeply into the dynamics of East-West interaction in L2 writing instruction and led us to embark on this autoethnographic study.

# 3.2.  Collaborative autoethnography

As we collaboratively reflected on our own lived experiences, stemming from our activity of teaching EFL writing in Vietnam in comparison to our prior Western-based education in TEsOL, we found ourselves naturally inclined towards collaborative autoethnography (CAE) as a ftting method of self-inquir. We chose CAE because i allowed us to dele into our systemic tensions, emotions, and agency from an insider point of view, which helped us to provide a detailed and contextually thick description (Gertz, 1973) of the research issue In additio, CAE fuels intentional inrospection on instruction and can thus be an effctive method for generating significant insights into language teacher agency (Zhu et a., 2024). As \*a multivocal approach in which two or more reearchers work together to share personal stories and interpret the pooled autoethnographic data" (Lapadat, 2017, p. 589), CAE strikes a balance between individual and collective experiences (Blalock & Akehi, 2018), represents a shift from individual to collective agency, and provides a way to conduct impactful accessible research (Lapadat, 2017).

In conducting our CAE, we were mindful of criticisms regarding its potential lack of accountability, generalisability, and repre. sentativeness as a consequence of self-indulgence (Roy & Uekusa, 2020). To control our subjectivity, we practiced our self-reflexivit by constantly drawing a line between the research-self and the researcher-self throughout our rflection-based data collction and analysis (Coffy, 2004). Furthermore, we recognised that our narratives were intertwined with those of others (Adams et al., 2015; Sparkes, 2013); herefore, we took care to anonymise al individuals and groups mentioned in our acounts. For their direct words or messages that could potentially reveal their identity, we only provided our own interpretation of their thoughts.

# 3.3. Data generation

We generated data for our CAE by reflecting on our own experiences with overseas professional learning and Vietnam-based EFL writing instruction, in line with previous CAE studies that also employed this self-reflecting method for data generation (eg, Cong-Lem & Truong, Zhu, et al., 2024; De Costa et al., 2022). As a deliberate mental process involving thinking, reasoning, and introspection into one's own thoughts, emotions, and ideas (Glaser-Zikuda, 2012), this method is compatible with the purpose of our CAE to generate self-reflections on our lived experiences of tensions, emotion, and agency. Our reflections were based on our memory work whereby we together wrote, shared, and dissected our personal narratives as the main source of data (Lapadat, 2017). This process spanned a period of thee months during which we independently crfted our writtenselfreflections guided by these questions: what did you learn during your tudy abroad experience that helped you in teaching EFL writing? what diffculties did you encounter in applying your knowledge gained during your study abroad in teaching EFL writing? how did you feel?; and how did you address these difficulties? In responding to these questions, we gradually recalled what we underwent i teaching EFL writing at River Universit to craft our self-relections containing small storie about our experiences. Altogether, our reflections aded up to a total of 5932 words for analysis. In addition, we gathered two course syllabi (Writig I and I), our writing leson documents, and students writings along with our feedback to use as additional data sources. These also served as artefacts of our EFL writing teaching activity at River University.

After this phase, we organised two slf-recorded Zoom meetings (approximately 45 min each) in which we further shared and elaborated on our experiences narrated in the self-reflections. In these metings, we mutully scrutinised, interrogated, and probed into each others reflections through our collctively pooled data (Roy & Uekusa, 2020),allowing for a more profound understanding of ourselves and our social relations (Chang et al., 2013). For example, as Author 1 identified episodes of tensions in Author $2 \mathrm { { ' } } s$ reflections that contained no mentions of mediating contextual factors, emotional reactions, or agentive actions, Author 1 asked probing questions to elicit more information from Author 2. As we engaged with each other's reflections in the production of shared knowledge, our dialogue incorporated our diverse perspectives, thereby enhancing the depth, quality, and potential significance of our autoethnographic data (Guyotte & Sochacka, 2016).

# 3.4. Data analysis

Our written self-reflections, coupled with gathered documents and the transcrit of the Zoom discussions, were subjected to a direct qualitative content analysis wherein the coding process started immediately with predetermined codes (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Following this approach, we initially used CHAT components i., suject, object, mediating artefact, rules, community, division of labour) as the predetermined codes to pinpoint our networks of oint activit systems. The establishment of these systems helped us to set contextual boundaries for our data analysis, because \*in activity theory.., contexts are activity systems' (Cole, 1996, p. 10). This also supported us in graphically presenting our joint activity systems for analysis. Fig. 1illustraes the components of the interacting activity systems identified from Author 1's reflective data: studying in a US-based TEsOL programme and teaching EFL writing at a Vietnamese university. Author 2s joint activity systemsBelgium-based education and Vietnam-based EFL writing instruction are depicted in Fig. 2. Our join activity systems have a shared object being effective EFL writing instruction.

With our activity systems/contexts identified, we were able to code the data related to our tensions, emotions, and agency as mediated by particular contextual factors in the activity systems. Following the direct qualitative content analysis, we iteratively read and coded the data into predetermined categories (i.e, tensions, emotion, and agency). Emotional content was identified following Golombek and Doran's (2014) approach, whilst agentive behaviours were based on Pappa et al.'s (2019) notions of pedagogical agency constructed by teachers knowledge, skills and collaboration with learners, and relational gency built upon teachers utilisation of social relations and their knowledge and experience. We coded both Author 1 and Author $2 ^ { \prime } s$ data independently to distil episodes of tensions, emotional experiences, and agentive intentions and/or actions, and then we worked collaboratively to resolve coding disagreements. Also, we reviewed all our coding decisions and grouped our tension experiences into clusters based on their similarity. For example, both authors' experiences related to Activity 1's community and Activity $2 ^ { \prime } s$ artefact, community, and division of labour were combined into a cluster. Allof the clusters were presented as findings in Section 4. During this analysing process, we constany referred to the Writin I and  syllai, our writing leson documents, student esys, and our writen correctie fedack for data triangulation. This analysis was also informed by the itrature on EFL writing instruction and CHAT perspectives on teacher practice, considering diverse methodological approaches to interpreting CHAT concepts and principle (Dang, 2013). Table 1 gives an example of ur idntfication of tensions, emotions, and agenc through the direct content analysis based on Author Is activity systems serving as contexts. These tensions are graphically presented by dashed arrows, as depicted by Figs. 1 and 2.

# 4. Findings

4.1. Activity 1 (artefact) vs. Activity 2 (artefact and division of labour): experiences of tension, emotion, and agency

Our analysis uncovered some tensions between Activity 1's artefacts and Activity 2s artefacts and division of labour. For example, Author ${ \boldsymbol { 1 } } ^ { \prime } { \boldsymbol { s } }$ implementation of process pedagogy (Artefact 1) acquired through his MA studies at Forest University in the USA to transform students' learning experiences during his Writing I course at River University traditionall dominated by product-based pedagogies. Specifically, in teaching argumentative essay writing, he adopted a proces involving generating ideas with concept maps, creating essay outlines, writing, and delivering dynamic written corrective fedback--multiple rounds of meaningful, timely, constant, and manageable feedback focused on specific errors to reach the error-fre level (Hartshon et al., 2010). Ths feedback-giving method however took more time than anticipated and thus conflicted with the IELTs-oriented syllabus requiring coverage of "a number of other types of IES essays and practce est, too, within only a few wees of the course" (Artefact 2) (see Fig. 3) and his workload including handling over 70 students' essays per week (Division of labour 2).

This tension (Tension A) was a site of emotional struggle for Author 1 as he \*felt torn between keeping or abandoning [his] preferred method [process pedagogy, but \*the iner cll of innovation inside a teacher who used to study in the USA fuelled [his] determination' to continue his innovative practice, which laid the basis for a series of his agentive actions. He opted to create a Facebook group where individual students performed peer feedback targeted at particular aspects (e.g., idea development, cohesion, language-related problems), whilst he also actively joined them in this endeavour. He also "set up a Google Drive space on which students rceived dynamic feedack from their classmates who'd been guided to do so" (Fig. 4). He aditionally "rganised a regular

in-class writing showcase activity" where students "displayed their essays on the classoom walls and received feedback from their classmates". Offring bonus marks as a motivational strategy, he observed students' overall more active participation in the writing process and especially in dynamic feedback activities.

A similar tension (Tension D) was experienced by Author 2, who attended an advanced academic writing summer schoo whilst in Belgium and got introduced to various feedback methods (e.g., peer asessment, group feedback). Among these, he was crazy about face-to-face teacher-student fedback"teacher-student conferences (Lerner, 2005) (Artefact 1), as he was impressed by this method which had proved beneficial in addresing his writing problems. This positie experience fostered his pedagogical belief and intention to frequently incorporate teacher-student conferences into teaching Writing I at River University. His experimentation however turned into "a nightmare' due to time limitations and large class sizes (Division of labour 2). He narrated:

This technique consumed me lots of time because I'd to work with the students individually whilst the class was large and my time was limited. I was so ambitious in my expectation that I couldn't control my time devoted to each case.

Instead of shying away from the \*nightmare, Author 2 embraced it. Driven by his ambition to \*create a good working habit among the students' and his firm belief in the transformative power of feedback, he faced it head-on. With this ambition, instead of discontinuing ths approach, he identified students strengths and weakneses to provide focused feedback, which improved time effciency. Additionally, he diagnosed individual students' dificulties and organised conferences for groups with similar needs and expectations. Dedicated enough, he spent extra office hours conducting Zoom-based conferences to ensure equal exposure to this feedback intervention for ll his students. His eforts bore fruit as he noticed students' errors decreasing over time.

It is evident that although Authors 1 and 2 both encountered feedback-related tensions due to their artefacts and division of labour at River Universty and expressed a mix of emotions eg, feeling torn, determined, scared, ambitious), they stil found room amidst these challenges to exercise their pedagogical agency based on their personal capabilities and achieve observable outcomes (e.g., students' greater participation and accuracy).

4.2. Activity 1 (community) vs. Activity 2 (artefact, community, and division of labour): experiences of tension, emotion, and agency

Another tension (Tension B) involved Author 1's experience co-teaching an English communication course for immigrants in hisMA practicum at Forest University. In co-designing leson plans, one of his co-teachers (Community 1) suggested motivating students by strengthening their ESL speaker identities, and they together explored the students aspirations and crafted speaking tasks incorpo rating their desired identities (e.g., an English-speaking taxi-driver, an attorney in the USA). Adopting this approach at River University, he asked his students to write weekly short jounals about their aspirations related to English writing, alongside their ourse assignments, in a Writing I course he taught online in 2020. He held a belief that \*the more they write about themselves and their dreams, the more they can realise how English writing will help them in the future'. The students' writing identities were unclear, unfortunately, and as they confessed, they had a limited sense of purpose and motivation (Community 2). Seeing fewer and fewer submissions from the students over time in the course, Author 1 began to doubt the efectivenes of his identity-ehancing approach-a negative emotion compounded by his Western-derived knowledge of the overall low intensity of EFL students' identity in an EFL context where students often lack the real purpose and motivation to write beyond their schoolwork and examinations.

This negative emotion, however, did not ostruct his spiri f trial and eror, cultivated by his practice-teaching during his MA, as he insisted: I've used it and it worked. Why should I give it an end? Why not another way out?". This spirit, coupled with his

expectation that the students might be more inclined to write if made aware enough of the relevance of writing to their future as. pirations, Author 1 reimagined his approach. He recounted:

I often showed news stories of people succeeding thanks to their great writing skills Ialso invited my best student, a recent valedictorian and a winner of many undergraduate scholarships and international exchange programmes t come and share her experiences with the class.

The enactment of Author 1s pedagogical agency (materials containing successful stories) and relational agency (a guest speaker's knowledge, experiences, and accomplishments), as he reported, resulted in an increase in his students' writing motivation, clear writing-related self-images in their journal enries (Fig. 5), and \*the number of entries they handed in for language feedback".

For Author 2, the pedagogical cognition he developed during his involvement in practice-teaching in Belgium was also a source of tension (Tension E) he underwent in teaching at River University. Specifically, whilst teaching an English course for Belgian school children, he was surrounded by an academic environment where people valued teacher autonomy in relation to teaching materials (Community 1). During his service, Author 2 was allowed to select materials from various source (.g., internet, magazines) and ask his students to contrbute materials of their interest-a regular practice that contributed to shaping his pedagogical cognition. This philosophy, however, could not be replicated in his writing I instruction at River Universty on account of the textbook given by the university and the guideline of content stated in the syllabus (Artefact 2), "students lack of knowledge and motivation' to contribute to the learning proces (Community 2), and the need to \*cover allof the content required in one lessn in a limited time" (Division of labour 2). The feeing of having to deal with inappropriat content" intensified Author s ambivalence with deciding \*what to skip for extra activities or what to focus for achieving the lesson aims'. Nevertheles, hs concen about students needs and interests spurred his pedagogical agency, manifested as coping strategies to make room for his autonomy as wel as his students in manoeuvring the required teaching content: .

I had to adapt the textbook to ensure that I had enough time for my extra activities or tasks, specifically designed for my students' needs and interests. I skipped some tasks in the textbook that the students could do at home to promote their autonomy whilst inroducing more relevant interactive, communicative writing tasks that I intentionally designed for the students to do in the classroom [Fig. 6].

These instances demonstrate the clashes between the two authors' pedagogical approaches growing out of their interaction with the academic community during their Western-based education and the local practices of EFL writing. These tensions led to a range of emotions (e.g., Author 1's doubt, insistence, expectation; Author $2 ^ { \prime } s$ ambivalence, concern) that were associated with the emergence of their pedagogical and relational agency aimed at transforming their students' learning experiences.

4.3. Activity 1 (artefact-community combination) vs. Activity 2 (artefact, community, and division of labour): experiences of tension emotion, and agency

Our data showed that the combination ofartefacts and community in Activity 1 was in tension with many components in Activity 2. In his MA programme, Author 1 was introduced by his Reading/Writing professr to the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) and experienced his classmates' simulated activities in a specialised seminar, involving students using the corpus to self correct their writings and deepen their knowledge of lexico-grammatical patterns (Artefact 1), which was "a wow' to him as he had no prior knowledge about cocA. The enthusiasm displayed by his professor and classmates (Community 1) left a strong impression on his perception, motivating him to experiment with COCA at River University. He reminisced:

When I was teaching, I introduced CoCA to my students and also showed them how to use it at home to correct their errors, which I'd coded with explanations.

Here, a tension (Tension C) occurred. His coCA-based initiative apparently conflicted with his students' \*low motivation and language competence to independently exploit the corpus \*to understand patterns shown on COcA" (Community 2) and the need to ensure coverage of the stringent Writing I syllabus content (Artefact 2). Unwavering in his belief in CocA as "one of the perfect tools for improving writing, he however took a proactive strategy. He acordingly paired lesscompetent students with their more able peers in cCOCA-based group feedback activities in the classroom and alo scaffolded their collaboration in resolving complex language. related problems collected from their writings,tapping into their conducive zone of collaborative development (Balakrishnan & Claiborne, 2012). This pedagogical agency, as he noticed, resulted in \*a more dynamic environment and students' motivated behaviours".

Author 2s doctoral research delved into TBLT (Artefact 1), which haped the core of his expertise. As he recalled, the construction of his TBLT cognition was moulded by his discussions with his supervisor, a TBLT expert, and his fellows, who strongly advocated for TBLT (Community 1). Transitioning into lecturer passionate about TBLT, Author 2 keenly embraced this method in teaching at River University, as he believed staunchly in it effctivenes in transforming students' learning experiences traditionally dominated by the PPP model. This commitment, however, caused a remarkable tension (Tension F):

After the first few wees of my writing courses, Irealised that implementing learner centerednes.. in my clsroom-based practices encountered many challenges. My students were not familiar with learner-centred education, resulting in their resistance to my teaching.

This tension was conceivable, considering students (Community 2 familiarity with PPP-a hegemonic method of teaching English in Vietnam, as well as their timidity, exam-driven mindset, and reluctance to \*eagerly participate in the interactive activities or take their active roles in learning'. The tension however did not diminish Author $2 \mathrm { { ' } } s$ excitement about TBLT, as evidenced by a series of his dedicated actions:

I set clear goals and requirements for the assessment activity..I just kept on employing different strategic techniques (e.g., debate, lead-in discussions, think-pair-share activit, small group discussions or poster exhibition and presentations) to promote my students' interaction and collaboration... I guided my students to do peer and self-assessment.

This pedagogical agency, as he admitted, would require time to demonstrate its efectiveness, but at the classrom level, it contributed to sensitising students to their role in the learning process and transforming their learning experiences, which had been largely dominated by PPP.

TBLT (Artefact 1) and Author 2's doctoral community's advocacy (Community 1) also contradicted his Vietnamese collagues academic culture (Community 2). Convinced of TBLT's potential, he spearheaded institutional seminars to popularise the method in his faculty. Unfortunately, they resisted this initiative, citing reasons such as being under-prepared and unwilling to change and their students' hesitation to take risks. They also pushed back against TBLT-based collaborative teaching proposed by Author 2 and expressed their discomfort as this proposal went against their ingrained isolated working culture. Despite ocasional bouts of demotivation, as a TBLT enthusiast, Author 2 narrowed his scope, turning to two novice teachers in his department who showed openness to inovations. He shared material and lesson plans with them, engaged them in his talks, and invited them tocollaborate in his TLBT research. This \*friendly method' (relational agency), he hoped, \*might subsequently change everyone's belief about TBLT and take actions toward TBLT teaching in their classes'.

These accounts provide further evidence that emotional experiences (e.g., Author 1's idealisation of CocA, Author $2 \mathrm { { ' } } s$ enthusiasm for TBLT) were stimulators of their pedagogical and relational agency for both innovating teaching practices and reshaping their workplace's prevailing academic culture.

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

Our CAE lends support to observations from prior studies (e.g., Almutwakkil & Alshakhi, 2022; Hirose & Harwood, 2019; Lee, 2004; Leki, 2001; McCarthey, 2019; Saenkhum, 2019; Seloni & Le, 2019; Unaldi et al., 2019) that formal L2 writing pedagogies rooted in Western TESOL education may not seamlessly integrate with local EFL conditions and practices marked by distinctive educational, social, and cultural resources. This is substantiated by our finding that our tensions primarily occurred between our Activity 1s cultural rtefactsL2 writing ideals acquired during overseas education-and our EFL writing intruction practices. For Author 1, the artefacts in his overseas TEsOL studies (e.g., proces pedagogy, dynamic written corrective fedback, COCA) strongly mediated the formation of his pedagogical cognition (Seloni, 2022), considering his limited teaching experience and lack of prior pedagogical knowledge before his study abroad. For Author 2, as his doctoral studies concentrated on TBLT-related research rather than on extensive coursework covering diverse TESOL topics, TBLT and itsassociated principles, such as learner-centredness, were prominent artefacts of his overseas studies. The positive experiences associated with our acqusition of these artefacts fuelled our motivation to experiment with Western approaches to teaching, which in turn led to many systemic tensions --unfolding betwen multiple components of our Western-based education activity with our EFL writing instruction activity in Vietnam (Engestrom & Sannino, 2010).

Notably, interacting with community members during our overseas studies was also a source of our pedagogical cognition (Seloni 2022), which subsequently contradicted with our teaching activities. The input from Author 1s professor (e.g., COcA) and practicum co-teachers (e.g. identity-enhancing activities), for instance, moulded his perception and motivated his experimentation in teaching EFL writing. Likewise, Author $2 \mathrm { { ' } } s$ exposure to the perspectives of his doctoral supervisor and fellows fortified his confidence in the potential power of TBLT in transforming students' learning experiences. These pedagogies were however not i sync with our curriculum, textbooks, and local community, including students' existing proficiency and motivation (Authors 1 and 2) and colleagues reluctance towards innovations (Author 2). This suggests that the pedagogical knowledge constructed on the interpsychological plane-in social interactions between activity stakeholders -and internalised on the inrapsychological plane (Johnson & Golombek. 2011; Vygotsky, 1978) during Westen-based education is endemic to the Western context. Thus i also needs to be reimagined and localised rather than uncritcally adopted when it comes t teching writing in local context. This highlights the necesty for ongoing dialogue between Western TESOL stakeholders and EFL teachers post their graduation, as such exchanges can bettr inform the stakeholders of how Western perspectives differ from real-world EFL writing instruction in a particular locale.

Echoing the previous research, our study underscores the clashes between Western L2 writing pedagogies and micro-contextual (e. g, students unclear purpose/motivation, proficiency, and preferences; colleagues resistance to change and isolated working culture), meso-contextual (e.g, IELTs textbook, rigid curriculum, heavy workload, and time constraints), and macro-contextual factors (e., IELTS-driven ideologies) afecting local writing instruction. It i within these idealism-realism clashes that our systemic tensions arose and our pedagogical cognition reproduced iself in ways that accommodated local conditions and expectations. As evidenced in our reflections, these tensions emerged between not two but multiple components f our overseas study activity and our local teaching activity. This highlights the multidirectional interaction between activity components and thus the complexity of the "dialectic between thinking and doing' (Cross, 2010, p. 483) across teachers' socio-professional activities.

As suggested by our CAE,systemic tensions catalyse change and development (Engestrom, 2001; Engestrom & Sannino, 2021), because in our case, despite the tensions we experienced constraining our use of Western L2 writing pedagogies, they trigered our emotional responses, and in turn, our deliberate efforts (Edwards, 2017) to make contextually responsive decisions as well as experiment with adaptive pedagogies. This finding echoes recent research that has llustrated the unity of tensions, dramatic events emotions, and agency, and its role in teachers' professonal learning, practice, and development (e.g., Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024, Nguyen & Ngo, 2023). Our study has expanded this research by highlighting specific manifestations of agency. For instance, our emotional responses, both positive and negative, to the tensions stimulated the enactment of our pedagogical agency (Pappae al., 2019), demonstrated by our appropriation of our knowledge, competence, collaboration with students to initiate alternative pedagogies (e.g., Author 1's use of Google Drive, Facebook, and writing showcase during tension A, COCA-based group feedback during tension C; Author 2's textbook customisation during tension E). Simultaneously, we also leveraged our social relations and their knowledge and experience (e.g., Author 1's reliance on a former student during tension B; Author 2s orientation towards more willing colleagues during tension F) to construct and benefit from our relational agency (Kayi-Aydar, 2019) in the midst of tensions. This capacity to take action (Ahearn, 2001), mediated by both the tensions between our activity systems (Engestrom & Sannino, 2021) and our emotions, manifested in the forms of our intentional actions (e., Author 1's Google Drive and Facebook-based inovations, and COCA-based peer feedback; Author s textbook adaptations) and responsibility and commitment (e.g., Author 's extra office hours for teacher-student conferences) (Edwards, 2017). This supports the notion that Western-educated TEs0L teachers are not passive, peripheral reeivers of Western pedagogies; rather, they proactively use such pedagogies with awareness and a strong sense of agency (Barnawi & Phan, 2015) to navigate contextual affordances and constraints of the local activity, including social relationships (Feryok. 2012), and to develop their increasingly informed interpretation of realities (Edwards, 2017; Li & Edwards, 2013). This navigation, as our findings suggest, is an emotionally charged process.

Our enactment of agency in turn resolved the tensions and exerted an overall positive influence on our emotional experiences of systemic tensions and students' learning experiences, confirming this potential of agency documented in prior research (e.g, Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024). This positive influence was evidenced by desirable outcomes generated through our agentic actions, such as students' more active participation, better accuracy, clearer writing-related identity, greater motivation, and transformed learning experiences. The performance of these actions and the achievement of these outcomes hinged upon our tension-mediated personal agentive capacit, encompassing \*the ability to interpret and reflect on the situation [tension] as well as the abilit to devise and implement appropriate and efective problem-solving actions in response" (Cong-Lem & Nguyen, 2024, p. 9). Our study resonates with Nguyen and Walkinshaw (2018), which observed Vietnamese teachers' personal agentive capacity, although minimal, in responding to contextual hindrances of the local teaching activity. Despite having yet to create change at a broader contextual level (e.g., IELTS-driven ideologies, inovation-resting culture), at the very least, our pedagogical and relational agency, which operated at the micro-contextual classroom level, has been shown to be instrumental in negotiating the East-West collsion in TesoL. practices and creating spaces for our autonomy, as well as our students, in navigating the rigid, constraining IELTs-oriented currculum, unfavourable distribution of work, and student factors.

ig. 7. A representation of participatory pedagogical content knowledge of writin

Additionally, our findings suggest that the interaction between systemic tensions, emotion, and agency serve as critical experiences wherein participation-derived knowledge emerges. These critical experiences fostered the reimagination of our existing pedagogies and the construction of our participatory pedagogical content knowledge of writing (PPckw) (Fig. 7). As Donovan et al. (2023) put it PPCKW is "a processof activel, agentively, and itrativelyseeking and engaging in critical experiences to learn and grow as writers and teachers of writing who are empowered to solve problems of practice" (p. 30). It thus includes knowledge of practice, which emerges from teachers contextualised practice connected with the social context (Loughran, 2019). This is llustrated by Author I's innovative pedagogical experiments (e.g, using Google Drive and Facebook to accommodate peer feedback amidst curricular constraints and heavy workload) and Author $2 ^ { \prime } s$ adaptive pedagogies (e.g., offline and online teacher-student conferences, TLT-related strategies) to negotiate the tensions and tailor the Western-derived pedagogies to the exigencie f the EFL context. Also prominent in PPCKW is knowledge in practice, an outcome of teachers subjective conclusions about their practice (Cochran-Smith & Lyte, 2007), exemplified by Author 1's conclusive judgement about the power of identity enhancement in motivating his students and development of a social relations-based approach. This knowledge of and in practice in turn contributed to the critical reconfiguration of the knowledge base of L2 writing pedagogies (Donovan et al., 2023) we acquired during our Western-based education. Crucially, with PPCKW, teachers like us can be empowered to confront incongruous practices and create \*situated possbilities" (Tsui & Ng, 2010, p. 364), such as our self-authored context-responsive pedagogies, where Western pedagogies are constantly reproduced during critical experiences to cater to contextual demands.

The insights from our CAE provide implications for both practice and policy. Firstly, whils it remains necessary for Western-based L2 teacher education to equip teachers with formal knowledge, it is important to cultivate their critical experiences, perhaps through simulated training practices or EFL case studies, to nurture their context-responsive pedagogical cognition and PPckw; equip them with strategies to navigate their emotions, especill those derived from idealism-realism contradictions; and foster their sense of agency for resolving tensions. These case studies can serve as mediational spaces for them to develop their emotional regulation and agentive capacity, thus better praring them for the callenge of FL writing instruction. This attempt is crucial for enhancing these teachers' preparation in Western settings and also for developing the institutions in their home country (Hong & Pawan, 2018) Secondly, based on our findings, we recommend that L2 writing teacher education programmes always convert the learning process from a one-way, decontextualised exercise into the collaborative and context-rich construction of PPckW and also empower teachers to harnesstheir individual and collective resources to navigate contextual idiosyncrasies (Kumaravadivelu, 206). Simultaneously, these programmes should emphasise the why' of writing teachers learning and practice, helping them to understand the mattr of writing instruction and the rationale behind their instructional decisions and implementation (Lee, 2024). In addition, in local EFL contexts where i is impossible to change rigid, exam-driven EFL writing curricula, it is imperative to recognise and accommodate teachers autonomy within the contextual constraints (Nguyen & Walkinshaw, 2018) and promote their pedagogical and relational agency for instructional adaptations instead of mechanicall imposing currcular precriptions. This agency, as our findings suggest,

does contribute to students' classroom learning experiences.

Despite these insights and implications, our CAE is not without limitations. Methodologicaly, our adoption of an after-the-event self-reflection approach might have overlooked critical experiences that could have surfaced had a reflection-in-action alternative been employed. Additionall, our study focused exclusively on tensions, emotion, and agency but did not take in account the role of identity. This opens up avenues for future research done from a sociocultural perspective, including CHAT, to problematise the multidimensional interplay betwen identity, particularly translingual rofessional identity (Lin & Shi, 2024); emotion; and agency in relation to the application of Western L2 writing pedagogies in EFL contexts.
