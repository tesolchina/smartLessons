As international students and English-medium Instruction (EMI) programs increase, Japanese universities need to adapt their programs to fulfill the needs of these students. One often overlooked area is academic writing in English. This paper discusses an action research study examining the challenges of providing formal academic writing support for English-speaking students in an EMI-program at one large private university in Tokyo. The study utilizes a participatory action research approach (Burns, 2009). The study attempted to examine what aspects of academic writing are these students most confident and most insecure about, and what aspects of the writing course did the students feel are most useful for them in preparing them for further academic writing, and how this EMI program can help students overcome these challenges. The data comes from a multiple choice and open answer questionnaire as well as focus group interviews. Suggestions on how to create and implement successful academic writing courses in an EMI context, based on the lessons learned from this course from the administrative point-of-view as well as both from faculty and students' perspectives will be provided to conclude.

# 1. Introduction

As the popularity of English-medium instruction (EMI) programs continues to grow, universities must ensure that their programs satisfy students' needs. Japan is no exception, with many higher education institutions across the country launching new EMI pro grams due to a push and initiatives from the government (Aizawa & Rose, 2019). One ft-ignored area of EMI programs is the need for academic writing support because program administators often mistakenly assume that these students are fluent in English and. therefore, already posess the ability to wite academicall in English (e.g., Bhati, 004). However, researchers (e.g., Tomak, 2022) have documented the need for and usefulness f EAP and academic writing courses even for students with demonstrated proficiency in other areas. Studies which implement field research at participant universities with EMI programs in Japan arescarce, and researchers (e.g., Rose & McKinley, 2018) have called for further research in this area.

Therefore, to fill this gap, I conducted an action research study. The aim of the study was to understand how one institution's academic witing course, for which I was responsible for, could offer etter help to a diverse group of tudents in order to improve ther academic writing. The study utilized a participatory action research approach (Burns, 2009) that engaged both the teacher and students in understanding their daily writing practice and how it could be improved. The course,Academic Writing in English, has proven to be a challenge to teach and design because the students experiences with academic writing vary significantly, and there are insufficient resources to ensure that it adequately prepares students for the asinments and reearch writing that they must complete in their content-oriented courses.

The most chllenging aspects of academic writing experienced by the students in the Academic Writing in Englis course-including finding and using sources, avoiding plagiarism, and improving organization, coherence, and academic vocabulary--are discussed in this paper in addition to how their instruction can be beter incorporated into the course. The extent to which the course can help students acquire the fundamental aspects of academic writing that they ned and how these findings can benefit ther such courses and programs are also examined. Finally, the paper concludes with suggestions for creating and implementing successul academic writing courses in EMI contexts based on the lessons learned from this study via administrative, faculty, and student perspectives. These suggestions are believed tobe especiall relevant to the Asian educational context in which EMI programs are gaining momentum but are still in their infancy.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. English-medium instruction in Japan

Japanese higher education has recently jumped on the bandwagon of increasing EMI programs. In this paper, EMI refers to \*the use f the English language to tch acadmic ubject ther than English itelf i counries or jurisdictions where th first language of the majority of the population i not English (Macaro, 2018, p. 19) In other words, MI courses are content courses taught in English, but the primary goal is not necessarily English language education (Bradford & Brown, 2017). EMI programs in Japan have proliferated in recent years mainly because increasing numbers of overseas students are electing to complet their universty studies there. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of international students studying in degree programs in Japan- especiall students from other Asian countries-had been rapidly increasing. According to the Japan Student Services Association (JAss0, 2021), 146,041 iner. national undergraduate and graduate students were studying in Japan as of May 1, 2019; a number that has more than doubled since 200 It is predicted that even more students will choose to study in Asian countries in the near future for economic and political reasons (Choudaha, 2018). Various factors contribute to this trend.

The two main reasons for this increase in Japanese EMI programs appear to be the government's desire to increase the foreign student population, partly to make up for Japan's shrinking college-age population, and the need to prepare Japanese students for a global future. The Top Global University Project (TGUP) was launched in 2014 by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science Technology (MEXT) with significant funding and resources to internationalize Japan's higher education. The aim of this funding proect i to create a more globalized academic environment in Japan, both by accepting more excellent intenational students as wellas increasing the number of Japanese students studying overseas. This push has increased the emphasis on EMI at Japanese universities. The TGUP replaced and expanded the earlier Global 30 Project that began in 2009 and provided extra funding for 13 universitie to create and offer English-only undergraduate programs. However, with both of these initiative, the policies were made through top-down decision-making from policymakers, not through changes in response to the pedagogical needs of either teachers or students. Hence, there is scepticism about whether the primary participants in Japanese EMI programs, namely teachers and students, have been adequately prepared for these programs and are reaping their intended benefits.

Some documented benefits of EMI programs for students include improved English proficiency and subject knowledge (Chang, 2010; Coleman, 2006; Wanphet & Tantawy, 2018), as well as enhanced and globalized social mobility and employability (Galloway et al., 2020. For higher institutions, EMI programs can boost universt rankings domestically and globall, n adition to helping bring in more government funding (Galloway e al., 2020). However, due to the complexity of implementing successul EMI programs considerable challenges have been observed. One of the crucial and recurring challenges that many students in EMIl programs fae, and which has be documented by many researchers (e.g., Aizawa & Rose, 2019; Chapple, 2015; Evans & Morrison, 2011; Lin & Morrison, 2010; Mirizon et al., 2019), isinsuficent English ability. Some other problems that have been reported include limited intitutional support (se, e.g., gyen et al., 2017) as wellas conflicting perceptions and expectations of the faculty and students see eg, Jiang et al., 2019; Kuteeva, 2020). Many of these challenges may stem from the fact that these programs have been formulate from a top-down approach, lacking substantial involvement of the micro-level agents.

Indeed, in one study which examined both the meso-level (institutional) and micro-level (classroom) policies and their imple mentation at a Japanese university that aimed to increase EMI courses by almost $2 5 \%$ over a ten-year period, Aizawa and Rose (2019) found that the institutional policy goals of the universty did not materializeat the micro-level in practice as planned. They discovered a number of underlying challenges which included language use in the classroom not corresponding to the policies and syllabi, students' linguistic challenges in undertaking the courses, and faculty members' lack of English proficiency. Aizawa and Rose also claimed that Many studies on EMI implementation have shown that the drive for EMI is generally top-down, and that gaps exist between macro-level EMI policy and micro-level practice, (p. 1127). Other scholars have echoed asimilar sentiment regarding the disconnect between policy makers plans and the realities observed in the classroom (e.g., Bradford, 2018; Rose & McKinley, 2018) This seems to be true for the Jaanese context as well. Therefore, the study outlined in this paper was designed to examine the extent of this gap in one academic writing classroom in an EMI program in Japan.

# 2.2. Academic writing

Academic writing, a crucial sil in higher education, is frequently neglected in EMI programs, despite its importance to students Who are required to compose for various purposes. Academic writing is cognitively demanding, requiring critical literacy skills.As

Marinett (1985) expressed it in his book title students are Learning to write while writing to learn." Numerous studies have demonstrated that writing is a skillthat poses challenges for many students. In an interview study conducted with 34 international students in the UK, Jenkins (2013) reported that the participants uniformly expressed that academic writing was causing them the most problems in their studies. She discovered that the students found the available academic writing support either as not helpful for the writing requirements they face, or at the minimum, only helpful for superficial aspects of writing, such as grammar and micro-level organization. Studies in Asian contexts (e.g., Evans & Green, 2007; Lee & Lee, 2018) have also discovered that students in EMI programs find writing the most problematic language skilland deire more support from the university in addressing this challenge. Several other researchers (e.g., Abouzeid, 2021; vans & Morrison, 2011) have found that students struggle a great deal with producing essays in a suitable academic register using appropriate genres and conventions.

Despite theevident importance f writing as crucil academic sill, learners are frequently left  navigate it independently, often lacking substantial writing support (Angel & Garcia, 2017). Bhatia (2004) pointed out that students with advanced English proficiency are often mistakenly assumed to alo be able to produce high-quality writig. However, this i not necessrily the cae. As he explains, having textual competence, which refers to linguistic accuracy, is not often accompanied by generic competence of academic skils (Bhatia, 2004). Content instructors are not necessarily equipped to support students with their academic writing. Faculty members in EMI programs are tasked with teaching their content courses in English; however, this does not necessrily mean that they are capable of or have the time to focus on academic writing in their courses. As a consequence, students may be left without the crucial support they need to complete their research writing in English. In Japan, Brown (2016) found that targeted EAP clases at that time were offered "at only $8 \%$ of responding universities" and that "more than $4 0 \%$ of EMI programs rely on general English classes not associated with the program, and nearly half have no required language training at ll (p. 15). One student in an EMI program in Japan stated, I don't know how to write academic papers in English in academic way, so it's hard for me in terms of the taking classes and in terms of the submitting the papers to professors ... (Student 1)' (Curle et al., 2023, p. 14).

To addres these noted challenges, researchers in this area (e.g., Muttaqin & Chuang, 2023) emphasize the importance of incorporating AP classes into EMI programs with the explicit aim ofassisting students in achieving successin their EMI courses. Costa and Mastellotto (2022) also found an ESP course to be beneficial in preparing students to succeed in their English language content courses, particularly in relation to developing the essntial academic writing skill required. Furthermore, Rose et al. (2020) noted a clear correlation between the skill and language proficiency acquired in an ESP course and success i subsequent content courses. Tomak (2022), in an action research study examining the benefits of an academic writing course in Turkey, found that all the first-year university students in his study stated that they benefited from the course, specifically mentioning how it helped them with accurate sentence structure, vocabulary choice, organization for academic papers, and academic prose in general. He concluded that providing academic writig courses is crucial for students in EMI programs because of their enormous benefit in enabling students to complete writing asignments for their suject courses.In line with Rose and McKinley's (2018) suggestion that field esearch at TGUP site in Japan is crucial for examining the success of EMI programs, more action rearch studies like omak's are cearly needed in the Japanese higher education context as well.

# 2.3. Action research

Action research (AR) has been slowly gaining popularity as a research approach within the second language learning field in recent years. AR is not only beneficial as a research approach but also as a way of professional development for teachers. It is a research method intended to be a "self-reflective, critical, and systematic approach to exploring your own teaching contexts," (Burns, 2009, p. 2). With AR, the teacher becomes both an investiator-reearcher and a participant. Also alld the participatory action research (PAR) approach (Burns, 2009), the fundamental philosophy of this method i that the participants being examined should be actively engaged in the research, recognizing them as essential agents in the process.

As mentioned above, a crucial aspect of AR is the researcher's close and active engagement within the research context. When utilized by instructor-researchers, the goal is to gain a deep understanding of the effctiveness of their own teaching practices and identify areas for improvement. Wallce (2000) points out that teacher AR is incredibly valuable because it is small-scale, contextualized, localied, and has the goal of making changes to practice. In other words, the goal i to bridge the gap between identifying the best possible way of doing things and the most practica or possible way of doing things in a certain socia setting (Burns, 2009), often with the overarching aim of improving teaching practices in a given classoom setting as wellas leading to broader improvements that benefit the wider institutional or societal etting. In summary, it has the goal of solving real problems that exist in the classroom and bringing about improved teaching practices. Burns (2009) summarized this by stating:

The central idea of the action part of AR is to intervene in a deliberate way in the problematic situation in order to bring about changes and, even better, improvements in practice. Importantly, the improvements that happen in AR are ones based on information (or to use the research term, data) that an action researcher collects systematicall .. o, the changes made in the teaching situation arise from solid information rather than from our hunches or assumptions about the way we think things are. (p. 2)

In regard to conducting a study, Burns (199) outlined interrelate steps that should be taken to carry out AR mosteffectively. These steps involve finding an issue in the classroom with the aim of identifying areas of concern in regard to this issue, and then investigating it within the classroom context. She also explained that this process involves collecting data in an atempt to uncover possible remedies, and finally, planning concrete actions based on the discovery of these connected steps. Similarl, Lewin (1948) conceptualized AR as an ongoing proces consisting of four stages: planning, acting, observing, and reflecting, all with the aim of

improving practice through fluid cycles.

Despite the aforementioned advantages of AR, studies using AR methodologies have yet to become mainstream in the field of English language teaching. Edwards (2021) conducted a comprehensive review of the AR literature to examine the effects of this research on the individual language teacher, their educational context, and the wider educational field. Her study found only 21 published articles in a wide variety of both intenational and local journals from 2006 to 2020 acros nine countries that examined the impact of language teacher AR. She found that all these studies reported a positive impact on the individual teacher while the results were mixed in regard to the positive ffect on the broader institutional and educational context. Edwards found that AR studies seemto be particularly helpful to teachers in fostering teacher identity development as well as teaching and research development. Upon reviewing the literature, she identified a need for aditional AR studies which not only demonstrat the influence of AR on language teachers but, more crucially, explore its impact at the meso- and micro-levels. This approach aims to empower individual teachers to act as agents of change, a goal the study discussed here shares.

# 3. Background and research questions

This section willbriefly describe the background of this study before outlining the research questions. The EMI program in this study has grown rapidly due to the high prestige of the university. However, it has become clear that when designing the program, the universt did not pay sufficient attention to the English language support that the students may ned. Because all the students eligible for and admitted to this program have completed their primary education in English, the universty probably assumed they would encounter no linguisticdifficulties in their studies. The academic writing elective course discussed here was incorporated into the curriculum following several year of students and faculty highlighting the necessity for academic writing asstance. Both students and content faculty encountered chllenges in this domain, prompting the addition of the course. Eventually, I was asked to teach the academic writing course. I took over the course from a different instructor and itilly adhered to the syllabus that had een designed by the previous instructors. I did that the irst time wasresponsible for th ourse, howeer, basd n student fdack I relized that the course was not helping the students as much as it should.

Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the adequacy of the academic writing instruction received by the students in this EMI program. The study sought to address the following research questions, aiming to identify the optimal approach for assting students in this program. Additionall, another intention was to uncover insights that could potentially guide ther EMI programs in Japan and Asia.

RQ1. What aspects of academic writing are the students most confident and most insecure about, and how should these perceptions   
be taken into consideration in the course?   
RQ2. What aspects of the academic writing course did the students sruggle with the most, and what aspects of the course do they   
feel were most useful for them to overcome these challenges?   
RQ3. Based on the results of RQ1 and RQ2, what changes should be made into the course sylabus to ensure student success?

Academic writing within EMI programs in non-English speaking environments is still an understudied topic, as pointed out by Graham and Eslami (2020) and Dafouz (2020). Research on how to effctively ass students with academic language support has not kept up with the rapid expansion of these programs. Hyland (2013) has stressed that for students enrolled in EMI programs in EFL contexts, it i crucial to attain the necesar level of competence and fluency in acadmic writing in order to succeed in their content learning. Most students struggle with attempting to produce academic writing whil at the same time taking on challenging content courses. Thus, more reearch is needed to highlight this ssue and to examine how we can help these students in the best possible way.

In their recent paper, McKinley and Rose (2022) identified gaps in the EMI research literature that need to be addressed, one of them being studies that investigate curricular elements of language support that best prepare and help students with their studies. The authors also advocated for more contextualized studies into student needs, with writing being mentioned as an important area of inquiry.

Within the Japanese context, very few studies have empirically examined the experiences of students or instructors, the players who collectively represent the key constituents of EMI courses. Rose and McKinley (2018) pointed out that \*field research at participant universtie of the GUP is an essential next step in order to examine how these objectives manifest into actions' (p. 17) Bradford (2018) also emphasized that Japanese higher education instutions serve as frutful reearch site for EMI challenges due to the likelihood of policy and practice inconsistencies.

The current study's goal, therefore, i to bridge this gap, particularly about academic writig in EMI programs, since most research conducted in relation to EMI does not focus on writing but rather, on other aspects of language proficiency, such as taking notes or aural understanding. It i believed that hs study can contribute to helping both administrators and teachers realizethe importance of providing academic writing support in EMI programs as well as how to best implement it, especill in EFL contexts such as Japan.

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Context

The present study took place at a prestigious private university in Tokyo area that has an EMI degree program. The university is one of those chosen for MExT's "Global 30 Project" to receive special funding for the purpose of developing an EMI program. As of May

2019, a total of 225 students were enrolled in the program. The admission policy for entering the program is relativel flexible. Students can apply either from Japan or from overeas, and admission decisions are made purely on document screening and a 3-min video submitted by each applicant. There are no written tests or interviews, and no need to visit the campus during the application process. There are also generous and exclusive scholarship opportunitie for international students enrolling in this program. As for English language requirements, students whose native language is English or those who have pent at least two years in a high school where education was conducted in English are eligible to apply without the need to prove their English language ability via standardized test scores. Japanese students who have graduated from a high school with Japanese medium instruction arealso eligible to apply; however, they are required to submit astandardized tes score of OEFL or IEL with ther aplication, although the university does not specify minimum cut-off scores for admission.

This study was designed to examine one specific course within the program, an elective course tited Academic Writing in English. During this 15-week course, students complete a 12-15-page research paper or part of a research paper on a topic of their choice. To meet the EMI program's requirements, students write their graduation theses or research reports in English; however, there is no requirement within the program for an academic writing course to prepare them for this task. In fact, only one section of the elective academic writing course that this study discusses isoffered each semester. Students must be selected in a lottery drawing to even be able to take the course as enrollment i caped at 25 students per semester. In the semester during which this study took place, about $4 0 \%$ of the students who participated in the lottery were able to enroll in the course.

As mentioned earlier, when I initiall taught this course and followed the prescribed syllabus, both the students and I voiced frustration, expressing that the course fell short of its potential helpfulness. Rather than focusing on individualized support for students' writing, the course had been designed as a standard academic writing course based on proces writing with heavy emphasis on peer review to familiarize the students with academic prose on predetermined controversial social isue topics. The students commented that the course was not helping them or preparing them to write their theses, as the research topics they were exposed to in the EMI program varied greatly, with some relying heavily on scientific writing while others were more humanistic-oriented. Therefore, to identify ways in which the course could be improved, this study was conducted and the lessons learned from it were used to redesign the course for future students and instructors.

# 4.2. Participants

Twenty-five students participated in the present study consisting of 14 females and 11 males with ages ranging from 19 to 34. They came from a variet of countries: 12 were Japanese who had lived overseas, five were Southeast Asian, four were from European countries two came from African countries, and the remaining two were from East Asian countrie. All of the students were admitted to the program without official proof of their English proficiency because they had either completed at last two years of high school education in English, they were considered native speakers of English, or in two cases, they had extensive experience using English in their work and, as such, were considered expert users of English.

The students' experience with academic writing varied greatly; some had very littl previous experience with academic writing in English, while others had done essay writing in English. All participants were given consent forms that explained the ams and procedures of the study, and they all provided written consent to participate in this study.

# 4.3. Instruments & data collection

The data collection was both observational, involving classroom observations and observation notes, and non-observational. involving a questionnaire and focus group discussions. At the beginning and the end of the 15-week course, an online questionnaire with both multiple-choice and open-ended questions was administered using Google Forms. The multiple-choice Likert-scale questions asked the students t rate their own confidence levels in different aspects of writing (such as writing a thesis statement and being able to find and use sources) at the beginning and at the end of the semester, while the open-ended questions asked them to elaborate on features of the course as well as the writing processes that they found to be the most useful. Twenty-five students responded to both of the questionnaires (se Appendix Afor the questionnaires).In addition, focus group discussions were held at the beginning, middle, and at the end of the semester with nine students. Each focus group discussion lasted about $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and the sessions were recorded and transcribed (see Appendix B for the focus group questions). Instructor observational notes that Itook at various times during the semester were also part of the data collected.

# 4.4. Procedure

The data collection and analysis procedures ofthis stud consisted of four cycles; pre-cycle, cycle1,cycle 2, and cycle 3, as shown in Table 1.

Each cycle included the steps for thinking, relecting, and acting. The pre-cycle took place the semester before this study was conducted and involved reading literature and talking to the EMI faculty, students, and a teacher who previously taught this course. During cycles 1, 2, and 3, various data sources were used to collect the data used for analysis and reflection as outlined in Table 1.

# 4.5. Data analysis

The quantitative data, consisting of the Likert-item responses from the questionnaires, were simplytallied with the help of Google Forms to discover the most frequent scores for students' self-rated perceptions of their confidence levels with different features of academic writing. For example, when asked how confident the students felt about organizing ideas a the beinning of the semester, ix students chose either very confident or confident, whil 11 students chose either not confident or a litl confident. However, for the same question at the end of the semester, the results were quite ifferent; at the end of the term, 14 students noted that they felt either confident or very confident about their ability to organize their ideas for a paper while only thre students felt litle confident and no students chose not confident at all These results suggest that most students were not comfortable with their bility to organize their ideas in an academic paper at the beginning of the semester; however, this was not the case at the end of the semester. Thus, a change had taken place in the students self-perceived ability. This method of analysis was deemed the most effctive for meeting the stated purposes of this study since the participants responses to the survey questions not only addressed the research questions but also yielded targeted data ripe for in-depth exploration during the focus group interviews.

For the qualitative data, arising both from the open-ended survey questions and from the focus group interviews, thematic analysis was used and the findings were subsequently corroborated with the additional data collected through my own teacher-researcher observations. For the thematic analysis, pre-coding (Layder, 1998) was irst used to discover the themes that emerged from the qualitative data afer which In Vivo Coding (Strauss, 1987) was used to connect actual student voices to the themes

# 5. Findings & discussion

# 5.1. Pre-cycle

The pre-cycle research stage is discussed here briefly because i i an important foundation for the impetus of this study. As pre viously noted, the ddtion of hs electiveacademic wriing course to the curriculum occrred several years ater the establishment of the EMI program Its inclusion was prompted by feedback from both faculty and students, indicating a recognized need for writing support. At the time, no such support existed. Therefore, an English language teacher whose main job was to teach EFL courses for the regular Japanese underaduate students at the university was asked to create and teach this course. In the yr preceding the semester described in this study, the reonsiity for teching this course was deleatd to me. I fllowed the stalished common syllabus that had been used in the program previously. However, during the first year that taught the Academic Writing in English course, it became clear that the course, as it was desined, was not meeting thestudents' demonstrated needs in the most effctive way. At the end of the course, many students expressed dissatisfaction that it had not adequately prepared them for the actual academic writing required in their content courses. Therefore, I decided that i was important to embark on this study in an attempt to improve the course both for the instructor who would be teaching it afer me and, most importantly, for the student. Based on these early discussions and the initial course experience, it became evident that, as highlighted by Aizawa and Rose (2019) in their study, our program seemed to share some of the same inherent challenges. As noted in their study, these challenges semed to include students grappling with linguistic dificulties and a misalignment between classroom practice and overarching policies at the macro level. Therefore, the pre-cycle stage involved reading the relevant cholarly literaure in this area, talking to the EMI faculty atthe university, and talking to students who had previously taken the same elective course all of which served to more clearly ustify the need for ths study to be carried out and more clearly delineate its chief aims and purposes.

# 5.2. Cycle 1

From the pre-course survey, the first focus group interview, and the initial classroom observations, the following thre central themes emerged in cycle 1: confidence in micro-level writing features, lack of confidence in macro-level writing featres, and need for discipline-embedded writing instruction.

A relatively large proportion of students expressed self-perceived confidence in the following categories by indicating that they elt either very confident or confident about creating an outline $( 5 0 \% )$ , spelling and punctuation $( 5 0 \% )$ , coherence $( 4 0 \% )$ , and finding and using sources $( 4 0 \% )$ . These were the features which reflected the highest degree of confidence expressed by the students overall. Moreover, in the focus group interviews, al the students expressed their confidence in being able to correct spellin, punctuation, and grammar in their papers with the help of some online toos, such as Grammarly. The students also shared that they were used to writing academic essays using a process writing approach, and therefore, that they were familiar with creating an outline. One student noted, The importance of outlines in helping me write my essay was stressed in my high school, and I wrote probably about four or five outlines in my junior and senior years for my short esays." I also observed thesestrengths in the initial clas sessions when students were asked to write informal passages about themselves, their reearch interests, and their prior English writing experience, and later as they started preparing outlines for their writing task for our lass. These results align with previous research indicating that EAP students generally perceive employing an appropriate essy structure and ensuring error-free language, including accurate spelling and grammar, as the least formidable aspects of academic writing (Kohnke & Jarvis, 2023). Additionall, another recent study by Zhang and Hasim (2023) reported that many students believe their academic writing instructors overemphasize writing accuracy, an area which they already fel confident in and do not believe they require additional asstance. Jenkins (2013) conveyed a similar sentiment.

Interestingly, although many students in the class stated that they were comfortable finding and using sources for their writing, when this was discused further in the focus group, none of the students could elaborate on the subject. When asked what makes a good source, similarly, nobody could quite put it into words. They were able to ist places where they could find sources; however, how to choose sources was not something they could discuss. This phenomenon was also apparent in the classroom, where I witnessed students introducing sources containing valuable and effctive information related to their topics. However, these sources did not align directly with their papers or contribute to supporting the arguments they aimed to present in their research. Other recent studies also corroborate this finding: students often seem to demonstrate n inability to choose and evaluate apropriate sources for use in their academic writing in an EMI context (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023; Sun & Soden, 2021).

Conversely, a large proportion of the students in the class expressed a lack of confidence about the following writing features by indicating that they felt either not very confident or a little bit confident about source formatting $( 6 0 \% )$ , developing a thesis statement $( 5 5 \% )$ , avoiding plagiarism $( 5 0 \% )$ , and using academic vocabulary $( 4 0 \% )$ . Likewise, in the focus group interviews and during class. discussions and observations at the beginning of the semester, these macro-features of writing were also shown to be problemati for the students. In regard to source formatting, relized that the students were not familiar with standardized citation formats, but many of them had be taght  simple way to cit source, often by merely listig the sourc as links at the ed of their papers. aso had to work individually with each student to develop their thesis statements as very few of them could develop a clear and concise thesis, often employing questions or facts as thesis statements instead. When I asked the students about plagiarism, most f them understod this to mean geting complete papers from the internet or asking someone else to write thir papers, but when presenting them with more discrete examples of plagiarism, such as changing only a few words from a source, most of the students were surprised to lean that this could also constitute plagiarism. I also had to spend a great deal of time raisig students awarenes of the distinction between common vocabulary terms and the more advanced vocabulary terms that should be used in research papers and introducing strategies for them to improve this aspect of their writing. Earlier studies support these findings, especially in regard to academic vocabulary, plagiarism, and source formatting. Several previous studies have highlighted the struggle many student face with choosing appropriate academic vocabulary, ften due to lack of rich and specialized words, and using accurate documentation practices as well as avoiding plagiarism (Subandowo & Sardi, 2023; Tajik et al., 2022; Zhang & Hasim, 2023).

# 5.3. Cycle 2

Therefore, based on the results of cycle 1, several important changes were made to the syllabus of the course in an attempt to try to address these issues in cycle 2. They included inorpoating dscple-embedded toic, focusing on chooing and using sources, and emphasis on academic tone.

Firstly, instead of using pre-determined, more typical essay writing topicsfor the course as had been planned, the instructor allowed the students to choose their own topic for the semester writing proect. As a result, many students chose to write a paper on the topic which they were planning to write on in their thesis or conduct research on during the EMI program. This change was welcomed by the students according to the focus group interview. One student commented, I was able to start hinking about how to write about my research topic. This was great because I could use the teacher's help in how to choose and include sources in my real future research." Another student said, I felt like I was doing real writing because I could writ about something I am planning on researching in the future. I also noticed that when students wrote about topics closely tied to their subject ontent, their motivation for writing was significantly more ntrinsic and higher compared to the previous semester when they were assigned predetermined topics unrelated to their research. Other researchers have emphasized the importance f connecting academic writing with the content ourse topics students are taking (Tann & Scott, 2021; Van Viegen & Rusell 2019). Gommerman (2022) ontends that thi approach proves effective inassisting EMI students. He discovered that students sem to particularl value this connection as it enables them to acquaint themselves with the use of literature within their specific field.

Secondly, more emphasis was placed on how to choose appropriate sources and how to incorporate them into student writing. In fact, roughly about $2 5 \%$ of the course time was spent on this because it was considered to be such a crucial skilland of such importance for the students future writing requirements. Both in and out of the classrom, this required me to give much individualized support to each student. Based on the student comments during the focus group interviews, this was seen as helpful. Many students commented that they thought choosing sources would be easy; however, that when they actall had to do it, it was more dificult than they imagined. Some of the reasons mentioned for this was the fact that sometimes, a good source does not ncessarily support or help one's writing. One student said,  found many great sources and I used them in my paper. But I learned that often, they did not support my ideas good, or that they did not connect directly to what I wanted to say." Another student commented, \*It's more dificult than thought to find good reliable sources that help my ideas. It was tough, but I think I can do it better now."

Finally, one thing that the students expressed surprise at was the fact that they should not use casual spoken language in their academic writing. Most students were perfectly fluent in spoken English; however, they have not had so much experience in using more formal language. Therefore, many students tended to use very casual language in their writing, thinking it isnormal. For example, I discovered that in their previous writing, many of the students had been using colloquial expressions and were under the impression that these were fine to use in academic writing because they were used in everyday communication. This challenge that students face in employing an aropriate academic register has been documented in prior research, as evidenced by studies such as those conducted by Evans and Morrison (2011) and Abouzeid (2021). This was addressed in the revise syllabus, and many students noted that they found this to be eye-opening as it was something they learned about for the first time.

# 5.4. Cycle 3

During cycle 3, at the end of the semester, the effect of the changes implemented during the course were reflected on. Fig. 1 shows the students' responses to the question How confident are you about your academic writing skills" t the end of the course (in yellow) and at the beginning of the course (in orange). As the figure hows, at the beginning of the course, very few students answered that they felt very confident or confiden in their oveal aademic witing skill, only seve students in total, hil nine felt not confident at allor not confident. The remaining nine students felt neutral about their academic writing sills at that time. However, by the end of the semester, most students (18)stated that they feel very confiden orconfident about their academic writig abilities. Only three students felt not onfident at all or not confident about thir sils while four still indicated that they felt neutral at the end of the course. Therefore, these results srongly suggest that the course was helpful in improing the students' academic writing skill, in adition to giving them confidence in continuing to complete the academic writing tasks they wil face in their continuing studies. As a teacher, this was easy for me to see when comparing the quality of the students' writing at the beginning of the semester and the end of the semester. For example, I could observe great improvement in academic register, vocabulary use, and source incorporation in particular.

This finding aligns with those from other relevant studies, including those by Costa and Mastelotto (2022) and Tomak (2022) Which have demonstrated that efective academic writing courses can indeed contribute to enhancing students writing skills and better prepare them for subsequent EMI writing requirements. Moreover, Aizawa et al. (2020) determined that placing significant emphasis on writing development in an academic preparation program proved effective in alleviating students' challenges with writing in a Japanese EMI program.

The main themes that emerged from the open-ended questionnaire responses and the focus group interviews about the usefulness of the course were reality of academic writing, importance of sources, and audience awareness.

Firstly, most students expressed their surprise at not actuall having known what academic writing entails especially when writing research papers in English. Most students commented on being confident in their English ability in general; however, that the type of writing expected in longer research papers was very diffrent from the writing they had done for shorter essays in their previous educational situations. One student commented, \*English used in an English research paper is completely different from the usual shorter essy I am accustomed to." Another student wrote, Through this course,I learned what the real cademic writing is." Finally, one student exclaimed, \*Surprisingly, academic writing was completely new to me, so, I am happy that I have completed my vey frst research paper. thought I knew how to writ in English." A study by Crosley (2020) als found that English academic writing courses can be effective in raising students' awareness about writing conventions.

Secondly, many students realized that they had not been prepared for academic rearch writing due to their lack of understanding how to ind and use appropriate sources in their papers. In addition, many students had not learned about the different citation styles and referencing methods. Many students voiced comments like, I had no idea how to cite and use sources in my paper', I did not know about in text citations or proper formatting styles", and I am very happy that I became capable of formatting my paper in APA style." Several earlier studies support the common difficulty many students have with using appropriate source conventions (Sub andowo & Sardi, 2023; Sun & Soden, 2021; Tajik et al., 2022). Because a great deal of time was spent on developing these skill in the classrom, I could clearly see student facility with this becoming almost automatic for them towards the end of the semester.

Thirdly, the importance of audience awareness and how it affects one's writing was another common theme discussed by the students. Onetudent ut i this way, The most useul thing that  leaned about academic writing is that it must be presented in way that is appropriate to the audience. Before, I would use words and terms without thinking whether I need to define or explain them" Another student said, "Most importantly, I could develop the academic tone of my writing," while another one wrote, \*The most important thing I learned is that I must think about the overall voice of my paper from beginning until the end and make sure it is written and organized in an academic way. This became clear to the students when I often had to ask questions about the meaning of a vocabulary term or the reasoning behind their ideas. The meaning or reasoning seemed obvious to them, but directing their attention to these nstances made them realize that these thing are not necessaril always obvious to the reader. The dificulty of using suitable academic register has been documented by other researchers also (Abouzeid, 2021; Evans & Morrison, 2011).

Several other recurring minor themes in the students' comments highlighted what they perceived as the most crucial lessons learned in the course. These included the significance of avoiding plagiarism,selecting a suitabl topic, and crafig a robust thesis statement. One student wrote, I am so glad to learn how to avoid plagiarism." Another one commented, It is much easier to write about a narrowed down topic. So, t is important o consider and spend a lot of time choosing your topic." One other student said, I feel much more comfortable organizing my ideas with strong arguments and examples which is very important for research writing.

# 6. Conclusion

This study was designed to address three research questions, and the answers willbe discussed below in turn. Research question 1 sought to explore which elements of academic writing students eel most confident and least confident about, and how this information should be considered when structuring the course. The findings indicate that students demonstrated greater confidence in micro-level writing aspects such as grammar, selling, and surface-level organization, while expressig insecurity with macro-level skills such as adopting an academic voice, employing academic vocabulary, and effectively selecting and using sources in their writing. Consequently, a conventional ESL/EFL writing syllabus emphasizing the writing process accuracy, and peer review may not be the most effectie aproach. Istead, much more uitable pproach might involve preparing students fr uces in their content courses. This approach would ental integrating subject-specific writing topics, placing a heightened emphasis on guiding students through source conventions, and enhancing their use of academic vocabulary and appropriate register. As demonstrated by this study, such an approach proved beneficial for the students in the course investigated.

Research question 2 delved into the challenges students encountered in the academic writing course, identifying the aspects they found most difficult and pinpointing which elements they considered most beneficial in overcoming these challenges. The results partilly coincide with the response to reearch question 1. According to the datacollected and analyed in this study, thre aspects of academic writing, namely the realities of academic writing, the significance of sources, and audience awarenes, posed the greatest challenges for students during the course. Interestingly, these aspects were also identified by the students as the most important learning takeaways of the course. The assumptions that students held about academic writing did not align with the specific re. quirements of research writing in their EMI program and in this elective academic writing course. Consequently, developing an awareness and understanding of the true nature of academic writing proved to be invaluable to many of the participant students. Likewise, the acquisition of skils for utilizing sources and reconzing the mportance f audence awarness were identified as crucial achievements by many of the students.

Research question 3 examined the modifications that should be implemented in the writing course to maximize its benefits for students. I this case, the original course had been designed with general ES. writing principles in mind, but, as a result of this study, the revised syllabus was designed to be morediscipline-oriented with focus on the identified weaknesses of the students. In this case, the modifications made to the course syllabus and approach semed to result in very positive outcomes. As the findins show, all of the students benefited from the course, and despite being only a one-semester course, it semed to notably increase their confidence in their English academic writing abilites on the whole. Nevertheles, the results also revealed that certain students continued to harbor reservations about specific aspects of their writing skills even though there was an overall increase in confidence. This outcome underscores the intricate and challenging nature of teaching academic writing to a diverse group of learners. Furthermore, it serves as evidence that single semester acadmic writing course might not uffice for many students. Consequently, there is a compelling case for the introduction of a more structured and longitudinal writing support curriculum in this EMI context.

In summary, this study has shown the importance as well as the need for providing efective academic writing courses for students enrolled in EMI programs in Japan that are crefully designed to mee the unique challenges these students are likely to face. The need and benefits of providing academic writing support in EMI programs has ben documented by several researchers (Abouzeid, 2021; Evans & Morrion, 2011; Jenkins, 2013), and, in Asian contexts, it has been found that writing i ofte considered the most challenging aspect of EMI coursework for many students (Evans & Green, 2007; Le & Lee, 2018). Students in these programs are often mistakenly assumed not to need any academic writing support, and therefore, like the program discussed i this study, these resources are not always readily avalable to them. However, academic writing courses can make a significant difference in the success of students in EMI contexts, and like the students in this study, this one academic writing course provided them with the guidance and confidence needed to be able to tackle their undergraduate research writing requirements. Previous studies ., Muttqin & Chuang, 2023; Song, 2006) have discussed simila findings stessing how important EAP preparation isto students academic achievement and their oeral success in EMI programs and demonstrating a significant relationship between the two.

However, the discrepancy in macro-level policy and macro-level practice continues to be an issue, as this study has shown. As stated by Aizawa and Rose (2019), It appears that the EMI policy in Japan is being driven by institutional-level and national-level policy, rather than being pushed by students and teachers themselves." Hamid et al. (2013) noted that while EMI programs continue to be popular, serious obstacles remain, which tend to prevent them from being operated in the most efective way. In the Japanese context, Brown (2016) found that only $8 \%$ of the universities offering EMI programs offered AEP support. Hence, it is crucial for policymakers, university administrators, and faculty to ensure that EMI addreses students' pedagogical and linguistic requirements efectively. Collaboration between all stakeholders is crucial tofulilling these needs because often it sems that the faculty teaching content courses may not be aware of the English language challenges their students are facing while the English teaching specialists may have more information and expertise in addressing these specific needs. At the same time, it i mportant for English languageteachers to be aware of the requirements of the content courses when it comes to academic English skill, so that they can design their courses accordingly.

To conclude, i i clear from this study that academic writing courses are useful and necessary for universty students. Student gained critical academic writing skill from the course, which will prove to be crucial for them to complete their reearch writing in English. Therefore, when universities in Japan develop EMI programs, more emphasis should be placed on providing academic writing support for the students. Reearch writing courses like the one dicussed in this study should be offered to students as foundational and required courses, not only as elective courses.

# 7. Limitations

While it i believed that this study has provided useful information, there are several limitations that should be kept in mind. First the results of this AR study canot neessrily be generalized and should only be interpreted in this context. However, that is asoseen as a strength of AR; itsaim is to produce practical knowledge that is useful in a specific teaching context. The validity of AR research can be measured by whether i improves the classroom situation or not. In ths case, the study succeeded in meeting that central aim. Based on student feedback, the course now serves them better. Other weaknesses are that the study used self-reported questionnaire data, which is not always an accurate indication of one's abilities and that it focused on an EMI context comprised of mostly L2 earners; however, t is possble that 1 writers would experience similar chllnges. Furthermore, the study took place only for one 15- week semester. An even longer study would ikely provide more useful and accurat feedack- especiall fter this first semesterto asses the concrete efect of the course. Therefore, extending the study for another semester or an additional year while the students continue writing in their content courses would clearly be insightful. Finall, since the program does not have official or standardized English proficiency information on the students, that i a limitation as the ned for academic writing support and students perceptions could vary based on their proficiency. Having this information would be highly valuable in evaluating how English language proficiency impacts each individual learner's readiness for the type of academic writing they will need to do.

# 8. Pedagogical implications

Several pedagogical implications, particularly for the Japanese and other Asian contexts, can be derived from this study.

Firstly, as this study has shown, EMI students who are often viewed as being fluent i English sill ned academic writing support. It is important for teachers to attempt to undersand the weaknesses students have and talor their courses to help with these specific challenges. There is no one-size-it-all soltion, i sems, and t is mportant for techer to reize tht tradtioal  witing courses may not offer the best approach. In Japan and Asia, any EMI English support courses are most likely being taught by English language teachers. These teachers need to venture outside of their comfort zone and provide more individualized writing instruction that better prepares students for the demanding writing they will actually undertake.

Secondly, more coordination between content courses and English language support in EMI programs would be helpful. Specifically, with academic writing courses, teachers should align the writing tass to students content subject, especially when students are expected to do research on their field. This study has shown that there is a need for greater EAP support for many EMI students, especiall those studying in EFL contexts. McKinley and Rose (2022) stressed the crucial role that English language teachers can play in assisting EMI students. Especiall in Asian contexts, where the government i usually the driving force behind EMI programs, ELT should become a central component of EMI programs, they argue. The authors also acknowledge that English academic support remains notably absent in many of these programs at the moment, as also evidenced by this study, or that i exis only as a marginal afterthought.

Finall, at the administrative level, Jenkins (2013) argues that higher education institutions that are attempting to introduce successful EMI programs need to undergo "stematic changes in order to abandon the view that it is the intenational students who need to adapt to the local way of doing things. Instead, she argues that universties need to meet them halfway and also adapt, and providing appropriate EAP support is one way of achieving this. Many researchers have stressed the importance of providing university-wide academic language support, including writing support, as the most efective way to support students studying in EMI programs (e.g., Arkoudis & Harris, 2019, Edwards e al., 2021). Writing teachers can advocate for this by examining their own contexts and suggesting improvements, just as this study has done.

Therefore, teachers need to undertake more classroom research that can directly improve their own teaching context. AR research can be extremely valuablefor the language classoom and should be utilized more by language teachers. As Burns (2009) has pointed out, AR is an important way of discovering how we can improve our teaching contexts and classooms in addition to being important for professinal development. An important area for future research that can utilize AR is to explore how ELT professionals as well as EMI faculty and administrators can collaborate to address both the discipline-specific needs and EAP needs of students. Galloway and Ruegg (2020) argued that collaboration betwee language and content specialists is urgently needed. In one recent study in China, it was shown that such collaboration was already standard practice at two transnational universties where they worked together to develop and provide writing courses to students (McKinley et al., 2021). This should become the standard in EMI programs.
