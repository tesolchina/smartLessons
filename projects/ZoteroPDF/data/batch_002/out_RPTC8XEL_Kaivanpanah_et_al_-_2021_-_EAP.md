Responding to the limited research on English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teachers, and especially in the context of ‘expanding circle’ countries, this study aimed to explore Iranian EAP teachers’ teaching competencies and professional development (PD) activities as well as their perceptions about the roles, responsibilities, and challenges in teaching EAP. Data were collected from 105 university EAP teachers through questionnaires and semistructured interviews. The questionnaire findings in relation to teacher competencies identified self-reported strengths in the areas of reading and speaking skills development and aspects of pedagogy. Potential areas for further development were related to listening skills, certain areas of writing, providing feedback, and performing needs analyses. Content analysis of the interviews indicated nine major categories of roles and responsibilities involved in the delivery of EAP courses (teaching, PD, collaboration, testing, motivation, materials, needs analysis, research, and text analysis) and seven major challenges (students, materials, EAP teachers, administrative issues, curriculum and syllabus, testing, and content knowledge). Additionally, the teachers provided information about their pathway to EAP teaching and their viewpoints about the role of content knowledge, essential qualifications for EAP teaching, and content of EAP teacher education programs. Finally, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are presented.

# 1. Introduction

This study aims to provide a panoramic overview of a range of issues relating to the knowledge, roles, teaching competencies, and Professional Development (PD) activities of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) practitioners in Iran. EAP practitioners in this study are taken to include those teaching English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) courses within Iran’s higher education institutes. While some may classify these courses as English for Specific Purposes (ESP) courses, the approach taken here is to consider them within the purview of EAP as the courses focus on the acquisition of academic English for the main purpose of participation in higher education.

In any language teaching and learning situation, teachers, students, and materials/textbooks are considered to be the three main integral elements (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Richards, 1998). However, when referring to EAP’s parent discipline of ESP, Brown (2016) claims that teachers are central to the implementation of ESP courses. Teachers are responsible for supporting the four main pillars of this field, namely: materials and methods, needs analysis, learning objectives, and evaluation (Anthony, 2018). The demanding nature of this area of language teaching is emphasized by Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998), involving roles beyond classroom teaching alone (Charles & Pecorari, 2016). These roles include: analyzing learners’ needs, designing courses, developing materials, collaborating with subject-matter teachers, analyzing discipline-specific discourses, and evaluating courses/programs (Woodrow, 2018). The complexity surrounding this type of teaching would seem to require a considerable level of practitioner knowledge and training and a concomitant level of research activity. However, despite the continuing expansion of EAP programs around the world, the training and ongoing development of EAP teachers able to implement this type of complex language course have unfortunately been treated as marginal issues (Basturkmen, 2014, 2019; Belcher, 2013).

In the research literature of EAP, there has been a considerable focus on learners (Bocanegra-Valle, 2016; Long, 2005) and materials (Stoller, 2016; Tomlinson & Masuhara, 2018), but there has been a lesser research focus on EAP teachers (Ding, 2019; Ding & Bruce, 2017; Ding & Campion, 2016). This area seems to have been largely neglected at the expense of a research focus on aspects of curriculum and student needs (Basturkmen, 2019; Bocanegra-Valle & Basturkmen, 2019). This paucity of research on EAP teachers has been repeatedly highlighted by several scholars (e.g., Basturkmen, 2014, 2019; Campion, 2016; Ding & Bruce, 2017; Ding & Campion, 2016; Martin, 2014). A recent review article by Nazari (2020) has also highlighted the issue, noting “a dispersed intermittent empirical attention to teachers” under an array of topics (p. 1). Further empirical confirmation of this lack of a research focus on the teacher is also found in recent studies of the bibliometrics of journals in the EAP and ESP fields (Hyland & Jiang, 2020; Liu & Hu, 2021; Riaizi, Ghanbar, & Fazel, 2020). In fact, as Belcher (2013) maintains, “the community that ESP [and EAP] professionals know the least about is their own” (p. 544). Despite the “plurality of identities, roles, contexts, and praxis” in EAP (Ding & Campion, 2016, p. 548), only a small amount of research on teachers has been conducted in a limited number of contexts (e.g., Alexander, 2012; Bocanegra-Valle & Basturkmen, 2019; Campion, 2016; Chang, 2017; Li & Ma, 2020; Li & Wang, 2018; Nguyen, Haworth, & Hansen, 2019).

While EAP instruction can be described on a continuum stretching from general to specific EAP courses in which the program context determines learners’ needs and the suitable specificity level (Bax, 2003; Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998; Graves, 2008; Jordan, 1997; Savignon, 2007), it is also acknowledged that there is a considerable diversity of EAP contexts, such as in inner circle, outer circle, and particularly expanding circle countries (Ding & Bruce, 2017). Therefore, the actual job of teaching EAP requires a wide range of types of knowledge and expertise, which may vary according to institutional and national contexts (see Hyland & Shaw, 2016, Part VII, Pedagogic Contexts). In the context of Iran, an ‘expanding circle’ country with an active EAP community, a significant body of research has addressed students’ academic English needs and EAP textbooks in various university disciplines (e.g., Atai & Nazari, 2011; Atai & Shoja, 2011; Atai & Hejazi, 2019; Soodmand Afshar & Movassagh, 2016). However, with the exception of a small number of studies (e.g., Atai & Fatahi-Majd, 2014; Atai & Taherkhani, 2018; Rajabi, Kiany, & Maftoon, 2012), little research has systematically explored Iranian EAP teachers’ teaching competencies and PD activities as well as their perceptions about their roles and responsibilities.

Therefore, acknowledging the diversity of EAP contexts (Ding & Bruce, 2017) and their inherent contextual differences (related to teachers, learners, textbooks, and curricula), it is argued here that further contextualized research on EAP teachers is needed in order to make informed decisions in several areas including the content of EAP teacher education programs, evaluation of EAP teachers’ practices, and development of criteria for EAP teacher recruitment.

# 1.1. The study context

In Iran, all university courses are taught in the country’s official language, i.e. Persian. In all undergraduate programs, students are required to pass one general English course, characterized as English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP), as well as one or two, obligatory, discipline-based EAP courses, characterized as English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP), to become ready to read research publications and textbooks in English during their studies (Tavakoli & Tavakol, 2018). In fact, these two types of courses, designed and sponsored by the Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology (MSRT), constitute a significant part of the curricula for all majors in Iran (Atai & Tahririan, 2003). It should be noted that all EGAP courses are implemented by ELT departments and taught by English language (EL) teachers. However, since there is no formal mandate in the national curriculum on who should teach discipline-based EAP (ESAP) courses (Taherkhani, 2019) as well as the fact that they are included in the subject-matter (e.g., sociology, mechanical engineering) curricula, they are taught mostly by content teachers (Atai & Fatahi-Majd, 2014) and a small number of content-informed EL teachers. For teachers of these ESAP courses in Iran, there are no established teacher education/training programs and PD opportunities.

In response to Basturkmen’s (2014, 2019) call for further extensive empirical research on EAP teachers in different contexts, the study reported here (which is part of a larger project) attempts to shed light on this increasingly important area of the practitioner in the Iranian context. The study focuses on teachers of ESAP courses, specifically examining their teaching competencies, PD activities, roles, and responsibilities as well as other issues. The study was motivated by the following Research Questions (RQs):

1. What are ESAP teachers’ perceptions about their roles and responsibilities in teaching EAP?   
2. What are the major challenges in teaching ESAP in Iran?

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Participants

A total of 105 ESAP teachers (English language and content teachers of EAP) from 15 leading state universities and 16 academic majors in Iran participated in this part of the project. The teachers were either those teaching the students who participated in other data collection activities of the larger project or others chosen by convenience and snowball sampling in the 2018e2019 academic year. Fig. 1 provides details about the sample, including gender, age, tertiary education, and employment. Among the 105 teachers of ESAP that responded to the questionnaire, $5 0 . 5 \%$ and $4 9 . 5 \%$ of them were identified as English language (EL) teachers and teachers of content subjects (who also taught ESAP), respectively. From the questionnaire sample, 28 teachers agreed to participate in semi-structured interviews by responding to a question at the end of the questionnaire. It was decided that data saturation was accomplished when 20 ESAP teachers were interviewed. Fig. 2 shows the interview participants’ demographic information.

# 2.2. Instruments

To increase the validity of the findings, triangulation of data collection methods (instrument triangulation) was employed (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2017, p. 265). Questionnaires were developed to probe ESAP teachers’ teaching competence and PD activities. In addition, a schedule of questions for semi-structured interviews was created for use with a sub-group of the ESAP teachers who had completed the questionnaires to explore their views about their roles, responsibilities and challenges in teaching ESAP, and a range of other issues.

# 2.2.1. Questionnaire development

Following Dornyei € ’s (2010) steps for questionnaire development, two Likert-scale questionnaires were developed to explore ESAP teachers’ teaching competencies (Appendix A) and PD activities (Appendix B). Both questionnaires drew on BALEAP’s CFTEAP and TEAP documents (2008, 2014) as well as the findings of preparatory unstructured interviews with several EAP and content teachers (see Section 2.2.2). In addition, the teaching competencies questionnaire was developed based on studies by Alexander (2012), Atai & Hejazi, 2019, Atai and Fatahi-Majd (2014), Chostelidou, Griva, and Tsakiridou (2009), and Rajabi et al. (2012). Additionally, the professional development questionnaire drew on previous questionnaires by Jing (2010) and Wichadee (2012).

Following the initial development of the two questionnaires, expert feedback and advice on the questionnaire design was sought from a panel of 12 specialist teachers (EL, $\Nu = 4$ ; content, $\Nu = 4$ ; and EAP, $\ N = 4$ ) to obtain their views about PD and teaching competences, which led to minor revisions in a few items. Next, a panel of experts including EL and EAP teachers $\mathbf { N } = 6 \mathbf { \dot { \Omega } }$ ) and psychometricians $( \Nu = 2 )$ ) checked and revised the questionnaires for clarity, content-relatedness, and format.

Fig. 2. Participants’ demographic information (interview)

Finally, a pilot study with representative samples was conducted, and some further modifications were undertaken t improve the questionnaires.

Following the common practice for scale development and validation (Hair, Anderson, Babin, & Black, 2010; Worthington & Whittaker, 2006), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was run in AMOS (Version 23) to corroborate the factor structure of the questionnaires. After removing items with factor loadings below 0.3 and performing some model modifications, the two questionnaires were considered to display adequate construct validity and acceptable internal consistency coefficients in different sections $\texttt { \^ } { } \alpha = 0 . 7 4  – 0 . 9 5$ ).

# 2.2.2. Interview schedule development

To complement the data collected through questionnaires, a schedule of semi-structured interviews with ESAP teachers was also developed in order to probe the teachers’ views about a range of issues. The interview questions were based on previous studies (Campion, 2016; Martin, 2014) and preparatory unstructured interviews with several ESAP and content teachers carried out during the questionnaire development phase. A panel of EAP experts further checked the questions and suggested some modifications, leading to the final selection of nine questions (see Appendix C).

# 2.3. Procedure

In recruiting the sample, university administrators (e.g., vice deans of educational affairs, heads of content departments as well as EAP departments) in several major state universities were initially contacted (in person or via telephone/email) to seek their permission. The aims of the study were explained for them, and those granting permission at the institutional level were further contacted to organize data collection procedures. Requests for participation in the study were made to ESAP teachers in person or by email. The principles of volunteerism, informed consent, and anonymity were adhered to. Before gaining the participants’ consent, they were informed that participation in the study was entirely voluntary, and they could withdraw at any stage. The exclusion criteria were incomplete questionnaires, refusal to give informed consent, and unwillingness to continue the study. In the reporting of the study, aggregation of the collected data was employed to ensure the anonymity of the participants and their institutions.

The data collection was carried out in the 2018e2019 academic year. A total of 140 questionnaires were distributed among the ESAP teachers, and 105 were returned in person or via email, resulting in a response rate of $7 5 \%$ . Additionally, 20 ESAP teachers who had completed the questionnaires also participated in the semi-structured interviews which were conducted in either Persian or English to suit their preferences. Each interview took about $6 0 { - } 7 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ in order to provide the participants with sufficient time to express their opinions in response to the nine guiding questions. The interviews were recorded and transcribed for analysis. It was considered that data saturation was accomplished after interviewing ten English language teachers and ten content teachers who taught ESAP courses.

The interview data were analyzed following the approach of Dornyei (2007) € . First, the data were transcribed. Then, in the pre-coding stage, the transcripts were carefully read a few times. Next, the data were coded and recoded several times to obtain ‘higher-order pattern codes’ from ‘descriptive and low-inference’ codes. For example, regarding challenges in teaching ESAP courses, sub-themes such as low General English Proficiency (GEP) level, heterogenous GEP levels, low motivation for and fear of EAP, and exam-oriented mentality were re-coded and subsumed under a major code named ‘student issues’. In addition, based on Lynch’s (2003) recommendation, the coding and extraction of sub-themes and major themes were cross-checked by two applied linguistics experts familiar with qualitative research and analysis of interview data.

# 3.1. The teacher questionnaires

# Teacher competencies

The questionnaire relating to teacher competencies (see Appendix A) comprised a granulated set of 72 items focusing on elements of teacher knowledge and pedagogical practice, which were selected as they were considered relevant to the delivery of EAP courses in the Iranian university context during the questionnaire preparation and consultation phases. Teachers were asked to self-rate their knowledge or teaching abilities as 1. very proficient, 2. Proficient, or 3. needing improvement in the following ten areas:

reading skills (Questions 1e10) listening skills (Questions 11e16) writing skills (Questions 17e21) speaking skills (Questions 22e24) ICT (Questions 25e28) - grammar and vocabulary (Questions 29e34) translation skills (Questions 35e38) - provision of feedback (Questions 39e47) assessment (Questions 48e51) pedagogy (Questions 52e64) performing needs analyses (Questions 65e72)

Appendix A presents the items with the participants’ $\mathrm { N } = 1 0 5$ ) responses to each item as percentages of the total sample of respondents. The following is a summary of the key trends that emerged from the findings of the teacher competencies questionnaire.

In the questionnaire responses, a considerable majority ( $7 5 \%$ or more) self-assessed as either ‘proficient’ or ‘very proficient’ in items relating to: reading skills, speaking skills, grammar and vocabulary, translation skills, assessment, aspects of classroom pedagogy, and the use of technology in the classroom. However, for most of the questionnaire items relating to teaching aspects of the listening skill, the percentage of teachers’ self-assessing as ‘proficient’ or very proficient’ was below $7 0 \%$ . In the needs analyses section, over $2 5 \%$ of the teachers suggested that they would benefit from further development work in identifying and addressing students’ needs in the area of developing listening skill knowledge.

In relation to the writing skill, responses to items relating to technical essays and related professional writing (e.g., formal correspondence and CV development) were below $7 5 \%$ as ‘proficient’ or ‘very proficient’. Similarly, in the responses to items relating to aspects of writing feedback, such as fluency, accuracy, organization and the use of different structures, more than $2 5 \%$ also indicated that they would benefit from further development in this area.

Professional Development

The questionnaire relating to professional development activities (see Appendix B) consisted of 19 items asking the participants to indicate how often they had participated in the named events and activities during the last 12 months with the options of always, sometimes, never. Appendix B presents the items along with the participants’ $\mathbf { N } = 1 0 5$ ) responses to each item as percentages. The following is a summary of the key trends that emerged from the findings of the professional development questionnaire.

Frequent development activities were:

peer observations (Item 3) with $9 5 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
informal sharing of ideas with colleagues (Item 4) with $8 3 \%$ choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
professional reading (Item 13) with $8 3 \%$ choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes.   
searching for knowledge for teaching through print and electronic sources (Item 14) with $9 5 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
- searching for knowledge for assessment through print and electronic sources (Item 15) with $8 1 . 6 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
- regularly reviewing one’s own teaching (Item 16) with $9 5 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
accessing subject matter lectures through YouTube (Item 18) with $9 5 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.   
- learning new technologies for classroom use (Item 19) with $9 3 \%$ of participants choosing ‘always’ or ‘sometimes’.

The lower-frequency activities identified by the participants included:

sharing PD knowledge with colleagues (Item 5) with $7 2 . 4 \%$ of participants indicating ‘never’.

attending conferences (Item 6) with $4 8 . 6 \%$ of participants indicating ‘never’.   
- publishing a paper in ELT/EAP journals (Item 10) with $5 0 . 5 \%$ of participants indicating ‘never’.   
presenting a conference paper nationally or internationally (Item 11) with $5 8 \%$ of participants indicating ‘never’.   
memberships of national or international subject organizations (Item 12) with $5 8 \%$ of participants indicating ‘never’.

# 3.2. Interview results

To build on the questionnaire findings, semi-structured interviews with ESAP teachers $( \Nu = 2 0$ ) were also conducted to elicit more detailed information about teachers’ perceptions of a variety of aspects of the planning and delivery of ESAP courses. The sample was divided between subject content teachers (hereafter ‘content teachers’) who also taught ESAP $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1 0 )$ ) and English language teachers of EAP $\mathrm { N } = 1 0$ ) (hereafter ‘EL teachers’). The findings are organized around the nine interview questions.

1. What are the main roles and responsibilities of ESAP teachers?

Almost all participants stated that teaching ESAP is a demanding profession due to their important responsibility to ‘keep track of everything related to an ESAP class, such as students’ needs, materials, etc.’ The analysis of the responses to this question resulted in the identification of a variety roles and responsibilities seen as central to the delivery of ESAP courses.

Issues identified by both teacher groups

Materials: This issue was stated by almost all teachers $( \mathsf { N } = 1 9 )$ ). Content teachers mainly referred to materials selection while EL teachers added a wider range of terms such as materials adaptation, materials simplification, and materials production/development. One content teacher said, ‘I believe it is important to choose texts at the right level of difficulty. Also, the text should be chosen from authentic sources published by well-known international publications’. In addition, one EL teacher said, ‘We should be fully prepared to choose authentic texts and adapt them to our students’ level’. Another EL teacher stated, ‘I mostly compile my own materials and develop new texts by consulting with my content counterparts’. Teaching: Another frequent theme $\mathrm { N } = 1 8 $ ) in nearly all interviews was teaching reading comprehension skills and technical vocabulary based on EAP syllabi designed by the MSRT. Moreover, nine content teachers and one EL teacher strongly believed translation techniques and grammar structures should definitely be covered in ESAP classes. Testing: Testing was cited by both EL teachers $( \Nu = 7 )$ and content teachers $( \Nu = 6 ) ,$ . They mostly referred to this theme as an ‘enormous responsibility’. For instance, their official responsibilities to ‘develop suitable tests’ for either formative or summative assessment and ‘mark a considerable number of exam papers at the end of each semester’ were mentioned by many teachers. Student Motivation: This theme was pointed out by many teachers $\mathbf { N } = 1 2$ ). They thought they have an instrumental role in raising students’ awareness of the importance of English for research publication and conference presentation. Several content teachers $( \Nu = 7$ ) stated that they motivate students to read academic sources in English and even take general English classes in private institutes or university language centers. Furthermore, some EL teachers $( \Nu = 5 )$ underscored the importance of helping students enhance their self-confidence for studying general and academic English.

Issues identified by the English language teachers of EAP

Professional development: Eight EL teachers maintained that ESAP teachers should actively invest in their PD by participating in conferences, workshops, and seminars as well as conducting research and publishing/reporting the results.   
Collaboration: Seven EL teachers highlighted the importance of collaboration with subject-matter experts/teachers to select suitable materials, improve their subject-matter knowledge, and have a better view of students’ needs. For example, one EL teacher said, ‘I have always relied on the knowledge and expertise of my colleagues in the psychology department to select suitable materials, improve my subject-matter knowledge, have a better view of my students’ needs, etc.’ A few EL teachers $( \Nu = 3$ ) acknowledged the help they received from content teachers in preparing exam questions. On the other hand, a small number of content teachers $( \Nu = 4 )$ said they referred to EL teachers only for pronunciation and translation.   
Needs analysis: EL teachers $( \mathbf { M } = 7 )$ considered needs analysis very important both during and at the end of the term. One EL teacher stated, ‘I usually help my department design and administer surveys to have a better view of the learners’ needs by probing the views of students, EAP teachers, and sometimes content teachers’. On the other hand, content teachers did not explicitly refer to this theme, but said they did their best to have students’ present and future needs in mind.   
Research: This theme was cited by some EL teachers $( \mathsf { N } = 5 )$ ). ‘Conducting mini-research projects to fulfill professional duties’, ‘undertaking several research projects’, ‘publishing research papers’, and ‘delivering presentations in conferences’ were stated by these teachers.   
Text analysis: Some EL teachers $( \Nu = 6 ) $ ) said they often analyzed texts taken from authentic sources to raise students’ awareness of different genres. For example, two English for Medical Purposes (EMP) teachers said they analyzed different parts of research papers as well as the moves and steps in different genres such as morning report, case study, and research papers.

2. What are the main challenges of teaching ESAP courses in Iran?

The challenges cited in response to this question could be categorized into the following groups:

Student issues: Several problems relating to students, as major barriers to efficient implementation of ESAP programs, were pointed out: low General English Proficiency (GEP) level $( \mathsf { N } = 1 8 )$ ), heterogenous GEP levels $( \mathsf { N } = 1 5$ ), large class sizes $\mathbf { N } = 1 3$ ), low motivation for and fear of EAP $\mathbf { N } = 1 2$ ), and students’ exam-oriented mentality $( \mathsf { N } = 1 0 ^ { \cdot }$ ).   
Materials: Most ESAP teachers $( \mathsf { N } = 1 7$ ) referred to the lack of or limited number of suitable ESAP textbooks as a major problem. A considerable number of teachers $( \Nu = 1 2$ ) complained about locally published textbooks as not being based on comprehensive needs analysis, lacking practical exercises, ignoring listening and productive skills, and overemphasizing translation.   
ESAP teachers: More than half of the participants $\mathbf { N } = 1 5$ pointed out several issues subsumed under the major theme ESAP teachers. All EL teachers referred to content teachers’ low GEP level, inadequate language teaching skills, and excessive attention to translation and teaching the subject-matter in ESAP classes as serious problems. Additionally, some content teachers $( \Nu = 5$ ) thought EL teachers were not cooperative in developing materials and tests.   
Administrative issues: A large number of ESAP teachers $( \Nu = 1 3$ ) considered the absence of EAP-specific PD and teacher training programs as a major problem. In addition, many EL teachers $( \Nu = 7 ) .$ ) criticized the unquestioned authority of content teachers and departments to teach ESAP courses even when there are EAP departments in universities. In addition, many EL teachers $( \Nu = 7$ ) referred to their lower perceived status by students, content departments, and the whole education system. Furthermore, several EL teachers $\mathrm { T } = 8$ ) claimed that there was an insufficient number of EAP departments in Iranian universities.   
Curriculum and syllabus: Several teachers $\mathrm { \bf N } = 9 .$ ) pointed out that the current Iranian EAP curriculum is vague and incoherent. For example, one content teacher said, ‘The MSRT curriculum provides only a list of topics to be covered in sociology without paying attention to details and different genres’. They also criticized the insufficient number of EAP units at undergraduate and graduate programs as well as the MSRT syllabi for neglecting important details such as course aims and procedures, genre awareness, and roles of materials, students, and teachers.   
- Testing: This challenge was mentioned by a large number of teachers $\mathrm { N } = 1 3$ ). They were mostly unsure about what to test due to their failure to distinguish the borderline between testing the subject-matter, English language, and ESAP. Additionally, many content teachers $( \Nu = 7 )$ and a few EL teachers $( \Nu = 2 )$ ) said they needed training for developing appropriate tests. For example, one content teacher admitted his lack of expertise in developing suitable ESAP tests by saying ‘I feel really incompetent in developing tests. I just ask my students to translate technical words, phrases, and sentences from English to Persian. That’s all. I think there should be more!’ Content knowledge: A large number of EL teachers $\mathrm { T } = 8 $ ) referred to this challenge in their comments. One teacher said he was unsure about the depth and breadth of the necessary content knowledge. In addition, some EL teachers $( \Nu = 6 )$ highlighted their significant role in developing mutual trust with their students and subject-matter colleagues for expanding their content knowledge and resolving subject-matter critical incidents.

3. What route have you taken to become an ESAP teacher?

The EL teachers were either EAP faculty members or visiting teachers. Based on the interviews, the former group $( \Nu = 6 )$ all had PhD degrees in TEFL and had been formally assessed and recruited based on their previous teaching and research background in EAP and their academic records. The latter group $( \Nu = 4 )$ , i.e. the visiting teachers with either an MA or PhD in TEFL, acknowledged the fact that there were no special recruitment criteria.

Content teachers mostly said they did not choose to teach EAP, but rather, just wanted to fill their weekly schedule $( \Nu = 6 )$ or willingly or unwillingly accepted their [content] departments’ offer for complying with their departments’ tendency to avoid outsourcing ESAP courses $( \Nu = 7$ ). They reported that expertise to teach ESAP was based on spending their sabbatical leave in a foreign country $( \Nu = 7 .$ ), a personal interest in English-to-Persian translation $( \Nu = 6 )$ , taking extra general English classes during their undergraduate degrees $\left( \mathrm { N } = 6 \right)$ ), and translating books and papers from English to Persian for either publication or research purposes $( \Nu = 6 )$ ).

4. Which type of materials do you use in your teaching: simplified or authentic?

Many teachers $\mathrm { N } = 1 3$ ) said they used authentic texts adopted from subject-matter textbooks published by well-known publishers while others $( \Nu = 7 )$ preferred simplified texts. Three EL teachers in medical science universities maintained that they followed their departments’ requirements based on which the authenticity of the texts gradually increased or authentic texts were used for certain majors, such as pharmacy, medicine, and dentistry.

5. Which type of discourse do you mainly focus on: oral or written?

Almost all teachers $\mathrm { N } = 1 8$ ) said their classes are based on written texts. Only few EL teachers said they use YouTube videos $( \Nu = 3$ ) on rare occasions or maintain oral interaction with students through using very simplified sentences in English $( \Nu = 2 )$ ).

6. Which type of exercises do you use in your classes?

A large number of the teachers $\mathbf { N } = 1 4$ ) mentioned several types of text-based exercises, such as English-to-Persian translation of words, phrases, and sentences, true/false questions, multiple-choice reading comprehension questions, word structure exercises (e.g., prefixes and suffixes), grammar exercises (e.g., active/passive voice and clauses), and cloze tests. In addition, a few EL teachers $( \Nu = 3 )$ ) teaching ESAP to medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry students said they sometimes work on paraphrasing and summarizing texts and involve the students in oral discussion.

7. What is the role of content knowledge in teaching ESAP?

All teachers acknowledged the key role of content knowledge but held different views about its necessary amount. Nearly all content teachers $( \mathsf { N } = 9$ ) believed that ESAP teachers should thoroughly know the theoretical background of the subjectmatter. However, several EL teachers $( \Nu = 9 )$ ) thought they could not master the subject-matter better than the students but did their best ‘to establish a high level of mutual trust’ with students and content teachers to ‘gradually gain content knowledge in their career from various sources’.

8. What qualifications should an ESAP teacher have?

All ESAP teachers clearly emphasized the importance of GEP, content knowledge, and language teaching methodology. Most content teachers $( \Nu = 9 )$ thought ESAP teachers should necessarily have a subject-matter degree as well as sufficient GEP and knowledge of language teaching methodology. On the other hand, all EL teachers $\mathrm { N } = 1 0$ ) believed an ESAP teacher should essentially have English language teaching qualifications and experience since ‘teaching ESAP is not just reading and translating texts and is different from teaching subject-matter’. Additionally, they mostly believed content knowledge could be gradually gained in their career through interactions with students and content teachers.

9. What do you think about the contents of an efficient ESAP teacher education program?

Content teachers’ response to this question was highly affected by their belief in the superiority of content teachers to teach ESAP courses. They did not provide any detailed responses but mostly said such a course/program should improve their GEP and provide them with essential skills in language teaching and testing. On the other hand, EL teachers provided very comprehensive responses. Since they all thought EL teachers are the best candidates to teach ESAP courses, their responses were mostly focused on how to empower EL teachers with subject-matter knowledge and further develop their teaching skills required in EAP contexts. More specifically, they highlighted the necessity for a content module with several elective preliminary content courses in different fields, such as medicine, sciences, and engineering as well as an ESAP module including assessment, materials development, genre analysis, needs analysis, and teaching methodology. Interestingly, one EMP teacher maintained that her department had prepared a tentative curriculum for an MA in EAP, but abandoned the idea due to administrative challenges.

# 4. Discussion

In responding to the two research questions, this study aimed to investigate Iranian ESAP teachers’ perceptions about their roles and responsibilities (RQ1) as well as the challenges in teaching ESAP in Iran (RQ2). The study began with broad contextual findings from the two quantitative questionnaires, which revealed overall themes in the areas of knowledge, practices, and needs of Iranian ESAP teachers, regardless of their pathway into the field (content or EL teachers). Specifically, the teacher competencies questionnaire reflected self-reported strengths in the areas of teaching academic reading and the focus on translation, which is an activity deemed important by Iranian universities. It also highlighted areas in which a sizable percentage of the sample ( $2 5 \%$ or more) identified the need for further development of their expertise in the areas of EAP listening and writing skills development as well as needs analyses in these areas.

In relation to the first research question relating to the EAP teachers’ roles and responsibilities, content analysis of the teachers’ interview responses identified seven major themes, namely, teaching, PD, collaboration, testing, motivation, materials, needs analysis, research, and text analysis. Some of these categories overlap the roles suggested by Woodrow (2018), i.e. classroom teaching, needs analysis, course design, materials provision, collaboration, discourse analysis, and evaluation. In this study, the teachers, interestingly, went beyond these roles and added three new roles/responsibilities: PD, research, and motivation.

ESAP teachers’ comments on the importance of PD and research highlight the importance of teacher development for socialization and gradually gaining sufficient expertise to successfully transform their identity and agency in academic settings (Ding & Bruce, 2017), which has also been emphasized by Bocanegra-Valle and Basturkmen (2019). In the area of professional development, it has also been argued that conducting research in different areas, such as students’ needs, different academic genres and discourses, also plays an important role in building effective practitioners (Belcher, 2009; Hyland, 2019). According to Charles and Pecorari (2016), research, along with teaching and materials development, is one of the main areas of EAP practice. To this end, it has been argued that it is essential for EAP teachers to develop ‘research literacy’ (Blaj-Ward, 2015), read theory and empirical studies in EAP (Bahrami, Hosseini, & Atai, 2019; Davis, 2019), and become involved in different research activities (Hamp-Lyons, 2018; Harwood, 2017).

In relation to the second research question, the main challenges in teaching EAP in Iran, the teachers’ responses in the interviews were categorized in seven main groups, namely, students, materials, EAP teachers, administrative issues, curriculum and syllabus, testing, and content knowledge. These challenges are similar to those identified by experienced Spanish EAP teachers, specifically course development, content knowledge, knowledge of language use in the target discipline, peer collaboration, and PD opportunities (Bocanegra-Valle & Basturkmen, 2019). They are also similar to the challenges identified by Chinese EAP teachers, such as ‘developing new subject matter knowledge’, ‘knowing needs and students’, ‘developing new pedagogical content knowledge’, and ‘mapping existing communication skills in new curriculum context’ (Jiang, Zhang, May, & Qin, 2020).

The challenges identified in relation to students (low GEP, heterogeneous GEP, large class size, low motivation for and fear of EAP, and exam-oriented mentality), materials (e.g., a lack of or limited number of suitable EAP textbooks, concerns about locally published textbooks, and banned access to YouTube content), and curriculum and syllabus (e.g., vague and incoherent, not detailed, and insufficient number of EAP units) have been identified and discussed in previous local studies (Atai & FatahiMajd, 2014; Atai & Hejazi, 2019; Khany & Tarlani-Aliabadi, 2016; Soodmand Afshar & Movassagh, 2016; Tavakoli & Tavakol, 2018). However, less research attention has been paid to other issues identified as challenges: EAP teachers, administrative issues, testing, and content knowledge.

A key theme that emerges from the study is the need for ESAP teacher training and continuing professional development. The third interview question asked teachers about the route they had taken to become an ESAP teacher. Since most ESAP courses are administered by content departments not willing to outsource them to the (limited number of) EAP departments or visiting EL teachers, content teachers (willingly or unwillingly) teach ESAP courses for various reasons. On the other hand, a small percentage of ESAP courses in Iranian universities are taught by EL teachers permanently employed by EAP departments or visiting EL teachers employed on short-term contracts. Most teachers employed in EAP departments hold MA or PhD degrees in TEFL and are recruited based on their previous teaching and research background in EAP and ELT as well as their academic records. With the exception of EAP departments in some medical science and industrial universities, there are no particular objective criteria for selection, training, and evaluation of EAP teachers (Iranmehr, Atai, & Babaii, 2018). In fact, the national curriculum has not explicitly specified who should teach ESAP courses at tertiary level (Taherkahni, 2019). As one experienced English for Medical Purposes (EMP) teacher (who had been a head of department in his university for several years) said in an interview, few EMP departments in medical universities are formally accepted and recognized by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MHME), which could account for the lower perceived status of EAP teachers generally. According to him, although there are many EMP departments in medical universities, many of them are not officially defined within the university management structure or approved by the MHME. In the context of industrial universities, two heads of EAP departments stated that the number of EL teachers in EAP departments is insufficient. These illustrative findings suggest that the current situation relating to ESAP in Iranian universities seems somewhat unclear. It seems that the Government has no specific plan regarding tertiary ESAP courses, and may not be willing to invest in EAP for a range of reasons (e.g., limited budget, insufficient recognition of the importance of EAP) the investigation of which was beyond the scope of the present study.

Testing was considered another serious challenge for the ESAP teachers. Their concerns about testing in this study are in line with Huang (2018) revealing EAP teachers’ lack of appropriate testing and assessment training as well as certain gaps in different theoretical and practical aspects of language testing in the Canadian context. As Weigle and Malone (2016) maintain, defining and describing the language to be tested is a critical issue in EAP testing. EAP teachers can overcome the ambivalence over what to test and how to test by taking into account the “purpose of academic study and demands that are specific to a particular academic context” (p. 611). Considering the paramount importance of assessment in EAP and ESP (Charles & Pecorari, 2016; Woodrow, 2018), EAP teachers’ assessment literacy could be promoted by including EAP testing units in BA and MA TESOL programs and holding practical workshops for in-service EAP teachers.

Finally, content knowledge was identified as another important challenge for EL teachers. While content teachers believed having a full command of content knowledge is essential before becoming an ESAP teacher, EL teachers believed in gradually acquiring this knowledge through interactions with content colleagues and students as well as referring to other sources such as subject-matter textbooks and the Internet. Although there is no consensus about the necessary amount of content knowledge (Belcher, 2009), EAP teachers should be “content area informed instructor[s]” (Belcher, 2006, p. 135). The tendency of Iranian ESAP teachers with ELT qualifications to gain content knowledge from different sources, especially students and content teachers, is in line with EAP teachers’ views in Campion (2016) and Bocanegra-Valle and Basturkmen (2019), but in stark contrast with Chinese EAP teachers who, following Confucian principles, prefer not to rely on their students’ content knowledge (Wu & Badger, 2009).

Considering the teachers’ responses to the eighth and ninth interview questions, both EL and content teachers are aware of the importance of content knowledge, GEP, and language teaching skills. ESAP teachers’ suggestions for the components of an EAP teacher training program are in line with the proposals of Hall (2013) recommending a three-module course including pedagogy, context-embedded language and discourse analysis, and management. In addition, following the comments of Hüttner, Smit, and Mehlmauer-Larcher (2009) and Hyland (2018) on a text-oriented approach to EAP, it would seem to be important to incorporate some instruction on genre analysis and corpus linguistics in this program.

# 5. Conclusions, implications, suggestions for further research, and limitations

The present study aimed to address the gap of “little commentary literature concerning ESP [and by extension, EAP] teaching methodologies and teaching/learning activities” (Basturkmen, 2020, p. 6) by focusing on EAP teachers’ knowledge, trajectories, and practice. In relation to these areas, the findings of the present study raise particular issues relating to Iranian ESAP teachers, their professional activities and their needs, potentially providing a basis for both development activities and further research in these areas.

As in other contexts, some of the issues that emerge in Iran are rooted in perceptions of, and attitudes towards EAP (Anthony, 2011), and specifically whether EAP is considered to be a research-informed and well-established academic subject or a peripheral support service (Ding & Bruce, 2017), which can greatly influence EAP teachers’ identity and perceived position (Ding, 2019). Possible solutions to the uncertain position of EAP in the Iranian context may involve providing greater administrative and institutional support to the existing EAP departments (or language centers) and establishing new ones in universities. In addition, the findings of the study highlight the need for both initial, pre-service EAP teacher education, such as that proposed by Kirkgoz (2019) € in the Turkish context, and ongoing teacher development. To support this, a competency framework could be developed for the training and development of Iranian EAP teachers, similar to those developed for EAP teacher training in other contexts (Khamis, 2019; Pham & Ta, 2016), or at least determined attempts could be made to validate and localize the CFTEAP in the Iranian context.

The findings also suggest a need for departments and centers to adopt standard procedures to evaluate, train, and recruit ESAP teachers according to valid and objective criteria (Atai & Hejazi, 2019). Support for these types of development could also involve collaborations with international associations like BALEAP and content departments in Iranian universities. In addition, similar to mobility programs suggested in Bocanegra-Valle and Basturkmen (2019), effective collaboration with EAP departments/centers in other expanding circle countries could be established and fostered. To the best of our knowledge, apart from the collaboration of two Iranian universities with the University of Illinois and the British Council for needs analysis and course development in the 1970s (Atai, 2002), no determined attempts have been made to collaborate with international partners.

Building on the present study, which illustrated EAP teachers’ “plurality of interrelated necessities, concerns, expectations, lacks, and wants” (Bocanegra-Valle & Basturkmen, 2019, p. 144), future research could further explore some of the issues raised. Research could, for example, further examine the need for EAP teacher training and ongoing development. Also in this area of teacher formation, there is a need for ethnographic studies that examine issues faced by EL and content teachers transitioning into EAP. Furthermore, given the EAP teachers’ responsibility for curriculum and materials development (Basturkmen, 2020) as well as the paucity of research on EAP teachers’ beliefs and practices in materials development (Basturkmen & Bocanegra-Valle, 2018), further studies could focus on EAP teachers’ skills in materials development, selection, adaptation, and evaluation as well as possible avenues for collaboration between content and ELT/EAP departments. The issue of content teachers without a language teaching background being drafted into EAP teaching (and specifically ESAP teaching) is an embedded structural issue in the Iranian EAP context. Based on the findings of this and other research, our recommendation is that all EAP should be taught by those who have an appropriate training and knowledge base to enter the field and that all practitioners of EAP should meet the same training, induction, and practice requirements, which should be comprehensive and transparent.

Additionally, in response to the growing demands of the Iranian MSRT for internationalization and increasing the number of publications in flagship journals in different fields, as well as overcoming the marginalization of EAP in Iran, it seems it is the right time to establish associations (similar to The China EAP Association, European Association of Languages for Specific Purposes, and The Norwegian Forum for EAP) and organize annual conferences and seminars (similar to BALEAP conferences and professional issues meetings). It is noteworthy that the publication of the Iranian Journal of EAP (IJEAP) by Chabahar Maritime University has provided a suitable professional forum for EAP and ESP scholars in Iran, but the present study also suggests that EAP in Iran could further benefit from more ongoing activity in these areas of professional associations and publication.

The present study was based on a cross-sectional design and used semi-structured interviews and self-reported questionnaires for data collection. However, to build upon this study, future research could use further qualitative data collection techniques such as observation, life history narrative, and ethnography to further explore the career trajectories of Iranian practitioners. Additionally, it is suggested that future studies on Iranian ESAP teachers explore the views of various stakeholders including, but not limited to, policy makers, heads of EAP departments, and vice deans of educational affairs in universities. Last but not least, care should be taken in generalizing the findings to other contexts since the present study was performed in Iran, which has its own particular political, educational, and cultural features.
