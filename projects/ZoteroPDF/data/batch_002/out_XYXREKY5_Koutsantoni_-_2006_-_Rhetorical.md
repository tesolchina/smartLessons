# Abstract

Research articles and research theses constitute two key genres used by scientific communities for the dissemination and ratification of knowledge. Both genres are produced at advanced stages of individuals’ enculturation in disciplinary communities present original research aim to persuade the academic community to accept new knowledge claims, and are the result of social negotiations between authors and disciplinary gatekeepers.

However, despite their similarities, these two academic genres differ as regards the status of their authors in academic discourse communities and the power asymmetries between themselves and disciplinary gatekeepers. Awareness of these differences in relations of power and of the social forces behind the formation of genres, which are constituents of advanced academic literacy, defines the rhetorical strategies used by the authors of these two genres. This is revealed by a comparison of 17 research articles and nine samples of research theses from the fields of electronic and chemical engineering. The analysis of the texts focuses on the density and function of hedges and, in particular, discourse-based strategic hedges and of their personal or impersonal expression.

The analysis indicates that students hedge more than expert authors and virtually wholly refrain from taking personal responsibility for their claims. Expert authors, on the other hand, hedge less than the students and often use personally attributed hedges. The comparison additionally indicates differences in the frequency of certain types of strategic hedges between RA authors and students.

# 1. Introduction

Research articles and research theses constitute two key genres used by scientific communities for the dissemination and ratification of knowledge. The research article occupies a prominent position in research publications, and is considered the main means employed by the hard sciences for the introduction of new findings and claims in the community. Ratification of claims comes only following their approval by a research network as a whole (Gilbert, 1976), and as Latour (1988) claims, scientific statements are made into facts by others. Research articles are, therefore, essentially persuasive in nature, and their main goal is to persuade the academic community to accept new knowledge claims (Latour & Woolgar, 1979). Research articles go through a complicated process of refereeing and peer review before they reach publication, and claims offered in them are phrased in ways that disciplinary gatekeepers are likely to find persuasive (Myers, 1990). Gatekeepers are people of power in the discipline, who are at the top of the hierarchy and act as evaluators of what is acceptable or not. These individuals control access to scholarly discourse and have the power to decide who may speak, about what, when and in what context (van Dijk, 1996).

Research theses, in their turn, are considered “major intellectual enterprises” (Fox, 1985, p. 7) which provide their producers with valued professional credentials and membership in academic discourse communities (Fox, 1985; Shaw, 1991). For new claims made in theses to become accepted and for titles to be awarded, internal and external examiners need to be persuaded of the validity of these claims (Shaw, 1991). Like authors of research articles, research students are faced with the same challenge to persuade the community, albeit a smaller representation of it, of the soundness of their claim. The negotiation of content, language and style of theses between students and their supervisors happens with the examiners’ expectations in mind, as to obtain their title, research students need to present their claims in ways that adhere to examiners’ expectations and satisfy their requirements. Similarly to journal articles’ referees, examiners are people of authority in the field, people of power, who set the requirements and define the expectations. As van Dijk (1996) points out, in education, teachers control communicative events, and have special access and control over educational discourse. Students are in unequal relations with these people of power, and satisfying them, therefore, is part of the power relations that operate in the case of research theses’ validation and award of Masters’, MPhil and doctoral titles.

However, despite their similarities, these two academic genres differ as regards the status of their authors in academic discourse communities and the power asymmetries between themselves and disciplinary gatekeepers.

Power has a dual meaning, and has been defined as control on the one hand, and as status or social rank, on the other. Cansler and Stiles (1981) write that:

A person’s status or social rank may be construed both absolutely in a stable social hierarchy and in relation to another member with whom he or she is currently interacting. Thus, one’s relative status is high in a conversation with a subordinate and low in a conversation with a superior, but one’s absolute status is the same in both conversations. [original italics] (pp. 450–460)

When research article authors submit their articles for publication and offer their claims for negotiation and validation by referees and peer reviewers, they find themselves having low relative statuses, while critics have more powerful positions, are in control of which paper becomes accepted for publication or not, and have the power to impose their own standards and expectations. This means that contributors need to adhere to gatekeepers’ expectations in order to achieve publication and solicit acceptance for their claims. However, even though research article authors may be of lower relative status than disciplinary gatekeepers, they may be of the same absolute status as them, and have expertise on a branch of knowledge. This learned authority, as Watt (1982) explains, requires personal excellence and is constant, as opposed to the institutional authority to make decisions on which papers are to be accepted or not, which gatekeepers hold. Such authority has a term after which it expires (Watt, 1982). This may counterbalance the power and status asymmetries and give expert authors more room to present themselves as experts and address gatekeepers as equals.

Research students, on the other hand, are of lower both relative and absolute status than their examiners. Even though they may make original contributions to knowledge and have some learned authority, their examiners are still of a higher status and possess both learned and institutional authority, which prevents students from claiming expertise and authority of knowledge.

However, even individuals thought to possess lower status and power can contest, dispute and challenge the roles assigned to them by others, as individuals’ power and authority are ratified by community members and obtained through strategies of appropriate social behaviour (Diamond, 1996). Belcher (1995) points out that the means of achieving the goals of persuasion and consensus building is rhetorical, and as Olson and Torrance (1983) maintain, texts can acquire authority not only by virtue of the status of their writer, but also by their ability to stand up to criticism. Delivery of a persuasive message and acquisition of credibility and authority, as Gilsdorf (1987) maintains, can be achieved by knowing the audience’s frame of reference and its expectations.

Advanced academic literacy (Belcher, 1995) and advanced enculturation (Prior, 1991) in the disciplinary community can be claimed to give scientific authors this knowledge and assist them with delivering a persuasive message that meets gatekeepers’ expectations and balances asymmetries in power. Stierer (2000, p. 181) writes that academic institutions are sites of power and academic writing is a point where power is exerted and contested. Institutional discourse is powerful and the ability to expertly employ institutional discourses credits individuals with social power and recognition in their disciplines (Hyland, 2000). As Bazerman (1988) writes, the whole communicative system in academe is based on conflict, while the formation and conventions of academic genres are a response to social forces within disciplines and the challenge to erase traces of conflict and achieve consensus (Bazerman, 1988; Hyland, 2000). Bazerman (1988) points out that display of disciplinarity and conformity to these conventions is the only way to hold this antagonistic structure together, motivated by the desire to gain reputation, obtain full membership in the community, and make a difference in the discipline (Hyland, 2000).

Advanced academic literacy, therefore, consists of understanding the purpose of a piece of writing, and of assessing the audience and its expectations; of generally being aware of the social contexts in which genres occur, of the social forces that give rise to and institutionalise their conventions, and of the ability to adopt appropriate textual practices and positions being conscious of what each position implies (Paltridge, 2002). As Hyland (2000, p. 168) puts it, “knowledge is power, but this is the knowledge to make one’s way in one’s discipline and claim authority.”

This paper aims to investigate the ways advanced academic literacy and awareness of power asymmetries and academic communities define authors’ rhetorical strategies in research articles and research theses. The corpus of analysis consists of seventeen research articles and nine samples of MSc, MPhil and PhD theses1 from the fields of electronic and chemical engineering. The analysis of the texts focuses on the density and function of hedges and, in particular, discourse-based strategichedges (Hyland, 1996, 1998a,b), and of their personal or impersonal expression.

The paper will go on to provide more details on the corpus of the analysis and the methodology used, before presenting the results of the analysis and attempting to discuss their significance.

# 2. Corpus and method

The corpus consists of seventeen research articles (RAs) and nine MSc, MPhil, and PhD theses from the fields of electronic and electrical, and chemical engineering. The choice of discipline has been motivated by the under-representation of engineering in studies of disciplinary discourse. Although engineering features in some studies on RAs (mechanical and electrical engineering in Hyland, 1998a, 1999, 2001a,b, 2002a and electronic engineering in Kuo, 1999), it has not been investigated exclusively, and, to the best of my knowledge, chemical engineering, in particular, is not included in any of the corpora in the above studies. Engineering is poorly represented in studies on students’ writing, as well, and it has only been investigated by Herrington (1985) (chemical engineering) and Hyland (2002b,c,d) (mechanical engineering).

The RAs are taken from relatively recent issues of leading electronic and electrical engineering journals, namely The International Electronic and Electrical Engineering (IEEE) Transactions on Communications, Information Theory, Magnetics, Biomedical Engineering, Multimedia, Image Processing, the IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and the International Journal of Electronics, dating from 1996 to 2000.2 These particular journals were selected because they were referenced in students’ work, and because specialist informants recommended them as key journals in their field. Some of the articles that were analysed were actually referenced in students’ work, while others were randomly chosen.3

The theses comprise one MSc dissertation and three MPhil theses from the field of electronic and electrical engineering, and five chemical engineering PhD theses. The theses date from 1984 to 1997. Table 1 shows the distribution of the theses analysed in level and field.

The format of the theses analysed falls into two categories: the traditional thesis with introduction, literature review, methods, results/discussion and conclusions, and the individual chapters compilation thesis, with a general introduction and summary/conclusion, but with chapters having their own introduction, method, results, and conclusion.4

Table 1 Distribution of theses in level and field   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Level</td><td>Number of samples</td><td>Field</td></tr><tr><td>MSc</td><td>1</td><td>Electronic and Electrical Engineering</td></tr><tr><td>MPhil</td><td>3</td><td>Electronic and Electrical Engineering</td></tr><tr><td>PhD</td><td>5</td><td>Chemical Engineering</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>9</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Due to their great length, the dissertation and theses were not analysed in their entirety but specific sections were selected. In the case of chapter compilation theses, the general introduction, and conclusions/recommendation for further work, together with one complete chapter reporting experimental procedures, were selected for analysis. In the case of theses following the traditional format, the introductions, results/discussions5 and conclusions were examined. These three parts were selected as they constitute the most rhetorically complex parts of this kind of text and they are considered to be more evaluative than, for instance, methodology sections (Adams Smith, 1984; Hyland, 1998b).

The analysis focuses on the rhetorical strategy of hedging and its personal or impersonal expression.

Hedging, or the modification and toning down of claims, is one of the most prevalent rhetorical strategies of scientists. Hedging is motivated by both epistemological and social factors. On the one hand, there is the uncertainty of science, which, as Star (1985, p. 392) maintains, scientists “constantly face.” A scientist interviewed by Campbell (1985) confirms this point by saying that:

.if you are looking for total certainty you’ll never get it. It’s not possible in this world, and it’s not possible in science (.) you’ve got to recognise that there is a point beyond which you cannot go (.). Certainty is impossible for science because science doesn’t make those kind of statements. Science deals in probabilities, and it deals in theories. (p. 445)

In view of this uncertainty, hedges have been seen as devices that help writers present statements with appropriate accuracy and caution, and as resources that help scientists express the correct degree of their certainty to their claims (Hyland, 1996, 1998b; Salager-Meyer, 1994).

On the other hand, there are the power asymmetries between contributors and disciplinary gatekeepers, which dictate that contributors allow room for alternative interpretations, and tone down their claims in order to solicit acceptance for them (Hyland, 1996; Myers, 1990). Pinch’s (1985, p. 23) suggestion that claims with “high externality” can be “risky as they will give more grounds for possible criticism,” and that claims with “low externality” are “less risky and more likely to gain acceptability,” Latour’s (1987, p. 51) belief that “if you are too timid the paper will be lost, as it will if you are too audacious,” and Myers’ (1990) report of scientists having to lower the strength of their claims in order to achieve publication are all indications of hedging being dictated by social goals in scientific communities.

The taxonomy of hedges adopted in the analysis of this study is the one proposed by Hyland (1996, 1998b, 2000), which comprises two types of hedges: lexical6 and discourse-based or strategic, as he calls them. This category includes whole sentences that refer to limitations of the study, the methodology or model used, and admission of lack of knowledge. To these are added sentences that refer to agreement of a study’s findings with other studies. These are also tentative ways for justification of one’s claims, in the way that authors attempt to support their findings by aligning their work with the work of other researchers, implying that since they are not the only ones who came to certain conclusions, their conclusions must be correct (Koutsantoni, 2003). The analysis focuses in particular on the frequency of each of these types of strategic hedges, as it is argued that the motivation for use of each type can be traced back to awareness of power asymmetries in disciplinary communities.

Hedges can be expressed either impersonally or by personal attribution. This study is particularly interested in the use of personally attributed hedges in the articles and theses, that is hedges that are expressed though personal pronouns (we, I, us, and me), possessive pronouns (our and my), and possessive adjectives (ours and mine). The difference denoted by the use of impersonally and personally attributed hedges is explained by Hyland (1996) as reader and writer orientation, respectively. Hyland maintains that impersonally attributed hedges are writer-oriented and limit the writers’ commitment to claims by attributing claims to some impersonal agency, and, thus, protecting authors from personal criticism. Personally attributed hedges, on the other hand, are reader-oriented, “recognise the need for reader acceptance in accrediting knowledge and respond to the possibility of opposition to claims on interpersonal grounds” (Hyland, 1996, pp. 440–449).

The methodological approach adopted in this paper was both qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative approach served to identify frequency of occurrences and to produce comparable data, while the qualitative approach looked at the occurrences in context and tried to identify pragmatic usage. My corpus of materials is not electronic, so the counting of items was conducted manually and particular attention was paid to the context in which they were used. Strategic hedges were counted as one item.

Following Crismore, Markkanen, and Steffensen (1993), densities were arrived at by dividing the number of items by the number of lines of both articles and theses. The length of lines was comparable as either the format was similar (in the case of the articles published in the same journal) or lines contained similar amounts of information per line. This was calculated by counting the number of words in random paragraphs and then dividing it by the number of lines in that paragraph, and it was done separately for paragraphs in RAs and theses. The results were also compared statistically to see whether there was any significant difference between the average numbers of words per line in the RAs and theses. $T$ -tests showed that differences were non-significant. The statistical results are shown in Table 2.

The frequency of occurrence of each group of items was calculated in percentages.

# 3. Strategic hedges

Strategic hedges are hedges that are normally identified in context. Strategic hedges acknowledge limitations of various types, which authors are the first to point out before they are pointed out by others.

The quantification of hedges in the RAs and theses analysed indicated that thesis authors hedge more than the RA authors: the density of hedges per line in theses is 0.07, as opposed to 0.05 in the RAs (see Table 3).

Thesis authors also employ more strategic hedges than RA authors: $20 \%$ of all hedges in the theses are strategic, as opposed to $14 \%$ in the RAs (see Table 4).

In both RAs and theses, strategic hedges fall into five categories but with certain differences in frequency between the two engineering disciplines and between theses and RAs. The five categories include limitations of method, limitations of the scope of the paper, limited knowledge, agreement with other research, and limitations of the study (reference to testability). Tables 5–8 display the frequency of occurrence of each type of strategic hedges in order offrequency. Tables 6 and 7, in particular, display the frequencies of each type of strategic hedge in each engineering discipline, while Table 8 presents the summative frequency of each type in all theses.

The remainder of this section analyses each type of strategic hedge and gives examples from the two research genres.

# 3.1. Limitations of method/technique/tool/algorithm

This type of strategic hedge acknowledges limitations of the method used in experiments or simulations, of tools, techniques or algorithms developed, acknowledging in effect undesirable results, which are part and parcel of experimental work. Such strategic hedges are employed by authors to protect themselves from negative criticism, and to admit to limitations before they are pointed out by journal referees and peer reviewers. The frequency of this type of hedge is the highest in the articles $(40 \% )$ , and second in frequency in research theses, with the frequency being slightly higher in electronic and electrical engineering theses $( 3 6 \% )$ as opposed to $2 5 \%$ in chemical. Examples include:

1. Because of the complexity of the problem it was not possible to evaluate the confidence of the estimate mean and variance, however, the results suffice to illustrate trends. (Hebley & Taylor, 1998-RA)   
2. It proves to be quite difficult to obtain the theoretical probabilities Pfa, $\mathrm { P m }$ , and $\mathrm { P h }$ if the data are interleaved by character. (Welburn & Cavers, 1999-RA)   
3. The absorbent particle size was too small to enable accurate effective diffusivities to be obtained. (Catchpole, 1991-Thesis)

4. Regrettably the limited operating conditions of the SISTAM and the unexpectedly large errors in measuring drum surface temperature have restricted the study of some of the more interesting aspects of the heat transfer process (.) The experimental work was cut short as it became increasingly difficult to measure drum surface temperature due to the increasing appearance of trapped air pockets between thermocouples and the drum surface. To cure this problem would have involved . (.) These modifications would have been very expensive and time consuming . (Parkin, 1990-Thesis)

However, in some cases, even though authors do acknowledge such limitations, they go on to stress other good results of advantages of their method, tool, technique, etc., and point out that these limitations do not significantly affect their results, thus counterbalancing them:

5. This method does not guarantee the global maximum [STRATEGIC HEDGE], however, simulations indicate that the algorithm works well even when Es/s2 is small [COUNTERBALANCE OF HEDGE]. (Halford & Brandt-Pearce, 1998-RA)

Thesis authors attempt to counterbalance the limitations mostly by attempting to justify their methodological choices, and by indicating that there were problems even though the necessary precautions were taken:

6. The most serious problem encountered throughout all of the fermentations reported in this thesis was that of batch to batch variability . [STRATEGIC HEDGE]. Efforts to minimise this included . (.) Despite all these precautions [COUNTERBALANCE OF HEDGE], the level of reproducibility was not as high as should have been desired . [STRATEGIC HEDGE], although agreement with the published data on xanthan fermentations was good and inter-batch variability has also been reported by other researchers . [STRATEGIC HEDGE-agreement with other research acting here as COUNTERBALANCE OF HEDGE]. (Fletcher, 1993-Thesis)

Table 8 Types of strategic hedges in the theses (in order of frequency)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Types of strategic hedges</td><td>Number of items</td><td>Percentages</td></tr><tr><td>Agreement with other research</td><td>46</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Limitations of method</td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Limitations of study (testability)</td><td>18</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Limited knowledge</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Limitations of scope of thesis</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>94</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

Acknowledgments of limitations in theses might thus be characterised more honest, as when starting a research project, students do not know in advance problems they might face, and the thesis needs to be completed within certain time limits and often with limited resources. This means that after the required time has elapsed, students have to write up that research irrespective of whether or not they have obtained significant results. The only solution is to acknowledge the problems and limitations, and counterbalance the hedge by attempting to justify their choices and indicate that they did take some precautions. On the other hand, RA authors choose which accounts to send for publication and admittedly they are not expected to send accounts of work that was problematic and did not produce significant results. As Knorr-Cetina (1981) observed, certain aspects of laboratory work, such as results being the result of specific methodological decisions and methods chosen with a view to anticipated results, are often concealed from public scrutiny in the research article.

# 3.2. Limitations of scope of paper/thesis

This type of strategic hedge acknowledges limitations of the scope of the paper and what the authors have chosen to discuss in it, and constitutes $2 5 \%$ of all strategic hedges in the articles. Examples include:

7. Although available directly from the FDTD results, the distribution and magnitude of power losses within the biological tissues of the model are not discussed in this paper. (Scanlon et al., 1999-RA)   
8. It is not our intention to present here a thorough investigation of the network as a communications system. (Deane et al., 1996-RA)

These limitations are sometimes attributed to word and space limits, which is a well-known restriction for journal research articles:

9. Our design method for MTQ’s [sic] differs substantially from that of ECTQ’s [sic] described earlier, but in the interest of brevity will only be sketched here. (Larsen & Frost, 1997-RA)

In theses, these limitations seem to be mainly motivated by failed experiments and circumstances outside of the students’ control. As the example below indicates, the decision of what to include in the thesis is not a conscious one taken before the writing of the thesis or based on word or space limits, but one dictated by unforeseen circumstances in the course of the research. Consequently, this type of hedge is not very frequent in the theses and is only encountered twice in one particular chemical engineering thesis:

10. The cell counts for the single Rushton fermentations 1 and 2 were considered too unreliable to report. (Fletcher, 1993-Thesis)

# 3.3. Limitations of knowledge

These hedges acknowledge inability to always offer explanations for phenomena and limitations of the scope of definitions and suggested models, versions, etc., make a reference to the uncertainty scientists face, and are used at $12 . 5 \%$ in the RAs:

11. It must be emphasised however, that there is no way in general to eliminate the window effects on instantaneous bandwidth and higher moments of the spectrogram. (Davidson & Loughlin, 2000-RA)   
12. However, we point out that our definition of m is neither universal nor complete. (Larsen & Frost, 1997-RA)

Acknowledgment of limited knowledge is only found in chemical engineering theses and constitutes only $3 \%$ of the total of strategic hedges in the theses:

13. No physical explanation of this can be put forward at the present time. (Dawson, 1992- Thesis) 14. The cause of the discrepancy is uncertain. (Catchpole, 1991-Thesis)

This difference can be attributed to status differences between expert authors and students. Even though RA authors admit to limited knowledge more than the students, their strategic hedging still connotes power and authority on their part to make the claim (Hyland, 2001a, p. 560). On the other had, students cannot claim to be in that position and to definitely say that knowledge in a certain area is lacking as they may not be familiar with all of the research in an area and may feel that admitting to lack of knowledge might weaken their thesis.

# 3.4. Agreement with other research

Agreement with other research constitutes strategic hedging as authors express tentativeness regarding their findings by seeking support from external sources, suggesting that they are not alone in their suggestions and that there are other researchers with similar suggestions and results. As Hunston (2000) maintains, when statements are attributed, as opposed to being averred, the responsibility is generally shifted. At the same time, authors demonstrate familiarity with the research conducted in their field and ‘strengthen their claims through the replicability of experimental procedures’ (Hyland, 2002d, p. 538). Agreement with other research comprises $12 . 5 \%$ of all strategic hedges in the articles, while it is a very frequent way of strategic hedging in the theses, with a significantly higher frequency in chemical engineering theses $54 \%$ as opposed to $21 \%$ in electronic and electrical):

15. These results are consistent with the commonly used model for a permanent magnet with no equivalent volume current density corresponding to (20). (Waterson, 2000-RA)   
16. Note that this optimal window is divergent, which was also found to be the case by Cohen and Lee in the minimisation of . in some cases [6]. (Davidson & Loughlin, 2000-RA)   
17. There was good agreement between literature values and the measured diffusion coefficients obtained in this work. (Catchpole, 1991-Thesis)   
18. The density dependence is similar to that found by other workers using a variety of near critical fluids as solvents [29, 62–65]. (Catchpole, 1991-Thesis)

This finding is in agreement with Herrington’s (1985) observation that high correlation between authors’ experimental results and established correlations was frequently used as a warrant for claims in the chemical engineering reports she analysed. The higher frequency of this type of strategic hedge in the theses could be attributed to different value systems between electronic and electrical and chemical engineering.

# 3.5. Limitations of study (reference to testability)

These hedges refer to the testability of the study and acknowledge the need for further research in order to validate the findings of the study. In this way authors indirectly indicate that their results are not definitive and that there is scope for further work. This type of hedge is the least frequent in the articles analysed $( 1 0 \% )$ :

19. Although the initial results are promising several research problems remain to be explored. (Larsen & Frost, 1997-RA)   
20. However, for improved confidence in the method, formal validation must be undertaken. (Williams et al., 1997-RA)

Reference to the testability of the research is much more frequent in the theses and constitutes $43 \%$ of all the electronic and electrical engineering and $15 \%$ of all of the chemical engineering strategic hedges:

21. However, several of these approaches accurately fulfil the diode model requirements for detailed circuit simulation, but further investigation is necessary to find the most appropriate one. (Smith, 1995-Thesis)   
22. The results of the absorption chromatography experiments are preliminary only and there is considerable scope for further work. (Catchpole, 1991-Thesis)

The difference in frequency of use of this type of strategic hedge in the RAs and theses could be explained with regard to authors’ status in the academic community, the authoritativeness they can assume, and the confidence they can show in the significance of their study. RA authors can claim a higher level of expertise and authoritativeness possibly supported with previous acceptance of their claims by the community in RAs or theses. On the other hand, student researchers can be assumed to feel insecure about the validity of their claims as they are pending acceptance by their examiners.

A summary of the differences in frequency of each type of strategic hedge in the RAs and theses is shown in Table 9.

# 4. Personal and impersonal expression of hedges

The quantification of personally attributed hedges in the RAs and theses indicates that even though hedges are expressed mostly impersonally in RAs, RA authors do employ some personal attribution when hedging, while students virtually totally refrain from doing so. Only $0 . 6 \%$ of all hedges in the theses were personally attributed, as opposed to $16 \%$ in the RAs (see Table 10), and were all expressed with collective pronouns (we, our). Preference for collective pronouns over $I _ { - }$ or my is a characteristic of the hard sciences, where research is usually carried out in laboratories by teams of researchers, and where joint publication is the norm (Hyland, 2001b).

As mentioned earlier, the motivation behind the use of personal attribution when hedging propositions has been attributed to a reader orientation, and a desire on the part of the writers to mark their claims as personal beliefs, hedge their assertiveness and open up avenues for dialogue with the readers (Hyland, 1996). Taking responsibility for a claim and not presenting it as directly deriving from hard data softens it, hedges its generalisability, and marks it as an individual interpretation, open to alternative judgements (Hyland, 1996, 2000; Myers, 1989):

23. We approach this problem in the belief that . (Deane et al., 1996-RA)   
24. We feel that our results may serve as a good guide . (Robertson et al., 1998-RA)

Personally attributed hedges can also make a personal reference to limitations of the method, or admit to personal lack of knowledge and again hedge author assertiveness:

25. We make no claims for our particular version other than it is fairly standard. (Robertson et al., 1996-RA)   
26. To our knowledge, the R(D) function of this composite source is not known. (Larsen & Frost, 1997-RA)

However, Hyland’s claim (1996, 1998b) that personally attributed hedges are always an indication of writers’ wish to mark their claims as personal beliefs and, thus, hedge their personal assertiveness is valid when personal attribution is of an exclusive function, that is, when it refers to the authors themselves. In co-authored papers, collective personal attribution can refer to the writers and readers (inclusive), the writers and the academic community (inclusive), or to the writers themselves (exclusive), and the writers and (an)other scientist(s) (exclusive again). It must be emphasised here that it is not always easy to decide whether collective attribution is used inclusively or exclusively of the readers, and there are cases where there is ambivalence. Kitagawa and Lehrer (1990) propose a simple method for investigating whether we is exclusive or inclusive. They suggest that we is inclusive when it can easily be replaced by one or you without the informational content of the sentence being altered in any way.

Adopting this method, in all of the above examples taken from RAs, personal attribution seems to refer to the authors themselves and have an exclusive function. It is, therefore, quite clear that it is employed in order to reduce claims to personal opinion and minimise their generalisability. There are, however, cases when hedges are personally attributed but have an inclusive function. In such cases the motivation behind their use could be taken to be a desire for the responsibility for the fallibility of a claim to be shared by both authors and readers, and possibly the whole of the scientific community, as is the case in (27)–(28). In these examples, we seems to be inclusive, as it could be replaced by one or you without any alteration in the meaning of the sentence (Kitagawa & Lehrer, 1990):

Table 10 Personally attributed hedges in the RAs and theses   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>RAs</td><td>Theses</td></tr><tr><td>Total hedges</td><td>277</td><td>472</td></tr><tr><td>Of which personal</td><td>45</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>% of personal hedges</td><td>16</td><td>0.6</td></tr></table></body></html>

27. All the methods used except the GA rely upon the search space having what we might define as the smoothness property. (Irvine & Woods, 1997-RA)   
28. For example, we might begin with $\mathbf { h } ( \mathbf { x } )$ as piecewise linear function and change it to an appropriate quadratic over Dn if necessary. (Price & Hayes, 1998-RA)

This seems to be the case with the hedges that were personally attributed in the theses, and which were most probably of the inclusive type, since we could again be easily replaced by one or you. This interpretation appears to be plausible in the theses also because they are single authored and there are fewer possibilities that we refers to work done by teams of researchers:

29. Similarly, after all the channels have been loaded, we might expect to see . (Stoner, 1996- Thesis)   
30. Thus, we may conclude, within the limits of experimental error, from this work, that . (Parkin, 1990-Thesis)

This strategy, therefore, does not always “function to represent both the source and the status of the claim as individual rather than collective” (Hyland, 1998b, p. 181), but, on the contrary, there are cases when the exact opposite is true, and reader involvement is the objective. The hazy limits between exclusive and inclusive personal attribution make it a powerful rhetorical resource for scientific authors, as it can be manipulated in a variety of ways to assert authors’ learned authority. As Pennycook (1994) maintains, the use of personal attribution is political and always implies relations of power. As we saw, opinions can be presented either as personal or as communal. Taking personal responsibility for claims and claiming personal recognition for them clearly convey power and authority to make the claims. On the other hand, creating a shared context for the claims is an indirect show of power; opinions, inferences and conclusions are presented as if deriving from communal effort when in reality they originate from authors, and are imposed on readers.

In both cases, the use of personal attribution is inherently strategic. It seems, though, that thesis authors are unwilling to make use of this rhetorical strategy and remain almost wholly impersonal in their writing. Thesis authors seem to be aware that they are in unequal relations of power with their examiners, since examiners have the power to fail or pass the students if their writing does not meet their expectations and does not fulfil their requirements. This appears to motivate their tendency to protect themselves from any kind of personal criticism by distancing themselves from their claims and to attempt to gain credibility by attributing all claims to data. Students show awareness that impersonality can be a means of establishing credibility and acquiring authority. As Fairclough (1992) maintains, the use of objective modality makes it unclear whose views are being presented, whether the writers are presenting their own views as being universal, or acting as a vehicle for the views of the group and the community. In this sense, the use of objective modality often implies some form of power and authority (Fairclough, 1992).

# 5. Conclusions and pedagogical implications

In order for claims made in research articles and research theses to be accepted by disciplinary gatekeepers, in the form of journal referees and examiners, they need to be phrased in ways that gatekeepers find persuasive and meet their expectations. The rhetorical strategies employed by authors in these scientific genres reflect power symmetries between authors and gatekeepers and constitute the means by which scientific authors display awareness of these expectations, and attempt to establish credibility and membership in the community.

This paper has compared some rhetorical strategies employed by authors of a small corpus of Engineering research articles and theses focusing on discourse-based strategic hedges (Hyland, 1996, 1998a,b) and their personal or impersonal expression.

The analysis indicated that student researchers hedge more than RA authors and employ more strategic hedges than them, while there are also differences in the frequency of certain types of limitations RA and thesis authors acknowledge. Thesis authors avoid using personal attribution as a persuasive tool, preferring to distance themselves from their claims and minimising their commitment to them by being impersonal. On the other hand, RA authors use it both to weaken their claims by making them sound like personal evaluations, and to diffuse responsibility for a claim by making it seem collective.

The findings indicate that the student authors of MSc, MPhil and PhD level are aware of the power asymmetries between themselves and examiners, of their status in the community and of their status in the particular situation, which motivates their choice of rhetorical strategies. This in itself constitutes indication of their advanced academic literacy and awareness of the social forces that define genre conventions in academic discourse communities (Bazerman, 1988). It also indicates awareness that despite power asymmetries, power can be negotiated between individuals in academic communities and that when they are presenting original work and research, students can negotiate their learned authority.

Knowledge of what the disciplinary community finds acceptable and why can assist authors with making informed choices, and presenting their claims in ways that need few alterations, retaining the meaning they wish to convey, and taking a stance that, on the one hand, meets gatekeepers’ expectations, while, on the other, foregrounds their original contribution. In this way, authors can strategically manipulate readers’ reactions, negotiate their status and authority in this community, and acquire the power to persuade the community to accept their claims.

It has been established that the academic discourse community is not homogeneous but that each discipline can be considered as a different world and tribe (Becher, 1989), where certain ideas and views of the world prevail, where practices reflect these views, and where all communication and discourse follow certain rules which are determined by these views. It has also been suggested that EAP materials should reflect this disciplinary variation and discourse specificity (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002). Engineering discourse is under-represented in studies of scientific discourse and conventions, and has hardly been studied at student level. The models of rhetorical behaviour identified in the RAs and samples of students’ writing analysed in this study can be characterised as successful since their authors have met referees’ and examiners’ expectations. The findings of this study, therefore, in conjunction with further research in this discipline, could be used to devise teaching strategies and materials in order to familiarise prospective engineers with the rhetorical behaviour that is considered acceptable by this disciplinary community.
