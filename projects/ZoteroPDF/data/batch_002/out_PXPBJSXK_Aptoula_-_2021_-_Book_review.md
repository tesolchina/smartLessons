Writing a thesis is a challenging undertaking for most graduate students, and the challenges are compounded if they are second language (L2) writers of English (Paltridge & Starfield, 2007). Doctoral Writing: Practices, Processes and Pleasures discusses different aspects and stages of this challenging yet rewarding process. The book originates from an academic blog (https://doctoralwriting.wordpress.com/) and is a compilation of the key issues in doctoral writing, as well as presenting solutions to some real-life scenarios in various doctoral writing contexts. A distinguishing feature of the book is that it is written by three authors, who each contribute different sections. Having multiple authors brings different perspectives, but at times it makes the book’s content seem rather disjointed, especially when they write in different styles.

The book has seven chapters, each of which is organised around themes relevant to stages of the doctoral writing process. In the Being and developing writers chapter, the authors illustrate different aspects involved in doctoral writing process. For instance, Carter lists some ideas for managing supervisors and doctoral writing, and Autchison shares some materials from a series of doctoral writing supervisory practices. This section includes many of the authors’ personal experiences and scenarios for doctoral students and supervisors such as feedback by doctoral supervisors, integrating feedback from supervisors for doctoral students, managing feedback in team supervision, and maintaining mental health during doctoral writing. What distinguishes this chapter from the rest of the book is that it discusses the joy, desire and struggles that students and their supervisors face during doctoral writing, which can contribute to the overall development of both writers and supervisors.

In the next chapter, the authors focus on Managing Productivity in doctoral writing. Specifically, they explain the nature of writing groups and retreats (e.g. bootcamps, other social writing events), writing processes (e.g. writing, reviewing, editing, etc.), habits and time management (e.g. new years’ resolutions for doctoral writers, writing and time scheduling) and motivation, pleasure and humor (e.g. writing motivation and writing pleasure). In this section, the authors describe some ways to reflect on some of the questions that students have posed in their consultation sessions.

Academic literacy practices prepare doctoral students to enter their disciplinary discourse communities. The term discourse community can be broadly defined as a group that has a basic set of goals. Swales outlined six characteristics of discourse communities as “common public goals; methods of communicating among members; participatory communication methods; genres that define the group; a lexis; and a standard of knowledge needed for membership (2011; 471e473). In Crafting Writing: Clarity, Style and Voice, the authors provide readers with some ideas for gaining acceptance within their discourse communities. These suggestions include recommendations on developing insider persona for doctoral writing, as well as authorial voice and emphasis in doctoral writing.

Other writing-related issues such as structure, argument, critical thinking, and data analysis are explored in the following chapter: Writing the thesis. This section includes some explanations regarding expectations for specific parts of the thesis. For example, it discusses ways to address the etiquette of thanking in the acknowledgments section and how to write a literature review. After writing the thesis, graduate students may need to cope with issues related to publicizing their research. This may be the reason why Writing the thesis section is followed by a chapter on disseminating research, which includes the topics of publishing processes, peer review, co-authorship and related genres (e.g. grant writing, research posters, etc.). These issues are usually neglected as doctoral writers confront them after graduation. However, some, such as co-authorship and grant writing, are crucial for the academic socialization of doctoral students. More specifically, the authors inform us about grant writing processes by explaining grant writing season and specific grant requirements. This chapter is particularly useful, since doctoral students do not always have access to mentoring or supervisory support after graduation, and are not often informed about these processes before doctoral graduation. For these reasons, sections on doctoral writing and career building may be of help for doctoral students before as well as after graduation.

Writing at the doctoral level for most students requires disciplinary knowledge and a good command of English language, and during the writing process doctoral students develop their own scholarly voices. During this writing and transformation period, writers and supervisors face a number of challenges that are unique to different aspects of doctoral writing. While the volume primarily addresses current issues in doctoral writing especially in the dissertation stage and onwards, the activities, suggestions and questions provided in this book could be adapted to any doctoral socialization/orientation classes and/or workshops in the initial years of a doctoral program. The volume therefore provides invaluable advice for doctoral writers and supervisors by asking thought-provoking questions about issues surrounding doctoral writing. In comparison with other books on doctoral writing, Doctoral Writing: Practices, Processes and Pleasures offers more practical examples and references to actual examples from consultations and workshops taken by the authors. However, some shortcomings need to be mentioned. Readers looking for advice on doctoral writing issues in diverse contexts may find some of the chapters less useful than others. The authors make comments based on their experiences in universities in New Zealand and Australia, which could mean that some of the information they provide is less applicable elsewhere. While the chapters make clear suggestions and recommendations, the authors could have commented on the feasibility of some of their recommendations and the extent to which they are culture-specific; for example, “bootcamps” may not be feasible in some disciplines and cultures.

In addition, the volume could have reached out to a more diverse international readership if possible, implications and related suggestions had been discussed for a variety of disciplines and institutions. For example, in the section Doctoral Writing and Decision-Making in the First Few Months, we are given the example of advising a student in the first months of doctoral program with no coursework required. It is true that in some disciplines, graduate students who already holds a postgraduate degree on the same or related discipline will be admitted to the PhD program without any obligation of mandatory coursework and you carry out pure research under the supervision of their PhD advisers; however, in some universities, a certain amount of coursework is required as well as doctoral candidacy examinations. This difference in PhD programs may lead to some essential dissimilarities in the way doctoral students are advised at different stages of their doctoral writing.

Overall, Doctoral Writing: Practices, Processes and Pleasures effectively addresses a range of relevant issues in doctoral writing. The book will appeal to researchers, scholars and graduate students who are interested in L2 writing, doctoral student writing, academic writing and doctoral student writing socialization. The volume has a user-friendly structure with an abundance of practical examples and guidance. Given that doctoral writing is one of the relatively under-researched areas, this book fills a gap in literature by providing very useful advice to doctoral writers and supervisors alike. While doctoral writing is a challenging for almost all students, it also equally demanding for early-career doctoral supervisors and also experienced academics given the change in student perceptions of supervisory roles, institutional demands and the difference in research trajectories. The suggestions and questions provided throughout this book might help not only doctoral students to reflect on their writing practices about the issues discussed in each chapter of the book, but also doctoral supervisors to facilitate discussions about different stages of doctoral writing, and clearly articulate their changing roles in this process. All in all, the volume should be seen as worthwhile reading not only for doctoral writers themselves but also for anyone interested in supporting doctoral writers, and exploring the details of different aspects of doctoral writing as well as polishing their work for publication.
