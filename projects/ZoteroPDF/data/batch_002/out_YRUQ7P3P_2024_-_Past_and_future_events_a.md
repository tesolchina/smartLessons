# Past and future events and projects for BALEAP assessment and testing

We have invited individual BALEAP Executive Committee members to tell you more about their roles in this and upcoming instalments of BALEAP news – our first is the Testing Officer.

Past and Future Events and Projects for BALEAP Assessment and Testing.

Mission statement:

At the core of the BALEAP Testing Officer's role is supporting EAP practitioners in the development of valid and reliable assessment measures. This is accomplished through the cultivation of a dynamic environment and online presence, aimed at enhancing assessment literacy, and facilitating collaboration among experts from a range of institutions within the UK and internationally. In essence, the objective is to drive a positive and lasting impact in the field of EAP assessment.

Events:

# BALEAP Assessment Roadshows.

Building on a survey conducted in late 2023, which sought input from the EAP community regarding their assessment interests, the BALEAP Assessment Roadshows were reinstated in the beginning of 2024. This series of workshops is designed to facilitate knowledge exchange on assessment practices and to provide EAP practitioners with tools that will enhance their proficiency and efficiency in developing context-specific assessment measures.

To date, we have successfully hosted two sessions, both of which were dedicated to the exploration of artificial intelligence in the context of EAP assessment.1 These sessions have attracted significant attendance and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from participants. Two further sessions addressing the role of artificial intelligence in this area are planned to be delivered: one this year and another in January 2025.

Future plans:

BALEAP Guidelines on English Language Tests for University Entry.

In 2025, a project involving a comprehensive review of the BALEAP Guidelines on English Language Tests for University Entry is scheduled to commence.2 The primary aim of this project is to adapt the existing guidelines to better meet the evolving needs of assessment in the current educational landscape.

Contextual information.

The BALEAP Guidelines on English Language Tests for University Entry have provided stakeholders with a detailed framework for comparing various English language tests (both SELTs and others). These guidelines have assisted institutional staff in the selection and evaluation of tests, as well as in the interpretation of associated scores. The intended audience for these guidelines includes university admissions officers, international office staff, EAP administrators, programme and course leaders, EAP lecturers involved in the creation and assessment of language tests, as well as sponsors and international students. It is crucial to note that these guidelines are not definitive; institutions are encouraged to formulate their own admissions policies and engage relevant staff in discussions regarding the issues raised.

Originally compiled in 2007 by a group of experts with extensive experience in EAP such as Bruce Howell (University of Reading), Philip Nathan (Durham University), Diane Schmitt (formerly of Nottingham Trent University), Chris Sinclair (University of Southampton), Jenifer Spencer (EAP writer and editor, formerly Heriot-Watt University), John Wrigglesworth (University of Sheffield Hallam, formerly of the University of Portsmouth) and John Slaght (Professor Emeritus University of Reading), they consolidate over 100 years of collective experience in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English language testing. The guidelines were significantly updated in 2020 by John Slaght, the BALEAP Testing Officer at that time.3 Contact details: Anna Ziomek – University of Reading.
