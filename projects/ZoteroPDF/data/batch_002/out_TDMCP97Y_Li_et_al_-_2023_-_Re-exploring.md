Visual metadiscourse

As multimodal texts become ubiquitous in the digital age, analyzing how writers interact with readers via the multimodal genre is getting increasingly important. Enlightened by Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) work on visual design, D'Angelo (2016) extended the metadiscourse model (Hyland, 2004) and proposed a new framework of visual metadiscourse to analyze academic posters. In this study, we adopted the well-recognized metadiscourse model (Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2004) and developed D'Angelo's (2016) visual metadiscourse framework to evaluate the comprehensibility and engagement of medical students' infographics completed in an EAP class. A total of 127 Visme infographics on how to prevent hypertension were collected and analyzed. We focused on how the students used diverse metadiscourse resources to inform and engage the audience in their infographics. We coded interactive and interactional features regarding both textual metadiscourse and visual metadiscourse for each poster and identified the overall patterns of the EAP students' metadiscourse use. We also zoomed in on illustrative posters to depict the students' use of various metadiscourse resources. This study adds to the metadiscourse model by extending it to the multimodal genre and sheds new light on multimodal pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

Digital multimodal composing (DMC), in which a composer integrates multiple semiotic resources to produce a multimodal text using digital tools, has been increasingly implemented in English for academic purposes (EAP) contexts (Hafner, 2014; Jiang, 2017) The expansion of DMC has been supported by New London Group's (1996) multiliteracies emphasizing the multimodal nature of human communications and Kress (2003) seminal work on multimodality (i.e., the use of different modes, i.e, textual, aural, linguisic, spatial, and visual) in communication and meaning-making, Meanwhile, DMC is fueled by the fact that DMC mets students real-world needs in the digital age (Li & Akoto, 2021; Zhang, Akoto, & Li, 2023). Previous reearch also shows that DMC can augment learner autonomy, increase genre awareness, and develop digital literacy skils (Belcher, 2017; Hafner & Ho, 2020; Yi, Shin, & Cimasko, 2020). Students are now engaged in diverse types of multimodal composition using different digital media in the L2 context such as blogs, digital stories, infographics, and videos (Hafner & Ho, 2020; Kang, 2022; Li & Akoto, 2021). Transfer across media enables students to experiment and express content in multiple modalities during the composing process (Kang, 2022).

Infographics, in particular, are regarded as efective DMC tasks implemented in EAP classes, as infographic composing allows students to present information quickly and clearly (Krauss, 2012), and also enables them to think citiclly about the interplay of information and design while keeping their audience in mind (Maamujav, Krishnan, & Collins, 2020). Moreover, infographics, as a new professonal digital genre, increasingly appear in multiple domains, such as in medical health. That is, infographics are widely used by health professionals to communicat medical information to ther patients. Therefore infographics used as authentic materials in the EAP class capture both instructors' and researchers attention. In this study, we focus on the infographics completed by EAP students as a multimodal/digital genre and examine how the composers guided their audience to comprehend and engage in science content through multimodality and interactivity, drawing on Hyland's (2004, 2005) metadiscourse model comprising textual devices and DAngelos (2016) visual metadiscourse model focusing on visuals other than words. Our study is expected to inform readers how to integrate infographic tasks into EAP instruction and how to teach and assess the comprehensibility, flow, and engagement of multimodal texts. Before we present the details of our study, we discuss some key concepts and frameworks in the ollowing section.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Metadiscourse

This study is informed by the theoretical framework of metadiscourse (Hyland, 2004, 2005; Hyland & Tse, 2004). Metadiscourse refers to \*a range of devices writers use to explicitly organize their texts, engage readers, and signal their atitudes to both their materials and their audience (Hyland & Tse, 2004, p. 156). Based on the viewpoint that writing is a social engagement in which writers negotiate social relations with readers, it has been regarded as an established approach to the analysis of academic texts (Hyland, 2017). According to Hyland (2005), interactive metadiscourse \*primarily involves the management of information flow" (p.44), guiding readers through the text content, whereas interactional metadiscourse is \*more personal' (p.4), involving readers overtly in the argument/development of the text. Textual metadiscourse is realized via interactive resources (e.g., transitions, frame markers, and code glosses) and interactional resources (e.g., hedges, boosters, attitude markers). The two types of metadiscourse re sources are displayed in Table 1. Drawing on the metadiscourse model, previous research has examined the patterns of metadiscourse in scholarly work in Englis compared with other languages (e.g., Hu & Cao, 2011; andarli, Bayyurt, & Marti, 2015), a well as the use of metadiscourse in students' EAP writing (e.g., Ho & Li, 2018; Hyland, 2004).

# 2.2. Visual metadiscourse

As multimodal texts become ubiquitous in the digital age, researchers have started to examine how textual and visual resources interact, and research appears that focuses on the metadiscourse presented in the visual mode (Hyland, 2017). Kumpf (2000 initially proposed the concept of visual metadiscourse, defined as the desin choice that \*support readability and macrostructural consistency" (p. 404) and that \*reveal awareness of visual literacy and of the communication context" (p. 401), and he analyzed the deployment of visual metdicourse featres in technial oment, uch as first impreion (i., immedat rctions intrrtations, or emotional responses), heft i., perceived length, importance, or signficance), consistency (i., uniformity and coherence of design elements and/or prescribed styles), chunking (i.., information broken down into smaller, discreet parts), and attraction (i.e., drawing and guiding attention to specific elements). Metadiscourse in the visual realm becomes "a design feature to help viewers navigate through and understand texts' (Hyland, 2017, p. 26). Visual metadiscourse has been increasingly explored in business and technical communication (De Gro0t, Nickerson, Korzlius, & Gerritse, 2016). Drawing from Kress and van Leeuwen's (2006) semiotic work DAngelo (2016, 2020) initiall examined how visual and textual resources are used in academic conference poster i diferent fields (e.g., biology, economics, linguistics, and medical sciences), to convey interactive and interactional meanings. In particular, she developed the visual metadiscourse framework, which consists of visual interactive resources and visual interactional resources. In her definition, visual interactive features serve to organize the flow of information and help the viewer in the comprehension of the multimodal text (D'Angelo, 2016, p. 124), and visual interactional features' are "used to attract, involve and engage viewers" (D'Angelo, 2010, p. 4). D'Angelo's framework of interactive metadiscourse features informs our study on analyzing the comprehensibility and flow of AP students infographic posters. Specifically, she developed five categories (i., information value, framing, connective elements, graphic elements, and fonts) and the subcategories of these visual interactive metadiscourse devices, and also explained the corresponding functions of the five categories. Table 2 shows the model of visual interactive resources.

2.3. Previous research on EAP students' use of metadiscourse

The majority of previous studies addressed scholars' use of metadiscourse in research genres across disciplines (e.g., Hu & Cao,

2011; Hyland, 2004; Shokouhi & Talati Baghsiahi, 2009). The use of metadiscourse by EAP students is much les examined. One representative study i Intraprawat and Steffensen (1995), in which EFL students essays were rated, and high-rated essays were found to have more instances of efective metadiscourse. Informed by this research finding, researchers have implemented a pedagogical approach to metadiscourse, focusing on the explicit instruction of metadiscourse (e.g., Cheng & Steffensen, 1996; Steffensen & Cheng, 1996). With explicit intruction, students were able to comprehend English texts more easily (Tavakoli, Dabaghi, & Khorvash, 2010) and to produce significantly better writing (Steffensen & Cheng, 1996).

Due to the ubiquitous technology and computer-mediated communication, researchers started to examine the efect of the Web 2.0 tol (e.g., Wiki) on the students use of metadiscourse in course writing (e.g., Alyousef & Picard, 2011; Kuteeva, 2011). For instance,

Kuteeva (2011) implemented wiki group writing with the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) students and found that wiki writing enabled the students to raise awareness of the audience and to increase the use of interactional metadiscourse, such as engagement markers, hedges, boosters, self-mentions, and atitude markers. More recently, genre scholars (e.g., Luzon, 2023; Tardy, 2023) began to examine the interactivity and multimodality of emerging digital genres on social media (e.g., YouTube and Twitter). For instance, Luzon (2023) examined Twittr acounts of scientists and research groups for users' various stance and engagement resources, including those often adopted in writen texts (e.g., self-mentions attitude markers) and the other resources aforded by the digital medium (e.g., moving images, emoji, hashtags). However, litle research to date has explored students' use of metadiscourse in a. ademic multimodal genres (e.g, infographics). We have barely any knowledge of how EAP students draw on multiple semiotic resources to communicate science knowledge aesible via infographics, and how to analyze the various metadiscourse resources in a multimodal genre. Thus, we aim to bridge the gap by examining medical students use of visual and textual metadiscourse? features to organize multimodal texts and interact with the audience through an infographic task in an EAP class Textual metadiscourse refers to a range of textual devices writers useto explicitly organize their texts and engage readers (Hyland & Tse, 2004), whereas visual metadiscourse refers to design features composers use to help viewers comprehend and engage with multimodal texts (D'Angelo, 2010). Both types of metadiscourse all into the categories of interactive and interactional resources, as discussed earlier. We addres the following overarching question in this study: How do the students use diverse visual and textual metadiscourse devices to inform and engage the audience in their infographic posters? The students use of various metadiscourse devices willhelp us understand their visual literacy skills, which will accordingly shed light on how to assess and foster students' multimodal literacy.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Context and participants

This study comes from a larger project (i & Pham, 2022) conducted with 185 first-year medical students enrolled in an EAP course named English in Medicine at a public medical university in the south of Vietnam. For the 6-year undergraduate program that trains medical profesonals specializing i traditional medicine, multiple core course ar offered in the first year, such as Biology, Statistics in Medicine, and English in Medicine. This EAP course, bearing three credits, required the students to atend 15 class meeting esions in person, passthe midterm quiz, complete classassignment, and take a final exam at the end of the semester. The goal of this course was to provide students with opportunities to learn and practice English used in the context of anatomy and physiology through listning, speaking, reading, writing, and pronunciation. The texts used in this course included the required textbook English n Anatomy and Physiology and other online resources selected by the instructors. The participants on average were twenty years old, and their English language proficiency level was Intermediate Low or higher according to the ACTFL Guidelines.

# 3.2. DMC task

To innovate the pedagogical practice, we designed DMC tasks for the participants to work on collaboratively and individually in this course. Informed by the current medical practice that infographic, as a new professional digital genre, are used by health professionals to communicate medical information to their patients, we created two infographic composing tass in this course with the hope that practicing such authentic tasks in language classrooms would enable medical students to better prepare for their future healthcare carer. Defined as "an innovative and engaging method of visually communicating information in a colorful and concise manner (McCrorie, Donnell, & McGlade, 2016, p. 71), infographic i found to be an effective DMC task in language classes (Maamuujav et al., 2020).

In the larger project (Li & Pham, 2022), the students worked on two infographic composing tasks: prevention of COviD-19 infection and control of hypertension, two weeks for each composing task. By creating infographic posters, the students 1) provide instructions for their family and friends to prevent coviD-19 infection, and 2) guide future patients to control hypertension. The students were required to identify the potential audience of their infographics, orchestrate semiotic resources (e.g., words, images, hyperlinks) obtained from reliable sources, use the technical terms related to health, and include a footer at the end of a poster to list all ited resources. The infographic task was evaluated according to a multi-traits rubric that we developed based on Hafner and Ho's (2020) study. The thre assessment criteria are organization/content, visual effct, and language, from band 1 to band 5. Specifically, the participants were expected to present and organize information clearly, logicall, and in original ways; full adres the topic with well-supprted ids; and cite renes apropriatly. n terms of multmedia and visaleffect, the participnts were xpected to use visuals and multimodal resources appropriately (e.g., texts, hyperlinks, images, emoticons; tables, graphs) toconstruct meaning and engage the audience. The language criteria sought participants language accuracy and a wide range of lexicons concerning the topic.

During the orientation session conducted by the third author, the infographic assgnment was presented to the students, and they evaluated fie sample infographics selected from the wHO website. Students got familiarized with the thre criteria of the grading rubric, namely contents/organization, visual efects and language, before they created their infographic posters either individually or collaboratively. However, they were not introduced to the concepts of metadiscourse and visual metadiscourse.4 They were then trained to use the free version of Visme, a tool supporting the creation of presentations, infographics, and other visual content. The students were encouraged to use editable infographic templates and icons, drag-and-drop capabilities of various infographic elements, and collaboration functions (when working on a group assigment). They were given atrial fusing Visme to create a short infographic poster. In the present study, we focused onthe infographic task on hypertension control and accessed a total of 127 infographic posters through the web links submitted by the students, who had agreed to participate in the study and signed the consent form.

# 3.3. Data analysis

As discussed earlier, DAngelo (2010, 2016) developed a framework for analyzing visual metadiscourse in academic posters. Due to the similarities in information organization between academic posters and infographic posters, we drew on D Angelo's (2016) visual interactive metadiscourse framework (Table 2) to analyze our data to see how the students guided their readers as they constructed infographic posters. Specifically, information value is organized by layout (e.g, left-right, top-bottom, etc.) and framing is done through frame lines, color contrast, and empty space. Furthermore, ideas presented in multimodal discourse are connected through repetition, vectors, and information alignment, which guides the flow of information presented to the reader. Graphic elements are also used to summarize content and help readers' immediate retention of information. Finally, font decisions, related primarily to legibilit, function to clarify/enhance organization. We removed a few devices, namely eliminating the Centre-Margin and Triptych, not applicable t ur own data, inthe informational catgory, and pard down raphic lements to four catgories i.., table, figres, pictures, and other) that applied to our data. Although DAngelo (2010) addressed visual interactional resources of academic posters (e.g, salience, size of frame, and perspective), we do not think those categories apply welltour data. We had a review ofall the infographic posters and allowed subcategories regarding interactional resources to emerge from our own data, namely emoji, picture, color, and typographic substitution, which are al related to engagement devices. Table 3 below shows the operationalized definition and representative examples of each type f visual interactional resource. Regarding \*color as an interactional metadiscourse device. it only relates to readers emotions (e.g., red is associated with negative danger-bearing emotions), which is ifferent from the use of color for legibility and clarification purposes (interactive metadiscourse device).

Moreover, we analyzed the textual metadiscourse resources (both interactive and interactional) used in the students infographics drawing on Hyland's model (see Table 1). e found seven codes applicable to our data, namely transitions, frame markers, evidentials code gloses, hedges, self-mentions, and engagement markers, with a few entaling distinctive features of the multimodal genre. I particular, frame markers, showing textual stages are reflcted in a sequence of numbers. Evidentials refer to information from other texts; in adition to the phrases functioning evidentials ina traditional text (e.g., \*according to), a QR code serves as a new device to present outside resources.

After we determined the coding schemes for both textual metadiscourse and visual metadiscourse, the first and second authors individuall analyzed the first ften posters with each relevant item check-marked regarding visual metadiscourse use and textual metadiscourse use of each poster, reaching $8 7 \%$ agreement for the visual metadiscourse analysis and $9 5 \%$ agreement for the textual metadiscourse analysis, discrepancy then resolved upon discussion. The second author then proceeded to complete the coding of the remaining data which were kept in an Excel fil, and all the codes were later verified by the irt author. As followed, we calculated frequencies and percentages for each item of the coding schemes, taking all the data into account. Moreover, the first and second authors tok a holistic view of all the analyzed data in the Excel spreadshet and selected two infographics with a high number of checkmark (suggesting a wide range of metadiscourse resources used) for illstration. Specifially, as to each of the two infographic posters, the first and second author discussed one representative example for each check-marked item regarding visual metadiscourse and textual metadiscourse one by one, and then the second author completed the narratives of how the students drew on diverse metadiscourse (visual and textual metadiscourse) devices to complete the multimodal products and possble reasons for their specific metadiscourse use. The third author contacted the composer of the two infographics (Figs. 4 and 5) and shared with each of them the narratives, which were verified by these participants afer the project was completed. This member checking ensured accurate interpretation of metadiscourse use, and alleviated, to a great extent, rearcher speculation other than the true representation of the students' perspectives.

# 4. Results

We examined a total of 127 infographic posters on the control of high blood pressure in terms of visual metadiscourse and textual metadiscourse, scrutinizing the frequency counts and percentage for each subcategory, and then briefl interpreted the results. We also zoomed in on illustrative posters to depict how the students deployed various metadiscourse resources to guide and engage the audience through multimodal content.

# 4.1. Uses of diverse visual metadiscourse resources

The EAP students exploited many kinds of visual interactive resources to make multimodal texts comprehensible and clear to their audience, as shown in Fig. 1. Under the category of information value, the majority of the infographics used left/right and top/bottom $\mathbf { \left( L R + T B \right) }$ , followed by TB configuration, but no LR configuration was identified. This finding may relate to the fact that TB affords more and longer information to present. Also, the Visme infographics templates more frequently come in the elongated TB format Regarding the framing devices that students used to create division or to separate lements f ther infographics, over 70 percent f the infographics equally used frame lines and empty space, while color contrast was deployed in 50 percent of infographics. The use of lines and empty space may be intentional, o i simply may come down to the fact that empty space is the default element to use. To connect information elements, the most frequently used device was the reetition of shapes (over 80 percent), closely followed by the repetition of color and alignment of information, and only a few students applied vectors. Regarding graphic elements, the most popular element by far was the use f ictures at over ixty percent. This was fllowed by figures and tables. Speficall, pictures were highly preferred, because they helped add much information clearly, and also reduced cognitive load for language learners compared with writing accurate text, especially in a case like this medical genre (Maamuujav et al., 2020). Some used graphs to show hypertension data and information, aiding the readers immediate retention of information. Regarding the final category, fonts were used to nhance legibilit, highlight the most important part of the text, and clarify the organization, and over 90 percent of infographics used variable font sizes and font types, closely followed by font colors. Font variations in size, type and colorseemed simple for the students to execute to foreground or provide contrast.

Besides the visual interactive resources used to enhance the comprehensibility of infographics, we also found some visual inter. actional resources the students used to atract, involve and engage viewers. Fig. 2 depicts the use of iffrent types of visual interactional resources.

The students largely used pictures (over 60 percent) to aract and engage the audience, such as hearts or other body parts (i.

lungs or brain as seen in Infographic A below). In particular, they ofen used emojis to arouse readers' emotions. For example, the stressed-out emoji in Infographic A indicates the risk of high blood pressure due to high emotion. The students also used colors to engage the audience. For instance, red was consistently used as a color to denote concern or danger, a particularly common thread given hypertension was the theme of the infographic task. Interestingly, we identified a few instances of typographic substitution, in Which images are creatively embed in words and phrases, such as c ntro! and HyPeRTeNsRON. In the first example, the \*o" in control is a heart, denoting control of the heart (through contrlling blood presure), and the t" in hypertension replaced with the ominous figure of the angel of death can alert the reader to deadly consequences of uncontrolled hypertension. These visual interactive resources enabled users to convey information clearly and engagingly.

# 4.2. Uses of textual metadiscourse resources

Despite the multimodalit afforded by infographics, a few traditional metadiscourse resources were also identified, as displayed in Fig. 3.In terms of interactive resources, 17 percent used frame markers such as a sequence of numbers. Five percent used transitions such as "and' or "but". Almost $5 0 \%$ of infographics included evidentials with the explicit mention of outside resources with a QR code (e.g, \*HO website click here"). One nstance of evidentials in academic writing (i.e. acording to") was also evident. Only one occurrence of code glos used to elaborate propositional meanings (i.e., \*such as") was noted. Regarding interactional resources, the majority of infographics $( 7 8 \% )$ relied on engagement markers, such as "you' (predominantly used) and \*hey'. Almost $5 0 \%$ used hedges expressing uncertainty and indirectness, such as "may cause, \*could help" and \*could become severe'. In addition, ${ 3 \% }$ deployed self-mentions, such as "Let's' and \*Keep a healthy heart so we won't be apart".

# 4.3. Illustrative examples

We further present the student' use of visual metadiscourse and textual metadiscourse resources, by showing two illustrative infographics which can represent the deployment of a wide range of interactive and interactional resources. In Infographic A, we see the use of many visual interactive resources and visual interactional resources to engage with readers. Beginning with informational value, this infographic employs a Left to Right and Top to Bottom (LR-TB) approach to presenting information, which is the most common format found in our tudy. The LR-TB format is typical of the reader's tendency (in English to present information lft t right and top to bottom. Thematically we alo see information separated into areas of information type, with an introduction of hypertension and blood pressure in the top part, the middle part descring ways to control high blood pressure, and the roughly bottom part providing links and QR codes. This separation of information types allows for information to be separated for clarity. Color contrast sets the main information apart from the background, and the links are distinguished with a dull grey background. Further uses of visual interactive resources are found in the lin framing of "So, let's control high blood presure", which draws the reader's attention to a transition into a new information category. Repetition of squares connects the \*Take and \*Reduce" suggestions, reinforcing the commonality and connection, and indicating they are all ways to address hypertension. Repetition of shapes also connects themes, as seen with the \*Take positive suggestions for controlling high blod pressure l in square boxes with checkmark, while the activities to Reduce" or eliminate are indicated with another retition, in this instance the use of the red crossed out cicle with an embedded vector element. Furthermore, empty space is used to separate diffrent areas of information, in this example again the Take" and Reduce" suggestions from each other, and additional space separates suggestions from other areas of information, namely the links at the bottom and description of hypertension in the top information section. Emoticons and pictures such as the anguished face and the tennis shoes with the leg in a jogging stance provide information without having to use text or further description. Pictures of the heart lungs, and brainall alert the readers to areas of health concerns to be considered. This infographic uses several font choices, with the most obvious being red to highlight topics or points f considerable concern (red being a common choice to draw readers atention) Words like "unknown', "uncontrolled', and heart attack or stroke" are given importance in their use of red, and in the case of "control, a larger font size makes the text stand out. This use of red connects nicely with the red high blood presure numbers in the upper right corner, providing thematic continuity. Also, this infographic is one of the few that used cursive writing as a font choice.

Fig. 3. Textual interactive and interactional Resources.

Moreover, Infographic A uses diverse visual interactional resources to impact viewer emotions. The composer uses emoticons effectively to draw an emotional response from the viewer. The previously mentioned emoticon of a distressed figure on the upper right side of the infographic clearly shows the face with straning and tears (or sweat perhaps) streaming from the character emoticon with red hair. This is contrasted nicely with the character acros on the left side, with a happier character holding out the heart next to the text 'So, let's control high blood pressure", introducing the next thematic section. Hypertension' uses the angel of death as a typographic substitution for t, an efficient use of visual interactional resources to add a further layer of emotion to the word. This infographic also use a ommon textual nteractie resource, namely heges. f uncontrlled can ladto hert atack.. is an example of using a hedge to withhold full commitment, something that i very common and makes logical sense considering this is medical advice. Also, Hey' in the top left corner i a good example of an engagement marker lts is a nice example f elf-mentions. These textual interactional metadiscourse resources enhance engagement with the audience. Worthy of note, visual metadiscourse resources are complementary to textual resources in meaning construction. For instance, the picture of a hamburger in a red "do not" circle indicates avoiding satrated fats. This image is highly informational as i illutrates one example of saturated fat sources, enhancing viewers' understanding. That is, the combination of the image and text informs the audience what is bad for health and what is a common food type that contains it.

The second example is Infographic B, shown in Fig. 5, which is visually and textually rich and very organized. Again, a $\mathrm { T } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { B } + \mathrm { L } \mathrm { - } \mathrm { R }$ organizational structure is used with efficient use of visual and textual metadiscourse to incorporate a relatively large amount of information in a manageable and engaging presentation. Frame lines keep separate areas with diffrent information themes. Repe. titions of shape and color are used to connect common themes, such as red circles indicating risk factors, and color repetition is also deployed to reinforce this linkage. A vector arrow is used to connect symptoms to prevention in the middle left pane. Moreover, graphic elements in the form of tables and charts (e.g., blood pressure chart" and \*chart by age') clarify and organize the data presented. Pictures are used throughout to construct meaning, from medical oncerns (i.e., kidney disease) to coffe intake. Information is searatd y effective usef spacend lineelements t allow for cer and effective delineation f information theme. hape alignment and repetition with the descriptive red bubbles around the body image clearly indicate connected information on the risks of high blood pressure on parts of the body. Font elements are used throughout in distinguished type, size, and color to indicate areas of special concern as in How to control hypertension'. Furthermore, diverse visual interactional resources are evident in this infographic. For instance, we se clever use of typographic substitution in which they in hypertension is replaced with a stethoscope. In the text \*To prevent hypertension, we should have check-ups every year", inclusive "we", involving viewers, is considered an engagement device. Also, inclusive \*we' tones down implicit directives and confers the verbal text with a didactic tone that matches the purpose of infographics. Inaddition, we can identify many other examples of textual metadiscourse resources icluding hedges e. 8, "may not", \*an"), engagement markers (e.g., you need", you can use), and slf-mentions (e.g, "we eat), further closing the emotional space with the viewer. This infographic also shows an example of transition, \*. but its complications are severe", which was found in only afew infographics analyzed. Notice \*Scan Me" with the vector pointing to the QR code, a nice instance of the use of evidential pointing towards outside information.

Furthermore, we saw again the nice interaction of visual resources and text resources in the infographic poster. For example Infographic B presents the risks of high blood pressure by drawing on a human body image showing that the risk (stroke") can occur in multiple body parts. Instead of stating "A stroke occurs in the brain" and then repeating that a stroke occurs in each of the other body parts, the image complemented with concise textual chunks conveys the meaning economically. To take another example, the image of "stess wth he red color reets and mphasize he phrase Rduce stress sohat th viewer is more lred to the hamful ffets o stress. The visual-text relationship of redundancy in this case enhances the audience engagement.

Tables 4 and 5below show the overal results on the uses of metadiscourse in the above two infographics, analyzed according to the visual metadiscourse and textual metadiscourse models.

As seen in the examples above, both infographics use diverse font choices and connective elements such as shape repeat, color repeat, and alignment. Infographic B has charts and tables to incorporate data-rich information in an accessble format, whil Infographic A has a more limited, but silleffctie presentation. otable in both infographics and throughout our samples was the limited use of textual resources, both interactive and interactional. Given the option of using text or graphic choices to engage the reader, the creators of the infographics chose to use visual representations, which i a reasonable choice given the format with limited space in an infographic and the potential linguisic limitations on the topic the creators may have faced. Hedges, slf-mentions, and engagement markers were common choices used in the two infographics, which reflect the genre (medical advice is ofen hedged) and how the authors were trying to present the information as advice and/or recommendation that we should ll consider, with the usage of "you" and "we/us' In addition, in both infographics, visual metadiscourse resources and textual metadiscourse resources are found to be complementary or redundant in meaning-making and audience engagement.

# 5. Discussion

This study examines how the EAP students pursuing health professions used diverse visual and textual metadiscourse resources to create infographic posters on controlling hypertension viaVisme. We found that the infographic composing tas i an appropriate and authentic task to be implemented in EAP/ESP classes in which students deploy multiple semioticresources to construct meaning and demonstrate their knowledge in content subjects, which is expected to prepare them for their future carers. In the multimodal genre, the students largely drew on visual metadiscourse resources to guide the audience through the text and engage the audience in the content. We identified multiple ways of interaction between words and images. For one thing, we found abundant intances of pertinent images used to complement concise texts in the infographic posters (see specific examples discussed in the results section) The words ffer essential information, while pictures/image llustrate the information and meanwhile induce emotions in the viewer. For another, thestudents had creative use of typographic ubstitutions. Also known as \*picture-embedded" words, this type f textual choice is common in educational materials such as language learning flashcards (Strauber, Sorcar, Howlet, & Goldman, 2020) or other learning platforms because they form an association between the word and the concet found in the picture. These substitutions are helpful when individual letters are replaced with images that add meaning while enhancing audience engagement.

We found that the visual interactive devices used in academic posters proposed by D Angelo (2010) were applicable to the analyses of our infographic data. Also, we created a new framework of visual interactional metadiscourse device or analyzing infographics, it enabled us to beter understand how students engaged the audience through the multimodal genre. The study reveals that the participants in this study used visual interactive devices much more frequently than interactional, which is probably due to the less face-threatening aspect and the strictly informational value of informative posters (D'Angelo, 2010).

Visme provides various poster templates for students to choose from, but the provision of templates cannot guarantee the clarity and comprehensibility of posters Students need to have sufficient visual literacy sil to sucesfully complete the multimodal composing project. Despite a clear recognition of the necessty of visual knowledge and the use of mult-trat grading rubric including the criteria f visulffets, bth instructors and tudent in this std may stil not e wl informed about what trong isal desin may involve and cannot suficiently reason why specific products have high or low quality in terms of visual design. After we implemented the DMC task, we realized that the explicit knowledge of visual rhetoric, such as the knowledge of visual metadiscourse, would be very helpful for future learning of a multimodal academic genre (e.g., infographics).

# 6. Conclusion

This study makes a unique contribution to the current body of literature on both metadiscourse and DMC by highlighting the role of visual metadiscourse. This study advances our understanding of students' knowledge presentation through a range of metadiscourse devices. As the majority of metadiscourse studies focused on purely written genres (Hyland, 2017), our study on analyzing the visual metadiscourse and textual metadiscourse f the multimodal genre could largely bridge the research gap. In particular, we proposed a brand-new analytical framework to evaluate the visual interactional devices of posters (see Table 3), in tandem with the visual interactive devices developed by DAngelo. Also, the comprehensive visual metadiscourse framework (encompassing visual interactive and interactional resources) we developed could help instructors evaluate the visual design that students engage in, which is well needed as instructors lack of confidence and skills t assess DMC was largely reported in previous studies (e.g., Jiang, Yu, & Zhao, 2021; Yi & Choi, 2015). Important pedagogical insights can be derived by using the framework as a learning tool to enhance students visual literacy skills when DMC is implemented in language and/or writing classes.

Our study further directs teachers' and researchers' attention to the role of metadiscourse, particularl visual metadiscourse in multimodal literacy. As Kumpf (200) posited, visual metadiscourses are design choices that \*reveal awareness f visual literacy' (p.401). The analysi of students use of metadiscourse resources can help tachers evaluate their current visual literacy awareness and skill. In turn, to promote thir visual litery awareness/skills the studnts ca be trained to efetiely use metadscourse resoure. Similar to the training on textual metadiscourse reported in previous research (e.g., Cheng & Steffensen, 1996; Steffensen & Cheng, 1996), instructors can use the visual and textual metadiscourse resources framework as both a learning ol and an asssment tool.For instance, rlaing to the iterion fisual effct th grading rubric addesse earir, instuctors can xpla clerly hw stdents can "use visuals to present information creatively and efectively drawing on the framework of interactive metadiscourse devices, and how to engage the audience by drawing on the knowledge of interactional metadiscourse devices. In this way, students' metacognition of visual deign could be enhanced, and they would be motivated to asess their multimodal texts by referring to the frameworks and attending to diverse metadiscourse resources throughout the process of multimodal composing.

We have to admit a few limitations of our study. First, we just focused on the description of metadiscourse use in DMC products, and students inner perspectives would have shed light on why diverse specific resources have been deployed and why some types of metadiscourse resources are more frequently used than others. Future research can adopt an ethnographic approach drawing on multiple data sources such as interviews and questionnaires to explore if and how students develop their awareness and skill of making semiotic choices and what are their purposes for using specific interactive and interactional resources in their multimodal texts. Also, more iquiries that explore the possblecorrlation between the qualit asessed according to agrading rubric and the use of visual metadiscourse in multimodal genres (Li, Gibbons, & Pham, 2023) could further suggest the role of visual metadiscourse in the current multimodal pedagogy. Moreover, future research can step further by training students about visual and textual metadiscourse knowledge and examining the effect of such training on students multimodal writing competence through the comparison of pre-task and post-task performance. Also, a questionnaire survey could be conducted to find out students increased awareness of metadiscourse knowledge and their perceptions of a possble enhanced level of visual literacy. In addition, we can extend the previous research on integrating the acquisition of metadiscourse into collborative writing tass (e.g., Alyousef & Picard, 2011; Kuteea, 2011), and examine how EAP students can collaboratively learn metadiscoursal knowledge whil jointly completing DMC tasks.
