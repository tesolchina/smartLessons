Abstract: With the rapid development of shadow education around the world, it has become an important part of the education system, and all countries have launched initiatives to manage and standardize shadow education, which also has an enlightening effect on the governance and development of extracurricular tutoring in China. An analysis and comparison of the extracurricular tutoring in Singapore, Finland, South Korea, and the United States show that their tutoring development is relatively mature, while the extracurricular tutoring market in China needs further standardization. The experience of shadow education abroad has reference significance for China. This paper focuses on shadow education in several typical countries, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of shadow education through the international perspective, and puts forward some improvement measures to promote the healthy development of shadow education in China.

# 1. Introduction

Extracurricular tutoring is not orthodox school mainstream education, but as a supplement and expansion of school education, school education as the guidance and premise of existence, so foreign scholars image of it as shadow education. In recent years, with the reform of China's market economy and the loosening of private education policies, some shadow education has begun to emerge. At the same time, the promotion of quality education has allowed students to increase their after-school time and energy. The emphasis on achievements has gradually transformed into comprehensive development of various qualities. shadow education has the advantages of meeting the diverse development needs of students, improving individual competitiveness, and enriching after-school time, so shadow education has emerged and flourished. However, with the continuous expansion of shadow education, problems such as low barriers to entry, lack of supervision, and worrying quality are constantly exposed at the same time, it also brings great challenges to the balanced development of China's education and education equity. It is imperative to regulate and cool shadow education.

# 2. Positive and Negative Effects of Shadow Education

# 2.1 Positive Effects

# 2.1.1 Meet the Differentiated Needs of Students

In ordinary school teaching, the number of students is large, the number of teachers is small, and the teaching content must be carried out in accordance with the syllabus, so that the teaching speed can not be slowed down or accelerated for individual students, resulting in excess energy of eugenics, and students with the weak foundation can not keep up with the situation from time to time. But the shadow education teaching has the flexibility, and may choose one-to-one or the small class system teaching pattern, carries on the targeted teaching to the basic weak student, has made up the mainstream education insufficiency.

# 2.1.2 Provide Personalized Education

With the promotion of quality education and the transformation of parents’ ideas, more and more students are not only focusing on learning, but enriching their extracurricular life, learning musical instruments, painting, and other extracurricular interests, The number of art students and music students is also increasing, but at the present stage, there is a lack of teaching and training in music, art and other discipline systems in high schools. Shadow education can make up for this vacancy and meet the individualized development needs of students.

# 2.2 Negative Effects.

# 2.2.1 Influencing Educational Equity

Although the “commodity” of shadow education is education and customers are students, profit is its main purpose. Therefore, unlike school education, which is inclusive, shadow education uses money as an exchange of education. Therefore, Some students living in poor and remote areas cannot enjoy quality shadow education. Investment in education will bring higher and lifetime benefits. Therefore, when shadow education is only affected by market forces, it will aggravate social injustice. As a result, shadow education undermines efforts to provide educational opportunities for all.

# 2.2.2 Suppression of Mainstream Education

Some educational institutions employ public school teachers as their own human resources through high salaries, resulting in the loss of talent in public schools. At the same time, teachers in public schools believe that they can earn extra income through educational institutions, do not have to work hard in public schools, indulge in making extra money, the quality of education will be affected, students can get the same education from educational institutions like public schools, or even more examination-oriented education, which will lead to more and more disrespect for school teachers.

# 2.2.3 Contrary to Quality Education, Increasing the Burden on Students

Shadow education, in order to satisfy students' pursuit of achievements, is openly guided by exam-oriented education, which seriously hinders the development of quality education. At the same time, students have to switch between school and extracurricular tutoring, and they have to do two things at the same time. Taking care of both in-class and out-of-class will definitely increase the burden of schoolwork and extracurricular work. The heavy schedule will lead to students' lack of energy and the education process will become ineffective.

# 3. Shadow Education in Singapore, Finland, South Korea, and the United States

Shadow education has advantages and disadvantages, how to get rid of its dross, take its essence, become a research problem in various countries. The analysis of shadow education in Singapore, Finland, Korea, and the United States can sum up the advantages and disadvantages and draw lessons from experience.

# 3.1 Shadow Education in Singapore

Singapore is an elite education-oriented country, extracurricular tutoring is prevalent. According to the latest information, the Ministry of Education of Singapore has approved more than 850 registered tutoring and remedial centers. In Singapore, teachers who provide extra-curricular tutoring are all from extra-curricular tutoring institutions, and in-service school teachers are explicitly prohibited from teaching in remedial institutions. Under the regulations of the Ministry of Education of Singapore, in-service teachers who substitute classes in out-of-school counseling institutions, work part-time, or hold remedial classes in various names will not be able to obtain the post of teacher for life once found or reported.

The strict prohibition, due to the reflection of Singapore society on extracurricular tutoring, has the view that the prosperity of extracurricular tutoring to some extent exacerbates the inequality of education. According to the survey, $34 \%$ of families spend S $\$ 500 – 1000$ per month on tutoring and $16 \%$ of children spend about S $\$ 2000$ , which may increase their burden for families with more children.

# 3.2 Shadow Education in Finland

The phenomenon of cram schools is not common in Finland, it is even less common for students to attend private tutoring. In Finland, teachers are not allowed to leave homework for students, and exercises must be completed in class so that students can devote their time to comprehensive quality training after school. In order to avoid junior students staying at home alone after school, Finland's “pre-class and after-school activities regulations” stipulate that schools and nearby related institutions must design extracurricular activities that allow children to rest, play and benefit their physical and mental development in a safe environment from 7 a.m. to $5 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . every day, before and after class.

# 3.3 Shadow Education in Korean

A survey of private education expenditure by the Korean Bureau of Statistics in 2015 showed that the average monthly education expenditure of students with a family income of 7 million was 420,000 won, accounting for $8 2 . 8 \%$ of the private education expenditure; the average monthly private education expenditure of students with a family income of 1 million It is 66,000 won, and the proportion used for private education expenditure is $3 2 . 1 \%$ . In order to change this situation, South Korea first canceled the junior and senior high school entrance exams. Then, it organized public schools to provide extracurricular tutoring to students in need. Since then, limiting private education costs has become the focus of reform.

# 3.4 Shadow Education in America

The US Federal Government launched the “After School Program”. The “after-school plan” is uninterrupted throughout the year. The main venues for implementation are schools and communities, which are very rich in form and content, some are mainly to promote academic development, and some are mainly to prevent student crime and promote physical and mental health. The extracurricular tutoring under this plan is not compulsory, and it is rarely charged. It is mainly to help the working class to solve the placement problem of their children after school, and to stimulate interest in learning.

# 4. Problems

Due to the continuous development of the international environment and the domestic education market, China’s shadow education has also continued to grow and develop. Compared with the above countries, China’s shadow education has developed late and is in an immature stage. Many problems are gradually exposed, mainly existing problems in the following aspects

# 4.1 The Quality of Teachers is Worrisome

The shadow education institutions have insufficient teachers, are good and evil people mixed up, and have a personnel of all educational backgrounds, and students as consumers cannot discern the identity and authenticity of their educational backgrounds. Shadow education institutions have not yet stipulated the qualifications of the teachers of the institutions, nor have a systematic training mechanism. It is an industry where workers come and go freely. There is a large gap between different institutions, and the quality of teachers cannot be guaranteed.

# 4.2 Arbitrary Charging Phenomenon

On the one hand, in order to attract high-quality teachers, educational institutions can only attract teachers with rich wages, the rise in costs will inevitably lead to an increase in fees, on the other hand, Chinese parents in education have always not been stingy to spend money for their children, adhering to the principle that expensive is good, institutional fees will be accepted by the parents will be crazy, and then encourage institutions to charge high fees.

# 4.3 Low Barriers to Entry

The huge demand and high profits of the education market have caused countless people to flock

to it. Education and training in some private places are difficult to control and supervise, and often do not require entry barriers, especially in small and medium-sized cities and remote areas. The requirements for school fees, venue facilities, and faculty are extremely low.

# 5. Standardization

In view of the above problems, and drawing on the experience of other countries, I think that China's shadow education can be standardized and improved from the following aspects:

# 5.1 Strengthen Government Supervision

Shadow education should be supervised by the relevant government education department, standardize its school-running behavior, follow national education policies, and ensure its school-running quality. At the same time, the price department should standardize the agency's charging standards and supervise its tax payment. At the same time, the combination of punishment and incentives should encourage high-quality shadow educational institutions to take measures such as tax reductions and awards of honors.

# 5.2 Improve the Strength of Teachers

Unify the qualifications of teachers in educational institutions, standardize academic requirements, implement assessment mechanisms, form industry norms and guidelines, and restrict behaviors that violate teachers' professional ethics and damage industry reputation.

# 5.3 Improve Laws and Regulations

Existing education laws are relatively lagging behind. It is necessary to improve the laws and regulations that form shadow education as soon as possible and put forward clear and detailed regulations on their industry standards.

# 5.4 Strengthen Cooperation with Social Organizations

In order to reduce the fees charged by shadow education institutions and promote social equity, extracurricular tutoring institutions can be allowed to cooperate with college students, members of non-profit organizations, etc., to provide extra-curricular tutoring for more students with poor living conditions.

# 5.5 Raise the Market Entry Threshold

Implement a strict qualification entry mechanism, and raise the requirements for the unified standards of shadow education institutions' school funding, venues, teachers, etc.

# 5.6 Improve the Quality of Public Schools

To fundamentally cool shadow education, we must vigorously improve the quality of public schools, prohibit public teachers from taking part-time jobs, increase public school funding, and expand the teaching staff to meet the diverse and personalized development needs of students.

# 6. Summary

There are some differences in shadow education in different countries because of different national conditions and development courses. We should take its essence and constantly reflect and standardize the shadow education so that it can really play the role of assisting and perfecting the mainstream education.
