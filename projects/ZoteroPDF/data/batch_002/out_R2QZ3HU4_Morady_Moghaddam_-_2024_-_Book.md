Social theory for english for academic purposes, Ding Alex, Evans Michelle (Eds.). Bloomsbury Academic (2022). p. 232, 81.00, ISBN: 9781350227668

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) is a complex field that encompasses linguistic, cognitive, and social dimensions (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002). Incorporating a sociological imagination in EAP practice is important because it alows practitioners to better understand the contexts, practices, values, cultures, and structural forces that shape academia (Benesch, 2001). By utilizing a so. ciological imagination, practitioners can gain insights into thesocial, cultural, and political frces that inluence academic disciplines and genres (Morady Moghaddam, 2023). This understanding helps practitioners develop a reflexive understanding of their own field and the fields of thir students, enhancing their ability to effctively teach and support students in their academic endeavors. Addtionally, a sociological imagination enables practitioners to criticlly examine the ideological, tructural, and discursive forces that shape the fieldof EAP itef, empowerig them tochllenge and transform existing practices and contribute to research and scholarship in the field (Liu & Hu, 2021).

Addressing these needs, Social Theory for English for Academic Purposes aims to provide EAP practitioners with a set f theoretical frameworks and critical perspectives for them to engage with social theory to gain a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political forces that shape academia and EAP. The book discuses several sociological traditions that inform the discussion within the context of Higher Education, EAP, and perceptions of genre. These traditions include (Structural) functionalism, conflict-based traditions stemming from Marxist orientations, and social action-based traditions exemplified by Weber, Mead, and Schutz. These tra ditions provide atheoretical foundation for understanding the social, cultural, and political forces that shape academia and EAP, and they are explored in various chapters throughout the book.

The edited volume has two main parts (Foundations and Perspectives) and nine chapters (232 pages). Part I has three chapters and Part I has six chapters. The volume has also Introduction and Afterword ections that are written by the Editorsof the book, Alex Ding and Michelle Evans, respectively. In the reminder of this review, I will briefly discuss each of these sections.

In the introductory section, Alex Ding argues that EAP practitioners should actively engage with social theory and develop a so. ciological imagination to gain a deeper understanding of the contexts, practices, values, cultures, and structural forces that influence academia and EAP. It explores the utilization of social theory in EAP, along with is connection to genre theories, academic literacies, and systemic functional linguistics. Additionall, it delves into the current state of social theory, the importance f relexivity in the EAP field, and the limited integration of social theory in EAP publications.

Part One of the book emphasizes social theory within the existent knowledge-base of EAP. Chapter 1, written by Michelle Evans, focuses on the sociological foundations and implications of genre in the field of sociology and EAP. It explores influential genre traditions in different EAP contexts, examines sociological concepts and themes within these traditions, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the multi-functionality of genres and their role in social stability and academic change. The chapter concludes by discussing the theoretical eclecticism of genre traditions and the need for paradigmatic reconciliation. Chapter 2 by Jackie Tuck delves into the lack of a shared or definitive meaning for the term academic literacies It provides an overview of academic literacies as a research paradigm, highlighting its unique theoretical perspective and it rlationship to social practice, the social aspect, and criticality. The chapter also explores the historical development of academic literacies and its application in various language. specialist fields and higher education settings. The chapter concludes by reflcting on academic literacies as a paradigm that en. courages a creative diaogue bewethery and practice. Chapter , written by J. R Martin diusses Systemic FunctionaLinguistics (SFL) as a social theory of language that views language as a social semiotic. It also considers the uses of language and the distribution of inguistic resources among members of communities. It provides acomprehensive framework for understanding language as a social and meaning-making resource.

Part Two of the book highlights the social theories that are useful for informing EAP practitioners, but have not yet fully developed within EAP. Chapter 4 by Steve Kirk focuses on Legitimation Code Theory (CT) as aframework to adressthe fragmentation observed in EAP. LCT provides a common language for EAP practitioners to comprehend and analyze the field, ultimately leading to the cumulative building of knowledge within the field. By making knowledge practices more visible, LCT allows for a nuanced and integrated perspective of EAP, empowering practitioners to examine the underlying organizing principles and critically evaluate existing pratices. Chapter 5 by Ian Bruce discusses the relation between social realism and EAP, providing a theoretical framework for knowledge. building and knowledge-refining in the field. This chapter argues that social realism offers a theoretical framework that can help address the issues in EAP by providing a basis for conceptual and methodological judgments in genre studies It emphasizes the ontological existence of genres, the integration of ifferent types of knowledge in genres, and the importance of judgemental rationality in genre research.

Chapter 6, written by Julia Molinari, explores the application of critical realism to EAP. Critical realism is introduced as a phil osophical approach that acknowledges the existence of an ultimate reality independent of human thought and action, while also accommodating the relativism inherent in individual experiences and practices. The relevance of critical realism to EAP is discussed underscoring the necessiy of understanding the structures and mechanisms that shape the field. Chapter 7 by Alex Ding explores the struggles and tensions within the EAP field, including its lack of autonomy and its dependence on economic and politial feds. The author emphasizes the need for reflexivity and scholarship among EAP practitioners It also addresses criticisms of Bourdie's determinism and writing style. Chapter 8, written by Haynes Collins and Adrian Holliday, highlihts the usef ethnography in EAP and its potential contributions, providing a holistic and critical perspective on academic writing and universty discourses. Ethnography helps students srategicall navigate academic writing by recognizing when to conform to these conventions and when to challenge them. It also highlights the influence of wider discourses, such as neoliberalism, on the universty environment and the ways in which certain meanings and identities are constructed and marginalized. Chapter 9 by Yolanda Cerda promotes the adoption of feminism as a theoretical framework for analyzing EAP, exploring its potential advantages and influence on academic writing pedagogies and scholarship.

The Afterword section of this volume (by Michelle Evans) reflects on the process of writing and discussing social theory in the context of EAP. It discuses the challenges authors faced in understanding and presenting social theories, the importance of authen. ticity in their writing, and the riss and rewards of engaging in this project. This section explored the benefits of social theory for EAP practitioners. Firstly, it provides a theoretical framework that helps practitioners understand the complex social dynamics and structures that influence academic language and literacy practices. Secondly, social theory allows practitioners to critially examine and question existing practices and assumptions within the field. Furthermore, social theory informs practitioners' pedagogical strategies and interventions. The Afterword section concludes by encouraging EAP practitioners to continue exploring social theory in their own practice..

Exploring the strengths of this volume, several key aspects stand out. Firstly, the volume provides a platform for EAP practitioners to engage with social theories and their application in academic language and literacy practices.Itoffers several theoretical frameworks that help practitioners understand the complex social dynamics and structures that shape these practice. This understanding can enhance their knowledge and critical thinking skills enabling them to navigate the complexities of EAP instruction more effectively. Secondly, the volume encourages EAP practitioners to criticlly examine and question existing practices and assumptions within the field. By engaging with social theories, practitioners can analyze power dynamics, social inequalities, and cultural influences that may impact EAP. Furthermore, the volume emphasizes the importance of authenticity in EAP practice. This authenticty not only enhances the relevance and applicability of the theories but also inspires innovative teaching methods and approaches.

The volume can be problematized on several grounds as well The complexity and depth of social theories may be overwhelming for some readers, especially those les familiar with the subject matters. Moreover, the diverse and somehow independent range of chapters and approaches may not satisf all readers expectations or address al possible questions. The volume's discussions and insights are more inclined to the perspectives and experiences of Western EAP practitioners, since the authors of the chapters mainly belong to highly developed countries such as the UK. Therefore, non-westen cultures and ideologies with regard to EAP practices have remained underdeveloped.

All i all, he volume provides insightful ideas and discussions that can help EAP practitioners improve their critical thinking and innovative practices. These challenges, however, can be seen as opportunities for growth, reflection, and learning for the authors and the EAP community as a whole. In short, the volume contributes to the field of EAP by promoting the integration of social theory, highlighting its transformative potential, and encouraging ractitioners to continue exploring and discussng social theory in their own practice. It offrs a valuable resource for EAP practitioners seeking to deepen their theoretical knowledge, enhance their critical thinking skills, and promote social awareness and transformative practices within the field.
