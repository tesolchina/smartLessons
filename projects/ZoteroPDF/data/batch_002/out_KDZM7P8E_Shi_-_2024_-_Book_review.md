Academic writing is widely acknowledged as a challenging and complex sil that entails the inerplay of social, cogntive, affctive, rhetorical, contextual, and linguistic factors. Among abundant monographs on academic writing in English, most take the perspective f the writer, addressing th topic in tms of vrious stags of the writi procs ., Baiey, 2003 rme & Lea, 2008; ilt e l. 2009; Valls, 2010), iffert writing techniques (e.g, Albrighton, 2021; Wilbers, 2014), or a single key skil inolved (e.g., Hrris 2017; Wette, 2021), whereas few start f from the angle of the receiver end-the reader. Following a graduate student reader orientation, Clarity and Coherence in Academic Writing Using Language as a Resource by Nunan and Choi focuses on clarity and coherence, two key qualities of academic writing, and explores inguistic means to achieve them. Instead of presenting technical knowhow of academic writing, the volume highlights its nature as a meaning-making, language-mediated, and communicative act In other words, academic writing is treated as an act that concretizes thinking and transforms ideas into words, during which the writer works as the agent by means of language while it is the reader that judges the effectiveness of such transformation.

The volume consists of nine chapters that are organized into three parts. Part 1 (Chapters 1-6) aims to be conceptual, introducing essential concepts of which an understanding would equip writers with indispensable ools to achieve clarity and coherence in writing, such as knowledge of language in general (Chapter 1), connections (Chapter 2), theoretical approaches to writing (Chapter 3), audience and purpose (Chapter 4), voice (Chapter 5), and figurative language (Chapter 6). Part 2 (Chapters 7-8) is intended to be practical, discussing the appication of important concepts previously mentioned to the work of seeking and providing feedback (Chapter 7), and revisin (Chapter 8). The volume ends with Part 3 (Chapter 9). In what follows, summarize the main content of each chapter.

Chapter 1 reviews the basic knowledge of English language every writer should have, including grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation. cificall, insted f following a decontxtualied approchto ammar that equates it t accuracy and corrctss, the authors advocate a functional one that \*describes the systematic rlationship between grammatical form and communicative function' (p. 12) and considers grammatical structures as meaningful chunks used to perform communicative acts. Concerning vocabulary, lexical collocations are valued more than individual words, while for punctuation, besides its mechanical role, the authors remind us that it also sigals pauses and logical relations. Allthi basic knowledge helps writer to guard against grammatical erors, poor lexical choices, and mechanical mistakes, which lays the foundation for clear and coherent writing.

Besides basic language knowledge, other linguistic concepts are fundamental to clarity and coherence. In the next chapter, the authors discussresources for making connections at the sentence, paragraph, and text levels, such as thematization (given-new structuring), cohesive devices (reference, substitution, elipsis, conjunction, and lexical cohesion), and signposting and summarizing that inform readers of what comes next and what has been treated respectively.

Up to this point, readers may wonder whether clear and coherent writing is all about the use of linguistic resources. The authors provide a forceful NO from three aspects in the following chapters. To begin with, Chapter 3 conveys the well-known idea that writing is not only a product but also a process. According to the product-oriented view, writing i something not in vacum but closely intertwined with situational contexts (register) it matches and social functions (genre) it serves. And a processorientation views writing not as a one-time concern but a rflective and recursive process that involves such steps as pre-writing, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing.

To clarify the role of register and genre in writing, the authors go on in Chapter 4to explain the notions of purpose (why to write) and audience (whom to writ for). The reason why these two notions matter lies in the fact that writing is in no sense an automatic at of human beings, like breathing, but highly motivated one. Purpose and audience bridge the gap betwee social factorsregister and genre  and human factorsthe writer and the readerin written communication. The authors also recommend writing for oneselfin order to experience the two concepts from the first-person perspective--both as the writer and the reader.

The third aspect concerns the means to tailor writing to different purposes and audiences-voice in Chapter 5. It refers to the way that writers reveal their writerly selves through the texts they construct (p. 97). Contrary to the conventions in academic writing, the uthors argue for active voice and encourag writers to inser ther felings and attitudes into their writing reasonably, avoiding being a phantom any more. Through active voice, the reader could better understand why the writer chooses to write about something in a particular way, and above all what writer identity, style, and stance are like. To create voice, the authors suggest various lingustic devices including sentence length, word choice tense, and modifiers, non-discoursal elements such as tables, charts, figures, photgraphs, as well as story-telling. Use f figures of speech is another way to develop voice. Chapter 6 illustrates simile, metaphor, grammatical metaphor, and idioms (colloquialism, cliche, and slang). The point is, as the authors remind us, to learn about the degree of acceptabilit for different figurative expressions in academic writing, as well as how, when, and why to use them.

Part 2 presents two key steps to improve clarity and coherence in writig. Step 1 (in Chapter 7) sees to identify what is lacking in terms of larity and coherence through feedback. In whatever format, feedack must ental an action-reaction-response cycle that connects product, proces, and person, so as to be meaningful. Responding to feedback could be influenced by the ource of feedack (teacher, per, or computer), timing of feedback bing given, type irect r indirect) and fous (langua or structure of feedack, as well as the type of writing. Step 2, as exemplified in Chapter 8, is incorporating feedback into subsequent drafts of writing. As a common saying goes, writing itself does not make good writing; revising does, which adds evidence to the importance of revision.

Chapter 9 ends the volume with ten concise take-away ideas. Among them, worth mentioning are the authors' emphases on the highly demanding properties of academic writing for everyone and the responsiveness to the fact that academic writing standards change with the times.

As an atypical volume on academic writing, this one ofers not a how-to guide but a conceptual framework that failitates clear and coherent writing. This framework contains a series of elusive concepts ranging from basic language knowledge, cohesion, coherence, product, and proessto audience, purpose, voice, fback, and revision. Undoubtedy to make thee notions concrete is adifficult job, yet fortunately the authors have done an excellent one through integrating examples, exercises, and Q & A into the text. Admitedy adopting these strategies is nothing innovative, but what impresses me most is the authors ingenuity underlying the design and arrangement of these elements. Specificall, the well-chosen examples are mainly first-hand, coming from the authors themselves as frontline teachers and the second author's graduate students. They are quit illstrative, which contributes to the first step towards the accessibility of abstract concepts.

To illustrate, Choi's writing experience serves tostres the close tie between writing and thinking in Chapter 3. Also, to drive home the complex essence of considering audience and purpose in academic writing for novice writers, Chapter 4 cites the conversations between the two authors and one student about the student's journey from term paper to journal articl. This journey emerges out of the conversations as a way of learning to sense what the audience expects and a proces of conducting meaning-making negotiations accordingly. In addition, the idea that developing one's voice starts from imitating models but ends with moving beyond them gets across through the learning experiences of Nunan and one student in Chapter 5. Moreover, while Chapter 7 quotes thre students views on feedback to make clear the factors that are either conducive or not to affective, cognitive, and behavioral engagement with feedback, Nunan's manuscript-revising experience in Chapter 8 vividly displays revision as a systematic project that is no less exhausting than drafting. Finall, Chapter 9, by sharing one student's diary recording her feelings on an academic writing tak, reiterates the importance of learning to writ clearly and coherently.I like these examples not simply because of their authenticity and functionality, but more importantly, their sincerity that makes me fel the authors are sharing in earnest their experiences, eflections, and thoughts.

To consolidate readers' understanding of the abstract concepts by means of exercises functions as the second step towards their accesibility. Instead of placing the exercises at the end of each chapter and the keys at the end of the volume as usual practice the authors choose to insert them into each chapter, immediately afer the points the exercises are designed for, which calls for instant application of knowledge. Meanwhile, analyses of answers are provided together with these exercises, as reinforcement of important points. Also found are open-ended exercises that are quite thought-provoking for readers.

The third step is the introduction of a Q & A module into the end of each chapter. Collected from the authors' daily instruction and supervision, these questions serve as those the authors anticipate from their potential readers of the volume. In addition to adding an author-reader interaction element to the volume, this module also complements each chapter with further explanations of key points. Typical examples include form-meaning relationships in functional grammar in Chapter 1, cohesion-coherence relationships in Chapter 2, product-processcoordination in academic writing in Chapter 3,causes of and solutions to \*writer's block" in Chapter 4, the way to one's own voice in Chapter 5, caveats of using figurative language in academic writing in Chapter 6, tips on the deadline problem in Chapter 7, as well as revising for a journal in Chapter 8.

Another striking feature of the volume consists i its opinion on the fundamental source of the writing problem. It is considered as neither a linguistic problem nor a technical one but asimplification or reduction in representation. That is the challenge is one of transforming the non-linear and multi-dimensional real world into linear and uni-dimensional language. The transformation naturally leads to the lackof clarity and coherence in expresion. Solving this problem is equal to solving the writing problem, which requires not only mastery of inguisticresources but also using them to develop and establish writers voices based on purpose and audience s wel as to make refinements based on feedback. Concerning this problem-solving proces, one suggestion given by the authors is to develop a sense of the author in academic writing by personal journal writig. Readers may doubt it t first sight, but i has been substantiated that expressive or reflective writing helps self-recognition, identit construction, and voice development, and thus benefits academic writing (Pfeiffer, 2022).

Meanwhile, it should be noted that this volume, mainly aimed at awareness-raising, would be best not used alone if applied to teaching. Here is how I would use it i combination with other material for graduate students: the first two chapters together with a functional grammar volume (e.g., Thornbury, 2001), Chapter 3 with resources on writing stages and textual features of different writing (e., Gillt et al, 209), Chapter 4 with infmtion about releant writing tenique (e.., Wilrs, 2014), Chaptrs 5 and6 with materials on source use (e.g., ette, 2021), as well as Chapters 7 and 8 with works on revision strategies (e.g., Thomson, 2022). Moreover, identfying with the authors' opinion on the relevance of writing clearly and coherently to the multi-modal composition in modern times, I would consider trying the idea of integrating information literacy and technological development into academic writing instruction (Mammadova, 2022), to arouse students' passon in exploring multiple modalities for meaning-making and communication.

However, there is also some room for improvement. For example, although it is a good idea to draw on findings from an empirical study to discuss learners engagement with feedback in Chapter 7, the authors only detail contextual factors, without attending to individual ones  another critical element that influences the engagement and would be best not omitted. If there is asecond edition of the volume, it would also be preferable to incorporat the latest studies associated with other key concerns in the volume, such as those on the effcts of audience on L2 writing processes and text (Barkaoui, 2021) for Chapter 4, the construction of discoursal scholarly identity in research writig (Qi & Zhao, 2023) for Chapter 5, the multidimensional impact of L2 writing feedback (Liu & Yu, 2022) for Chapter 7, and the in-depth exploration of revision by means of finer-grained product- and proces-related indices (Conijn e l., 2022) for Chapter 8, just to name a few. This would help readers kee up-to-date with what is going on and contextualize thir understanding within the research landscape.

To conclude, cler and coherent writig is never about following rule and regulations and seeing no point in doing it. Neither is it a job to rush through. If one thinks otherwise, then what follows naturally might be their superficial engagement with or even strong distaste for writing. By lluminating the nature of academic writing as a language-dependent meaning-making act oriented towards communication and a problem-solving process leading to self-discovery, the volume helps readers to see the point and smooths the challenging journey for them, thereby demystifying the formidable task of academic writing. In this sense, the book would be a desirable reference for beginning academic writers 2 writing tachers, and graduate students from applied inguisics education and other related fields.
