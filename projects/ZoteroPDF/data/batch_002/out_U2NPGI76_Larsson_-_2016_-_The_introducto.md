The introductory it pattern, as in it is interesting to note the changes made, is a versatile pattern of great importance to academic writers. However, very little attention has been paid to its syntactic and lexical variability. The present study investigates the degree of variability of the pattern with regard to its syntactic and lexical make-up in expert and apprentice learner writing, and whether the variability and/or frequency of particular realizations found in expert writing has an effect on the use of the pattern in learner writing. The study uses data from the Advanced Learner English Corpus (ALEC) and the Louvain Corpus of Research Articles (LOCRA). The results show that the pattern is relatively invariable overall, as certain high-frequency realizations account for the bulk of the tokens in both corpora. With some noteworthy exceptions, the learners use the pattern similarly to the experts, which suggests that the learners generally are proficient users of the pattern. However, the it V ADJ to-inf subpattern, possibly due to its particularly high token frequency in the expert data, was significantly overused by the learners, as was its most frequent realization it V POSSIBLE to-inf; there thus seems to be a frequency effect in play.

# 1. Introduction

Due to its wide array of uses, the introductory it pattern, as in it is interesting to note the way rhetorical choices vary, can be considered to be of great importance to academic writers. The uses of this pattern, which is made up of a non-referential introductory it, a predicate and a clausal subject (cf. Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985:1391), range from stance marking to information structure management (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999:661, 677). However, while much research on the use of the pattern in academic writing has focused on its various functions (e.g. Hewings & Hewings, 2002; Romer, 2009 € ), very little attention has been paid to its syntactic and lexical variability; the pattern has thus not yet been described in its full complexity.

In light of this, the aim of the present study is twofold. Firstly, the study aims to investigate the degree to which the makeup of the introductory it pattern is fixed or variable in academic writing by expert writers and learner writers. This is done through an exploration of the pattern's syntactic structure and of its most salient lexical items, as outlined below. Secondly, the study investigates whether the variability and/or the frequency of particular realizations found in expert writing are matched in learner writing, in order to further explore the learner difficulties reported in previous research on the pattern (e.g. Hewings & Hewings, 2002; Larsson, forthcoming).

Variability is here treated as a lexico-syntactic rather than a semantic variable. It is viewed as a cline with invariable items, such as fixed expressions, representing one end of the scale, and highly variable items which have many different alternative realizations representing the opposite end of the scale. Interestingly, the introductory it pattern has members that can be found at either end of the continuum, as will be demonstrated in section 3. The study starts out from what is, to the best of my knowledge, the most fine-grained syntactic classification of the introductory it pattern there is, namely that of the COBUILD grammars (Francis, Hunston, & Manning, 1996, 1998) and introduces the terms subpattern and predicate lemma.

Subpatterns denote a set of instances of the introductory it pattern that share a syntactic make-up; for example, the it V that subpattern encompasses all tokens that have this basic structure, with that representing a that-clause. Another subpattern is shown (in bold) and illustrated using a corpus examples in (1). A list of the abbreviations used in the COBUILD grammars can be found in Appendix A.

# (1) it V ADJ to-inf:

[ … ] it is important to examine different aspects of vocabulary learning. (LOCRA_018-04)1

The term predicate lemma is used to denote the lexical item within the predicate of the introductory it pattern that carries the most semantic content. Example (1) above can be used to illustrate this. In addition to the two subjects (it and to examine […] learning) there are two lexical items: is and important. Whereas is is arguably semantically neutral by comparison (cf. Quirk et al., 1985:1174), important plays a key role for the purpose of use of the pattern. Important is therefore considered the predicate lemma of this token. More details are given in Section 2.2.3.

Variability is investigated here from three different perspectives. It is measured using (i) the type-token ratio of predicate lemmas by subpatterns, (ii) the relative frequency of the different predicate lemmas for each subpattern and (iii) the presence of features such as negation and modal verbs inside the introductory it pattern. Taken together, the three perspectives offer valuable and complementary information. While type-token ratios provide an important overview, relative frequencies provide more detailed information about the pattern-internal distribution of the predicate lemmas. The additional features explored in the third stage are features that are not accounted for in the COBUILD classification, but which are, due to their frequency, nonetheless likely to provide important insights into the degree of variability of the introductory it pattern that would otherwise have been overlooked.

For the second part of the study, which investigates whether the degree of variability and/or token frequency in expert writing appears to have an effect on the use of the pattern in learner writing, the expert writing is viewed as being representative of the input of academic writing that learner writers receive. In usage-based models of L1 and L2 language acquisition, input is considered to play an important role for language acquisition and processing (Ellis, 2013:369). While there are, of course, many determinants of learning that interact, the role of input frequency has been emphasized (e.g. Ellis, 2002, 2013; Ellis, O’Donnell, & Romer, 2013; Hasher € & Zacks, 1984). Ellis (2013:368) states that “[f]requency promotes learning and entrenchment”. That is, very frequent linguistic items are easily accessed and are more likely to be learned, which should mean that learners are more likely to produce these linguistic items than other, less frequent ones; this hypothesis will be tested in the present study. Similarly, previous research on the introductory it pattern has shown that learners have a tendency to make use of a limited set of high-frequency realizations and use those very frequently, a tendency that has been referred to as lexicogrammatical teddy bears (Larsson, forthcoming, from Hasselgren's (1994:256) term lexical teddy bears). It could furthermore be expected that subpatterns that exhibit a low degree of variability, and which thereby are more fixed, are more likely to be used by the learners, as these would be perceived as more salient (cf. Ellis, 2013:376); this is another hypothesis that will be tested in the present study. The research questions used to guide the analysis are as follows:

 What is the degree of variability (as operationalized in the present study) of the different subpatterns of the introductory it pattern in the expert data and the learner data?   
 If we use the expert data as a standard for comparison, do token frequency and/or the varying degree of variability of the subpatterns have an effect on the learners' use of the introductory it pattern?

Based on previous research (e.g. Ellis, 2013), it is expected that high-frequency, invariable subpatterns found in the expert data will be found even more commonly in the learner data, as the more frequent and regular the input, the more likely it is that learners will use these subpatterns frequently in their own production.

# 1.1. Previous research on the introductory it pattern and variability

The introductory it pattern is highly versatile and has been found to be particularly frequent in academic discourse (Biber et al., 1999:674, 722). The different functions of the pattern have been thoroughly investigated across disciplines (e.g. Biber et al., 1999; Groom, 2005; Larsson, forthcoming; Peacock, 2011) and in learner vs. expert data (e.g. Hewings &

Hewings, 2002; Romer, 2009 € ). However, although some studies (e.g. Hyland, 2008) have established the frequency and behavior of certain fixed realizations of the pattern, very little focus has been placed on investigations of less fixed realizations and how common these are in relation to the fixed ones, which is an area to which the current study will contribute.

Most previous investigations of the introductory it pattern in academic writing have taken a lexical bundles approach (e.g. Hyland, 2008), some version of a search-pattern approach2 (e.g. Groom, 2005; Peacock, 2011; Romer, 2009 € ) or an approach based on a set of preset syntactic categories (e.g. Larsson, forthcoming, where Quirk et al.’s (1985:1392) classification is used). However, while these approaches are well suited for their respective aims, they are not satisfactory if the focus is on investigating variability within the pattern, since a great deal of variation is left unaccounted for with these methods. The four instances of the introductory it pattern listed in (2)e(5) will be used to exemplify this.

(2) It is clear that the child knew what a Christmas tree is [ … ]. (LOCRA_008-04) (3) It is immediately clear that such a lexical item will be able to combine with a range of other items [ … ]. (LOCRA_006-03) (4) It might also be the case that the Korean students make more use of analogy strategies [ … ]. (LOCRA_006-04) (5) It is important for monolingual children to have mastered the language [ … ]. (LOCRA_002e04)

In a study taking a lexical bundles approach, the first two examples, (2) and (3), would not be treated as variants of the same realization by the search algorithm, but instead as two different realizations, despite their similarity. Moreover, only example (2) can be found in its entirety (albeit without the full that-clause) in a search for four-word clusters. Likewise, this example is the only one that will be found in a study using a search-pattern approach that does not allow for noun phrases and/or intervening clause elements. Quirk et al.’s (1985:1392) syntactic classification covers all four of the examples; however, if no further subdivision were to be implemented, all of the examples would be classified as belonging to one and the same category (SVC: Subject-Verb-Complement), which means that all internal variation, such as type of clause complementation, inserted adverbials and modal verbs, would be ignored. All of this variation will, however, be investigated in the present study.

Variability and fixedness have been addressed in several analytical frameworks of relevance to the introductory it pattern. While the present study defines fixedness lexico-syntactically, analytical frameworks such as Phraseology (cf. Granger & Paquot, 2008), which have been used to investigate variability in other studies, emphasize semantic fixedness. Phraseological units are typically viewed as including “all types of conventional, phraseological chunks such as idioms, metaphors and similes, proverbs, sayings and cliches, bound collocations and binominals - ” (Philip, 2008:96). Fixedness is then commonly understood in relation to the degree of compositionality, i.e. whether or not the meaning of an expression is transparent given the meaning of each linguistic component of the expression (Lyons, 1995; Svensson, 2008:82). Two recurrent criteria for what constitutes a phraseological unit are non-compositionality and allowance for certain syntactic, but very little semantic variation (Svensson, 2008). While the introductory it pattern as a whole cannot be considered non-compositional, certain occurrences of it might be viewed as operating at the periphery of phraseology in the sense that they can be placed towards the non-compositional end of the spectrum (in uses such as it is tempting to agree with X).

In other approaches addressing fixedness, no criteria of non-compositionality or limited semantic variation are applied; on the contrary, studies taking a lexical bundles approach investigate recurrent expressions “regardless of their idiomaticity, and regardless of their structural status” (Biber et al., 1999:990). Although this approach has clear advantages in that it, for example, reveals recurrent expressions that have previously gone unnoticed, it is not as useful when investigating semi-fixed patterns like the introductory it pattern, as the approach does not allow for any internal variation at all. By contrast, frameworks such as Pattern Grammar (cf. Hunston & Francis, 2000) and Construction Grammar (cf. Goldberg, 2006) allow for a high degree of variability within patterns and constructions respectively, even if these frameworks do not necessarily include descriptions of all the variation possible. For example, while a pattern is defined as “a phraseology frequently associated with (a sense of) a word, particularly in terms of the prepositions, groups and clauses that follow the word” (Hunston & Francis, 2000:3),3 this classification does not account for features that can occur with almost any word class, such as prepositional phrases and adverb groups (Hunston & Francis, 2000:49).

Since the present study aims to investigate all of the internal variation of the introductory it pattern, in order to provide a more complete picture of the degree of variability of the pattern in academic writing, none of these frameworks is applied in its entirety. The Pattern Grammar framework does, nonetheless, form the basis of the classification scheme, albeit with a few additions and some slight adjustments. For example, the introductory it pattern is viewed as one pattern with a common core and various subpatterns in the present study. In the COBUILD grammars, however, each syntactic category of realizations (what is here referred to as a subpattern) is referred to as a pattern; there is no umbrella term to cover all the instances, although it is acknowledged that these patterns have a common core (cf. Hunston & Francis, 2000:156e157).

# 2. Design of the study

# 2.1. Material

The material used for the present study is made up of academic writing in linguistics. The study uses material from two corpora: the Louvain Corpus of Research Articles (LOCRA) and the Advanced Learner English Corpus (ALEC). LOCRA is a threemillion-word corpus of published research articles in business, medicine and linguistics currently under development at the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics at Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. Only articles from peer-reviewed, - top-rated journals are included (http://www.uclouvain.be). The corpus is not restricted to only include native-speaker writing. The present study uses the subcorpus comprising research articles in linguistics, which amounts to approximately 1 million words (109 texts).

The full ALEC comprises 1.3 million words of essays written by university students in English linguistics and English literature who are in their third through fifth year of study. The majority of the students whose essays are included in the corpus have Swedish as their L1. Unlike most learner corpora, ALEC has the advantage that its metadata includes, among other things, information about what grade each essay was awarded, thus making it possible for the researcher to control for level of achievement. As factors such as discipline, year of study, NS status and level of achievement have previously been found to have an effect on the use of the introductory it pattern (cf. Groom, 2005; Larsson, forthcoming; Romer, 2009; Thompson, € 2009), these factors were controlled for in the present study by including only texts that were written by students in English linguistics, who are in their third or fourth year of study, whose L1 is Swedish4 and who received an A or a B (on a grading scale from A to F) on their essay.5 All told, the study uses a subset consisting of approximately 170,000 words (21 texts) of learner writing. It is worth noting that the corpus of expert writing is much larger than that of learner writing; the expert writing will therefore receive slightly more focus.

# 2.2. Method

2.2.1. The introductory it pattern: the definition and the COBUILD classification

What is in the present study referred to as the introductory it pattern has previously been investigated under many different labels, including subject extraposition (e.g. Quirk et al., 1985:1391, Biber et al., 1999:155; Herriman, 2000, 2013), the introductory it pattern (e.g. Francis, 1993; Groom, 2005; Larsson, forthcoming; Peacock, 2011; Romer, 2009 € ), the anticipatory it pattern (e.g. Adel, 2014 € ), it-clauses (Hewings & Hewings, 2002) and it-extraposition (Kaltenbock, 2005; Zhang, 2015 € ). Common to all approaches (some of which are more inclusive than others) is that the pattern is made up of an introductory it e which does not have anaphoric reference e a predicate, and a clausal subject. In the present study, the introductory it pattern is defined as comprising patterns with two subjects; the first is an introductory it that does not have anaphoric reference and the second is a nominal clause (including that-clauses, to-infinitive clauses, -ing clauses, and wh-clauses) (cf. Quirk et al., 1985:1391), as exemplified in (6), where the two subjects are italicized.

(6) It is likely that most adults know many of the terms [ … ]. (LOCRA_020-02)

This definition excludes tokens with adverbial clauses and tokens in which it is not an introductory subject, such as it clefts, referring it and empty it.

The classification system of the COBUILD grammars (Francis et al., 1996, 1998) was used to categorize all valid tokens. These grammars list a total of 45 different “patterns with it” (which in the present study are referred to as subpatterns of the introductory it pattern), as exemplified in Section 1.1 and in (7) and (8) below.

(7) it V that: [ … ] it seems that fluctuation in all the male quartiles is moderate. (ALEC_109)   
(8) it V n for n to-inf: It takes work for speakers and writersto stay for long [ … ]. (LOCRA_005-02)

Three of the 45 subpatterns were, however, excluded from the present study, since the clause following the predicate was adverbial (rather than nominal, as stipulated by the definition). Three of the remaining subpatterns were included with some restrictions: only non-conditional uses of $i f$ (where it could be exchanged for whether), as in (9), were included for the it $\mathbf { v }$ when/if, it V adj when/if and it V n when/if subpatterns.

(9) [ … ] it is not clear if their proficiency arose from their explicit knowledge, or vice versa. (LOCRA_017-01)

Conversely, a few subpatterns were added to the classification. Following the method of classification explained in Hunston and Francis (2000:32e35), a total of 16 subpatterns that were not attested in the COBUILD grammars were identified in the material used for the present study (see Appendix B for the full list). One potential explanation for the fact that these subpatterns were not included in the COBUILD grammars is that they are all very infrequent; another possible explanation could be that the corpora used in the present study are specialized corpora, exclusively focusing on academic English.

# 2.2.2. The retrieval and data management process

In order to extract the tokens from the corpora, WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2012) was used to find all occurrences of it and their immediate context, after which the list was gone through manually to exclude all invalid tokens (cf. Section 2.2.1). There were 1650 valid tokens in the expert data and 395 valid tokens in the much smaller set of learner data. Whereas a fully automated retrieval process (such as use of predetermined search strings) would certainly have been less time-consuming, the semiautomated process adopted in the present study has clear advantages in that it allows for the inclusion of, for example, tokens with many intervening elements. Another advantage is that the corpus does not have to be part-of-speech tagged.

While the extraction process as well as the marking up of predicate lemmas (cf. Section 2.2.3) and additional material (cf. Section 2.2.4) was carried out manually, the software environment R (R Development Core Team, 2008) was used to process the data and to summarize the frequencies. R was also used to test the differences for statistical significance using the Pearson Chi-squared test (for the categorical data), as well as the KruskaleWallis rank sum test on the medians of the frequencies. Furthermore, a log-rate generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted onto the results to test for statistical significance and to investigate whether there were any interacting predictors. This kind of regression analysis takes into account the fact that the size of the subcorpora differed considerably (Powers & Xie, 2000:154ff). The variance was also checked to make certain that any differences found were not due to individual preferences. When applicable, the frequencies were tested and mapped out through a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis, using the UCREL Clustertool (http://corpora.lancs.ac.uk/clustertool/index. php).

# 2.2.3. The predicate lemmas

As mentioned in the introduction, the base-form of the element inside the predicate of the introductory it pattern that carries the most semantic content was considered the predicate lemma. Since there was, for most tokens, more than one predicate-lemma candidate, the selection process used was as follows: the head adjective of a predicative adjective phrase6 was ranked higher than the head noun of any noun phrase, which in turn was ranked higher than the main verb; the highest ranked element was considered the predicate lemma. In example (10), for example, CLEAR is the predicate lemma, as it is ranked higher than the verb BECOME.

(10) [ … ] it becomes clear that there are countless thousands of other such titles [ … ]. (LOCRA_018-02) [bold face added]

Both adjectives and nouns, when present, arguably carry considerable semantic content in an introductory it pattern. Biber et al. (1999:673, 720) note, for example, that an adjective complemented by a to/that-clause is commonly used to mark stance/ attitude towards the clausal subject. In practice, however, predicative adjective phrases and noun phrases are typically mutually exclusive, which means that placing adjectives before nouns in the hierarchy mainly affects tokens which include an object complement; no such instances of the pattern were, however, found in the data. Tokens that contained two potential predicate lemmas that were ranked equally high, as in (11), were excluded from the analysis. Ten such instances were removed from the expert data and five instances were removed from the learner data.

(11) [ … ] it is thus legitimate and necessary to re-use the latter's description. (LOCRA_010-01) [bold face added]

Due to the great variety of adverbials possible, and due to the infrequency of subpatterns for which the adverbial is obligatory, adverbials are not viewed as predicate-lemma candidates; the main verb is instead considered the predicate lemma for these tokens. Furthermore, it is the lemma rather than the inflected form that is counted as a predicate lemma. This means that appear, appears, and appeared are all grouped under the lemma APPEAR; likewise, adjectives such as easy, easier, easiest are grouped under the lemma EASY. Moreover, tokens with prefixes, such as im- and un-, were grouped together with the corresponding unprefixed lexical item.

# 2.2.4. Additional features investigated

The additional features included to further investigate the degree of variability of the subpatterns are tense (an example of an instance with past tense is given in (12)), occurrence of modal verbs (13), negation (14) and optional adverbials, realized through prepositional phrases (15) or adverbs (16); bold face has been added. This list comprises the features that were not accounted for in the COBUILD classification but that were found in the data and that can occur in all of the subpatterns.

(12) It was necessary to select participants [ … ]. (LOCRA_004-04)   
(13) It can be noted that the client does not respond [ … ]. (LOCRA_010-02)7   
(14) [ … ] it does not matter what kind of accent/pronunciation you have. (ALEC_116)   
(15) It was difficult, at sentence level, to decide whether they were unfavorable or favorable. (ALEC_049)   
(16) It is thus natural to talk about ‘a terrible/awful bore’ [ … ]. (ALEC_083)

The category of negation encompasses instances of the introductory it pattern that include the negator not (cannot is also included), as in (14) above, or a negating prefix (im-, un-, in-, etc.), as in (17) below.

(17) Given this, it is inappropriate to consider (53) as exactly equivalent to (54). (LOCRA_021-03) [bold face added]

The very few instances that included both the negator not and a negating prefix (it is not impossible that, etc.) were not counted as being negated, on semantic grounds, as the two negating features in combination arguably cancel each other out and perform more of a hedging function than a negating function.

# 3. Results and discussion

The results of the investigation of the expert writing are presented and discussed in Section 3.1. These results are then compared to the results of the investigation of the learner writing in Section 3.2; this subsection also explores whether high-frequency, invariable subpatterns found in the expert writing seem to be more commonly found in the learner writing, as hypothesized.

# 3.1. Degree of variability of the subpatterns in expert writing

There were 43 different subpatterns of the introductory it pattern8 attested among the 1650 valid tokens found in the expert data, which concurs with previous studies emphasizing the versatile nature of the pattern (e.g. Thompson, 2009). The degree of variability of the most frequent of these tokens will now be investigated with respect to type-token ratios (Section 3.1.1), relative frequency of the predicate lemmas (Section 3.1.2), and the additional features described above (Section 3.1.3).

# 3.1.1. Type-token ratios

Type-token ratios provide us with important information about the degree of variability of each subpattern: the higher the type-token ratio, the more variable the subpattern. Fig. 1 shows the ten most frequent subpatterns and the corresponding number of different predicate lemmas per subpattern.

![](img/f9ef186fc78e63c7acab8f88717ed0e133c13aa2c0e924cc746d28f128d87f75.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Raw frequency of occurrence for each subpattern (dark-gray bars) paired with the number of different predicate lemmas for each subpattern (light-gray bars).

Here, two more general observations can be made about the token and type frequencies. First, in terms of token frequency, four patterns, it V ADJ to-inf, it V ADJ that, it be V-ed that and it V that, as in examples (18)e(21), stand out; together they account for 84 percent (1378/1650) of the total number of tokens.

(18) However, it is important to note that none of these models specifies how the reading system works [ … ]. (LOCRA_003-04)   
(19) [ … ] it is clear that there is variability [ … ]. (LOCRA_001-02)   
(20) It was found that MVLT was made up of six factors. (LOCRA_020-04)   
(21) Thus, it appears that the order of auxiliaries in PNJ is more rigid [ … ]. (LOCRA_010-03)

Because tokens with high frequencies contribute more to characterizing a given category than lower-frequency tokens (Ellis et al., 2013:33e34), these four subpatterns can be considered the most prototypical instances of the introductory it pattern. Second, it can be noted that the subpatterns containing adjectives generally exhibit relatively high type frequencies. It is of course the case that the choice of possible predicate lemmas is far less limited for these subpatterns than for some of the others, such as the it V that subpattern, as we shall see below.

Fig. 2 illustrates the type-token ratios; it shows how large a proportion of the total token frequency of each subpattern is made up of tokens belonging to different types with regard to what predicate lemma is included in the pattern. For example,15 percent (74/495) of the tokens belonging to the it V ADJ to-inf subpattern each belong to a different type; all the other tokens belong to a type that already has at least one member. Note, however, that the token frequencies vary considerably across the subtypes, which means that the results of any general comparisons of the type-token ratios should be treated with caution.

![](img/b2e54a2829247dd774e095eb74a0f55f56fc40462c12785145e54db98cd1ab2b.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Type-token ratios for the number of different predicate lemmas per subpattern.

As can be seen from the graph, the more frequent subpatterns generally have lower type-token ratios, which is an effect commonly noted in relation to this measurement (e.g. Richards, 1987). A likely explanation for this is that the subpatterns with the highest token ratios can be expected to be closer to the point where all the possible types are attested and where the ratios therefore go down as the token frequencies go up. Nonetheless, the low type-token ratios for the most frequent subpatterns may have resulted in the realizations belonging to these subpatterns being more salient and thus more easily learned, which is something that will be investigated in Section 3.2, where the results for the expert data are compared to the results for the learner data.

However, the effect described above would arguably predict that the it V that subpattern, as in (22), would have a higher type-token ratio than the three more frequent subpatterns. The fact that this is not the case then suggests that this subpattern exhibits an especially low degree of variability compared to the other subpatterns.

(22) Overall, it seems that a conceptualization of strategic behavior requires two stages [ … ]. (LOCRA_020-04)

As alluded to above, the low type-token ratio for this subpattern is likely to be due to the limited range of predicate lemmas possible, which is something that will be revisited in the next section.

# 3.1.2. The relative frequency of the predicate lemmas

Turning now to a more detailed investigation in which the relative frequencies of the predicate lemmas are also taken into account, we find that a small group of high-frequency predicate lemmas make up the bulk of the tokens for all frequent subpatterns. This is shown in the overview in Fig. 3.

![](img/3edc18cb2e83ffbb96f6c2e8d9082fb729bce42df748b276a35364ff9157d9f7.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Stacked bar graph showing the proportion of the predicate lemmas for each subpattern.

For the two most frequent subpatterns, it V ADJ to-inf and it $\mathbf { v }$ ADJ that, the five most frequent predicate lemmas (POSSIBLE, IMPORTANT, DIFFICULT, NECESSARY and USEFUL for it V ADJ to-inf, and CLEAR, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, TRUE and SURPRISING for it V ADJ that) account for 63 percent (313/495) and 55 percent (216/393) of the tokens respectively. Similarly, despite the fact that the it be $\mathbf { \delta v } .$ -ed that subpattern has no fewer than 50 different predicate lemmas, the five most frequent ones (ARGUE, NOTE, ASSUME, SUGGEST and FIND) account for just over half of all the instances (154/300). This can be compared to the it $\mathbf { v }$ that subpattern, which has only eight different predicate lemmas, of which the four most frequent (SEEM, APPEAR, BE and FOLLOW) make up no less than 93 percent of all the instances (176/190).9

While the it V that subpattern, along with some of the less frequent subpatterns such as it V det N that and it V ADJ wh,10 shows an especially low degree of variability with regard to the relative frequencies of predicate lemmas, it is arguably the case that all the high-frequency subpatterns can be considered to exhibit a relatively low degree of variability in the sense that more than half of the instances are made up of five or fewer (i.e. a very small proportion) of all the predicate lemmas that occur in each subpattern. It may then be the case that realizations of the introductory it pattern that include high-frequency predicate lemmas are more likely to have been ingrained in the language enough to cause writers (and not just learner writers) to use that realization rather than a variant of it.

# 3.1.3. The additional features

The additional features (described in Section 2.2.4) account for a considerable amount of variability inside the introductory it pattern. About 28 percent (470/1650) of the tokens had prepositional phrases and/or adverbs inserted, and approximately 10 percent (161/1650) of the tokens were negated. Moreover, 19 percent (313/1650) had a modal verb in the verb group, and 22 percent (367/1650) of the tokens were in the past tense.11 These features thus clearly contribute to the pattern-internal variation of the introductory it pattern.

The results are summarized in Table 1. The relative frequencies for each subpattern are presented separately for tense and occurrence of prepositional phrases (PPs) or adverbs, negation and modal verbs. The average of these four columns is also included, along with the raw frequency of each subpattern. The three lowest frequencies for each column (low degree of variability) are bolded, and the cells with the three highest frequencies (high degree of variability) are shaded. The least frequent variable is used as the baseline (i.e. since past tense proved to be less frequent than present tense in the present study, past tense is used as the baseline for this table).

Table 1 Relative frequency per feature for the ten most frequent subpatterns.

While the subpatterns perform relatively similarly in the sense that all of them have an overall average that is below 50 percent, there are still noteworthy differences between the subpatterns. The distribution of the features provides important information about the lexicogrammatical preferences of each of the subpatterns. For example, while certain subpatterns, such as it V ADJ what/how, show a strong preference for negation (73 percent of the tokens were negated), others, such as it V that, showed a strong dispreference for negation (only 1 percent of the tokens were negated). One potential explanation for this dispreference is that the two most frequent predicate lemmas for the it V that category, SEEM and APPEAR, most often occur in a related construction when negated, namely it DO not SEEM/APPEAR as if. Two examples of these subpatterns with negation are shown in (23) and (24) respectively.

(23) It is not clear how to interpret the absence of a form [ … ]. (LOCRA_003-02) (24) [ … ] it does not follow that X and Y necessarily are in the HeC relation. (LOCRA_008-03)

All in all, with all three perspectives on variability taken into account, it is clear that there is a considerable range of variability among the subpatterns. With regard to the four most frequent subpatterns, it V that was found to be less variable than it VADJ toinf and it V ADJ that; it be $\mathbf { \delta v } .$ -ed that was found to be slightly more variable than the others. Furthermore, even though highfrequency realizations, such as it is important to and it seems that (the verbatim realizations have no less than 71 and 41 occurrences per million words respectively), exist, it is not the case that the subpatterns are made up solely of such realizations. If the aim is to investigate the full range of possible realizations of the introductory it pattern, there is a considerable degree of variability that needs to be accounted for, as has been shown. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to allow for the inclusion of tokens that exhibit a high degree of variability in a description of the introductory it pattern and other similar patterns.

# 3.2. Degree of variability of the subpatterns in learner writing

In the learner writing, there were 21 different subpatterns of the introductory it pattern, four of which are not included in the COBUILD grammars (see Appendix B), among a total of 395 valid tokens. In Section 3.2.1, the overall frequencies are compared across the learner and expert data; as above, the degree of variability is subsequently investigated from the perspectives of type-token ratios (3.2.2), the relative frequencies of the predicate lemmas (3.2.3) and the additional features (3.2.4).

3.2.1. Overall frequencies compared across learner and expert data

When the token frequencies are compared, we find that the learners make more frequent use of the introductory it pattern overall. With regard to the subpatterns, the same four subpatterns are the most frequent ones for the experts and learners alike (see Appendix C for an overview of the frequencies of occurrence); the only difference is that while it V ADJ that was found to be the second most frequent subpattern in the expert data, this position is held by it be V-ed that in the learner data. These four most frequent subpatterns make up no less than 92 percent (363/395) of the total number of tokens in the learner data, which can be compared to 84 percent (1378/1650) in the expert data; the difference is statistically significant.12 Due to the low frequencies for the less frequent subpatterns, the focus of this section will be on the four most frequent subpatterns.

If the experts' use of the pattern can be seen as influencing the learners' use, it is likely that this results in the most salient realizations of the introductory it pattern being overused by the learners (i.e. that subpatterns that exhibit high frequencies and low variability in expert writing could be expected to be even more frequent in learner writing due to their salience). Based on the results from the previous section, it V ADJ to-inf (e.g. it is interesting to see), it V ADJ that (e.g. it is possible that), it be $\mathbf { \delta V } .$ -ed that (e.g. it has been found that) and it $\mathbf { v }$ that (e.g. it seems that) are all potential candidates, because of their high frequency and relatively low degree of variability, even though the most frequent subpattern, it V ADJ to-inf, and the least variable subpattern, it V that, could be considered the most likely candidates. However, a comparison of the token frequencies of the four most frequent subpatterns shows that it V that is used almost equally frequently by the two groups, as can be seen in Fig. 4, which suggests that this subtype might not be subject to this kind of effect after all.

Fig. 4. Normalized frequencies for the four most frequent subpatterns in the learner and expert data. The asterisks mark level of statistical significance.

As can be seen, it is almost exclusively the it V ADJ to-inf and it be V-ed that subpatterns that account for the difference between the two groups. Judging from the high frequencies in the learner data of the most frequent subpattern in the expert data, it V ADJ to-inf, there seems to be a frequency effect in play for this subpattern (i.e. high-frequency items from the input are more easily accessed and thus more likely to be produced; cf. Ellis, 2013); this will be addressed in the subsequent subsections. Whether there could potentially be a frequency effect in play for it be V-ed that as well will be discussed in Section 3.2.3.

While the focus of this study is on the lexico-syntax of the pattern rather than the function of its use, a closer look at the results showed that functionally, the it V ADJ to-inf and it be V-ed that subpatterns are used similarly by the learners and the experts. For both groups, the main function of the it V ADJ to-inf subpattern is its use as an attitude marker (e.g. it is interesting to note; it is possible to claim). Although the it be V-ed that subpattern can function as a hedge (e.g. it might be suggested that) and as an emphatic (e.g. it should be stressed that), its most common function in both corpora was to make neutral statements, very often about current or previous findings (e.g. it has been found that). Furthermore, the vast majority of the tokens in both corpora lacked explicit attribution to a source of the claim made, which points to the importance of the pattern as a tool for depersonalizing claims made by the author him/herself (cf. Kaltenbock, 2005 € for a more detailed discussion).

It thus seems as if the main differences between the learners and the experts reside in frequencies, i.e. how often each of the groups uses the different subpatterns and what predicate lemmas are chosen, which is something that will be discussed further in the next subsection.

# 3.2.2. Type-token ratios

The type-token ratios for the most frequent subpatterns are provided in Fig. 5 below; the corresponding raw type frequencies for each subpattern can be found inside the bars. Compared to the expert data, the ratios are generally somewhat higher in the learner data, which is likely to be explained by the fact that the token frequencies are much lower than in the expert data, as these results are based on a smaller sample (cf. the discussion about the relation between token and type frequencies in Section 3.1.1, based on Richards, 1987).

![](img/e752bbf54e4800d3c1d9d909f683d56aadb2ba9e1bc5d8e7d5a323539ede03f0.jpg)  
Fig. 5. Type-token ratios for the number of different predicate lemmas per subpattern.

Unlike for the experts, the most frequently occurring subpattern, it V ADJ to-inf, is less variable even than it V that, which was the least variable subpattern in the expert data. Furthermore, if we can expect the type-token ratios to go down as the token frequencies go up, the type-token ratios for it V ADJ to-inf in the learner data could be expected to be higher than in the expert data, as the token frequencies are lower in the learner data; the fact that this is not the case (the ratios are the same) suggests that this subpattern is less variable in the learner writing than in the expert writing. It could then be the case that frequent exposure to specific variants of this subpattern might have resulted in the learners having learned these as wholes, which is something that will be investigated further in the next subsection.

3.2.3. The relative frequency of the predicate lemmas The predicate-lemma frequencies for each of the four most commonly occurring subpatterns across expert and learner   
writing are presented in Figs. 6e9 below.

Fig. 9. Line graph showing the normalized frequencies of each predicate lemma per subpattern in the expert data (dark gray) and learner data (light gray). The x axis displays each predicate lemma as a number, sorted by frequency in the learner data and then by frequency in the expert data.

The learners' use of the predicate lemmas differed significantly13 from the experts' use for three of the four subpatterns (the slight difference found between the groups for the it V that subpattern was not significant). With the exception of the it be $\mathbf { \delta v } .$ -ed that subpattern, the learners overuse the most frequent predicate lemma found in the expert data in all of the four most frequent subpatterns. The it V ADJ to-inf subpattern in particular distinguishes itself as the subpattern containing the most predicate lemmas that are not only very frequent in the expert data, but also notably overused by the learners. This may offer further support for the claim made in the previous subsection about certain high-frequency variants of the introductory it pattern having been learned as wholes.

A separate graph showing the most frequent predicate lemma for each subpattern in the expert writing compared to its frequency of occurrence in the learner writing (Fig. 10) illustrates the difference between the groups more clearly.

Fig. 10. Normalized frequency of occurrence of the most frequent predicate lemma for each subtype in the expert and learner data. The asterisks mark level of statistical significance.

Interestingly, there is a clear and statistically significant difference between the learners and the experts only for the most frequent predicate lemma of the most frequent subpattern, it V POSSIBLE to-inf. This not only suggests that input frequency does, in fact, seem to have an effect on learner writing, as argued by Ellis (2013:368e369), but furthermore supports the claim that learners have a tendency to cling to certain high-frequency structures and overuse them in their own writing, something that has, in previous studies, been referred to as a preference for lexical teddy bears (Hasselgren, 1994:256) or, in this case, lexicogrammatical teddy bears (Larsson, forthcoming).

By contrast, for the only other subpattern that was overused as a whole by the learners (cf. Section 3.2.1), it be V-ed that, the learners overuse virtually all predicate lemmas except for the most frequent one. In general, there does not seem to be any correlation between the experts' and the learners' use of this subpattern. These results do thus not support there being a frequency effect for it be $\mathbf { \delta v } .$ -ed that. The overuse of it be V-ed that on the learners' part could instead be due to the learners having a stronger preference for the passive voice in general, as found in previous research comparing learner writing (albeit not in a Swedish context) to expert writing (e.g. Hyland, 2002).

# 3.2.4. The additional features

The additional features for the learner data pattern very similarly to those in the expert data. Table 2 displays the relative frequencies of the features for the four most frequent subpatterns in the learner data ordered by average relative frequency. The lowest frequency for each column is bolded (low degree of variability); the highest frequency is shaded (high degree of variability).

Table 2 The relative frequency per feature for the most frequent subpatterns.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Subpattern (raw frequency)</td><td> PPs or adverbs addede</td><td> Negation added</td><td>Modal verbs added.</td><td>Past tense</td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><td>it V that (32)</td><td>0.12</td><td> 0.00</td><td>0.16</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>it V ADJ that (73)</td><td>0.34</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.04</td><td>0.07</td><td>0.13</td></tr><tr><td>it V ADJ to-inf (154)</td><td>0.20</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.17</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>it be V-ed that (104)</td><td>0.27</td><td>0.02</td><td>0.42</td><td>0.54</td><td>0.31</td></tr></table></body></html>

As with the expert data, the it be V-ed that subpattern has a higher average than the other high-frequency subpatterns. This is mainly due to the fact that this subpattern exhibits a high frequency of past tense tokens (as exemplified in (25)) and tokens that include modal verbs (26).

(25) It was argued that such dialogues had less successful communicative outcomes [ … ]. (ALEC_133) (26) Hypothetically it could be said that people with a greater need for social acceptance are more likely to accommodate [ … ]. (ALEC_088)

While it V that and it V ADJ that rank higher in the learner data than in the expert data, the overall average for the subpatterns investigated for both groups differs by only 0.02. There are thus only marginal differences, which suggests that the learners are able to successfully make use of the lexicogrammatical behavioral profile of the subpatterns, with regard to the features investigated. A cluster analysis carried out on these features confirms this, since all but one of the subpatterns pair up; the dendrogram is shown in Fig. 11. Following Gries & Otani (2010:131), the similarity measure used was Canberra, and the amalgamation rule used was Ward's method. The elements that behave most similarly with regard to the elements investigated cluster together; the higher up in the graph the tree branches, the more dissimilar the two branches are.

![](img/e730bebb291de4140687e5c90a0384a63e7de5b65dfb83c20e8937e3fe8c0f03.jpg)  
Fig. 11. Cluster dendrogram of the four most frequent subpatterns for all the features investigated across learner and expert writing.

The learners thus seem to be using the pattern largely in a target-like manner in this respect, unlike for the functions of use, as was found in Hewings & Hewings’ (2002) study investigating the use of the pattern in learner and expert data.

In sum, while the type-token ratios and the averages for the additional features did not vary considerably across the expert and learner data overall, differences between the groups were found when the relative frequencies of the predicate lemmas of the four most frequent subpatterns were compared. The it V ADJ to-inf subpattern, in particular, merits consideration; the subpattern was not only overused as a whole by the learners, but its most frequent predicate lemma, POSSIBLE, was also significantly overused by the learners. This seems to at least partially support the hypothesis that high-frequency subpatterns with a low degree of variability would be more frequent in the learner data. While a low degree of variability could potentially facilitate a frequency effect, it seems that frequency of occurrence plays a more important role, since the effect was found only for it V ADJ to-inf, which is very frequent in the expert data (in addition to exhibiting a relatively low degree of variability), and not for it $\mathbf { v }$ that, which is less frequent, but which is among the least variable subpatterns in the expert data.

# 4. Conclusion

This article has investigated the degree of variability of the introductory it pattern in academic writing. It furthermore explored whether the variability and/or frequency of certain subpatterns that are found in the expert writing are matched in the learner writing. Overall, there is a range of variability between the four most frequent subpatterns, with it V that generally being slightly less variable than it V ADJ to-inf and it V ADJ that, and with it be V-ed that being slightly more variable than the others. This is the case not only with regard to type-token ratios and relative frequencies of the predicate lemmas, but also with respect to the additional features investigated (such as occurrence of adverbials, modal verbs and negation). The distribution of these additional features across the subpatterns was far from arbitrary, with certain subpatterns showing a strong preference for a feature that other subpatterns show a strong dispreference for. This suggests that the subpatterns each have their own phraseology.

These four high-frequency subpatterns were found to be the most frequent ones in the learner data as well; in fact, the learners showed a significantly greater preference than the experts for these four, in relation to the other subpatterns. The degree of variability of the high-frequency subpatterns of the introductory it pattern did not differ considerably between the expert writing and the learner writing with respect to type-token ratios and the additional features, suggesting that the learners are proficient users of the pattern. However, the use of the introductory it pattern differed significantly between the groups with respect to the relative frequencies of the predicate lemmas for three out of the four high-frequency subpatterns; there was an especially large difference between the groups for the it V ADJ to-inf subpattern. The particularly high token frequency for this subpattern in the expert data makes it a likely candidate for a frequency effect (cf. Ellis, 2002), which would result in it being overused in the learner data. Since the learners overused both the subpattern as a whole and the most frequent predicate lemma (POSSIBLE) in comparison to the experts, it would seem as if there is, indeed, a frequency effect in play.

While the present study has investigated the degree of variability of the different subpatterns of the introductory it pattern, it remains for future investigations to explore whether a similar approach could be used for other constructions or patterns. Avenues for future research also include investigations of the variability of the different subpatterns of the introductory it pattern outside the academic realm. It is hoped that the present study can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this pattern, knowledge of which can for example be useful for grammars describing it in academic writing. Finally, the four subpatterns identified by the present study as being particularly frequent in academic writing would arguably be especially useful to focus on in the EAP classroom, as one way of helping students develop a successful academic persona.
