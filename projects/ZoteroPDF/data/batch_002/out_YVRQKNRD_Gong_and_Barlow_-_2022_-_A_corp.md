# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Research articles Macrostructure patterns Academic disciplines Large corpus-based study

This study investigates how the macrostructure patterns (MSPs) of research articles (RAs) are distributed across different disciplines. The investigation is based on the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus consisting of 76,835 RAs from 26 disciplines coming from Health Sciences (HS), Social Sciences and Humanities (SH), Life Sciences (LS), and Physical Sciences and Engineering (PE). In this study, we identify 72 salient patterns and show that a higher ratio of functional headings is found in HS, LS, and PE than in SH, which can be atributed, in part, to different emphases with respect to the knowledge mode and knower mode (Maton, 2009). In addition, we explore the connection between specific MSPs and particular fields. We also detail the wide distribution of the I_M_R_D pattern; it appears in the top 10 pattern list for 21 out of the 26 disciplines, and is particularly frequent in medical journals. In sum: this large corpus-based study provides a comprehensive picture of how MSPs vary across RAs from different disciplines and fields.

# 1. Introduction

Research articles (RAs) are a unique academic genre reconstructing disciplinary research activities (Swales, 1990, p. 175), and the reconstruction itelf i realised by following different macro structure patterns (MsPs). For example, many hard science disciplines follow the MRD structure (Inucton, Method, Rults, Dscussion). According to Kintsch and Van Dijk (1978, p.373), these sections reflect the schemata of RAs including the "schematic categories", which cover both the macrostructures and the function of each section. Being acquainted with discipline-specific MSPs will help to construct, deliver, and acquire disciplinary knowledge more efficiently (Hewings, 2006), as the MSP provides both RA writers and readers with a shared schema or framework to organise and processinformation. (Kintsch & Van Dijk, 1978; Ye, 2019). Moreover, according to Van Gog (2014), there are two types f signal that help people to perceive information: picture- and text-based signals. The former is ofen realised via devices such as arrows and colours, while the latter relies more on atention-gaining lexical resources. When scanning RAs, the reader can employ MSPs and headings asa type of tex-based signal, cueing reders on the location of sections of interest, thus essening their ognitive burden Jin et al., 2020; Van Gog, 2014).

RA MSPs and section headings are related to disciplinary knowledge-making. In early work on the epistemology of different disciplines, Bernstein (1999, p. 172) distinguished vertical and horizontal knowledge structures. The former, associated with the sciences, are abstract and based on an integrating code: the integration of knowledge to form general principles and theories (Bernstein, 199, p. 162). The atter tend to be assciated with the Humanties and Social ciences and \*onsis of a serie of specialised languages with specialised modes of interrogation and criteria for the construction and circulation of texts." Within horizontal knowledge structures, Bernstein (199, p.174) refersto weak grammars and strong grammars, and here grammar refers to the constraints on a particular discipline: the stronger the grammar, the heavier the restrictions on the scope of empirical investigation. According to Bernstein, examples of disciplines with strong grammar are Economics and parts of Psychology; disciplines with weak grammars are Sociology and Cultural Studies.

Following on from the work of Bernstein, (Maton 2000, 2007, 2009, 2014) describes disciplines in terms of knower structures in addition to knowledge structures. In this model, there are two types of structure, namely the knowledge mode and the knower mode. The former isrepresented more strongly by academic fields such as natural sciences in which the discursive practices highlight "explicit principles, sills and procedures" (Maton, 2009 p. 46). The knower mode, which is embodied more fully in fields such as the humanities, has a greater fous onatitudes, apttudes and dispositions (Maton, 2009 p.46). For example, the soft science disciline Psychology is thought to be a more knowledge mode-oriented discipline (Harper, 2008; Hood, 2013; Hu & Ca0, 2015; Madigan e al., 1995). Drawing on Maton's model, Hu and Cao (2015) noted that when compared to the other two social science disciplines, i., Applied inguistics and Education, Psychology RAs tend to use fewer "certain" metadiscourse markers such as boosters. They argued that the construction of the disciplinary knowledge in this discipline relies largely on the rigorous research procedure and methodology, diminishing the need for the writer to adopt rhetoricalstategie, such as the use of metadiscourse resources. Along similar lines we can surmise that the way in which scholars structure their RAs by the use of different section headings can,to some extet, reveal preferences in the construction of disciplinary knowledge.

The MSP of a RA is manifested by its section headings, of which there are two general types: functional headings (conventional & varied) and content headings (Yang & Allison, 2003; 2004). The conventional functional group refersto headings with relatively fixed forms such as Inroduction, Method, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. The varied functional group includes headings such as Findings and Data colection. The other type, as the name suggests, refers to headings based on specific research content, for instance, Computational model for the probe stage of fire suppression.

The first type has received the most attention, especially the IM RD pattern (Bruce, 1984; Hartley, 199; Swales, 1990). t i not known exacty when this patten was first inroduced, but according to Bruce (1984, p.5), it was used as format requirement in the British Medc Jounal because it reflects the accepted procedural pattern for most biomedical experiments which have fllowed what Heath (1970) calld the logical cycle of inductive inquiry'" This patern has been regarded as the standard format of RAs in biomedical studies since 1972, and more and more disciplines have adopted it (Pique-Angordans & Posteguill, 2006).

By and large, there are two strands of research related to MSPs: the first one concerns the investigation of language features in different sections of RAs based on IM R D or similar divisions, such as a lexical-grammatical analysis (e.g., Cao & Hu, 2014; Yang, 2013) and genre/move analysis (Cotos et al., 2017; Kanoksilapatham, 2015; Le & Harrington, 2015; Maswana et al., 2015; Moreno, 2021; Moreno & Swales, 2018; Nwogu, 1997; Stollr & Robinson, 2013; Swales, 1990; Tessuto, 2015). One of the most famous and influential studies is the Swales (1990) CARS model (Create a Research Space). Based on the IMR D pattern, Swales put forward this model in his investigation of English RAs, which in turn has made this pattern become even more visible and widely accepted in the genre and move studies.

The second line of research focuses on investigating the RA macrostructure i different setings (e.g., Jin et al., 2020; Kwan, 2017; Li & Ge, 2009; Lin & Evans, 2012; Tessuto, 2015; R.; Yang & Allison, 2003, 2004; Ye, 2019). Whil this ine of research has provided many insights into the I M RD paten, it is unclear whether i is the prototypical paten for all dsciplines s the IMRD does not always apply" (Kwan, 2017, p. 14). For example, the I M R D was "not the defining characteristic of the contemporary generic output published by the Law discipline (Tessuto, 2015, p. 14). Applied Linguistics can have several other salient sections such as Theoreticel Basis, Conclusio, and Pedagogic Implications (Yang & Alison, 2003, 2004). Information System has sections such as RM/H (Research Model/Hypotheses), P/RA (Problem/Requirements Analysis), RP (Research Paradigm) A (Artefact), and E (Evaluation) (Kwan, 2017) Economic can have sections labelled as Mechnisms, Application, and Rostess Jin et a., 2020). TheM Methd) setin is not ound in Computer Science RAs (Posteguillo, 199). The I LM R&D_C pattern is used more frequently than the IMR D pattern in Social Sciences and the Humanities, Applied Linguistics, and Engineering (Lin & Evans, 2012). Finally, we can note that the IM_ R&DC is the most dominant pattern in Energy Engineering (Ye, 2019).

Our study, which belongs to the second type, aims to overcome some of the limitations of previous research, namely, relatively small corpora and a narrow range of isciplines investigated. As shown in Table 1, the corpora used in previous research range from 20 to 433 RAs. Although there are a total of 433 RAs in Lin and Evans (2012)'s corpus, the maximum number of RA investigated per discipline is only 19. And in terms of the range of disciplines, many typical hard and soft ciences, for example, Chemistry and Psychology, are not included. Following Ye' proposal (2019, p.50) that the RA macrostructure of any particular aea should not be taken for granted without systematic investigation of a considerably large number of representative texts in this area', in this study, we investigate a wide range of disciplines, making use of a very large corpus: the Elsevier OA $\mathrm { C C ^ { - B Y ^ { 2 } } }$ corpus (Kershaw, 2020).

The procedure for categorising and coding headings varies considerably in previous studies. For example, some varied functional headings describing research methods (e.g., Experimental, Experimental procedure) were coded as the independent E section by Ye (2019), while Lin and Evans (2012) asigned them to the M section. Moreover, Resuls and discusion was regarded as a sub-form of the R section by Yang and Allison (2004) and Kwan (2017); however, in and Evans (2012) and Ye (2019)treate i as a unique RD section.

Additionall, Lin and Evans (2012) put whatever occurs between the Introduction and Methods sections into the L section (Literate review) while Kwan (2017) only put Literature rview, Prior research, Related studies, and Theory-sections in L. In contrast, the theory related sections were coded as an independent T section by Ye (2019). Although there are some advantages in adopting superordinate categories, in our study we adopt adifferent strategy. We use a data-driven bottom-up methodology to investigate the use of section headings in RAs and address the following three research questions:

RQ1. What is the relative frequency of the functional headings and content headings in each of the four fields (Health Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, Life Sciences, and Physical Sciences)?

RQ2. What are the most salient MsPs in the four fields?

# RQ3. How are the MsPs distributed among the four fields?

Here are some signposts for the remainder of this article: section 2 introduces the methodology for the study. Section 3 reports the quantitative results of corpus analysis corresponding to the three reseach questions. Section 4 compares our findings with that of other research, and further explores some important MSP features from the perspective of knowledge delivery and disciplinary culture. Finally, this article concludes in section 5 with a discussion of some implications and limitations.

# 2. Method

As shown in Fig 1, there are four phases in this study: 1) processing the Elsevier corpus and extracting the raw headings, 2) cleaning the headings, 3) determining heading types and extracting heading patterns, and 4) data analysis. These steps were realised mostly by the use of Python scripts written by the first author. In this section, we willintroduce the first three steps in detail.

# 2.1. Processing the Elsevier OA CC-BY corpus and extracting raw headings

This corpus contains 4001 open access RAs, but in some cases an RAis coded as belonging to more than one iscipline. Rather than try to select asingle discipline for each RA, we fllow the structure of the corpus and allow the same RA to be listed under different disciplines, which yields atotal of 76, 835 coded RAs from 26 disciplines published from 2014 to 2020 in four broad fields (Physical Sciences and Engineering (PE), Life Sciences (LS), Health Sciences (HS), and Social Sciences & Humanities (SH) (see Table 2). A consequence f this is that the differences among the academic disciplines reported here is lessthan it would be if each RA were assigned to one discipline. This corpus was compiled and balanced by fllowing astratified sampling approach to equall represent all the disciplines published by Elsevier (Kershaw, 2020). This corpus contains individual RAs in JS0N (JavaScript Object Notation) format, in which the metadata and the main text are organised in the form of name and value pairs. The corpus does not consis of a sequence of artce; rather, it contains a set of sentences (not in discourse order) and embedded within each sentence is metadata such as section id, setion tite, etc. Basd on this structure, we used ython scripts to read and extract the raw heading from each RA JSON file.

# 2.2. Cleaning headings

The raw headings were first lowercased and lemmatised with the help of spaCy (e.g., Methods, Method - $>$ method; $D a t a \cdot >$ datum). By following this procedure, the headings were unified to a certain degree. Some sections such as Author's contribution, Conflict of interest, and Disclaimer are ancillary sections and are excluded from the analysis. These ancillary sections usually appear at the end of the RA and soto identify them, we extracted the last three sections of each RA (see Appendix 2) and generated the following identifiers of ancillary headings:

The headings containing one of the above items were taken to be ancillary and were deleted.

# 2.3. Determining heading types

As mentioned above, there are two types of headings: functional and content. We assume that the functional headings contain set words or phrases such as Introduction, Background, and Data analysis. We wrote a Python script tocollect and count all the cleaned headings in the corpus to see what typical functional headings were present. We then extracted the top 100 headings from allthe collected cleaned headings (see Appendix 1). By observing these top 100 headings, we further shortisted those typical functional headings and formed the following list (see Appendix 4 for the complete functional heading list):

[introduction', objective, hypothesis, literature', background', theory', 'context', 'method', 'material, 'methodology', 'datum', 'experimental', 'experiment, result, finding, discussion', interpretation', 'analysis', 'conclusion', summary', limitation', 'model' ...

Similar t the procedure outlined in 2.2, we wrote a Python script to compare the items in this list with the cleaned raw headings. f a raw heading matched one in the functional heading list then it was marked as function heading; if not, then it was marked as content heading (see Table 3 for examples). Finally, we counted each type and obtained the frequency of functional and content headings in each discipline (see Table 4).7

# 2.4. Extracting heading patterns

As noted above, in this study the patterns for headings were extracted in a completely bottom-up manner, with no pre-set cate gories. This method allows us to avoid oversimplifying the MSP naming,. For example, previous research following pre-set categories might name ll the method-related sections such as Material & Methods, StarM, and Experiment as M, but our approach keeps these headings separate. Hence, instead of ending up with a single MSP such as I_M_R D, we can obtain a more precise and diverse set: I_M&M_R_D, I_Exp_R&D, and I_R_D_StarM.

To achieve this outcome, the top 100functional headings were firtly extracted to form the initial abbreviation list. Second, the cleaned headings were replaced with the abbreviations. The relevant abbreviations were then concatenated to yield the MSP for each RA (ee Fig. 2 for an example). If a word is found in the heading that a i not in the abreviation list and b) appears in the top 10 most frequent patterns of a disciline (.g, the word soft in comp), it is adeto the list and th ython crit are run again t crate anew abbreviation list (see Appendix 3).

Finall, the patterns of headings for each discipline were counted and the results were analysed. The first two research question were addressed by comparing the relative frequency of diffrent sections and MSP patterns at the disciline and field levels. However, to answer the third research question, we need a more advanced yet manageable approach to frame the complex relationship between various patterns, disciplines, and fields. We achieved this by employing a corrspondence analysis (CA), which measures the chisquare distance between different variables from the different categories. The CA enables us to project the relationships among the categories onto a reduced two-dimensional (x and y axis) correspondence plot (Brezina, 2018, p. 200). By observing the clustering of groups of ifferent patterns and their rlationship to fields in the lot, weotain avisualisation of the asociation btween patterns and fields. The CA in this study was performed by the FactoMineR package in R.

# 3. Results

In this section, we comment on the ratio of functional and content headings in the four fields, and we analyse how different MSPs are distributed across and within field. Additionll, we explore the distribution of the I M RD pattern and other patterns that follow a less common ordering of sections.

# 3.1. The percentage of the functional and content headings in each field

As suggested in the introduction, the knowledge-knower mode of a discipline can be reflected in the percentage of functional and content headings. The higher the ratio of functional headings is, the closer the discipline inclines to a knowledge mode. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 3, the overwhelming majority of headings in each field are functional heading. Among the four felds, the proportion of functional headings in HS, LS, and PE is around $8 2 \%$ while that of sH is about $7 6 \%$ (see Fig. 3). When it comes to individual disciplines, the percentage of functional heading in most disciplines is greater than $8 0 \%$ (17 out pf 26 disciplines). The highest percentage of functional headings is found in CHEM $( 8 6 . 9 2 \% )$ and the least is in ECON $( 7 2 . 7 \% )$ (See Table 4).

# 3.2. Pattern distribution across the four broad fields

Afer selecting the top 10 patterns in each discipline, we obtained 72 unique pattern types, which were coded as p1 to p72 (see

le 5). The frequency of each pattern in a discipline has been normalised to n per 100 RAs.

Fig. 3 shows the result of a correspondence analysis (CA) revealing how the 72 patterns are istributed acros HS, H, PE, and LS $( p$ $= 0 . 0 0 0 < 0 . 0 1$ $\mathrm { d } 1 = 5 1 . 7 6 \%$ $\mathrm { d } 2 = 3 0 . 3 1 \%$ $\mathbf { d } 3 = 1 7 . 9 3 \%$ . As can be seen in Fig. 3, the patterns cluster into three main groupings made up of HS & $\mathrm { { S H } ^ { 1 0 } }$ , PE and Ls. This clustering reveals the strong association between the pattern type and the field.

The CA can be used to asses the relationship between patterns and fields the closer the pattern and field are located to each other, the stronger their association. Thus, we can rank theattraction of diffeent pattens to each field. More spcificall, the top 3 patterns for HS are IM_R D (p56), IM RD_C (p16), and MDet (p30); for SH, they are IM_R D_C (p16), I_M_R_D (p56), and I_R&D_C ExpSec

Changing perspective, we see that the top patterns occupying a central position on the graph are I Mat&M_R D_C (p9), I M_R D&C (p43), and M R D (p67), suggesting that I Mat&M R D_C (p9) is the most evenly distributed pattern across the four fields. This tendency can be further seen in Table 6 where p9 has a high-ranking pattern in all the fields.

As shown in Fig. 4, the section heading patterns vary in their istribution within the diffrent PE disciplines. For example, p17,p3, and p9 are found in al the nine PE disciplines, whereas some patterns are restricted to certain disciplines.

Unlike the distribution in PE, the LS disciplines have more shared patterns (see Fig.5). For example, p4, p9, p56, and p16 occur in all five disciplines in LS. BI0C has two unique patterns (p35, p30), NEUR has three (p19, p29, p58), ENVI has three (p33, p43, p37), and AGRI has one (p7).

# 3.3.3. Patterns in HS disciplines

As displayed in Fig.6, p4, p56, and p16 appear i all six HS disciplines. P9 and p17 appear i five disciplines. When it comes to the unique patterns in HS, VETE has four (p64, p41, p12, p3); DENT has six (p34, p26, p19, p11, p6, p18); PHAR has five (p72, p36, p69, p45, p35); HEAL has five (p30, p55, p60, p71, p48); MEDI has four (p67, p52, p40, p23); NURS has three (p2, p28, p20.

# 3.3.4. Patterns in SH disciplines

P16, p56, and p9 appear in allsix SH disciplines (se Fig. 7). Another four patterns show up i four disciplines in this field: p3, p17, p4, and p37. DECI has the largest number of unique patterns (fie: p48, 13, p21, p65, p68), fllowed by PSYC and BUsI, both of which have three (p67, p2, p64; p44, p53, p24). EC0N has two (p42, p70), whereas SOCI and ARTS only have one (p43, p20 respectively).

# 3.4. The I_M_R_D pattern in the corpus

In the previous section, we have visualised the distribution of dfferent section headings at the field level. We turn now to examine the distribution of the IM RD pattern, in particular. As shown i Fig. 4, IM RD (p56) is situated closest to HS, followed by SH and then more stantly by LS, and PE This shows that I MR is not distributed evenly acros the four fields, and is closely asociated with HS (55.91/100 RAs), follwed by SH (42.62/100 RAs), LS (22.75/100 RAs), and PE (6.34/100 RAs).

To figure out its distriution at the discipline level, we listall the disciplines having I M_R D (p56) in Table 7. The five disciplines in which I M R D occurs in more than 10/100 RAs are PSYC (22.83/100 RAs), MEDI (16.73/100 RAs), VETE (14.55/100 RAs), NURS (13.55/100 RAs), and ARTS (11.14/100 RAs).

# 3.5. Alternative MSPs

Unlike the conventional order of I, M, R, and D, some patterns follow a different organisational tructure in that the method-related section is positioned at the end of the article and the result section follows the Introduction (see Table 8). Examples of this kind of alternative MSP include I_R_D_M (p99) and I_R_D_ExpPro (p40).

Interestingly, as shown previously in Table 5, 34 paterns have the standard-M heading to indicate method-related content, whereas the other 38 patterns exhibit variant patterns, such as Mat&M (material and method), Exp (experiment), ExpM (experimentl method), StarM, et. These alternative M headings are more specific and illustrative than the standard M heading. Moreover, they are only found in the hard science disciplines (PE, LS, and HS) (see Table 8).

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Why are there more functional headings than content headings?

In this study we have examined academic writing in diffrent disciplines, not by looking at phraseology (Cortes, 2013; Peacock 2011) nor move structure (Basturkmen, 2012; Le, 2020; Stollr & Robinson, 2013), but by examining the conventions for labelling sections in RAs: the macro structures for transmitting knowledge. Following the established common distinction made between functional and content headings, we can suggest that the functional headings represent more unified and standardised descriptions of research procedures, whil the content headings reflect more flexible and customised approaches. As discussed in the ntroduction, this distinction can be used to positiondfferent fields and disciplines on the spectrum of knowledge and knower mode through the ranking of their proportion of functional headings. Interestingly, in our study, Psychology is the most knowledge mode-oriented social science discipline, as indicated by the proportion of functional headings. As shown in Table 4, Psychology stands out from the SH field by its highest percentage of functional headings $( 8 1 . 8 1 \% )$ . However, if we look at the proportion of functional headings across fields and disciplines, we find that for th fields, the main discernible difference in terms of knower-knowledge structure is between SH and the other three fields (ignoring Computer Science and Math in PE). At the field level, the proportion of functional headings in the hard sciences (HS, LS, and PE) is around $8 2 \%$ , whereas that of the SH is about $7 6 \%$ . Given this, we may conclude that the ratio of functional and content headings is correlated to some extent with the knowledge-knower continum within academic disciplines. The results discussed above pertain to a general trend, but it is also evident that there is considerable variation in the proportion of the different kinds of headings within each field. We explore this issue further in section 4.3.

# 4.2. How dominant is the I_M_R_D pattern?

IM R D (p56) is a typical pattern in organising RAs, but there are also some commonly seen variations. In some cases, R and D are combined as R&D, which is used to comment on the results immediately afer they are reported. The C section can be either an independent section or concatenated with the D section (D&C). In this study, we have found these typical variations, as wellas, for example, I_M_R&D_C (p3), I_M_R_D_C (p16), and I_M_R_D&C (p43).

Previous studies have shown that I M R D (p56) should not be taken to be the most frequent pattern in alldiciplines (Kwan, 2017; Lin & Evans, 2012; Tessuto, 2015; Ye, 2019). For example, Lin and Evans (2012) claimed that I M R D was actually limited to a narrow range of disciplines, and Ye (2019) did not even find any exact instances of the I M_R D pattern in her corpus of Energy Engineering. However, we find in our corpus that IM_RD is widely used in most disciplines but with different degree of frequency (as shown in Table 7).

When it comes to specific disciplines, the results from the present study diverge somewhat from the findings reported in the literature. For example, Lin and Evans (2012) found that IL M R&DC rather than I M R D was the dominant pattern in SH and ENGI, which is only partly in line with our findings. While IM RD ranks 1st in SH in our corpus, it only ranks 7th in ENG (1.49/100 RAs). For ENGI, I Mat&M R&D_C (p17, 5.64/100 RAs) is the top pattern. Ye (2019) found that I M R&D_C (p3) was the most frequent pattern in Energy Engineering. We do not have exactly the same disciplines in our corpus. We have ENER and ENGI and in these two disciplines, IMat&M R&D_C (p17) takes the top position. This discrepancy in findings is due in part to the diferent coding scheme used by Ye (2019) since in her study, Theory, Experimental and Methods were all coded as M, whereas we coded them separately.

In our corpus, I M_R_D was most frequently used in the HS field (55.91/100 RAs), and within this field, it was primarily seen in MEDI (16.73/100 RAs), as shown in Table 7. It has been suggested that this preference could date back to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CsRT) released in 1994 by the Standards of Reporting Trials Group (Pique-Angordans & Posteguill, 2006). To reduce \*the lack of adequate reporting" and to give \*complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings to the readers in medical research, the CsRT statement suggests that when reporting randomised controlle trials, the essential information could be provided under these sections: Title and Abstract, Inroduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Other information (see Schulz et al. (2010, p. 689) for the CONsoORT 2010 checklist). This influential document has enhanced the uptake of IM R_D and facilitated the wide use of this pattern in MEDI and related areas (Pique-Angordans & Posteguillo, 2006).

The disparity between the description of IM_R D distrbution in the current study and in previous research could be due to dif ferences in corpus range, corpus size and methodology. One factor that may partl explain the disparity between our findings and those of Lin and Evans (2012) is that they only selected the empirical study RAs and excluded the theoretical study RAs; we did not make that distinction.

The number of RAs in the present study is more than 70,00, while that of Lin and Evans (2012) is 433. As for the range of disciplines, the current study covers four fields and 26 disciplines, which is much broader than most previous studies (see Table 1). Lin and Evans (2012) examined 39 disciplines, but with only 1-9 RAs per discipline. The size and range of the corpus used in the present study provide some confidence in the validit of the results and allow the detection of nuanced section heading pattrns across disciplines.

In the process of categorising sections, some previous studies have opted to use general, superordinate categories. For example, in Lin and Evans (2012)'s ground-breaking study, Experimental was coded as M (Method), and whateverocurred between the Intro duction and Method was coded as LR (Literature Review). There are some advantages to this classfication system, but some patterns, such as I Exp_ R&D (p25) wil be overlooked. Conversely, using uperordinate categories will oversate the frequency of some patterns. For example, Literature Review was not widely used in the top 72 patterns as it is only found in I_LitRev Dat&M_EmpR_C (p42) and 1_LitRev M R D_C (p44). To recap the inductive method used in the current study: we used python scripts to detect sections and then we concatenated the section abbreviations to yield a pattern for the whole RA.

To sum up, contrary to findings of previous research that IM R D was confined to a narrow range of disciplines (Lin & Evans, 2012), our results show that MR D is a widely used pattern in a wide range of disciplines, with different degree of use according to the discipline. It is mostly seen in HS, followed by SH, LS, and PE.

# 4.3. MSPs and disciplinary culture

Hyland (2000 p.11)'s suggestion that \*the rhetorical conventions of each text will relect something of the epistemological and social assumptions of the author's disciplinary culture' highlights the range of potential influences at play. Ye (2019) for instance. compared RAs written by Chinese and western scholars and suggested that differences in MSPs could be due to diffrent ways of thinking. Besides being influenced by cultural differences, MSPs will reflc the specific methodology and epistemology that each disciplinary community uses to approach relevant research questions (Kwan, 2017).

Previous research showing that different disciplines tend to have different MSP preferences (e.g., Kwan, 2017; Lin & Evans, 2012) is confirmed in some dtail in the currnt study. Some section patterns are particularly distinctive and are etricted to single disciline. For example, Mot&SigSofDes[lExa_ImpaC (p51, 2.4/100 RAs), Mot&SigSofDes_ImpaC, (p14, 0.57/100 RAs), and Mot&Sig SofDes IllExa Impa&C (p32, 0.37/100 RAs) were only found in the COMP top 10 pattern list Similar sections such as Pre liminaries, Algorithm, and Analysi f a system or program were noted in Posteguillo (1999)'s investigation of 40 COMP RAs. These patterns reflect the distinctive problem-solving and knowledge-creating paradigms of Computer Science.

Additionally, I Mod C (p70) was only found in the top 10 patterns of EcON, a result that partly aligns with Jin et al. (2020)'s finding that the sections Theoretical Model and Econometric Model are characteristic of the discipline. According to interviews with informants, these two model sections are typically adopted in the top research papers in EcON. The former is used to "propose hypotheses to be tested in following sections" and to \*provide a mathematical decription of a phenomenon; the later is used to \*show that the study used the right econometric model" and to "empirically test a theoretical model' (Jin et al., 2020, p. 237.

Maton (2000) emphasised the social role in addition to the knowledge role and hence we might look to the influence of academics working within their ommunities of practice, which willtypically be narrower than disciplines. For any particular researcher, aca demic work is likely to revolve around a handful of journals and conferences and this naturally leads to an interaction in both directions betwen the macro-structure of the core journals and the research practices of the researcher. As noted in Becher (1981), each sub-field has is own set of norms, and while these relat to the broad epistemological approaches discussed above, social and histrical trends play an important role in setting the conventions within the discipline and sub-discipline. And here the influence of individual journals is very important in determining norms for the reporting of research. The requirements of particular journals reflect and reinforce a set of norms. Some norms may be based on practice and not explicitly articulated, while others, especially in relation to writing and publication are more likely to be explicit. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (2009), for example, explicitly list the sections Introduction, Method, Results, and Discussion in the chapter on manuscript structure and content The APA guidelines are influential in the Humanities and Social Sciences and are followed by a wide range of journals. As another example, the author's guide for the journal Englis for Specific Purposes, itemises the section headings as Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, (alternatively a combined Results/Discussion), and Conclusion. Within the Humanitie, some journals such as the Modern Language Jounal, follow APA guidelines; others, such as Philosophical Studies, do not specify a particular set of headings and only prescribe formatting requirements. Similarly, the IEEE Jounal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Enginers) does not dictate a set of headings, and only refers to the form of primary and secondary headings.

Another important influence on MSPs is the introduction of protocols for the description of research procedures. An example is the StarM convention, originally STAR $\star$ Methods, which is related to the STAR protocol initiated by the Cell Press in 2016 (Marcus, 2016). According to Marcus (2016, p. 1059), the particulars of the research method in Health and Life Sciences were often not described in sufficient detail. He notes (ibid, p. 1059) that \*traditionally, methods sections are ofte abreviated for space and presented with ittle or no consistent organisation across papers. The Method was often situated at the end of the RA and may simply be rendered as \*as described in' other studies: In this case, readers would need to check the references themselves to find the experimental details. To address thee isues and improve the rigorousness transparency, and reproducibilit of research, the Cell Press proposed the STAR method protocol, ie., "Structured, Transparent, Accesible Reporting. This protocol proposes a format for structuring the method section, including elements such as Key resources table, Contact for reagent and resource sharing, Experimental model and subject detail, Method detail, Quantication and statistical analysis and Data and software avalability (see Zhao et al. (2017) for an example). In our study, this protocol was fllowed in some RAs in HS (IMMU, BIOC, NEUR, AGRI) and LS (MEDI, PHAR) disciplines. Another detailed protocol is cONsoRr 2010 (Schulz et al., 2010). As shown in Schulz et al. (2010, p. 699), this set of guidelines sugests that researchers need to report Trialdesign, Particiants, Interventions, Outcomes, Sample size, Randomisation, Sequence generation, Allocation concealment mechanism, Implementation, Blinding, and Statistical methods where appropriate in the method section.

These two types of method sections based on the starM and CONsoRT protocols differ from the more conventional method sections in that they reflect a particular explicit codification associated with a disciplinary paradigm. This kind of codification is most likely to be restricted to the hard sciences with their tandardised rerch procedures rather than the sot sciences such as the Humanties. Such protocols tend to have an influence on the relevant fields even if the codes are not strictly followed.

It is clear that a single MSP cannot represent a whole discipline (e., Kwan, 2017; Lin & Evans, 2012), but we can identify relatively strong associated patterns for each field. The large data set used in this study makes it feasible to carry out multidimensional scaling techniques such as a correspondence analysi to produce a visual representation of the distinctions among fields and the link between particular pattes and specific fids. As shown in ig. 3,ths analss shows ht intting frquency datfr ctionhding leads to three distinct groupings corresponding to HS-SH, PE and LS. (The reasons for the closeness of HS and LS are not explored here.) The correspondence analysis also reveals the strong connection betwen individual patterns and particular fields. For example, IMR D (p56) for HS, IM RD_C (p16) for SH, I M R&D_C (p3) for PE, and I Mat&M_R&D (p41) for LS. Hence, we may conclude that the patterning of section headings i associated with a particular field and that the three groupings represent three \*different views of knowledge, different research practce, and different ways of seeing the world" (Hyland, 2002, p. 389). The fact that I Mat&M_R_D_C (p9) is situated in the centre of the biplot suggests that i is the most evenly distributed pattern acros the four fields.

It has been suggested that the order of sections reflects preferences for the way disciplinary knowledge is delivered (Cargill O'Connor, 209; Kwan, 2017; Lin & Evans, 2012). For example, Cargill and O'Connor (2009) noted that IR D_M (p23) tended to appear frequently in two prestigious hard science journals: Natre and Science. They suggested that this ordering helped to prioritise and focus on new research findings.

We also observed in our corpus that IR D_M appears in the hard science discipline MEDI (1.07/100 RAs). Furthermore, we found this kind of M-final patten only occur in the hard science felds: HS, LS, and PE (ee Table 8). This trend may be attributed to the fact that the methods in the hard science disciplines tend to have fixed and standardised research procedures, whereas the methods used in the soft sciences are often more flexible and are much more topic-dependent. Hence, readers in the hard science communities may focus primarily on the results and may even be able to deduce the general characteristics of the method from the results.

There is some variation in the use of M-final patterns within the hard science disciplines. As shown in Table 8, PHAR has the highest diversty with five pattern types. In contrast, most other disciplines have fewer than three types. In adition, when compared with the overall patterns, most of theseM-final patterns are also the dominant patterns i each disciline. For example, the fiveM-final ones in PHAR are also found to be the top patterns in the discipline. This feature shows that the way of framing disciplinary knowledge in each discipline is more nuanced and specific than we might have expected, and this relates to the influence of acommunity of practice in disciplines and sub-disciplines.

The findings in the current study confirm, in some detail, Hyland's (2002) discussion of the context of ESP, in which he sressed the necessty and importance of ivolving pecific disiplinary norms into pedagogical practice in ESP. Similarl, He (2002) argues that different disciplines deal with knowledge, reearch activities, and the world differentl, which again requires a specific approach to disciplinary practices. Accordingly, our description of MSPs provides one framework for analysing disciplinary knowledge in RAs.

# 5. Conclusion

This study investigated the distribution of MSPs in 26 disciplines from four broad fields based on a corpus made up of 76,835 RAs. Analysing a large, representative corpus from a variety of disciplines has enabled us to provide some insights into the nature of the RA genre. We have noted the higher ratio of functional headings in HS, LS, and PE compared with SH, which we suggested is due to different weightings of the knowledge and knower mode and to the development of different communities of practice. Second, 72 frequently used patterns were identified and their association with the four fields was analysed via a correspondence analysis, which revealed that each field has a relatively strong associated pattern and that patterns tended to cluster around certain fields. As found in other studies, the IM RD pattern is widely used in many disciplines. Our study has detailed its dominance from a high in PSCH (22.83/100 RAs) to a low in BUSI (0.4/100RAs).

The findings of this study have some implications for RA-based genre and move studies, lexical-grammatical studies, and academic writing and teaching. In the frst area, previous investigations often begin by dividing RAs into diffrent sections and these typically follow a basic I M R/D C pattern, as in Ye (2019), for example. As Kwan (2017) points out, it i important to pay atention to RAs with other MSPs. Another issue in this area is that itis often hard to distinguish ection boundaries, and as Le (2020) notes, some studies annotate different sections with a single lael. For instance, Material  Methods and Experimental Proceures may all be coded as Method (Kanoksilapatham, 2003); Discussion and other closing sections may all be coded as D (Moreno, 2021; Moreno & Swales, 2018) However, we have shown that sctions such as Material & Methods can participate i different macro patterns, which are distinctive in some disciplines. Furthermore, we need to entertain the possbility that sections such as Mat&M and ExpPro could have a move/step profile that differs from that of M. The resuts from our study, which are quite fine-grained, can also make a contribution to any EAP research that is based on different RA sections (e., in et a. 2020; Kerans et al., 2020; Omidan et al., 2021). For example, midian et al's (2021, p4) lexicogrammatical study used the insights of previous research to sample IMRD-structured RAs. Hence, our data can provide a more nuanced approach to EAP in terms of organisational structure.

Turning to pedagogy, we can note that EAP/ESP teachers typically face two problems: a lack of specialised subject knowledge and the need o ch tudents from  arity of different dicilie. Our stud provides techers with an overview of diffent discilinary paradigms in terms of Mss and section headings, as well as providing an account of the similaritie and differences acros fields and disciplines. This can be seen as a contribution to the development of field- and discipline-specific pedagogical materials and teaching activities that Hyland (2002) sees as vital in the teaching of academic writing. To give a specific example: EAP teachers may give explicit instruction on the MSPs or they may ask students to determine the macrostructure of RAs. In either case, our research can provide details on the common patterns. For example, for Economics, the main patterns are IMat&M_RD_C, IMRD_C, and 1 Mat&M R&D_C, in addition to 6 minor patterns. Some EAP teachers may take a different perspective and focus on a particular pattern, such as MRDC I this case, our reults can be used as a guide to the disciplines ollowing that structure o  greater or lesser extent (e.g., EART, ENVI, NURS) and also indicate which disciplines tend to do something different (e.g., MEDI which favours 1_R_D_StarM).

The bottom-up approach adopted in this study, while allowing arange of patterns to be captured, requires a large data set. Such a large-scale analysis obviously has some limitations in terms of the level of detail that can be achieved In addition, the Elsevier corpus consists of RAs from OA journals. OA does not necessarily mean low quality, because our sampleanalysis shows that many RAs in this corpus are from sCI/sscI journals, such as the Lancet series. Despite this, we do not expect each RA to be from a top journal in the relevant field, and this may lead to some discrepancies in comparison with the results reported in previous research studies. The metadata of this corpus does not provide any information about the research paradigm the RA follows, such as whether the research is based on experiments or whether any theoretical proofs have been presented. Including such parameters when performing the MSP analysis would be insightful and future studies based on large corpora may be able to achieve this by using advanced digital humanities methods such as machine learning.

In this study, the number of patterns has been normalised to $\mathbf { n } / 1 0 0$ RAs. However, due to the sampling procedure employed in the compilation of the corpus, the number of journals varies by discipline. Thus, we may have more confidence in the results from dis ciplines with high numbers of journals (e.g., Engineering) compared with those with fewer journals (e.g, Art). inall, we should acknowledge that the influence of the multidisciplinary nature of RAs in this corpus. For example, the SH and HS fields in the correspondence analysis were closely clustered, which may largely be due to the fact that in these two broad fields, there are many RAs share the same discipline afiliation. A more detailed analysis would be required to provide a principled explanation for the closeness of the two fields. However, a preliminary examination of aeection of articles in HS suggests that the topics covered have a stronger than expected focus on the social rather than medical aspects of health science.

Overall, we believe that this study has made some methodological contributions based on the use of Python scripts to perform a bottom-up analysis of a large number of RAs in a broad set of disciplines and has provided a set of findings that can be used to guide future research on MSPs.
