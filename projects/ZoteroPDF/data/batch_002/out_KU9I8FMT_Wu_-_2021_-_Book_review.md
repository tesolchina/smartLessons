Learner engagement is a construct that originated in educational psychology and the learning sciences and that, in the past few decades, has captured increased reeacher interes g. Ainley, Prat, & Hansen, 2006; kinner & Pitr, 2012) in topics ranging from broader school-level engagement to more specific subject-level engagement. However, only in recent years has this concept been explored in the domain of language teaching and learning and the importance of engagement to achieving optimal language learning outcomes revealed. This volume comes as a response to the need for further research about engagement and its role in language instructional contexts. It focuses on the research of engagement in the second or foreign language (L2) learning domains, either within or beyond the classroom, and aims to provide a fuller understanding of the construct.

The volume is divided into two main parts in addition to the introductory and concluding chapters. Part One comprises four chapters (Chapters 2 to 5), representing the theoretical llustration of the construct of engagement. The following nine chapters (Chapters 6 to 14) constitute Part Two and showcase empirical studies on how engagement may contribute to L2 learning and teaching in a variety of contexts. This does not mean, however, that we need to read the book in sequence. Although formulating a coherent collection as a whole, individual chapters are contributions by individual author(s) and are self-contained.

In Chapter 1, the editors provide an overview of the characteristics of engagement, its relatedness to L2 clsroom, and their motivation for compiling this volume, as well as an outline of the book's contents. They note that the primary feature of engagement is its focus on action, which distinguishes it from related constructs such as motivation. They acknowledge that engagement is situated and context-dependent across diverse timescales. For example, academic engagement at school level can be a long-term form of action that may function at a timescale of months or years, whereas task engagement at classroom level may cover just hours or minutes. They also conceptualise engagement as dynamic and mallable, which suggests that disengaged students can be motivated to become more engaged through well-constructed interventions and appropriate intrapersonal and contextual conditions.

In the first chapter of Part 1 (Chapter 2), Sang and Hier explore definitions and dimensions of engagement to provide a fuller picture of how leaners devote effort and attention to learning opportunities. They point out the main similarities and differences between engagement and investment. While they both relatto individuals actin; that is, L2 leaners (or lack of) behavioural endeavours, those Who are baviourally engaged i certain ing ativity may not e inestin i t, phaps buse theidnttes and bele conlict with the values of the learning contexts" (p. 30). They end the chapter by proposing an agenda for L2 engagement research which in. cludes focusing on the nature of and necessary conditions for engagement, the development of engagement over time, and re-engaging disengaged or disaffected learners to reveal the complex, dynamic nature of meaningful learner involvement in L2 classrooms.

In Chapter 3, the focus switches from the general construct of engagement to a more specific notion of engagement with language (EWL), and Svalberg relate engagement to certain affordances for learning in the classroom such as forms-versus meaning-focused teaching, consciousnes-raising tasks, and learners' use of the first language in clas. In doing so, the author provides an extended discussion of the relation of EWL to other types f engagement such as task engagement and the implications of EWL for language teaching and learning. Following ths Han and Gao synthesize recent rsearch in learner engagement with written corrective feedback (WCF) in Chapter 4. They highlight the stuated nature of learners engagement with WCF at both micro- and macro-level setings, and point out specific research avenues for further investigation. Zhou, Hiver and Al-Hoorie end Part One with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the measurement approaches adopted by L2 researchers. They acknowledge that current knowledge about the operationalisation and measurement of engagement lacks clarit, and cal for some novel approaches such as incorporating physiological markers. Given the considerable potential of engagement in researching topics surrounding language teaching and learning, this discussion of operational precision is crucial to ensuring that related analyses will be on firm ground.

The empirical research chapters in Part Two begin with Sulis and Philp's examination of the interdependence of learning envi. ronment and engagement in the language classrom in Chapter 6. Drawing on a framework of environmental complexity, their research reveals that both environmental chllenges and support, which comprise the combined influence of peers teachers, and tasks, are fundamental i shaping leaners engagement at various levels. The impact of the learning environment on learners' engagement is confirmed by Fukuda and colleagues in Chapter 10, which reveals that positive pr relationships i classrooms can increase students prosocial engagement or constructive participation in creating an ecology of learning that helps prs to learn better and enjoyably. As an integral component of the learning environment, task types have also been revealed as influential, in particular for the affective engagement in language classrooms, and this is the main contribution of Chapter 9. These three studies concening the relationship of learning environment and engagement are of profound significance for capturing the interrelatednes of the dfferent dimensions of learner engagement.

In addition to the learning environment, modern technologies and tols are also conducive to language learning. Thi is explored by Carver, Jung and Gurzynski-Weis (Chapter 7), who examine the effect of interaction mode, and whether face-to-face (FTF) or syn. chronous computer mediate communication (SCMC) influence learners cognitive, behavioural and afective engagement. Their main finding is that task-based interactions may facilitat the learning of task-esential vocabulary and structures, rrespective of engagement types or communication mode. Shifting to another technology-based approach, Mil (Chapter 11) reports on how immersion in a digital virtual relity (VR) platform can target alldimensions of engagement, and informs us of the role of intructional design in constructing a pedagogy of engagement. These two pieces of research have important implications in view of the increasingly diverse learning modalities featured in language classrooms worldwide.

Observation i one traditional way of studying classoom engagement. However,caution needs to be taken to avoid overreliance on this instrument, since t may be hard to distinguish between fake and genuine engagement This problem i discussed by Merer, Talbot and Wang in Chapter 8, who show that some students may consciously manipulate their behaviours to feign engagement for various reasons, such as to meet social expectations. This kind f resarch may sensitize teachers to the level of students engagement and help teachers cultivate true willingness to engage in language learning within or outside classroom contexts.

To date, the vital function of engagement has been widely acknowledged by teachers and researchers in the language education field. As the editors rightly point out, engagement can provide a broad landscape of how learners think, fee and act in language teaching and learning proceses. Empirical studie i this volume lend support to previous research that higher larner engagement is likely to bring about a number of positie ducational outcomes, including agreater academic effort and achevement Chase, Hilliad, Geldhof, Warren, & Lener, 2014), higher academic aspirations, and improved mental health (Archambault, Janosz, Fallu, & Pagani 2009). Such growing recognition of the significance of engagement has led to it exponential increase in popularity despite its relatively short history; howeve, some theoretical and empirical isues surrounding engagement stil need to be clarified. By involving both theoretical and empirical chapters, this book marks a start of this initiative and provides valuable information and advice for practitioners who want to develop their engagement strategies.

Taken together, the contributions of this volume indicate that engagement is a dynamic, multifaceted and contextualised construct involving notions such as cognition, afect, behaviours, and social interactions in which action is a requisite component. Since this i an edited volume, thereare some inevitable overlaps i the discussion of the definitions of engagement across the chapters, but overall, they present a comprehensive conceptualisation of engagement in relation to particular research contexts and learning subdomains. Although the editors may have intended to achieve a definitional consensus acros the volume with a view to enhancing coherence of engagement research in 2 contexts, the chapters in this volume actually exhibit crtain derefvariation in relation to what engagement means and how it can be applied in specific research contexts. However, the definitions have a number of elements in common, namely they all ee engagement as a type of action that is not only \*situated and context-dependent' (p. 2), but also dynamic and malleale" (p. 3).

Furthermore, the chapters of this book are coordinated in a reader-friendly way in that each chapter signposts clearly related conceptual or empiricl iustrations rfered to in other chapters, thus forming an interatedwhole. Dtailed questionnaires and other operationalised instruments are included at the end of empirical research chapters, and these provide n aesible way for readers to verify the results of the research or o replicate it in their specific contexts. Given the context-dependent and domain-specific nature of engagement, related research in other contexts or domains would be a worthwhile endeavour.

This selection of studies presents a rich and varied picture of engagement reearch in a diverse range of L2 teaching and leaning contexts. It involves English, French and Spanish L2 learning in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia Thailand and Japan. The content of a book is therefore likely to appeal to a wide audience in the fields of applied linguistics or educational psychology. In light of its integration of both theoretical clarification and empirical exemplification, both novice and seasoned researchers in related fields will find this book highly informative.
