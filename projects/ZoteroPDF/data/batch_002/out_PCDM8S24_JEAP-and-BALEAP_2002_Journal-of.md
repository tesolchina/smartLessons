# JEAP and BALEAP

BALEAP sends its good wishes for the new Journal of English for Academic Purposes. We are delighted to have established a formal link with the journal, and welcome it as a major contribution to the professional field of EAP.

BALEAP (the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes) is a national organisation of centres where EAP (English for Academic Purposes) is taught within British Universities. BALEAP was founded in 1972 and currently has over 70 institutional members. Individual associate membership is also available, with numbers growing rapidly. BALEAP’s key roles include the development of English language provision for international students in institutions of higher education in the UK, promoting and disseminating associated research, and continuing professional development for teachers. It does this through three main channels:

A biennial conference. The most recent was held at the University of Strathclyde with the theme ‘EAP: directions for the future’. A collection of selected conference papers will be published in 2002 edited by Dr Leslie Sheldon. The next conference will be held in March/April 2003. A selection of proceedings from all previous conferences has always been published as a thematic, edited volume. Professional issues meetings (PIMs). These are one-day mini-conferences held in member universities around themes of current interest. Topics for 2002 include accuracy in EAP, EAP methodology, and foundation courses. A research register, regularly updated, of EAP-related research in member institutions.

BALEAP is also committed to the sharing of good professional practice, particularly through its membership mailbase, for discussion and consultancy, and through its rigorous Accreditation Scheme.

Information on these activities can be found by using the links on our website at http://www.baleap.org.uk/
