# Introduction

As technology continues to evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly permeated various sectors, with its impact being particularly significant in the realm of education (Forcier, 2016). A key subfield of AI, generative artificial intelligence, has the ability to generate new content similar to the training data, such as text, images, music, and more (Wu et al., 2023). Within educational contexts, its potential applications are widely acknowledged. These include the development of personalized learning resources, the creation of tailored learning paths, and the establishment of simulated instructional scenarios, all of which can enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of learning (Xie et al., 2019).

Situational Interactive Teaching, a method that integrates learning content into specific situations and facilitates teaching through interactive activities, has been shown to enhance students’ interest in learning and their practical understanding, thereby improving the overall learning effect (Brown et al., 1989). However, traditional situational teaching often necessitates significant human, material, and temporal resources, making its large-scale implementation challenging (Lave & Wenger, 1991). The advent of Generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated its ability to rapidly generate highquality content and perform personalized generation (Herrington & Oliver, 2000), such as aligning knowledge points with scenario construction. This opens up new possibilities for Situational Interactive Teaching.

Situational Interactive Teaching, characterized by the use of simulated courtrooms, is prevalent in China’s legal education system (Dhar & Dhar, 2018). However, its application is constrained due to substantial costs and the difficulty in achieving personalized instruction (Wu & Wang, 2010; Q. Zhang, 2014). This study aims to investigate the potential benefits and impacts of utilizing generative artificial intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching within the context of Chinese legal education.

The term “flow” initially introduced by Csikszentmihalyi (1990), denotes a state of profound immersion and enjoyment an individual experiences when fully immersed in an activity. Within the educational sphere, attaining a mobile experience during the learning process is perceived as a hallmark of effective learning. This can potentially enhance learner motivation, engagement, and overall learning effect.

This study seeks to investigate the influence of generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive instruction on students’ “flow” experiences and learning effect. We have developed an intelligent legal situational teaching application, capable of generating educational scenarios that incorporate specific legal knowledge points and facilitate interactive learning activities. The primary aim of this research is to elucidate the role of this innovative teaching approach in enhancing students’ motivation and effectiveness in learning, thereby providing empirical evidence to support the continued development of educational technology.

# Literature review

# Situational interactive teaching

Situational interactive teaching, a pedagogical approach that contextualizes learning content within specific scenarios and facilitates guidance through interactive activities, can enhance the sense of practice and improve learning effect (Gregory et al., 2015; Smith & Loewen, 2018). This method’s theoretical underpinnings primarily derive from constructivism and experiential learning theory, underscoring the facilitation of learning via practice and experience. Guided by constructivism, situational interactive teaching can foster an environment that encourages learners to actively engage in knowledge acquisition. Meanwhile, the experiential learning theory underscores the promotion of deep learning through hands-on experience (Smith & Loewen, 2018).

Situational interactive teaching has been implemented across various disciplinary domains. In the realm of medical education, M. Yu and Ja Kang (2017) devised a role-playing simulation programme aimed at enhancing communication skills between nurses and physicians, as well as fostering these skills among nursing students. In the realm of physical education instruction, situational interactive teaching methodologies are employed to enhance students’ proficiency in badminton and their collaborative skills (Liu, 2016). In art education (Ma, 2014), this approach has been utilized to augment students’ modern dance creativity and their artistic appreciation through innovative activities and hands-on workshops.

The utilization of a simulated court within the realm of legal education exemplifies a quintessential application of situational interactive pedagogy. This approach not only augments students’ comprehension of legal tenets but also bolsters their argumentative prowess by simulating authentic court settings. Research conducted by Cao and Guo (2022) underscores that engaging in simulated court exercises, including case trials and legal debates, significantly bolsters students’ practical competencies and enhances their capacity for critical analysis. Nonetheless, the conventional implementation of simulated court instruction is constrained by resource availability and scalability, thereby hindering the provision of diverse legal contexts and tailored learning experiences.

Traditional situational interactive teaching is constrained by organizational, temporal, and spatial limitations, as well as challenges associated with personalized instruction. However, the swift advancement of information technology has ushered in a transformative shift in this domain. Notably, the integration of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the automatic generation of personalized and immersive learning environments. This advancement holds profound implications for transcending the constraints of time and space, enhancing the personalization and interactivity of instruction, and offering innovative alternatives to conventional situational interactive teaching methodologies.

Despite the proven efficacy of situational interactive teaching across various domains, implementation challenges persist, including resource constraints and complexities in personalizing instruction. The advent of generative artificial intelligence offers promising avenues to address these issues. This research delves into the integration of generative artificial intelligence within situational interactive teaching, with a focus on bolstering its effectiveness, particularly in fostering personalized learning environments and enhancing interactivity.

# The application of generative artificial intelligence in education

The utilization of generative artificial intelligence technology in educational settings spans a diverse range of disciplines, including medical education (Heng et al., 2023), physical education (Z. H. Wang, 2023), journalism and communication education (Niu, 2022), language learning (Jiao & Chen, 2023), engineering education (Qadir, 2023), art education (Saurini, 2023), and writing training (Guo et al., 2023). Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by platforms like ChatGPT, have opened new possibilities in education (H. Yu et al., 2023). This technology excels in creating diverse personalized educational materials, enriching learning resources significantly (W. Dai et al., 2023; Zheng & Ren, 2023). Its robust language processing capabilities not only assist in instructional design but also promote autonomous learning among students. Specifically, several studies have leveraged this technology in the realms of intelligent homework grading, virtual teaching aids, and intelligent question-answering systems (Wu et al., 2023). Additionally, some researchers have utilized it for tasks such as content generation in education, personalized instructional support, and psychological and emotional guidance in education (Y. B. Zhang et al., 2023).

In the realm of legal education, generative artificial intelligence presents significant potential. Choi et al. (2023) underscores its capacity to augment learning experiences, while Ajevski et al. (2023) emphasizes its ability to generate personalized case studies and emulate legal scenarios. Nonetheless, the systematic deployment and assessment of this technology within legal education remain relatively uncharted territory. This includes an in-depth exploration of its implications for pedagogical approaches and instructional efficacy when integrated with generative artificial intelligence.

This research endeavours to integrate generative artificial intelligence into the realm of legal education, with an emphasis on enhancing pedagogical approaches and optimizing instructional efficacy. The objective is to investigate the novel potential of generative artificial intelligence in this domain.

# “Flow” in education

In the educational sphere, the phenomenon of “flow experience” holds significant sway. This experience is characterized by an individual’s total immersion and absorption in a particular activity, deriving profound enjoyment from the engagement (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In structuring lessons, the incorporation of “flow theory” is paramount. Educators can engineer tasks that match the skill levels of students with the challenges presented, which is a cornerstone of facilitating flow experiences. For instance, a study has illustrated how the meticulous design of instructional activities, based on flow theory, engenders enhanced engagement and learning effect (Chan & Ahern, 1999). Several studies underscore a positive correlation between flow experience and bolstered learning effect (Jackman et al., 2021; Rodríguez-Ferrer et al., 2023). Besides, it has been identified that educators can meticulously design participatory learning activities that wholly engage students, and can also harness immersive technologies such as virtual reality to magnify the flow experience (Salar et al., 2020). Notably, within legal education, empirical data reveals that the flow experience significantly uplifts academic performance (Wallinger, 2010).

A variety of instruments have been used to measure the flow experience, such as Flow State Scale (Erhel & Jamet, 2019) and Experience Sampling Method (Sumaya & Darling, 2018). These instruments were used in previous studies to assess the flow dimensions and explore the relationship between flow and learning effect.

A comprehensive review of the existing literature indicates a growing interest in understanding the relationship between flow experience and effective learning environments, particularly within the field of legal education. However, there remains a gap in research exploring how generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching activities could enhance the flow experience and, consequently, the learning effect of law students. Therefore, this paper delves into the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching activities on the flow experience and learning effect among law students. The objective of this study is to provide practical insights that could significantly contribute to the improvement of legal education.

# Measurement of learning effectiveness

Learning effectiveness refers to the overall improvement of students’ cognitive ability, emotional state and understanding in educational research (G. R. Sinha, 2020). It is an important indicator for evaluating teaching methods. Situational teaching can effectively improve learning effectiveness by contextualizing learning in real-life situations. A. F. Huang et al. (2010) demonstrated that situational teaching can enhance students’ understanding of language through situational contexts. Wei et al. (2018) found that multimedia teaching integrated with constructed scenarios can significantly improve students’ learning effect.

The advent of generative artificial intelligence, as evidenced by tools such as ChatGPT, introduces a novel dimension to the educational sphere. Cooper (2023) and Ruiz-Rojas et al. (2023) underscore the capacity of these AI tools to produce personalized instructional material, thereby augmenting learning efficacy through the customization of instruction to meet individual learning requirements.

The amalgamation of generative artificial intelligence with situational teaching, as examined in this research, unveils novel avenues for educational progression. This innovative fusion harnesses the adaptability of AI and the immersive quality of situational teaching to craft distinctive, personalized learning experiences that markedly enhance learning effect. Baidoo-Anu and Ansah (2023) highlight the promising potential of AI tools such as ChatGPT in the realm of education, particularly in augmenting the richness of learning experiences.

To complement the assessment of learning effectiveness, employing diverse measurement tools is essential (G. R. Sinha, 2020). For example, the improvement of knowledge level can be evaluated by specially designed tests or quizzes, which can directly reflect the teaching effect on students’ content understanding. At the same time, the Learning Effectiveness

Measurement Scale can evaluate multiple dimensions such as cognitive ability, technical ability and concentration level, so as to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation of the educational effect. The combination of these two tools can better reveal the impact of situational interactive teaching assisted by generative artificial intelligence on different aspects of student learning.

In order to gauge the efficacy of these novel teaching methodologies, this research employed a comprehensive evaluation using knowledge test questions and learning effect scales. Additionally, pre-test and post-test methods were utilized to facilitate dynamic assessment of the impact of generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching on students’ cognitive, skill-based, and emotional development. This approach offers a holistic perspective on the potential enhancement of learning effect through such innovative teaching strategies.

# Research questions

This research primarily seeks to investigate the following questions:

● Is there a significant difference in learning effect between generative artificial intelligencesupported Situational Interactive Teaching and traditional teaching methods? ● Is there a significant difference in the experience of flow between generative artificial intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching and traditional teaching methods? Do individual differences (such as gender, grade level, and whether the content has been previously studied) influence learning effect and the experience of flow? ● Under generative artificial intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching and traditional teaching methods, is there a correlation between learning effect and the experience of flow, and if so, are there variations in this correlation?

These questions guide the study’s exploration into the innovative integration of AI technologies within education, seeking to understand their impact on student engagement and learning efficacy. The findings will potentially contribute to shaping pedagogical practices that align with contemporary technological advancements, offering a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on teaching and learning in today’s academic landscape.

# Study design

# Participants

The subjects of this research are Chinese law-major university students, with a total of 128 participants involved. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group, with 64 individuals in each group. Both groups exhibit identical distribution of demographic variables. Specifically, the gender distribution is balanced with 32 male and 32 female participants in each group. Regarding the grade level, the sample includes 32 participants from freshman to junior levels and 32 from senior or postgraduate or doctoral levels. Concerning the variable of whether the teaching content has been previously studied, 36 participants have prior experience with the learning content, while 28 do not.

This structured and balanced design is instrumental in ensuring the integrity and robustness of the study, allowing for a nuanced analysis of how generative artificial intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching may interact with different demographic factors to influence learning effect and the experience of flow.

# Group setting

The students in the experimental group and the control group engaged in different teaching activities, with the teaching process and content maintained consistent across both, yet employing distinct teaching methods. Specifically, students in the experimental group utilized the Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching Method, it is an intelligent legal situational teaching application supported by generative artificial intelligence that we designed. This application integrated legal knowledge and cases into specific scenarios, facilitating the learning process through interaction.

In contrast, the control group students employed Traditional Video Interactive Teaching Method, specifically learning through videos incorporating embedded questions for interaction. In this study, they watched instructional videos from “Hou Da” law test, primarily employing lecture and case study methodologies. The learning process was similarly enhanced through interactive questionanswering. The selection of “Hou Da” law test educational videos for the control group was aimed at ensuring the fairness and comparability of the experiment, with both the experimental and control groups engaged in an online learning environment. This setup was designed to minimize differences in the physical learning environment, thereby allowing for a more accurate assessment of the disparities between the generative artificial intelligence-supported teaching method and traditional teaching approaches.

The content studied by both groups comprised the following legal knowledge points: an understanding of intentional and negligent criminal acts, the principles for collecting and utilizing evidence in criminal proceedings, comprehension of evidence theory, understanding of conviction and sentencing in robbery cases, and a comprehensive analysis and utilization of evidence in actual trials. The nuanced design of this study is expected to shed light on the differential impacts and efficacy of emerging AI-supported educational methodologies versus conventional instructional practices in the realm of legal education.

# Comparison of teaching methods between the two groups

When we discuss pedagogical strategies, interactivity and contextuality emerge as two pivotal elements, directly impacting the students’ learning experience and effect. The pedagogical methods incorporated within this study exhibited variations in both these facets, culminating in distinct learning effect. To gain a more profound understanding of these disparities, we shall juxtapose traditional pedagogical methods with our generative artificial intelligence-based teaching application in terms of their characteristics in interaction and contextuality. Table 1 delineates a comparison between the two learning environments.

In the realm of interactivity, Traditional Video Interactive Teaching Method predominantly facilitate interaction by embedding multiple-choice questions within videos (shown in Figure 1). Such an approach often induces a sense of intrusion and discontinuity in students, thereby hampering their immersive experience. Students might perceive this as an abrupt interruption, making sustained concentration on the learning material a challenge. Conversely, our pedagogical application, underpinned by generative artificial intelligence, embraces a novel interactive approach (shown in Appendix 1). In the Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching Method, interactions are seamlessly integrated within specific learning contexts, serving as catalysts propelling the narrative forward. Such a design amalgamates interactions with the learning content, not only bolstering the coherence of the learning trajectory but also significantly amplifying students’ immersive experience. Students can interact within a continuous context, devoid of the sensation of being interrupted, thereby facilitating their holistic engagement in the learning process.

Regarding contextuality, Traditional Video Interactive Teaching Method revolves around individual knowledge points. Educators, based on each knowledge point, elect or devise pertinent case studies to provide a learning context. Although this methodology ensures comprehensive coverage of all knowledge points, it might engender a fragmented learning experience, given the potential absence of direct connections between each case study. In contrast, Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching Method champions a context-driven approach. Herein, the context forms the backbone of learning, with every narrative progression unveiling a new knowledge point. Such a design endows the learning process with greater continuity and immersion since students must focus not merely on individual knowledge points but on the holistic development of the context. This context-driven learning methodology facilitates students in assimilating and applying knowledge more effectively, given its emphasis on the practical application of knowledge in real-world scenarios.

By employing this scale, the research aims to provide an accurate and culturally sensitive assessment of how students’ immersion and engagement in learning activities correlate with various psychological and emotional variables. This methodology contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the student learning experience, providing valuable insights into educational effectiveness and effect.

# Learning effectiveness measurement scale

In this study, the Learning Effectiveness Scale utilized by Chen (2022) in her research has been adopted. This scale provides a comprehensive assessment of student learning effect, encompassing three main dimensions: cognitive, skills, and affective aspects (The complete scale can be found in Appendix 5). Specific features of the scale are detailed as follows:

(1) Cognitive Aspect: This dimension, represented by items 1 to 4, primarily evaluates the depth of students’ understanding and mastery of the learning content. An example is item 4, which states, “My grades have improved”.   
(2) Skills Aspect: Spanning items 5 to 12, this facet predominantly assesses the students’ capability to employ the learning content in real-world problem-solving scenarios. For illustration, item 6 reads, “It improves my ability to communicate with others”.   
(3) Affective Aspect: Covering items 13 to 18, this segment chiefly measures students’ emotional responses and attitudes towards the learning material. As an example, item 13 posits, “I feel happy in the process of learning”. Rating Scale: Each item employs a 5-point scale for scoring, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

The application of this particular scale within the research design enables a multifaceted evaluation of student learning, including not only cognitive and practical skill development but also affective responses. To precisely gauge the enhancement in students’ learning effect, a pre-test and post-test assessment system is utilized, employing a standardized scale. This system guarantees an exhaustive evaluation of the influence exerted by instructional activities on student performance. By integrating these various elements, the research seeks to capture a holistic view of learning effect and effectiveness, considering the complex interplay of intellectual comprehension, practical application, and emotional engagement.

# Legal knowledge level test

In this study, we developed four sets of legal knowledge assessment questions based on the instructional content. These sets, detailed in Appendix 6, were designed to evaluate students’ mastery of legal knowledge, with a primary emphasis on gauging their cognitive abilities in the field of law. Prior to their implementation, these questions were subjected to expert review. This review ensured a comprehensive coverage of the instructional content and a consistent level of difficulty suitable for both the traditional instruction group and the experimental group during pre-test and post-test evaluations.

Each set of assessment questions consists of 5 problems, with each problem corresponding to one of the following five legal knowledge points in criminal law:

(1) Understanding of Subjective Intention and Negligence in Criminal Acts: This assesses comprehension of the differentiation between intentional and negligent actions within criminal offences.   
(2) Understanding of the Principles of Evidence Collection and Utilization in Criminal Proceedings: This gauges the understanding of legal protocols and standards in gathering and employing evidence during criminal trials.   
(3) Understanding of Evidence Theory: This evaluates comprehension of theoretical frameworks governing the use of evidence in legal contexts, including principles of admissibility, reliability, and relevance.   
(4) Understanding of Conviction and Punishment for Robbery: This measures knowledge of legal standards for determining guilt and imposing sentences for robbery offences, including legal definitions, required evidence, and applicable penalties.   
(5) Comprehensive Analysis and Utilization of Evidence in Actual Trials: This assesses the ability to conduct a thorough analysis of evidence and apply it effectively within real judicial proceedings, including critical evaluation, synthesis, and strategic use.

This comprehensive assessment structure provides insights into students’ grasp of critical legal concepts, principles, and practical application. By aligning the questions with core instructional content and validating them through expert review, the research ensures that the assessments are both relevant and rigorous, contributing to the validity and robustness of the study’s findings.

# Data processing and analysis

After collecting the pre-test, post-test data, and student sentiment evaluations from both experimental group and control group, the data was processed and analysed using Python. Python, with its extensive data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scipy, was chosen to enable a more flexible and comprehensive approach to the analysis. The main objectives of this experiment were to compare significant differences in learning effect, the flow experience, and student sentiment towards generative artificial intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching versus traditional teaching methods.

The analytical procedures employed were as follows:

(1) Data Preprocessing: Initial data cleaning and preprocessing were done using Python’s pandas library, ensuring data consistency and preparing it for subsequent analyses.   
(2) Reliability and Validity Analysis: Utilizing Python’s statistics modules and the scipy library, the Learning Effectiveness Scale and EduFlow-2 scale were analysed for reliability and construct validity.   
(3) Sentiment Analysis of Student Evaluations: Using Python-based text processing techniques and keyword-based methods, student evaluations were classified into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Chi-square Test for Sentiment Analysis, Python’s scipy library was utilized to determine if there were significant associations between certain categorical variables (like gender or prior exposure to the course content) and the sentiment of student evaluations.   
(4) Independent Samples T-Test: The scipy library in Python was used to analyse whether the changes in students’ knowledge level abilities and sentiment evaluations were significant under the two teaching methods.

# Results and discussion

# Reliability and validity analysis

This section scrutinizes the reliability and validity of the learning effect and flow experience scales. The accuracy of the measurements was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis and reliability assessments, with results detailed in Table 3. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values for the learning effect scale exceeded 0.6, while Bartlett’s test revealed significant p-values, thereby validating the suitability of the factor analysis. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.946 to 0.987, demonstrating high internal consistency. For the flow experience scale, KMO values surpassed 0.7, and Bartlett’s test produced a significant p-value of 0.001, confirming the appropriateness of the factor analysis. Cronbach’s alpha varied between 0.846 and 0.961, indicating strong reliability. These findings affirm the structural soundness of the scales and bolster the credibility and generalizability of the study.

# Learning effect

# Results of knowledge competency level

The Independent-samples T Test was employed to examine the differences in knowledge competency between the experimental and control groups. The analysis considered three variables: scores obtained prior to the experiment (pre-test), scores acquired following the experiment (post-test), and the variation from pre-test to post-test, as detailed in Table 4.

In the pre-test phase, the mean scores for the experimental and control groups were 2.94 and 3.16, respectively. Nevertheless, this discrepancy was not statistically significant $\left( t = - 0 . 9 4 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 3 5 )$ , suggesting no marked difference in knowledge level at the commencement of the experiment.

In the post-test phase, the experimental group scored a mean of 3.81, while the control group scored 4.13. Again, the difference was not statistically significant $( t = - 1 . 5 7 , p = 0 . 1 2 )$ , leading to the conclusion that there was no discernible difference between the two teaching methods in enhancing students’ knowledge levels.

In terms of the variation in scores from the pre-test to the post-test, no significant disparity was noted between the groups $( t ~ = ~ - 0 . 3 5$ , $p \ = \ 0 . 7 3 )$ ). Overall, the generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive Teaching did not demonstrate a significant advantage over traditional teaching methods in augmenting students’ legal knowledge.

These findings elucidate the relative effectiveness of the two pedagogical strategies, indicating that the novel utilization of generative artificial intelligence does not invariably yield a more advantageous learning effect in this particular educational milieu.

# Result of learning effectiveness measurement scale

This study utilized a two-way mixed design ANOVA to scrutinize the primary and interactive effects of Teaching Method and Test Time on learning efficacy. The Teaching Method, which differentiated between the experimental and control groups, functioned as an inter-group factor. While, Test Time, which compared pre-test and post-test results, served as a repeated measures factor.

The results of the analysis (in Table 5) revealed significant main effects for Teaching Method $( { \mathsf { F } } =$ 43.06, $p < 0 . 0 1 .$ ) and Test Time $( \mathsf { F } = 8 . 7 9 $ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ). Notably, a significant interaction effect was observed between Teaching Method and Test Time $( \mathsf { F } = 6 . 7 5 , p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , indicating that the learning effect improved differently across groups over time, with the experimental group experiencing greater improvement. Subsequent analysis of simple effects(in Table 6), utilizing paired T-tests for each Teaching Method and independent T-tests for Test Time, demonstrated significant improvements in the learning effect of the experimental group post-instruction compared to the control group.

Otherwise, a thorough analysis was conducted to examine the primary influence of “Teaching Method” on each facet of learning efficacy. The findings(show in Table 7) revealed that this enhancement was uniform across cognitive, skill, and affective dimensions of learning, as evidenced by significant main effects in each dimension (Cognitive: $\mathsf { F } = 1 1 . 8 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ; Skill: $\mathsf { F } = 1 2 . 8 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ; Affective: $\mathsf { F } = 4 9 . 4 0 , p < 0 . 0 1$ ).

In conclusion, the results indicate that the application of generative Artificial Intelligence in Situational Interactive Teaching markedly improves students’ learning effect across multiple dimensions when compared to conventional teaching methods.

# Summary and discussion

In addressing Research Question 1, which scrutinizes the learning effect of generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching in juxtaposition with conventional methods, our study discerned several salient phenomena.

The augmentation of legal knowledge demonstrated no significant disparities between the two pedagogical methodologies. This finding suggests that the utilization of generative artificial intelligence-supported instruction is as potent as traditional methods in enhancing students’ grasp of legal principles. However, the Learning Effectiveness Scale revealed a more pronounced differentiation in the overall learning effect. The experimental group demonstrated significant enhancements in cognitive, skills, and emotional dimensions.

These two measurements collectively imply that generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching, while not significantly different from traditional methods of imparting specific legal knowledge, excels in creating a holistic learning experience. This encompasses not only the acquisition of knowledge but also the enhancement of cognitive abilities and emotional engagement, which are crucial for effective learning. This can be attributed to the increased immersion and interactivity provided by AI-supported situational learning, as opposed to traditional teaching methods (S. Sinha et al., 2023; T. Wang et al., 2023), thereby positively influencing the learning process.

Consequently, we may surmise that although this novel teaching method did not exhibit a clear advantage in terms of improving legal knowledge test scores, it has the potential to optimize the learning process and elevate students’ learning effect. It appears to notably foster the cognitive, skills, and emotional aspects of learning. This lends certain support to the further promotion and application of this teaching method. However, it is also pertinent to recognize the limitations stemming from a relatively small sample size, which should be taken into consideration in future research or implementations.

# Flow experience

To address the second research question, this study calculated the total pre-test and post-test scores of the flow experience for both the experimental group and control group. A two-way mixed design ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of Teaching Method and Test Time on flow experience, as well as their interaction. The results(in Table 8) revealed significant main effects for Teaching Method $( \mathsf { F } = 1 1 0 . 4 3 , p < 0 . 0 1 )$ ) and Test Time $( \mathsf { F } = 1 1 4 . 1 3 , p < 0 . 0 1 )$ ), as well as a significant interaction between these variables $( \mathsf { F } = 1 5 6 . 2 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ). This implies that there was a more substantial improvement in flow experience for the experimental group from pre-test to post-test.

Due to the significant interaction effect, this experiment further carried out a simple effect analysis, that is, conducted a paired T-test for Teaching Methods and an independent T-test for Test Time. The results are delineated in Table 9. It reveals a substantial improvement in the flow experience of the experimental group. This was notably different from the control group, which did not demonstrate any significant changes. Notably, the post-teaching flow experience of the experimental group significantly surpassed that of the control group.

The research further scrutinized the variances in various flow dimensions across the groups. Notable disparities were identified in cognitive $( \mathsf { F } = 6 4 . 1 7 $ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ), temporal $( \mathsf { F } = 5 2 . 4 2 , p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , concentration $( \mathsf { F } = 3 2 . 5 7 , p < 0 . 0 1 )$ ), and affective dimensions $( \mathsf { F } = 3 0 . 2 5 , p < 0 . 0 1$ ). The results are delineated in Table 10.

In conclusion, these results suggest that the application of generative artificial intelligence in Situational Interactive Teaching significantly improves students’ overall and specific flow experience. This underscores the potential for incorporating advanced technology into educational settings to enhance the learning environment and foster deeper student engagement.

# Summary and discussion

In exploring the second research question on flow experience differences, we observed significant distinctions between generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching and traditional methods. The experimental group showed a higher degree of improvement in both overall flow experience and in specific dimensions – cognition, time, focus, and emotion. From a flow theory perspective (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975), this suggests that the AI-supported method enhances the balance between students’ skills and challenges, fostering a state of flow. This improvement, especially in cognitive control, time perception, focused attention, and emotional experience, might be attributed to the method’s interactive and immersive nature, demonstrating its effectiveness over traditional teaching.

The current study endorses the utilization of generative artificial intelligence technology in designing situational teaching methods. This could serve as a valuable reference for future educational design, aligning with other research findings that this approach can more adeptly engage learners’ enthusiasm and potential (Woithe & Filipec, 2023). In addition, the crucial role of flow experience in legal studies merits attention (Cody, 2019); it aids students in attaining heightened concentration, fully engaging in complex legal reasoning, and case analysis (Stendahl et al., 2021).

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that generative artificial intelligence- supported situational interactive teaching can more effectively stimulate students’ learning interest and potential by enhancing cognitive, temporal, attentional, and emotional experiences during the learning process. This finding provides support for the broader adoption of this teaching method.

# The influence of individual differences

To answer the third research question, a multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to investigate the influence of variables such as gender, grade level, and prior exposure to the taught content on the degrees of improvement in both learning effect and flow experience. The results are articulated in Table 11. The analysis revealed that variables like gender, grade level, and prior content exposure had no significant impact on learning effect and flow experience, as indicated by p-values above 0.05.These results imply that generative artificial intelligence-supported situational interactive teaching is effective across different student demographics, unaffected by gender, educational stage, or prior familiarity with content. This underscores the method’s universal applicability and its ability to enhance learning experiences consistently among diverse student groups.

# Summary and discussion

The research findings demonstrate that the enhancing effects of generative artificial intelligencesupported situational interactive teaching on learning effect and the experience of flow are not influenced by individual differences such as gender, grade level, or previous exposure to the content.

This might be attributable to the highly personalized and contextualized support that this pedagogical approach offers. It can perceive and adapt to the distinct needs of different students, thereby ensuring that varied student demographics all derive positive effects from the learning process. This is consistent with the conclusions of previous research, which have also indicated that the impact of adaptive teaching is not affected by individual disparities (Jonassen & Grabowski, 2012).

The implications of these findings are significant, underscoring the generalizability and adaptability of novel, technology-enhanced pedagogical approaches. Such strategies eschew traditional student characteristic-based discrimination, instead providing a universally advantageous learning methodology. This underscores the potential for a more inclusive educational milieu, wherein all students, irrespective of their demographics, have equal access to engage with the material effectively and attain superior learning effect.

# The correlation between learning effectiveness and flow experience

To respond to the fourth research question, this study utilized Pearson correlation analysis to explore the relationship between the changes in learning effect and changes in flow experience within both the experimental and control groups. The results of the analysis (in Table 12) underscored disparities in the correlation between learning effect and flow experience across teaching methodologies. In the control group, which utilized traditional teaching methods, no significant association was observed $( r = 0 . 0 7 5$ , $p = 0 . 5 5 7 \mathrm { \AA }$ ) between enhancements in learning effect and flow experience. Conversely, the experimental group, who were subjected to generative artificial intelligencesupported situational interactive teaching, demonstrated a substantial positive correlation $( r =$

Table 12. Pearson correlation analysis between situational interactive teaching supported by generative artificial intelligence and learning effect and flow experience under traditional teaching.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Divisions</td><td>Correlation coefficient</td><td> P values</td></tr><tr><td> Traditional group</td><td>.07</td><td>.56</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental group</td><td>.36</td><td>.00</td></tr></table></body></html>

0.364, $p = 0 . 0 0 3 \mathrm { , }$ ). This implies that an augmented flow experience is associated with more pronounced learning improvements under this innovative teaching approach, signifying a beneficial interplay between these factors that is not present in conventional methods. This can be ascribed to the captivating nature of AI-supported situational teaching.

# Summary and discussion

This research reveals that the innovative teaching approach can instigate a beneficial feedback loop between learning effect and the state of flow. This observation is further explained through the lens of flow theory: achieving a flow state can trigger intrinsic motivation, which subsequently enhances engagement in learning, thereby establishing a virtuous cycle (Moon & Baek, 2010).

Furthermore, the implementation of this pedagogical strategy, which employs generative artificial intelligence to facilitate situational and personalized instruction, may prove more efficacious in eliciting learners’ positive emotions and preserving cognitive focus. This could consequently lead to enhanced learning effect (W. Dai et al., 2023).Such findings carry substantial implications for fostering enduring motivation and critical thinking skills among legal professionals (Ajevski et al., 2023).

These findings underscore the potential advantages of implementing innovative teaching strategies that harmonize learning engagement (flow) with educational efficacy. The association between emotional engagement and learning effect enriches our comprehension of teaching and learning processes. By adopting an approach that addresses students’ psychological needs and fosters their intrinsic motivation, educators can potentially engender more profound and efficacious learning experiences. This contrasts starkly with conventional methods that may overlook these deeper connections between learning and emotional engagement.

# Students’ evaluation

# Implementation and methods of sentiment analysis

The feedback gathered from students regarding the generative artificial intelligence-based interactive teaching method was subjected to a keyword-based sentiment analysis. A selection of student opinions can be found in Table 13. Figure 4 illustrates the word cloud representation of these evaluations. This involved utilizing a dictionary of keywords that signified positive, neutral, and negative sentiments (Appendix 7). Keywords such as “good”, “like”, and “interesting” were classified as positive; “average” and “ordinary” as neutral; and “not good”, “dislike”, and “boring” as negative. Subsequently, these classifications enabled the categorization of students’ comments into positive, neutral, or negative categories, thereby offering insights into their perceptions of the teaching method.

Figure 4. The word cloud of evaluations.

For sentiment analysis, we first preprocess the student evaluation texts by removing special characters, converting to lowercase and splitting into words. Then, we use a pre-trained sentiment model to score each text and determine the sentiment polarity of each review. Finally, based on the polarity scores, we assign sentiment tags to each review and count the overall sentiment polarity of the student evaluations.

# The relationship between gender and sentiment in student evaluations

In our dataset, male students gave 14 positive, 18 neutral and 0 negative evaluations. Female students gave 14 positive, 17 neutral and 1 negative evaluation. Figure 5 shows the Sentiment Distribution by Gender Graph. Figures 6 and 7 show the word clouds of evaluations given by male and female students respectively. As it can be seen from this data, the distribution of positive and neutral evaluations is similar in both genders but negative evaluations were only given by female students.

![](img/05ef330f1f70d9a9e1975860a2f19af138e59e497f2c0be7af3802d6b2b13615.jpg)

Figure 6. Word cloud of male students’ evaluations.

To further explore whether there is a difference in the sentiment ratings between these two groups, we performed a chi-squared statistical test. The results are presented in Table 14, where the chi-squared statistic is 1.029 and the associated p-value is 0.598. This p-value is significantly higher than the conventional significance level of 0.05, so we cannot conclude that there is a significant relationship between the gender of students and the sentiment of their evaluations.

Although the statistical test does not show a statistically significant relationship between gender and sentiment evaluation, we can still observe some trends. For example, female students’ negative evaluations are present, while male students do not have any negative evaluations. This may indicate that female students may have certain dissatisfactions or face certain difficulties when using intelligent contextualized teaching mode. These findings can be further explored, such as why they give negative evaluations, or what is different about their experience when using this teaching mode.

# Relationship between grade groupings and sentiment in student evaluations

The statistical analysis of emotional evaluation effect reveals significant variances in emotional distribution across students of varying grades levels. Freshman through junior undergraduates exhibit higher positive evaluation rates compared to senior and graduate students, whereas the latter group tends to provide more neutral evaluations than their lower-grade counterparts. Figure 8 illustrates this emotional distribution by grade, distinctly highlighting the differential emotional perceptions of generative artificial intelligence-based teaching methods among students at different grade stages.

To further explore the differences in sentiment ratings between grade levels, we conducted a chisquared test. The p-value of 0.561 shows that there is no significant relationship between students’ grade level and their sentiment rating. As shown in Table 15, the perception of generative artificial intelligencesupported teaching method among students does not differ significantly according to their grade level. The chi-squared test compares the observed frequencies with the expected frequencies. The expected frequencies are calculated under the null hypothesis that there is no difference in sentiment ratings between students of both grade levels. The resulting statistic shows the difference between the observed and expected values.

![](img/d32ba62d53215d12ea85db616748965328f0d374e4cab147919d3340bf375c7c.jpg)

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Chi-Squared Statistic</td><td> P-value</td></tr><tr><td>Value</td><td>1.029</td><td>.598</td></tr></table></body></html>

From the results of this analysis, we can conclude that although students from “Freshman to Junior” had slightly higher positive evaluations than those from “Senior and above”, this difference may be due to randomness since the chi-squared test did not find a statistically significant difference between the two groups. This suggests that although students from different grade levels have somewhat different reactions to the teaching mode, their emotional responses are similar.

# Relationship between prior knowledge of the taught material and sentiment in student evaluations

To gain a deeper insight into the influence of grade level and prior exposure to teaching content on students’ emotional evaluation, we performed an in-depth analysis of the student evaluation data. Figure 9 presents a bar chart illustrating the sentiment distribution among students of different grade levels and those who had or hadn’t previously encountered the teaching material. The results clearly show significant differences in sentiment evaluations. Specifically, students with prior exposure to the teaching content tended to provide neutral evaluations, while those without such exposure provided similar numbers of positive and neutral evaluations. The Chi-square test’s P-value is 0.467, suggesting no significant correlation between the students’ prior knowledge of the textbook and their emotional expression in the evaluation (show in Table 16).

# Summary and discussion

The evaluation of students concerning pedagogical methodologies underscored by generative artificial intelligence offers insights into their emotional predispositions towards this instructional paradigm.

The analysis of gender disparities in student evaluations of generative artificial intelligence-supported teaching methods revealed similar distributions of positive and neutral sentiments between male and female students. However, negative evaluations were solely from female students. While the statistical analysis did not indicate significant gender-based differences, this pattern suggests that female students might have unique challenges or dissatisfactions with AI-supported teaching, leading to negative feedback. This may be attributed to differences in learning styles, preferences for engagement, or the perception and interaction with AI technologies that do not necessarily match the expectations or requirements of female students.

From grade perspective, the slightly higher number of positive evaluations from students in their first to third years, compared to those in higher years, does not indicate a significant statistical difference. This uniformity in responses suggests that the generative artificial intelligence-supported teaching method resonates similarly with students across different grade levels. It suggests that the teaching methodology remains consistently effective and appealing, irrespective of a student’s academic year within their programme.

The analysis of whether students had been exposed to the content before showed that students who were familiar with the content tended to give neutral ratings, which was not statistically significant but could be explained by their prior knowledge and expectations. Students may have expected more from the teaching method and would have given neutral ratings if they did not get what they expected. On the other hand, students who were not familiar with the content might have found the new teaching method more attractive and gave positive ratings. This implies that prior familiarity with the learning content influences students’ receptivity to and perception of the teaching method.

In conclusion, while there are some subtle differences, the vast majority of student feedback about generative artificial intelligence-supported situational learning is positive or neutral. This suggests that students generally accept this approach to teaching. However, to make this method even better, we need to understand more deeply the issues that led people to give negative reviews and try to address them.

# Conclusion

# Research summary and suggestions

# Research summary

This study delves into the ramifications of contextualized interactive pedagogy bolstered by generative artificial intelligence (Generative Artificial Intelligence- supported Situational Interactive Teaching Method) on students’ academic effect and flow experiences. Research findings elucidate that this avant-garde teaching methodology significantly amplifies students’ academic efficacy, particularly accentuating advancements in cognition, skill acquisition, and emotional domains. Concurrently, it markedly enhances students’ flow experiences across various facets, encompassing cognitive concentration, temporal perception, focus, and positive affect. Notably, these effects are impervious to variables like students’ gender, academic standing, and prior learning experiences, underscoring a profound universality. Additionally, the research discerns that this pedagogical approach can catalyse a virtuous cycle between academic effect and flow experiences. Analytical insights into students’ emotive evaluations further reveal a predominant inclination towards endorsing AI-supported situational teaching methodologies. Collectively, the study fortifies the notion that generative artificial intelligence harbours considerable potential to refine and augment legal education paradigms.

# Practical applications and educational suggestions

Based on the research findings, the following recommendations can be proffered to educators:

● Integration of Generative artificial intelligence technology in Legal Education: There should be contemplation of integrating generative artificial intelligence technology within legal education, structuring situational teaching content and interactive processes. This may be more efficacious in stimulating students’ learning potential. For example, this technology could be merged into case studies, simulation exercises, and other legal teaching segments, to enrich the cases and enhance the verisimilitude of simulated scenarios. Cognitive Load Reduction and Knowledge Construction: This teaching approach can diminish the cognitive load associated with abstract legal concepts, assisting students in constructing knowledge systems through specific situations. Educators should focus on utilizing this advantage in teaching design. Specifically, for theoretically intensive legal courses, educators might appropriately increase the application ratio of this teaching method to expand students’ applicative capabilities. Conversely, for more practical courses, undue reliance on technology should be avoided.   
● Enhancing Situational Experience and Interactive Support: Teaching design should emphasize providing high-level situational experiences and interactive support, to strengthen positive cognitive and emotional experiences during the learning process. This could be utilized to foster a cyclical pattern of “joyful learning benefits” through activating positive emotional experiences. Utilizing the universality advantage of this novel teaching approach, ensuring that different student populations can benefit, is also pivotal.   
● Addressing Potential Risks: Educators must remain vigilant to potential risks such as algorithmic bias, adopting measures like auditing and adjusting algorithms to safeguard the fairness of teaching content.   
● Long-term Effect and Optimal Implementation: The enduring effect and optimal ways to implement this teaching method necessitate further exploration. Attention should also be directed towards potential negative impacts, such as over-reliance on technology.   
● Leveraging Student Sentiment Analysis: Regularly assess student feedback using sentiment analysis to refine AI-supported teaching. Such evaluations can highlight areas for improvement, ensuring that the teaching approach aligns with students’ evolving preferences and needs.

In conclusion, though the long-term efficacy and the most advantageous implementation methods require further investigation, this study offers preliminary support for this innovative pedagogical approach. It can potentially serve as a foundation for subsequent research and practice in the progressive field of legal education.

# Research limitations

This study has achieved certain results in exploring the impact of situational interactive teaching supported by generative artificial intelligence on students’ “flow experience” and learning effects, but there are also some limitations. First, the size and diversity of the study sample may limit the generalizability of the results. The sample was drawn primarily from law schools in a specific region and may not fully represent students from all legal education backgrounds. Second, the research design focuses on short-term teaching effects, and long-term effects are unclear. In addition, the generative artificial intelligence techniques and instructional materials used may have specific limitations that affect the broad applicability of the study. Future research should expand the sample size and scope, explore teaching effects in different legal education contexts, and conduct a more in-depth analysis of long-term effects.
