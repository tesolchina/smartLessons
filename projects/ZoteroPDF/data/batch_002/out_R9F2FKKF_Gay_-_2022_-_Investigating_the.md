This paper reports on an action research project conducted at a university in China over the course of an academic year which aimed to investigate the vocabulary development of mixedability learners studying on an English medium instruction (EMI) journalism and communication course and evaluate the effect of providing technology-enhanced language support. Learners' vocabulary proficiency was measured at the start and end of each term. In the first term, the instruction focused on promoting vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs) and the use of a website/ app called Memrise. In the second term, a course was created on a Moodle platform that trained learners to use online resources and VLSs. In each term, the assignation of a control group allowed for evaluation of the effectiveness of the interventions on improving learners' vocabulary proficiency and EMI grades. Evidence for the beneficial impact of the interventions was found, in particular for a small group of learners who it is argued demonstrated high levels of selfregulation.

# 1. Introduction

As countries make eforts to internationalise and strengthen their global competitiveness, there has been an increased focus on implementing English medium instruction (EMI) programmes for non-language subjects in higher education institutions. EMI provision has grown at a rapid rate in China spurred by government initiatives aiming to internationalise the higher education system enhance the competitiveness and qualit f is universties (Rose et al., 2020) and provide students with more oportunities to improve their English language ability (Hu & Lei, 2014). As a result, there is a growing need for students to attin a level of English language proficiency that allows them to cope with the demands posed by learning an academic subject through the medium of a foreign language.

Technology has the potential to play a role in providingeffective academic English language support in EMI setings, especially in relation to acquiring vocabulary. There is a rich set of online resources available for the learning of English lexis such as apps, leaner dictionaries, colocation dictionaries, thesauruses, and corpora. Such resources provide tols that learners can be guided to use autonomously in order to take ownership of their learning (Zhou & Wei, 2018). There has, however, been limited exploration of teir potential to be incorporated into EMI support teaching.

Working as a senior teacher trainer at the British Council China, the author formed a partnership with an EMI teacher who was interested in providing adtional language support for her learners. Over the course of an academic year, action research was un. dertaken with the purpose of investigating the vocabulary proficiency level of learners studying on the EMI journalism and communication modules that the teacher was responsible for delivering and considering whether the provision of suplementary technology-enhanced support promoting the use of vocabulary learning strategies (VLss) improved vocabulary proficiency levels and content leaning outcomes. I line with Oxford's (2017, 48) definition of language lerning strategies, VLs are considered in this study to be conscious, observable actions undertaken to aid in learning or using vocabulary items. Vocabulary proficiency was assessed by implementing tests at the start and end of each term, while content learning was measured by the score learners achieved in an essay assignment that they were required to complete at the end of each term as part of the EMI content syllabus.

The action research project was guided by the following research questions:

1) To what extent does vocabulary proficiency level afect the EMI learners' language and content learning outcomes? 2) Can technology-enhanced instruction in vocabulary learning strategies improve the EMI learners' vocabulary proficiency and content learning outcomes?

# 2. Background and context of the study

There are several models of EMI being implemented around the world (Macaro, 2018). Although official policy often states an English-only' approach, it is common practice in China for universities to, in reality, adopt a bilingual model of EMI teaching, especially when the programme is aimed at local students (Rose et al., 2020). This might mean that some of the academic content modules are delivered in Chinese and some in English, or that lectures and reading materials use a mixture of English and Chinese input. It i ikly that adoption of bilingual mode i neesstated by Chinese undergraduate learners' level of English and the fact that state schools focus on the teaching of general English rather than academic English (Cai, 2013). Furthermore, many Chinese uni. versities tend not to implement strict English language entry requirements for EMI programmes (Rose et al., 2020.

This study took place at a university for foreign studies in China with undergraduate learners studying a journalism and communication major. The university follows abilingual model, but EMI classes do not begin until the second year. This investigation was carried out during the students first year of EMI study. Thre academic content modules per week were delivered in English and three modules in Chinese with classes for each module occurring once a week for 80 minutes dring term time. The study tracked two modules taught in successive terms by the same EMI teacher. The module taught in the irst term was International Communication? and in the second term Comparative Journalism'. The teacher is a Chinese native speaker with a highly proficient level of English and holds a PhD in Communication Studies awarded from a leading U.K. universty. The teacher and theiraffiliation wil be kept anonymous in this paper upon the teachr's reuest ermssion was received to use the data collected from tests and questionnaires from all learners taking part in the research.

It should be noted that the nature of the content study on an EMI journalism and communication course is somewhat different to subjects which contain larger degrees of technical vocabulary within their rgisters such as STEM subjects. One aim of the programme under study wasto develop bilingualism in hinee and Englis so that students il be able to work in a range of jounalisticroles both domestically and overseas. Whilst this suggests that thiscourse is somewhat language-oriented in nature, and some may question Whether content study is an appropriate decription, another explicit aim was to develop a sound theoretical knowledge of the field of journalism and international communication, with content modules including the study of the various models, paradigms, and frameworks relevant to the fields, thus plaing a major component of the programme in line with the type of study one would expect on an undergraduate social science course.

# 3. Literature review

# 3.1. Language support studies in EMI settings

Recent studies have examined the provision of language support in tertiary EMI ettings in China and considered students feelings about the support they rceive. Galloway and Ruegg (2020, 9) highlight that, whilst language support systems in Chinese universities "were typically developed to support general English sill', there has recently ben a shift towards English for Academic Purposes (EAP) cases. Nonetheless students studying at universities across China have tended to report issatisfaction with the quality and relevance of the EAP support on offer (Galloway et al., 2017; Galloway & Ruegg, 2020).

An investigation by Rose et al. (2020) found many students enrolled on EMI programmes in China faced language-related diffi culties, but hese problems were not a detectable concern amongst their MI teachers. The need for Chinese universities to implement discipline-targeted language support was akey conclusion. However, developing efective EMI language support structures is no easy task in China. Recruiting and retining suitaly qualified teachers iscallenging (Ding & Bruce, 2017), and there may be barrers that prevent collaboration between content and language specialists, such as entrenched professional identities potentiall inherent in content teachers (Macaro, 2018) or the recruitment of teachers not suitably qualified for the teaching of EAP (Krzanowski, 2019)

Research outside China has found promising results in providing language support designed to meet the needs of learners whose proficiency level i ikely to make MI study chllenging. Chang, Kim, and Le (2015) rport on the pilo creation of a language support course for learners who had recently begun EMI study at a Korean university. The support yllabus was designed in response to a needs analysis and included a focus on sub-skills relating to writig, communicatio, and preentations. It consisted of 6 hours of workshops and was mostly dliveed y stfrom the English school over the coursef the universit fallsmester. In addition, oring sesions provided by graduate students with English majors (18 hours intotal) were offered to small groups of larners. Those who attended were "strongly encouraged to bring thir individual EMI course assgnments and tasks for discussion during the program, thereby strengthening the link between the language support program and EMI courses (Chang et al., 2015, 516). Toealuate theeffctiveness of the program, student feedack was sought through post-course questionnaire, surveys, teacher reports and evaluations. Despite there being a lack f perceived language improvement i students self-assessment before and after the tutoring, student feedback on both the tutoring and workshops was generally positive on all aspects of the programme. Nonetheles, the study did notattempt to measure the language proficiency of the students or the impact the course had on learners' content learning outcomes.

Rose et al. (2019) examined the effect of several variables on second-year EMI intenational business students content asessment scores, as measured by calculating the average of learners' midterm and final examination scores. These included general English proficiency, academic language skill and motivatio. The study took plae t a university in Japan withall learners studying the same academic content sllabus delivered by the same teacher. Aditionally, students took an ESP course focusing on developing language skils most relevant to the topic of international business Students were tested for general English language proficiency revealing a range of levels with a CEFR (Common European Framework Reference) score of B1 being the average. At the end of the academic year, there was a weak-medium positive correlation between learners general English proficiency and their content asssment scores and a medium-positive correlation between these scores and their ESP language skills. Whilst this suggests the ESP syllabus was helpful in obtaining improved content learning outcomes, students were only asessed in this module at the end of term. As there was no pre-course test to provide a baseline to compare with, it is unclear how much benefit the ESP course brought learners in terms of their language proficiency development during the academic year.

# 3.2. Vocabulary in EMI settings

Students on EMI programmes face a challenging situation regarding, \*the kinds of words and the level of word-depth they are expected to understand (Macaro, 2018, p. 279). Academic genres are distinguished by specialised vocabulary items and as, "learning technical words is closely connected with leaning the subject (Nation, 1990, p. 141), it i essential that EMI students learn relevant discipline-specific vocabulary.

Knowledge of more common general lexis provides support for learning this more specialised lexis. In EMI lessons, the former is necessary for understanding definitions and explanations of subject-specific technical vocabulary (Macaro, 2018, p. 275). Interestingly, there is evidence suggesting that general academic words are more challenging to learn than technical ones (Vidal 2003). It seems important, therefore, that in a mixed-abilit EMI context, the learning of general academic lexis is not neglected within the wider programme.

# 3.3.VLS instruction studies

Reviewing a wealth of studies in EFL contexts, Nyikos and Fan (2007, p. 273) conclude that providing learners with instruction in VLSs improves leaner metacognition, leading to judicious use of a range of strategies. This in turn positively afects learner performance and the acquisition of vocabulary. The effct is more marked in lower proficiency learners and when the instruction is integrated throughout the entrety of acourse. Benefits for allproficiency levels may occr f exercises are provided to apply the aught strategies and practice time is provided in class".

Nyikos and Fan (2007) also highlight the potential of dictionaries to aid the learning of vocabulary, but note the challenge posed in becoming able to take advantage of the ful range of features they provide, and the dearth f studies investigatig clustr of trategies learners use when consulting a dictionary. Kim (2011, 105) argues that leaner decisions to independently check a word in a dictionary and then use it in a sentence increases involvement load, a measure of the motivational-cognitive demands a vocabulary learning task requires (Hulstiji & Laufer 2001). There is evidence that tasks with high involvement lods lead to more effective retention, an effect equally robust across different proficiency levels Kim (2011, 124).

Few VLS instruction studies have been conducted within an EMI support context. The most relevant studies have found students to look upon VLS instruction favourably, with some evidence suggesting instruction can lead to use of a wider range of strategies and improved vocabulary proficiency.

Brown (2013) reports on a study of note for it focus on VLSs within a universt setting. He integrated regular instruction on VLSs into a CLIL curiculum designed for firs-year undergraduate medical students which aimed to "support learners development of medical content knowledge and communicative ability (Brown 2013, 280). His implementation of strategy instructio followed the principles underpinned by the Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (Anderson et al., 2007, 142). The course also included regular vocabulary tests of words relating to medicine. An evaluation of the efectivenes of the strategy intervention was made based on feedback from student evaluation surveys administered at the end of each semester of the academic year. Data was collected for thre separate academic years. Pre- and post-vocabulary tests provide some evidence that the instruction led to improved breadth and depth of leaners vocabulary knowledge (Brown, 2012). The survey feedback revealed leaners perceived most aspects of the strategy instruction as being useful, especiall those that were focused on learning the specialist subject vocabulary. The metacognitive aspects of reflection and goal seting, however, were "only perceived as somewhat useful on average" (Brown, 2013, p. 285). The author suggests this may be down to a lack of understanding of the purpose of such activities owing to them not ligning with the

students' learning habits and beliefs.

Kobayashi and Littl (2018) carried out aclassrom study to investiate the effcts of VLS instruction in another Japanese university seting in which learners were studying an ESP course to support their biology major. Their intervention involved providing explicit instruction in applying four memory strategies to learn specialised vocabulary. The leaners were tested on their vocabulary size before the intervention and assigned to a higher or lower vocabulary group depending on their test score. The four strategies promoted were based on imagery, association, affixes, and grouping. The intervention involved providing $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } ^ { \prime } }$ explicit instruction on the use of one strategy type and 20-30 minutes for learners to apply the strategy to a list of target biology words with the help of an online science dictionary. Leaners were required to make a written report on how they applied the strategy to the new vocabulary items. In the following class they were tested on the new words. This cycle was repeated for each of the four strategies. After this, learners were given a final vocabulary list and told to learn the items using any strategy they wanted. The results showed that both groups of learners indicated satisfaction with the instruction, with the highest preference being for the affix strategy followed by the imagery strategy. Although the asociation and grouping stategies were les favoured amongst both groups, they were more popular with the higher vocabulary group. The authors reason that this may be owing to the need to have a reasonably large existing vocabulary to operationalise such strategies effctively. Furthermore, when learning the final vocabulary list, around a third of all the reported strategies in both groups were rote memorization strategies rather than the deeper memory strategies they had been trained on. Hence learners were willing to broaden their strategy repertoire but at the same time did not abandon the more mechanical strategies they werealready familiar with. It is uncler, however, if the strategy instructio led to leaners improving their vocabulary proficiency or content learning outcomes as these variables were outside the scope of the study.

# 3.4. Technology, resources, strategies, and self-regulation

There are now numerous digital resources readily available that can asst learners to develop language skill. Their value to teaching and learning has bee discused in some depth within EFL contexts and certain findings from these studies have implications for EMI language support mediated through technology, especiall those that explore the affordances provided by technology for autonomous learning.

Zhou and Wei (2018) systematically review how digital resources have influenced the use and teaching of language learning strategies in recent years. They highlight the benefits in terms of learning outcomes of Digital Age learners adopting selfregulated learning strategies whilst engaging in technology-enhanced language learning with reference to Oxford's (2017) three categories of cognitive/metacognitive, afective/meta-affctive and socioculturalinteractive/socio-cultural interactive. Zhou and Wei (2018, 487) argue that leaners might not be self-regulating or autonomous unless they have been explicitly taught to use learning strategies" and as such a crucial role played by teachers should be identifying the best technology resources and guiding students to be strategic, self-regulated language lners in the Digital Age (hou & Wei, 2018, p. 488). This reflect rcent thinking regarding elf-regulation and strategy use which has suggested teachers can lead learners from being an 'other-regulated' user of a strategy to a more selfregulated' user of it (Thomas & Rose, 2018).

# 4. Purpose and approach of present study

The purpose of this study was to conduct action research to explore the efect of providing mixed-ability EMI learners with technology-enhanced VLS instruction on their vocabulary proficiency development and content learning outcomes. In action research, a practitionr identifies a issueo inestit through a cycle of planning, ating, oseving, and reflecting Buns, 2013).The project took place over the course fa full academic year which enabled two cycles to take place with the ffectivenessof the instrction being reviewed at the end of the firs term. The EMI teacher taught two groups of students the same journalism and communication course. This allowed the creation of acontrol group. The intruction was offered as a supplementary component of the EMI sylabus to avoid impinging upon the class time allocated for delivery of the content syllabi.

In the first term, the main purpose was to establish the level of learners' vocabulary proficiency and consider the extent to which instruction in VLSs and the use of an app called Memrise led to improvements in vocabulary proficiency and score achieved in the endof-term essay given as part f the syllabus to asses learning of content knowledg. In the second term, the same approach to assessing learners' vocabulary proficiency and content learning was maintained but a more varied and structured online course in using resources and VLSs was created, and learners pre- and post-use of a range of strategies was measured.

# 5. Vocabulary tests and general vs. specialised lexis

It was considered whether the vocabulary tests should ssess specialised journalism and communication vocabulary given this was the topic of their EMI academic study. Unfortunately, there is a lack of published tests specificall for these disciplines so ones that focused on general academic vocabulary were used. Nonetheles, this was considered valid for this MI context where leaners had not previously studied EAP before and were, therefore, likely to ned to build their general vocabulary in tandem with discipline-related words, and which, as part of the wider programme, included as an aim the development of journalistic communication skill such as interviewing and news article writing.

Furthermore, specialised lexis may have distinctie features that afect the level of challenge involved in its learning, and a major chunk of journalism-related lexis consists of compounds which are often composed of general lexical items. An analysis of the TV, radio and news topic wordlist (Oxford Learner Topics Dictionaries, 2021) reveals 416 vocabulary items in total, of which the majority are classified at C1 or C2 cEFR level. An analysis of two subcategories (namely journalism and the press) from this lis showed that of the 96 lexical items in total, 54 were compound words. The author judged 28 $( 5 1 . 8 5 \% )$ of these to be transparent. Often the meaning of each part f the compound was at a lower CEFR level than the compound itelf suggesting that, for a reasonably high number of the items, learners should be able to analyse the components and deduce the meaning of the compound. Almost always, the compounds are associated with a single meaning and so learners would not be distracted by other senses pertaining to the same item. Table 1 outlines the analysis of a sample of these compounds to highlight features that may affect the level of learning challenge.

The vocabulary tests were created using activities from the reading and use modules of published Cambridge B2 First and C1 Advanced practicetests. Both these tests are provided by Cambridge Assessment English and are acepted by several institutions as prof f level of English. Whereas a pass in B2 First means learners can be "accepted for entry to foundation/pathway/pre-sessional courses in English-speaking countries, a pas in C1 Advanced shows the learner "\*can follow an academic course at university level' (Cambridge Asesment English, 2021). Each of the four papers that were created used a pair of tas from B2 level and another pair from C1 level. The B2 and C1 lel paper follow the same format, with the ifference being the dificlty of the vocabulary used in the test items. Task 1 and Task 3 were chosen owing to their combined focus upon testing a range of vocabulary knowledge. Task 1 in. volves the test-taker being presented witha reading passage. Eight words from the passage are missing and test-takers must select the correct word in each instance from four possibleanswers. Choosing the correct answer involves evaluation of the meanings of different kinds of lexical items e., individual words, fixed phrases, phrasal verbs, idioms, and collocations) hence covering the range f words learners would encounter during the EMI course and strategy instruction. Task 3 focuses specifically on word formation. A short text is provided and there re eight prompt words whose form must be changed to fit the sentence correctly e.g., by adding the correct suffix or prefi to aprimitive. Although this might appear to be testing mere grammatical knowledge, understanding that an affix associated with a word provides a cue to its word clss is one f several components that contribute towards having an in-depth knowledge of a word (Nation, 2013). A fll example tet is provided in Appndix 1. The questions in Section 1 are taken from a B2-level test and those in section 2 from a C1-level test. 1a and 2a are Task 1 type questions and 1b and 2b Task 3 type questions.

# 6. Term 1 methodology

An intervention and control class were randomly assigned. Class 1 received an intervention focusing on the promotion of vo cabulary learning strategies and the Memrise app. Class 2 were allocated as the control group. Vocabulary tests were given at the tart and end of term to both clsses. Leaners were allowed 30 minutes clas time tocomplete the tets. Although it was priorit to avoid impinging on clas time to implement the language-support research, it was deemed necessary for the tests to be invigilated by the teacher to ensure their validity. In the second clssof term, the teacher gave the intervention group a 20-minute presentation on using Memrise and strategies they could apply to the learning of new vocabulary on the platorm. Alluse of the platform thereafter was completed in learners' own time.

Memrise contains several English vocabulary courses and teachers can create their own courses. Every course follows an algorithm which involves a learning phase for each item of new vocabulary followed by a consolidation stage. Learners are firstly prompted to match the correct meaning to a target item's spoken or written form repeatedly until they consistntly associat form and meaning accurately. They are encouraged to create or choose mnemonic devices to help them remember new words. The platorm then uses a spaced-repetition method to review the learned items. Points are rewarded for successully learning and reviewing words. Following the presentation, larners were immediately given acess to two courses, one focusing on specialised journalism vocabulary and another on general academic vocabulary, hence appealing to the need for the learning of both general and specialised academic registers.

At the beginning of the course, the teacher also decided to create a new course with dificult words identified by students from the course reading materials. Four students volunteered to identify these words and record their definitions and example sentences from online learner dictionaries. The words were then used in a third Memrise course, meaning learners had an opportunity to review them using the platform. Use of the application was, therefore, further geared towards learners' language needs by including vocabulary items directly from the EMI course material. Both groups completed another vocabulary test at the end of term and submitted their content-essay assignments.

For the content-essay assignment, students were given a list of essay questions relating to topics they had studied as part of the international communication module and requested to select one essay question to answer. A sample of these essay questions is included in Appendix 2 along with the marking criteria used by the EMI teacher to grade the essays. The marking criteria are composed of a number of essay-skill areas with varying weightings assigned to each area. $7 0 \%$ of these skill areas are categorised as 'content', and $3 0 \%$ as 'format/presentation'. Under this latter category, a $1 0 \%$ weighting was given towards 'quality of English and academic style'. Direct vocabulary asessment seems necessary to help determine a core in this area. In addition, vocabulary would be assessed i a more implicit manner for several components of the content criteria such as those relating to the quality and coherence of the ar. guments put forward, as achievement in these aspects is dependent upon an ability to use a range of vocabulary with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

# 7. Term 1 results

7.1. What is the vocabulary proficiency level of learners on the journalism EMI course at the start of term?

The vocabulary test conducted at the beginning of the term shows that there was a wide range in vocabulary proficiency amongst learners studying on the EMI programme (Table 2).

The total mean score of 15.3 indicates that learners' average vocabulary level was B2. This is calculated by accounting for the fact that half of the 32 questions were from  2-level test and the other half take from  1-lel test The rangeof scores sugests that the vocabulary proficiency levels varied from A2 to C1.

7.2. Does promotion of vocabulary learning strategies and the use of the Memrise app lead to improved vocabulary proficiency outcomes?

To answer this question, a multiple regression analysis was undertaken to investigate the effect of start-of-term vocabulary test score and Memrise score on Class 1's total change in vocabulary test score between the start and end of term. Before the analysis students who had either extremely low $( - 1 0 )$ or high $( 2 5 + )$ start-of-term vocabulary test scores were excluded to create a more homogenous group and minimise outliers. This led to 27 learners being included in the analysis The data met al the necessary as. sumptions of regression. There was inearity as assessed by partial regression plots and a plot of studentised residuals against the predicted values. There was homogeneity of variance as assessed by visual inspection of a plot of studentised residuals versus unstandardised predicted values. The assumption of normality was met as assessed by a Q-Q plot. A significant regression equation was found $( \operatorname { F } ( 2 , 2 6 ) = 8 . 9$ $\pmb { p = < } . 0 0 5 ^ { * * } )$ with an adjusted $R ^ { 2 }$ of $0 . 3 7 9$ . For every point increase in start-of-term vocabulary test score, change in vocabulary test score decreased by 0.80 $( \beta = - 0 . 8 0 ,$ $S E = 0 . 1 9$ $p < . 0 0 5 ^ { * * } )$ , and for every point increase in Memrise score the change in vocabulary test score increased by 0,000015 $( \beta = 0 , 0 0 0 0 1 5$ $S E = 0 , 0 0 0 0 0 7$ $p < . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ . Thus, whilst those starting the term with higher vocabulary proficiency levels did not make as large gains in their vocabulary tet scores as those starting with lower scores. the use of Memrise was generally helpful for learners of al levels in improving their vocabulary test core over the course of the term. Table 3 displays class averages for start-of-term vocabulary test score, end-of-term vocabulary test score, change in vocabulary test score, Memrise score and content-essay score.

Independent samplet-tests were then carried out to analyse between-class differences in the average scores between the start and end-of-term ocabulary test and the average change in vocabulary test cores acrossthe term. A comparison of average scores between Class 1 and Class 2 s shown in Table4. There were no significant dfferences in vocabulary test scores between the two groups at the beginning of term $t ( 5 3 ) = - 0 . 1 8 6$ $p = . 8 5$ , or end of term $t ( 5 3 ) = 0 . 3 8 4$ $p = . 7 0$ Although the intervention group's mean change in vocabulary test score between the start and end of term was 0.52 greater than that of the control group, this was not a statistically significant difference $t ( 5 3 ) = 0 . 5 9 2$ $p = . 5 6$

These results suggest the promotion of VLSs and the Memrise app provided benefits in language proficiency gains for Class 1 learners. However, the evidence for it being a worthwhile intervention is not resounding owing to the mean differences in change in vocabulary test score btween the interention class (las1) and he control class (las 2) not reaching statistcal sinificance. Given the varying degres to which individual students engaged with the Memrise app, t seems that motivation to use this resource is an important variable affecting how much vocabulary test scores changed within Class 1 overall.

7.3. Does promotion of VLSs and use of the Memrise app lead to improved content-essay scores?

To consider this question, learners content-esay score was made the outcome variable in a multiple regresson model. The model examined the effct that end-of-term vocabulary test score, change in vocabulary test core and Memrise score had upon content-essay scores within Class 1. A significant regression equation was found $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 2 6 ) = 5 . 3 3 p < . 0 5 ^ { \ast } )$ with an $R ^ { 2 }$ value of 0.41. The result indicates that end-of-term vocabulary test score was a significant predictor of content-essay score ${ \mathrm { \Delta } } \beta = - 1 . 0 3 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ $S E = 0 . 2 9$ $p < . 0 0 5 ^ { * * } )$ For each increase of one mark in the vocabulary test, content essay scores increased by just over one mark. However, change in vocabulary test score $( \beta = - 0 . 1 4$ $S E = 0 . 2 3$ $p = . 1 7 \mathrm { . }$ and Memrise score $( \beta = - 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 5$ $S E = 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 8 ,$ $p = . 5 5 \mathrm { , }$ were non-significant

negative predictors.

The model thus suggests that, whilst having a higher level of vocabulary proficiency facilitated better achievement in the content essay asignment, some leaners who prioritised improvements in vocabulary proficiency and using the Memrise app may have done so at expense to their content-essay scores. This indicates the use of Memrise was most beneficial for those who started the term with lower vocabulary test scores and needed to improve their proficiency in order to cope with the demands posed by studying academic content in English. Those starting with higher scores may well have already been at a sufficient levelt feel comfortable engaging in the EMI course content without needing to dedicate time toward effortful language learning. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution as the negative effcts of change in vocabulary test and Memrise scores on content-esay scores did not reach statistical significance.

Finally, an independent samples t-test revealed there was ittle dfference in the intervention and control group's end-of-term mean content-essay scores, $t ( 5 3 ) = 0 . 3 1 1 , p = . 7 5$ (see Table 5). This would seem to suggest that the instruction did not notably impact upon the intervention group's mean content-essay score at the end of term.

# 8. Term 2 methodology

Afer reflection on the results of the intervention in Term 1, it was decided that providing online strategy instruction with a more intensive focus on modelling a range of online resources and VLSs be implemented. An online course was created on a Moode platform. The activities on the course demonstrated the use of resources and strategies using general academic vocabulary items selected from the Oxford Learner Dictionary's academic wordlist (Oxford Learner's Dictionaries, 2021) and more specialised subject-specific vocabulary either elected from the Oxford Learner Dictionary's TV, Radio and News topic wordlist (Oxford Learner's Topics Dictionaries, 2021), or chosen by the EMI teacher from the materials of the comparative journalism module. After each activity, learners completed a brief reflection questionnaire which asked them to evaluate the usefulness of the strategy or resource and state how likely they would be to use it in the future. The course promoted the following online resources:

learner dictionaries $\bullet$ thesauruses $\bullet$ corpora $\bullet$ collocation dictionaries $\bullet$ flashcard makers

As well as being useful for leaning vocabulary encountered during study, it was reasoned that most of these resources would assist learners in completing ther content-eay at the end of ter. Lener dictionaries, theauruses and collocation dictionaries can readily be consulted during the process of writing an essay to aid the expression of meaning. Learners were also taken through the steps of using an online corpus so that they could understand how to use this resource to find multiple examples of a word being used in

sentence contexts to help them consider its meaning.

All the strategies promoted on the online course are shown in Table 6. Following Cohen (2014), they are categorised by function. The table captures the multi-functional nature of many of the stratgies. As reflection on a stratey was integrated into the desin of the course, a metacognitive element was added for all the strategies that learners were trained on. The instruction took advantage of Moodle's quiz and leson modules to demonstrate the use f online resources and VLSs in a structured way. For example, to promote the use of visual strategie, leaners were introduced to flashcard techniques which incorporated avisual mnemonic for learning target journalism vocabulary (Fig. 1).

Example visual flashcard technique.

They were then given links to wesites which allow leaners to create electronic flashcards with visuals and intructed tocreate an image flashcard for new item of vocabulary. Finally, learners completed a reflection questionnaire requiring them to rate how useful they found the visual flashcard strategy, and how likely they would be to use it during their EMI course.

In many activities, the modelling of a new strategy was done in combination with other strategies that had previously ben demonstrated. For example, a sequence was presented which involved learners guessing the meaning of a word from context, then checking it i a leaner dictionary, then writing down the translation and then an example sentence. Leaners were thereafter required to apply this sequence themselves with selected vocabulary items. This approach helped to renforce the stratgies that had previously been practised, encouraged the application of strategies in sequences, and ensured a high involvement load was often integrated into the learning of the lexical items.

All learners were given a questionnaire before and after the training requring them to self-evaluate their frequency of use of a number of VLSs that the online course provided training in using, most of which were contingent on the use of online resources (Appendix 3). These strategy-use questionnares were completed in classunder supervision of the teacher who provided clarification on the meaning of unknown terminology as necessary.Vocabulary tests of the same dificulty level were administered at the start and end of term, and learners completed an essay at the end of term to asses their understanding of knowledge relating to comparaive journalism that was taught as part of the content syllabus.

To ensure all students received an opportunity to benefit from an intervention, the control group was switched from Clas 1 to Class 2. Learners in Clas 1, however, were made aware f the online strategy training course, and encouraged to sign up for it during the first few weeks of term. This led to the creation of athird group of learners who completed both interventions. New activities promoting strategies and resources were added incrementally throughout the term, and learners in Class 2 were instructed by the teacher to complete them as part of their homework requirements. Learners in the newly created third group accessed the online course and completed the activities without being obliged to by the teacher. Because the study now involved three ifferent groups studying under different conditions across two classes, the term group' will hereon be used instead of 'class' to distinguish the different sets of learners.

The same students who started Term 1 with very high or low vocabulary scores were excluded from the Term 2 analysis. In addition, one leaner from Group 2 let the course to join an exchange program and two learners from Group 2 were excluded owing to very late or low participation in the resource and VLS course. This led to the following groups and conditions:

: Group 1: Control $( \mathtt { n } = 2 4 $ : Group 2: Compulsory online resource and VLS training $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 5 \right)$ - : Group 3: Voluntary online resource and VLS training ${ ( \mathtt { n } = 3 ) }$

# 9. Term 2 results

9.1. To what extent does use of online resources and VLSs change during the term?

To consider which resources and VLSs learners found valuable, and to make comparisons between the intervention and contrl groups, statistical analyses of start and end-of-term strategy-use questionnaires were conducted. Group 3 were merged with Group 1 for the start-of-term analysis as they had both received the same intervention in Term 1, with Group 2 serving as the control group. At the start of Term 2, Group 1/3 had higher self-reported scores than Group 2 in 8 out of the 13 strategies. Independent-samplet-tests were conducted on each category to compare start-of-term scores between groups. A significant difference was found for 7) record collocations, where Group 1/3 had a 1.07 difference in the mean use of this strategy, $T ( 5 0 ) = 3 . 3 6 8$ $p < . 0 0 5$ , and 12) record words with the same root where Group 1/3 had a 0.72 higher mean score than Group : $2 \ T ( 5 0 ) = 2 . 1 4 7$ $p < . 0 5$ These differences may have reflected knowledge of strategies gained from the Term 1 intervention. Fig. 2illustrates the between-group differences at the start f term for each strategy:

At the end of term, paired-sample t-tests were conducted to consider changes in the strategy use of Group 1 and Group 2/3. Group 3 were now merged with Group 2 rather than Group 1 as these learners completed the Term 2 intervention. Group 1 now served as the control group having not completed it. Group 1's slf-reported strategy use showed modest changes in some categories, but none were statistically significant following paired sample t-tests (Fig. 3).

The intervention groups (Group 2 and Group 3 combined) showed more profound changes in self-reported use of resources and vocabulary learning strategies (Fig. 4). Learners reported increased use for twelve of the thrtee strategies. Moreover, two of these reached statistical significance in paired-sample t-tests. These were 10) create a visual image: $T ( 2 7 ) = 2 . 2 2 0$ $p = < 0 . 5$ , and 12) record root words: $T ( 2 7 ) = 3 . 2 9 2$ $p = < 0 . 0 5$

9.2. Does providing technology-enhanced training in using online resources and VLS enhance vocabulary proficiency outcomes?

To answer this question a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to examine the effect that the following independent variables had upon learners' change in vocabulary test score between the start and end of term:

: start-of-term vocabulary test score : end-of-term strategy-use questionnaire score

: total change in strategy-use questionnaire score (between the start and end of term) group (1. Control 2. Compulsory resource and VLS training 3. Voluntary resource and VLS training)

The model met al the necessary assumptions of regression. It found that start-of-term vocabulary test score was significant in negatively predicting change in vocabulary test score, whilst end-of-term strategy-use questionnaire score and Group 3 were signif. icant positive predictors. The regression equation was significant $( F ( 5 , 4 6 ) = 8 . 8 1 5 p < . 0 0 1 )$ with an adjusted $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.434. Students' change in vocabulary test score decreased by 0.45 for every point achieved in the start-of-term vocabulary test $( \beta = - 0 . 4 5$ $S E = 0 . 1 0 , p$ $< . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast \ast } )$ , but increased by 0.13 for each point increase on the strategy-use questionnaire $( \beta = 0 . 1 3$ $S E = 0 . 0 5 p < . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ . Compared to Group 3, Group 1 were associated with a $- 4 . 1 3$ difference in change in vocabulary test score between the start and end of the term $( \beta =$ -4.13, SE 1.29, $p < . 0 0 1 ^ { * * * } )$ , and Group 2 were associated with a $- 3 . 4 9$ difference $( \beta = - 3 . 4 9 ,$ $S E = 1 . 2 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 ^ { * * * } \big )$ . Comparing Group 1 with Group 2 revealed that change in vocabulary test score was not statistically significant $( \beta = - 0 . 6 3$ $S E = 0 . 6 2$ $p = . 3 1 \cdot$ Change in strategy-use score was also a non-statistically significant predictor in the model $( \beta = - 0 . 0 8$ ${ \bf S E } = 0 . 0 6$ $p = . 1 9 \AA$

The results provide some evidence that the instruction in using online resources and VLSs assisted learners in improving ther vocabulary proficiency. End-of-term strategy-use questionnaire score was a significant predictor of change in vocabulary test score, indicating that those who made more frequent use of resources and strategies tended to make higher gains in their vocabulary proficiency.

The scatterplot in Fig. 5 ilustrates the positive correlational relationship between change in vocabulary test score and end-of-term strategy-use score $( \mathbf { r } ( 5 0 ) = 0 . 3 9 , p < . 0 0 5 ^ { * * } )$ . The $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value was 0.15, signifying that $1 5 \%$ of the variance in change in vocabulary test scores can be explained by a model containing solely end-of-term strategy-use scores.

9.3. Does providing technology-enhanced training in using online resources and VLSs enhance content-assessment outcomes?

A stepwise multipl regression was conducted to identif significant predictors of content-essay score from group, end-of-term vocabulary test score, change in vocabulary test score, end-of-term strategy-use score and change in strategy-use score. Afer inspection for outliers, one student with a standardised residual of $- 4 . 3 8$ was removed. The predicted score according to the model was 84.84 compared to an actual score of 60. This was deemed extreme enough to warrant removal from the analysis. The multiple regression model found a significant equation $( \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 4 8 ) = 1 5 . 5 0 3 p < . 0 0 1 )$ , with an adjusted $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.367. End-of-term vocabulary test score and change in strategy-use score were statistically significant positive predictors of learners' content-essay scores. For each increase of one point in leaners change in strategy-use core between the start and end of term, final content essy scores went up by 0.19 ( $\beta = - 0 . 1 9$ $S E = 0 . 0 8$ $p = < . 0 5 ^ { * } .$ . Content-essay scores also increased by 0.93 for every point that learners gained on the end-ofterm vocabulary test $( \beta = - 0 . 9 3$ $S E = 0 . 1 9$ $p = < . 0 0 1 ^ { * * * } )$ . Group, change in vocabulary test score and end of term strategy-use score were excluded variables in the model.

The scatterplot in Fig. 6 depicts the positive correlational relationship between content-essay scores and change in strategy-use scores, $( \mathrm { r } ( 4 9 ) = 0 . 2 8$ $p = . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ . The $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ value was 0.076 so $7 . 6 \%$ of the variance in content-essay scores can be explained by a model containing change in strategy-use scores alone.

Group was not a significant predictor in the multiple regresson model. However, when analysing this variable without covariates, the mean difference in content-essay score between Group 1 and Group 3 reaches statistical significance in an independent samples ttest $T ( 2 5 ) = - 2 . 1 8 7$ $\pmb { p = < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * * } }$ , as does the mean difference between Group 2 and Group 3, $T ( 2 6 ) = - 2 . 8 0 8$ $\pmb { p = < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * * } }$ . The mean difference in content-essay scores between Group 1 and Group 2, however, was not statistically significant $T ( 4 7 ) = - 1 . 4 6 5$ $p = . 1 5 0$

# 10. Discussion

# 10.1. The effect of technology-enhanced VLS instruction on vocabulary proficiency

As in Term 1, learners starting the term with lower vocabulary test scores tended to make more significant gains in their vocabulary proficiency, as measured by the difference between test scores at the start and end of term. Nonetheles, studying the EMI course was not detrimental to the vocabulary proficiency of those who started the term with higher scores; gains in vocabulary test scores were more modest in nature, but flls were rare. One reason for this may be that the lower-lel proficiency learners were more preoccupied with improving their English level, whilst higher-lel students devoted more effrts towards content leaning. Another reason may e that there is a plateau effct which makes proficiency improvements more difficult at upper-intermediate and advanced levels.

In general, those who had higher strategy-use scores at the end of term tended to make better improvements in their vocabulary test score over the course of the term than those with lower strategy-use scores, roviding evidence for the enefit of supplementary online resource and strategy training in improving vocabulary proficiency. This result echoes previous research in EFL settings with Chinese learners of English that has found the use of a range of vocabulary learning strategies to be associated with improved performance in learning new vocabulary items (Yang & Wu 2015; Lan, 2013).

# 10.2. The effect of technology-enhanced resource and strategy training on content-essay scores

End-of-term vocabulary test score and change in strategy-use score both had significant relationships with content-essay scores in the regression model. That vocabulary proficiency should have a positive impact upon content-esay scores is not greatly surprising, given that writing an academic essay demands a decent command of vocabulary. Nonetheles, the fact that change in strategy-use was also positivel associatd wth content-ess score i th model is inriguing. hi incrs inthe us f reoure nd strati is ne might argue, rreentative of lerners who took rfletive approachto the onine strate instuction in partcuar, i catres those learners willing to experiment with the resources and strategies that were presented to them and adopt those that they found valuable into their learning routines. I can, therefore, be argued to reflet leners who alied a high level of metacognition, a characteristic linked to successful second language learning in applied linguistics research (Cohen, 2014, p. 19).

A question arises in relation to what extent the resources promoted on the online course were exploited by learners when engaged in the process of writing their content essy. It would seem a reasonable assumption that learners availed themselves of the online resources they had been trained to use for this purpose, iven the results of the regresson model and the nature of many of the resources being useful aids to essay writing. Unfortunately, owing to time constrains, it was not possile to ollect qualitative intervie data to explore findings from the quantitative analysis in more detail toestablish the degre to which leaners used the resources whilst writing their content essays.

# 10.3. The effect of motivation on vocabulary proficiency development and content-essay scores

This action research project was exploratory in nature and did not set out to measure learner motivation. Nonetheles, it emerged as an important theme during the study. Giving learners who had taken part in the instruction in the frs term the option of voluntarily completing further technology-enhanced VLS training in the second term captured a small subset of learners who demonstrated naturall high level of motivation (Group 3) In comparison to the other groups, this group showed significantl beter performance in improving thir vocabulary test scores across the duration of the academic year i adtion to achieving higher than average contentessay scores at the end of each term. able 7 lustrates the results of Group 3 in these areas in comparison to Group 1 and 2, bringing to light their high levels of engagement in the training interventions and superior academic performance.

Having the volition to complete the online resource and strategy course without any external pressure from the teacher demon strates these lerners', \*abilit and willingness to take responsibility for one's learning (Oxford, 2017, p. 81), a defining feature of learner autonomy in the Strategic Self-Regulation Theory advanced by Oxford (2017). In this model, self-regulation overlaps with learner autonomy but i distinguishable by its focus on identifiable actions (Oxford, 2017, p. 83). Actions the Group 3 learners ook to achieve high changes in stratey-use or Memrise score entail processes inherent in Oxfords slf-regulation model, such a attending to and concentrating on instruction, monitoring performance, evaluating effctivenes of trategie, and using resources effctively

Group 3 learners thus show evidence of moving from being other regulated to self-regulated i their use of resources and strategies through technology-assted mediation. This is an encouraging finding as it has previously been highlighted that Chinese university students studying at universities in China often remain other-regulated throughout the period of their universty course (Tao & Gao, 2017). Group 3 did, though, only consist of a minority of students who opted to take the Term 2 resource and strategy training course, and it is not clear what factors influenced them to complet it voluntarily, nor what factors layed a role in Group 1 learners opting not to complete it.

As self-regulation runs on a battery of motivation, understanding the driving forces compelling learners to engage in the training and go on to use the resources and strategies autonomously would shine a brighter light on the nature of their motivation. It is, therefore, unfortunate that this study could not collct qualitative data to analyse learner motivation in closer detail. Two previous investigations in EMI contexts have done so (Lasagabaster, 2015; Rose et al., 2019), both using Dornyei's construct of the ideal L2 possible self, which is one of three components of the L2 Motivational Self System (Dornyei, 2009). The findings of these studies found conflicting results with students ideal L2 self being a significant predictor of EMI succes in Lasagabaster's study, but not in Rose et al.s. Learners in the lattr study nonetheless identified motivation as being important in the qualitative interview data, leading the authors o conclude that \*altenative motivational constructs might prove to be better predictors of succes for content learning (Rose et al., 2019, p. 10).

Self-determination theory provides an illuminating way to consider motivation in the context of this study. In this theory, a person's motivation is categorised according to its perceived locus of causality, which can either be internal, hence in line with the self and autonomously motivated, or external, hence either partially internalised or external to the self (Deci & Ryan, 200). Autonomy is distinct from independence, as a person can be \*autonomously dependent" (Deci & Ryan, 200, p. 185). Le (2017, 223) points out that, regarding determining whether a learner's behaviour is internally located and hence volitional, the cetral isue . is whether learners truly endorse their behaviour".

It seems reasonable to attribute the quality of self-endorsement to Group 3 in virtue of their completing the online resource and strategy training without external pressure to do so. Group 2, on the other hand, completed this online course owing to a teacherimposed requirement. Whilst this suggests autonomously dependent behaviour, completion of the course for some learners in this group could also have been self-endorsed. Qualitive methods designed to probe the source of learner motivation as they engage in strategy instruction with reference to self-determination theory could be a fruitful way of advancing our understanding of the relationship between motivation, self-regulation and learning outcomes in EMI support settings.

# 11. Conclusion

The results of this study show that technology-enhanced support with a focus on online resources and VLSs has potential to aid learners in developing language proficiency in mixed-ability EMI support setins and may also ass them in achieving improved content-esay scores. The fact that such training can be provided online makes it a practical option for universities which might not have large budgets for language support. The technology-enhanced instruction supported leaners to use resources and strategies in an other-regulated manner, and this evidently prompted a movement towards self-regulation within some learners.

The findings could have been buttessed if the experimental design had included a qualitative interview component and a quantitative method of measuring motivation at the start and end of term. Nonetheles, one of the benefits of the cyclical nature of action research is that future iterations can build upon past findings. Hence a new cycle of action research that integrates these aspects is planned. It is anticipated that ths will provide deeper insights into the complex dynamic between vocabulary proficiency, language support, content learning and motivation affcting learner outcomes on EMI programmes comprising leaners of mixed-level English ability.
