# Promoting minority language use to foster revitalisation:

# Insights from new speakers of West Frisian

Language planners are increasingly aware of the importance of new speakers (individuals acquiring a language outside the home, typically later-on in life) for the revitalisation of minority languages. Yet, little is known about new speakers’ activation (the process by which they become active and habitual minority language users). This article presents a questionnaire-based investigation of new speakers’ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } - 2 6 4$ ) use of West Frisian in Fryslân, Netherlands – and the role traditional speakers play in new speakers’ activation. Qualitative and quantitative data show that participants use West Frisian only rarely; and when they do use it, it is mainly in the classroom. Minority language interactions outside the classroom, with traditional speakers, consist mostly of a few tokenistic words or phrases. The findings show to what extent different behaviours by traditional speakers discourage and/or encourage new speakers’ minority language use, highlighting how the complex dynamics between the speaker groups are hindering revitalisation efforts. The article discusses the implications of these findings for language planning to promote the activation of new speakers, and thereby the revitalisation of West Frisian.

# 1. Introduction

Minority language research has largely moved away from notions of reversing language shift, focusing instead on language revitalisation. Reversing language shift was conceptualised by Fishman (1991: 1) as ‘assistance to speech communities whose native languages are threatened’. Fishman’s widely-cited model exemplifies how, until recently, the primary concern of most researchers – as well as most policy makers and language planners – was the restoration of intergenerational transmission in the home. Such work often aimed to redress the social and political injustices experienced by minorities; yet it entailed a problematic reification of ‘native’ language communities (O’Rourke & Pujolar 2013). There was an implicit understanding that ‘successful intergenerational transmission should produce age-appropriate carbon-copy speakers modelled on earlier generations of the minority language community’ (Hornsby 2022: 4). This was linked to an iconic conception of minority languages and those who traditionally used them (Dunmore 2021). Consequently, little attention was paid to the acquisition of minority languages later-on in life, outside the home, and by those who were not part of these traditional communities. However, despite concerted efforts to reverse language shift, in many places the numbers of minority language users continued to dwindle due to urbanisation, economic modernisation, and globalisation (O’Rourke & Pujolar 2013). This led to an understanding that planning measures of various kinds – going beyond the promotion of intergenerational transmission in the home – are needed to ensure the future of minority languages (Hornsby 2022). Thus, while Fishman’s theoretical stance regarding the importance of intergenerational transmission in the home remains influential (Kircher 2022a), the focus of the research literature has largely moved from reversing language shift to language revitalisation, which is defined more inclusively as ‘the attempt to add new linguistic forms or social functions to an embattled minority language with the aim of increasing its uses or users’ (King 2001: 24).

This shift in focus has entailed a greater valorisation of new speakers – that is, ‘individuals with little or no home or community exposure to a minority language but who instead acquire it through immersion or bilingual educational programs, revitalization projects or as adult language learners’ (O’Rourke et al. 2015: 1).1 The term new speakers has been used to describe individuals with a wide range of competences. Previously, such individuals might have been labelled as, for example, non-native or $L 2$ speakers. Yet, in line with a problematisation of the notion of nativeness, the introduction of the term new speakers constitutes an explicit attempt to move away from the delegitimisation implied by previously-used labels (O’Rourke & Pujolar 2013). In many minority language contexts, there are now substantial groups of new speakers, and it has come to be recognised in the research literature that they can be central to revitalisation efforts (Hornsby 2015). Notably, new speakers not only increase the overall number of minority language users; they also have the potential to promote language use amongst traditional speakers – by expanding the social networks of minority-language-speaking adults and bolstering the communities in which minoritylanguage-speaking children are raised.

The emergence of new speakers as a salient phenomenon has important implications for language policy and planning,2 highlighting the need for more inclusive revitalisation goals and a wider range of measures to achieve these goals. Yet, it remains rare that the potentially pivotal role of new speakers is recognised in official language policies (see Dunmore 2021 for exceptions). Moreover, in most contexts where planning measures regarding new speakers have been implemented, the main concern has been the promotion of minority language acquisition through the education system – with language planners hoping that this would socialise new speakers into frequent language use (Dunmore 2018). Yet, as Baker (2011: 265) notes: ‘Potential does not necessarily lead to production’. Indeed, research from various contexts indicates that new speakers’ knowledge of minority languages does not automatically turn them into regular users of these languages (see Dunmore 2018 for an overview). This underscores the importance of activation – the process by which new speakers become active and habitual users of the minority languages they have learnt (Urla & Ramallo 2022). While a certain level of proficiency is evidently necessary for this to happen, it is crucial to bear in mind that social and contextual variables are also vital: activation is ‘inherently social and relational in its practical realisation’ (Urla & Ramallo 2022: 4).

In fact, social and relational issues are at the root of what makes the promotion of minority language use amongst new speakers so challenging. Two interrelated points need to be considered here: firstly, the issue of linguistic insecurity, and secondly, the question of who is deemed a legitimate speaker. Many minority language communities have been marginalised by majority language speakers, and they have had to struggle for support and recognition. It is not uncommon for traditional speakers to be stereotyped as ‘stupid peasants’ and to be ridiculed because of the way they speak (McEwan-Fujita 2010: 48). Relatedly, many traditional speakers of minority languages have been subjected to linguistic discrimination. By contrast, new speakers are generally taught standardised varieties of minority languages, which are commonly considered the only appropriate varieties in the education system – and which are therefore important for the achievement of educational and socio-economic success (Coughlan 2021). These standardised varieties tend to be quite different from those used by traditional speakers. In interactions between traditional and new speakers, it is thus not uncommon for the former to feel insecure because they think the way they speak is not ‘good enough’, while the latter worry that the way they speak is not ‘traditional enough’ (Hornsby 2019: 396). At the same time, many traditional speakers deem the standardised varieties of minority languages – as well as those who use them – to be inauthentic. Consequently, tensions regarding hierarchies of speakers are prevalent in most contemporary minority language contexts (Hornsby 2015). These tensions can amplify new speakers’ linguistic insecurity and preclude them from developing a sense of belonging to the local minority language community (Sallabank & Marquis 2018). As a result, new speakers may be deterred from using minority languages altogether (McEwan-Fujita 2010). The power dynamics between traditional and new speakers are thus complex, and they can hinder the success of revitalisation efforts.

Policy makers and language planners therefore find themselves in the difficult position of having to consolidate the needs of traditional and new speakers. Regarding the latter, it has become increasingly clear that the focus ought to be not only on acquisition but also on activation. Yet, no previous research has systematically investigated the ways in which traditional speakers influence new speakers’ language practices. An understanding of this is needed to inform language policy and planning to effectively promote the activation of new speakers and thereby contribute to the revitalisation of minority languages.

Here, we present a study that investigates new speakers’ minority language use and how it is affected by traditional minority language speakers’ behaviours. The study focuses on West Frisian – a minority language spoken almost exclusively in the province of Fryslân, in the north of the Netherlands. It is related to North and East Frisian, two minority languages spoken in Germany; however, this paper focuses solely on West Frisian, which we will henceforth simply refer to as Frisian. Most adult new speakers learn Frisian at the Algemiene Fryske Ûnderrjocht Kommisje – the General Frisian Education Commission, typically abbreviated as Afûk. By means of a questionnaire, we collected quantitative as well as qualitative data from 264 new speakers enrolled in Afûk courses. Our research questions (RQs) were:

o RQ1: What are the language use patterns of new speakers of Frisian? RQ2: How comfortable do new speakers feel using Frisian with traditional speakers compared to fellow new speakers?   
o RQ3: What behaviour by traditional speakers discourages new speakers from using Frisian?   
o RQ4: What behaviour by traditional speakers encourages new speakers to use Frisian?   
The aim is of this study is two-fold: firstly, to provide more comprehensive and nuanced insights   
into the dynamics of new speakers’ activation; and secondly, to inform actionable science   
communication for policy makers and language planners in Fryslân. To contextualise the study, we   
begin with a brief overview of the situation in this province.

# 2. Frisian in Fryslân

Fryslân has almost 650.000 inhabitants, of whom $89 \%$ understand, $70 \%$ speak, $59 \%$ read, and $1 9 \%$ write Frisian (Klinkenberg et al. 2018). Practically all Frisian speakers are bilingual speakers of Dutch, and UNESCO (2010) has classified the language as being vulnerable. This vulnerability arose in the last century. In addition to the global trend of minority language speakers shifting to majority languages with higher prestige and utilitarian value, mobility played a key role: there was an influx of non-Frisian speakers into the (hitherto homogeneously Frisian-speaking) rural areas of Fryslân, while many Frisian speakers moved to the province’s (predominantly Dutch-speaking) urban areas. These trends contributed to – and were, in turn, amplified by – a decline in intergenerational transmission (Gorter et al. 1984).

In recent decades, there has been an increase in status planning – that is, measures to regulate the official role of the language (Kloss 1969). In 1996, the Netherlands ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority languages, thereby committing to the protection and promotion of Frisian. In 2005, the Netherlands ratified the Framework Convention for National Minorities, thereby making the Frisians the country’s only officially recognised national minority. In 2010, the Dutch parliament decided to anchor the status of Frisian as an official language in its constitution. Based on the 2018 Administrative Agreement on Frisian Language and Culture, language maintenance and revitalisation are not only the responsibility of the national government but also, to a large extent, delegated to the provincial government of Fryslân (see Bayat et al. 2022 for more detail).

The promotion of a language is inextricably connected with the question of which variety of that language should be advanced (Oakes & Warren 2007; Kircher 2016). In Fryslân, this is the standardised variety of Frisian, and the standardisation process has constituted a key component of corpus planning – that is, the modification of the forms and structures of the language (Kloss 1969). Frisian has three main regional varieties: Súdwesthoeksk, Wâldfrysk, and Klaaifrysk. The latter constituted the main basis for the development of the standard. This process was affected by

concerns regarding the influence of Dutch, which led to a preference for forms that are linguistically different from the majority language, including numerous archaisms. The resulting standard is not only different from Súdwesthoeksk and Wâldfrysk but also from the Klaaifrysk of traditional speakers. Standardised Frisian is codified in dictionaries, grammar books, and teaching materials (see Hilton et al. 2020 for more detail).3

Much effort has been invested in acquisition planning – that is, measures to promote knowledge of the language (Cooper 1989). Fryslân’s strategy to encourage intergenerational transmission is exemplified by the “taalkado” (language gift): a box parents receive when they register their new-borns, which contains practical items to promote children’s Frisian acquisition alongside information to support the parents. The province also aims to foster the learning of Frisian through nurseries, schools, and higher education institutions (see Hilton et al. 2020 for more detail). Frisian teaching outside the traditional education system is offered primarily at Afûk. Yet, the focus of provincial acquisition planning has been very much on primary, and to a lesser extent secondary schools (Duarte & van der Meij 2018). Notably, not all Frisians are satisfied with – or even aware of – existing educational provisions (Kuipers-Zandberg & Kircher 2020).

To date, there have been no concerted prestige planning efforts – that is, measures relating to the ‘psychological background’ of Frisian speakers (Haarmann 1990: 104). While prestige planning is less clearly defined than the other planning types, it broadly includes measures regarding language communities’ attitudes, ideologies, and social identities (Haarmann 1984). Relatedly, it is notable that the activation of new speakers is neither anchored in any official policies, nor has it been the explicit focus of previous language planning measures.

# 3. New speakers’ minority language use

In the following sections, we state our hypotheses regarding new speakers’ use of Frisian, and we provide an account of the literature that motivated these hypotheses.

# 3.1 Language use patterns

There is much evidence of traditional speakers’ reluctance to use the local minority language with new speakers – and this has also been reported in Fryslân (Belmar 2019). As noted above, traditional speakers’ reluctance is oftentimes due to their own linguistic insecurity (Hornsby 2019) and/or their view of new speakers as lacking legitimacy (Coughlan 2021). Yet, whatever the reason: this reluctance generally exacerbates new speakers’ linguistic insecurity and precludes their development of a sense of belonging to the minority language community. Traditional speakers are seen ‘almost as a secret society or club with an audible membership card to belong to the community’ (Sallabank & Marquis 2018: 80). Such ingroup-outgroup dynamics tend to leave new speakers hesitant to use the minority language with traditional speakers, sometimes even deterring them from using it altogether (McEwan-Fujita 2010).

There is only one previous study that explicitly set out to examine language use amongst new speakers of Frisian: namely that by Belmar (2019), who collected data from participants enrolled in Afûk classes. The study’s analyses did not distinguish between new speakers and heritage speakers. Nonetheless, the findings are insightful: most participants reported that, in their everyday lives, they used only or predominantly Dutch. The classroom was the context in which most participants reported using at least some Frisian – and the most frequently-named interlocutors for Frisian conversations were classmates and teachers. Similar patterns have been observed amongst new speakers in other contexts (O’Rourke 2011). Consequently, our hypotheses (Hs) were:

o H1a: In a typical week, the only context in which most new speakers use Frisian more often than Dutch is in their Afûk classes.   
o H1b: In a typical week, most new speakers use Frisian more often with fellow new speakers than with traditional speakers.   
o H1c: In a typical week, most new speakers use Frisian no more than $20 \%$ of the time.

# 3.2 Levels of comfort with different interlocutors

No previous studies have explicitly compared new speakers’ levels of comfort when conversing with traditional speakers versus fellow new speakers. However, Belmar (2019) examined his participants’ levels of comfort with a range of interlocutors, and the largest percentage reported feeling most comfortable with their classmates – many of whom were new speakers. Based on this and on the complex power dynamics between the speaker groups, we hypothesised: o H2: New speakers feel more comfortable using Frisian with fellow new speakers than with traditional speakers.

# 3.3 The discouragement and encouragement of language use

In addition to the aforementioned reluctance to converse with new speakers in the minority language at all, traditional speakers also commonly switch to the majority language during conversations that started off in the minority language. Moreover, they frequently and unpromptedly correct new speakers’ mistakes, and they often laugh at new speakers. Research from various minority language contexts has shown that these reactions leave new speakers feeling belittled and disappointed (McEwan-Fujita 2010), ashamed (Dołowy-Rybińska 2018), disparaged (Sallabank & Marquis 2018), judged and frustrated (Coughlan 2021), and with diminished confidence (Dunmore 2016). However, no previous studies have systematically investigated the extent to which traditional speakers’ different behaviours affect new speakers’ language use.

New speakers often perceive traditional speakers’ reluctance to engage with them in the minority language as a sign of rudeness (O’Rourke 2011). Switches to – and use of – the majority language can feel like a form of rejection (Coughlan 2021). However, it is also possible to construe traditional speakers’ switches to – and use of – the majority language as an indication of politeness. Indeed, many traditional speakers have been socialised into an ‘etiquette of accommodation’: they were taught that it is inappropriate and rude to speak the minority language in the presence of majority language speakers (McEwan-Fujita 2010).

Traditional speakers’ corrections, too, can feel like a form of rejection – and they may entail an unwelcome shift in power dynamics which makes new speakers feel like they are being relegated from an equal interlocutor to a pupil who is being evaluated by their teacher (McEwan-Fujita 2010). Nonetheless, corrections could also be interpreted positively, as a genuine attempt to help new speakers improve their language skills.

By contrast, laughing at new speakers cannot be interpreted as either an attempt to help or as a sign of politeness. We therefore hypothesised:

o H3: What most discourages new speakers from using Frisian is traditional speakers’ mockery.

There is no literature on traditional speakers’ encouragement of new speakers. We decided to investigate four behaviours that could be deemed encouraging: speaking slowly, using easy words, checking in regularly to ensure understanding, and explicitly encouraging new speakers to keep using Frisian. The first three could be interpreted merely as attempts to facilitate conversations. The fourth, by contrast, is a clear signal that traditional speakers welcome new speakers’ use of the minority language. Consequently, we hypothesised:

o H4: What most encourages new speakers to use Frisian is traditional speakers’ explicit encouragement.

# 4. Methodology

To test our hypotheses, we collected quantitative and qualitative data by means of the Language Activation of New Speakers (LANS) questionnaire, which, prior to the main data collection, was piloted to test the items and instructions. The LANS questionnaire is part of a larger survey by means of which we also investigated new speakers’ language attitudes and ideologies (Kircher et al., under review) and their motivations for learning Frisian (Kircher & Vellinga, in preparation). Our hypotheses and data analysis plan were pre-registered; the LANS questionnaire, the preregistration, and our R analysis code are available on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/4n3cf/?view_only $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \delta \pi } } } } } $ 2eb0006ba5fb4e6ab2b9d867c71a1c43

# 4.1 Procedure

Data collection took place between November 2020 and February 2022. Initially, the questionnaire was distributed via teachers to participants who were taking in-person classes at Afûk. When teaching had to be moved online due to COVID-19-related restrictions, data collection was also moved online. In addition to distributing an electronic version of the LANS questionnaire to participants taking online classes at that time, we also shared it via mailing lists for participants who had been enrolled in Afûk classes between 2018 and 2020. To avoid deterring anyone with limited Frisian reading and writing skills from participating, the questionnaire was made available in Dutch and English, and participants could respond in the language of their choice. All eligible participants responded in Dutch.

# 4.2 Participants

The participant sample consisted of 264 new speakers of Frisian – that is, individuals who did not have Frisian (or a City Frisian variety) as their L1, and who had received little or no home exposure to the language when they were growing up. All were over 18 and lived in Fryslân.4 $9 . 9 \%$ were born in the province, $8 4 . 8 \%$ elsewhere in the Netherlands, $4 . 5 \%$ outside the country, and $0 . 8 \%$ did not report their birthplace. $3 3 . 1 \%$ lived in urban areas and $6 6 . 9 \%$ in rural areas. Their ages ranged from 23 to 82, with a mean age of 55 years. $6 0 . 4 \%$ identified as female, $3 8 . 8 \%$ as male, and $0 . 8 \%$ did not indicate their gender. A majority of $9 3 . 9 \%$ had Dutch as their sole L1; $4 . 2 \%$ had Dutch and other languages as their L1s, and a mere $1 . 9 \%$ had only L1s other than Dutch. The participants’ aural-oral proficiency levels in Frisian ranged from 1 to 4.5, with a mean of 2.5. (Aural and oral proficiency were elicited by means of five-point Likert scales, with 1 meaning not proficient at all and 5 highly proficient; these ratings were combined and their mean was calculated to create the aural-oral proficiency value.) Notably, only $3 7 . 3 \%$ had the goal of becoming an active Frisian speaker; the majority of $6 2 . 7 \%$ merely wanted to learn the language so they could understand it.5

# 4.3 Items and analyses

Information regarding participants’ language use in different contexts – namely in their Afûk class, at work, in public places, and at home – was elicited with multiple-choice items (33a-d) that had the answer options only Frisian, more Frisian than Dutch, equal amounts of Frisian and Dutch, more Dutch than Frisian, and only Dutch but no Frisian. The combined percentages of the first two options were used to test H1a, which was that the only context in which new speakers use Frisian more often than Dutch is in their Afûk classes. To shed additional light on participants’ Frisian use, we examined their responses to an open-ended item (34) asking about further contexts.

Information about participants’ interlocutors in a typical week was elicited with a multiplechoice item (30) that had the answer options I only speak Frisian with other people who have learned the language at Afûk, I speak Frisian more often with other people who have learned the language at Afûk, I speak equal amounts of Frisian with both kinds of people, I speak Frisian more often with people who grew up speaking Frisian, and I only speak Frisian with people who grew up speaking Frisian. The combined percentages of the first two options were used to test H1b, which was that most new speakers use Frisian more often with fellow new speakers. Since the item also offered the option does not apply: I am learning Frisian only to understand other people, not to speak, H1b could only be tested for participants who wanted to become active speakers.

Frequency of Frisian use in a typical week was investigated with a multiple-choice item (29) that had the answer options $0 \% - 2 0 \%$ , $20 \%$ -40%, $40 \% - 6 0 \%$ , $60 \% - 8 0 \%$ , and $80 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ . The percentage of participants who selected the first option was used to test H1c, which was that most new speakers use Frisian no more than $20 \%$ of the time.

Five-point Likert scale items were used to elicit participants’ levels of comfort when using Frisian with fellow new speakers (31) and with traditional speakers (32); 1 meant not comfortable at all and 5 very comfortable. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the levels of comfort, thereby testing H2 – which was that new speakers feel more comfortable using Frisian with fellow new speakers. 6 Since both items provided the option does not apply: I am learning

Frisian only to understand other people, not to speak, H2 could only be tested for participants who wanted to become active speakers.

To get an overview of traditional speakers’ behaviours, we examined participants’ responses to an open-ended item (35) that asked: When you use Frisian, how do Frisian speakers who grew up with the language usually respond?

To assess how discouraging participants deemed different behaviours by traditional speakers, we employed five-point Likert scales with 1 meaning not discouraging at all and 5 very discouraging. As noted above, the behaviours we tapped were: the use of Dutch from the outset of the conversation (36), switching to Dutch during the conversation (37), the correction of mistakes (38), and making fun of the way new speakers speak Frisian (39). A one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test was used to test H3, which stated that what most discourages new speakers from using Frisian is traditional speakers’ mockery. To shed further light on the issue, we also examined participants’ responses to an open-ended item that asked if they had encountered other kinds of discouraging reactions (40).

To investigate how encouraging participants deemed different behaviours by traditional speakers, we employed five-point Likert scales with 1 meaning not encouraging at all and 5 very encouraging. As explained earlier, the behaviours we tapped were: speaking slowly (41), using easy words (42), checking in regularly to ensure understanding (43), and explicit encouragement to keep speaking Frisian (44). We used a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s test to test H4, which stated that what most encourages new speakers to use Frisian is traditional speakers’ explicit encouragement. Furthermore, we examined participants’ responses to an open-ended item that asked about other kinds of reactions that would encourage them to use Frisian (45).

Participants who were only learning Frisian so they could understand the language were told to skip the sections relating to discouragement and encouragement. Therefore, these analyses could only be undertaken for participants aiming to become active speakers.

# 5. Results

# 5.1 Language use patterns

The results showed that there was no context in which the new speakers in this study used Frisian more than they used Dutch – with the same overall pattern emerging for participants learning Frisian to become active speakers and those learning it merely to understand (Figure 1). H1a, that most new speakers use Frisian more often than Dutch in their Afûk classes, was thus not supported. Nonetheless, our underlying idea was confirmed: namely that new speakers used more Frisian in their Afûk classes than in any other context. Linguistic insecurity and the complex dynamics between traditional and new speakers serve as a likely explanation.

Figure 1. Frisian use in different contexts – comparison of participants who want to become active Frisian speakers vs. participants who merely want to understand Frisian

In response to the open-ended item asking participants about further contexts in which they use Frisian, the most frequently-listed circumstances were interactions with neighbours, in shops, with older family members or in-laws, in local clubs and associations, and at the gym. However, numerous participants specified that they only ever use “een woordje” (one word) or “een paar zinnen” (a few sentences). Again, this can be explained by linguistic insecurity. This also emerged from responses such as: “Ik heb het Fries geleerd om het te kunnen spreken, maar ik doe het nooit want ik durf het niet” (I learnt Frisian to be able to speak it, but I never do, because I do not dare to speak it). Several participants highlighted traditional speakers’ behaviour as a reason for this insecurity; for instance: “ik zou meer Fries willen spreken, maar merk dat ik me daar niet prettig bij voel (onzeker) om gecorrigeerd te worden” (I would like to speak more Frisian, but I do not feel good (insecure) about being corrected).

Surprisingly, most participants reported that in a typical week, the majority of interlocutors with whom they used Frisian were in fact traditional speakers (Figure 2; as explained above, this represents only participants learning Frisian to become active speakers). H1b, that most new speakers use Frisian more often with fellow new speakers, was thus not supported. At first, this may seem at odds with the finding that the participants spoke the most Frisian in their Afûk classes (where they were primarily surrounded by fellow new speakers). However, as the answers to the aforementioned open-ended item showed, a higher number of traditional speakers as interlocutors does not necessarily entail more time spent speaking Frisian with these interlocutors: many of the participants’ interactions with traditional speakers in fact simply contained a few tokenistic Frisian words or phrases. More research is needed to shed light on the actual amount of time that new speakers spend conversing in Frisian with different types of interlocutors.

As expected, the results showed that in a typical week, most participants used Frisian no more than $20 \%$ of the time – with the same overall pattern emerging for participants learning Frisian to become active speakers and those learning it merely to understand (Figure 3). H1c was thus supported. Again, linguistic insecurity and the complex dynamics between traditional and new speakers serve as a likely explanation.

# 5.2 Levels of comfort with different interlocutors

Participants’ level of comfort when using Frisian with fellow new speakers was just above neutral, with a mean of 3.16 (S $\mathrm { D } { = } 1 . 0 4$ ), and their level of comfort with traditional speakers was just below neutral, with a mean of 2.94 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 1 8$ ). The trend of the findings thus supported H2: participants did feel more comfortable using Frisian with fellow new speakers than with traditional speakers. However, the difference was not statistically significant $\mathrm { W } { = } 6 9 3 . 5$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } . 0 8$ ). These findings are based solely on the data from participants learning Frisian to become active speakers, and it is possible that the lacking significance is due to the low number of participants in this category. Further research is necessary to ascertain this.

# 5.3 The discouragement and encouragement of language use

The open-ended item that asked participants how traditional speakers usually react to their Frisian use yielded responses regarding purely positive reactions, purely negative reactions, and reactions that combined positive and negative elements. There was little variation in the description of positive reactions: participants mostly commented on traditional speakers being “enthousiast” (enthusiastic) and finding new speakers’ use of Frisian “leuk” (nice) or “positief” (positive). Yet, aside from the occasional mention of “complimenten” (compliments), there were no details regarding the actual nature of traditional speakers’ positive reactions.

Much more detail was provided regarding traditional speakers’ negative reactions. Notably, participants referred to all four behaviours tapped by the closed questions: namely traditional speakers’ refusing to engage with participants in Frisian, switching to Dutch during conversations, correcting participants’ mistakes, and laughing at participants. (The open-ended item was placed before the closed items. The latter therefore could not have primed participants to mention these specific behaviours in response to the open-ended item.) Responses revealed that these behaviours demotivated participants – even when they were aware that traditional speakers did not necessarily mean to be disparaging. For example, one new speaker wrote: “de mensen zijn er verlegen van

omdat ze het niet verwachten en lachen, dit voelt als uitlachen. Oudere mensen zijn veel 'beleefder' en steken stoïcijns Fries als je probeert Fries met ze te spreken, dat laatste is fijn het eerste is zeebeer demotiverend” (people are a bit confused because they don't expect it, and then they laugh. This feels like being laughed at. Older people are usually much more polite, and they stoically continue speaking Frisian when you try to speak Frisian with them. The latter is very nice, the former is very demotivating). Several responses illustrated that traditional speakers’ behaviour led to new speakers’ discontinued use of Frisian; for example: “mensen die ik beter ken moeten meestal een beetje lachen, waardoor ik het niet doorzet” (people I know better usually have to laugh a little, that is why I don't continue speaking it). This is not surprising – as one new speaker explained: being laughed at “bemoeilijkt het erg om ‘mee te doen’” (makes it difficult to ‘participate’). Relatedly, several responses hinted at participants’ feeling of not being accepted as authentic members of the minority language community. For instance, one person commented that traditional speakers “vinden het vreemd om mij fries te horen spreken en dan ook nog eens ‘volgens het boekje’” (think it is strange to hear me speak Frisian and then I even speak it ‘by the book’), and another noted that traditional speakers do not consider new speakers’ varieties as “correct Fries” (correct Frisian). Several people explained that traditional speakers’ (expected) reactions were the reason they refrained from using Frisian; for example: “dus als ik iets in het Fries tegen mijn schoonmoeder zou zeggen, dan zou ze denk ik negatief reageren dus dat durf ik ook al niet” (If I were to speak Frisian to my mother-in-law, I think she would react negatively, so I don't dare).

In response to the closed questions, participants deemed all four behaviours we tapped to be discouraging. There was no significant difference between three of these: the use of Dutch from the outset of the conversation, with a mean of 3.50 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 2 5$ ), switching to Dutch during the conversation, with a mean of 3.75 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 1 3$ ), and making fun of new speakers’ way of speaking Frisian, with a mean of 3.39 (SD $| =$ 1.38). By contrast, with a mean of 2.20 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 3 1$ ), the correction of mistakes was deemed significantly less discouraging (p<.000001 for all three other reactions). H3, that traditional speakers’ mockery is most discouraging, was thus not supported. Based on the responses to the aforementioned open-ended item, one possible explanation is that traditional speakers’ laughter was interpreted as a sign of their surprise at participants’ use of Frisian, rather than as outright mockery. This would explain why it was deemed discouraging – but not to the extent that we had hypothesised. The finding that participants considered the correction of their mistakes to be least discouraging could be because this is the only behaviour one might construe as constructive: that is, as a genuine attempt by traditional speakers to help new speakers improve their language skills. More research is needed to ascertain this.

In response to the open-ended item asking if participants had encountered other discouraging behaviours, they mentioned traditional speakers’ use of “heel snel en slecht gearticuleerd Fries” (very quick and poorly-articulated Frisian) and the “inslikken van woorden” (swallowing of words). It was also deemed discouraging that traditional speakers get “ongeduldig” (impatient) when new speakers are speaking slowly or looking for the right words. Some very perceptive participants recognised traditional speakers’ own linguistic insecurity as the root cause of certain behaviours; for instance: “Friezen vinden zichzelf heel bijzonder en hun taal belangrijk, maar achter hun trots gaat bij velen een zeker minderwaardigheidsgevoel schuil” (Frisians think that they are very special and that their language is very important, but behind that pride hides a certain feeling of inferiority). Another participant’s response illustrates how the behaviour that results from traditional speakers’ linguistic insecurity can preclude new speakers from developing a sense of belonging to the minority language community: “als ik woorden gebruik die geef Frysk zijn en zij niet kennen, reageren ze alsof ik uit de hoogte probeer te doen en gaan vervolgens op ieder foutje dat ik in de grammatica maak letten, om aan te geven dat ik geen native speaker ben. Dus meestal durf ik geen Fries te praten helaas” (If I use words that are pure Frisian [i.e. the standardised variety] and they do not know these words, they react as if I am trying to be superior to them, and then they point out any grammar mistakes I make to show me that I am not a native speaker. So usually I do not dare to speak Frisian unfortunately). Participants’ responses thus reflect the

complexity of the power dynamics between traditional and new speakers, and they highlight the fact that these dynamics can hinder the revitalisation of Frisian.

By contrast, the findings showed that encouraging reactions on the part of traditional speakers can go a long way. The participants deemed all four of the positive reactions we tapped with the closed questions to be encouraging: deliberately using easy words, with a mean of 3.44 $\mathrm { \Delta S D { = } } 1 . 2 9$ ), checking in regularly to ensure understanding, with a mean of 3.58 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 3 4$ ), speaking slowly, with a mean of 3.92 $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 . 2 9$ ), and explicit encouragement to keep speaking Frisian, with a mean of 4.54 ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 0 . 9 1$ ). The difference between explicit encouragement and the other three reactions was significant (p<.000001, $\mathsf { p } { < } . 0 0 0 0 0 0 1$ , and $\mathrm { p } { < } . 0 1$ , respectively). H4 was thus supported: the new speakers in our study deemed traditional speakers’ explicit encouragement the most encouraging reaction to their use of Frisian. This is likely to be the case because – unlike the other behaviours we tapped – explicit encouragement cannot be interpreted as merely an attempt to facilitate conversation. Instead, it is a clear sign that traditional speakers want new speakers to use the language. In fact, it could even be seen to suggest that they welcome new speakers into the minority language community.

The only other significant difference was that between speaking slowly and using easy words, with the former being deemed even more encouraging than the latter $( \mathrm { p } { < } . 0 5 )$ . A possible explanation is that a slow speech style can be considered helpful for understanding, and therefore conducive to learning – whereas the use of simpler words might be considered condescending. While more research is needed to ascertain this, the notion that new speakers do not wish to be belittled is supported by the qualitative data from the open-ended item asking about other potentially encouraging behaviours. For instance, one person stated that they would prefer it if traditional speakers “gewoon wordt doorgegaan in het Frysk en het aan mij wordt overgelaten om zo nodig verduidelijking te vragen” (just continued speaking in Frisian as usual and if it was left to me [i.e. the new speaker] to ask for clarification if necessary). Another participant highlighted the difference between the ability to understand Frisian and the ability to use it, specifying that they would like traditional speakers to “gewoon lekker in het Fries blijven praten, niet makkelijker. Verstaan doe ik prima” (just keep speaking in Frisian, not easier. I understand just fine). Moreover, numerous new speakers indicated that they would appreciate traditional speakers to have “geduld” (patience) – even if conversing in Frisian “kost het ons beiden meer energie en moeite” (costs us both more energy and effort). Other frequently-mentioned reactions that participants said would encourage them included “complimenten” (compliments) and “oprechte waardering” (sincere appreciation). New speakers’ desire to be accepted as members of the minority language community is exemplified by one participant stating that they would like traditional speakers to “het gevoel geven dat je er echt bij hoort door Fries te spreken” (make you feel that you really belong by speaking Frisian).

# 6. Discussion

New speakers invest money, time, and oftentimes also considerable emotional energy into their goa of becoming accepted members of minority language communities (Hornsby 2015). They do so despite the challenges faced by all language learners – such as obstacles relating to infrastructures for language learning and individual learning proclivities – as well as the specific challenges present in minority language contexts (McEwan-Fujita 2010). However, the complex power dynamics between traditional and new speakers can end up deterring the latter from using the minority languages they have acquired, and the results of our study indicate that this is the case in Fryslân. The new speakers in this study only used Frisian very rarely, and when they did use it, it was mainly in the classroom. Frisian interactions outside the classroom, with traditional speakers, appeared to consist mostly of a few tokenistic words or phrases (RQ1). It seems likely that this is linked to our finding that new speakers felt less comfortable using Frisian with traditional speakers than with fellow new speakers (RQ2). However, more research – with a larger sample of participants learning Frisian to actually become active speakers – is needed to re-assess the significance of this finding.

This study makes a notable contribution by helping to build an understanding of new speakers’ activation – a process that ought to constitute an important goal in revitalisation policies and planning for minority languages. Specifically, the study underscores the crucial role that traditional speakers play in the dynamics of new speakers’ activation. The findings show that several common behaviours by traditional speakers demotivate new speakers, precluding a sense of belonging, and thereby discouraging them from using Frisian (RQ3). This is evidence that, in Fryslân just like in other minority language contexts (Coughlan 2021), the power dynamics between traditional and new speakers are hindering language revitalisation. Yet, the results also demonstrate that various aspects of traditional speakers’ behaviour hold the potential to positively influence new speakers’ activation. Explicit encouragement to keep using the minority language is most heartening to new speakers (RQ4) – presumably because it indicates that traditional speakers actually want new speakers to use the language. In fact, explicit encouragement could be interpreted as traditional speakers welcoming new speakers into the minority language community.

While it remains to be ascertained whether the findings of this study generalise to other communities, they do provide a starting point for actionable science communication for policy makers and language planners in Fryslân. As noted above, the emergence of new speakers as a salient phenomenon highlights the need for more inclusive language policies. In the Frisian context, policies which target not only on traditional speakers’ but also new speakers’ role in language revitalisation would undoubtedly be beneficial – and such policies would send a strong message of inclusion to new speakers. Moreover, there is a need for a wider range of language planning measures to ensure successful revitalisation. The results of our study indicated that, in Fryslân just like in other contexts (Dunmore 2018), existing acquisition planning measures alone are not sufficient to ensure the activation of new speakers. In order to effectively foster new speakers’ minority language use, we argue that prestige planning will be necessary. As explained earlier, prestige planning broadly includes measures regarding language communities’ attitudes, ideologies, and social identities. One of its specific functions is ‘the reduction of stereotypical evaluations that could exacerbate or cause [intergroup] conflict’ (Haarmann 1984: 83; Author 1’s translation). The need for prestige planning in Fryslân is highlighted by the fact that issues of belonging and intergroup dynamics emerged as key themes in our findings. Evidently, tackling intergroup conflict is a lengthy endeavour. As a first step, we are currently designing a campaign to raise awareness of traditional speakers’ perspective amongst new speakers, and vice versa – with the aim of creating more mutual understanding. More information about this campaign can be found here: https://www.praatmarfrysk.nl/nijefryskpraters/. As this prestige planning campaign is only a starting point, we are also in the process of writing a report for the Frisian provincial government in which we outline the results of our different project components (see above) and provide additional language policy and planning recommendations.

Notably, in Fryslân and beyond, language policy and planning regarding new speakers should not be seen as a replacement of support for traditional speakers. Instead, the former should complement the latter: a truly inclusive approach to minority language revitalisation must recognise the different needs of the two speaker groups, and strive to consolidate them (Hornsby 2015).

# 7. Strengths, limitations, and directions for future research

Using a questionnaire enabled us to collect qualitative as well as quantitative data from a sizable participant sample, thereby yielding more nuanced and comprehensive insights than we could have achieved with only one data type. However, due to our choice of research method, we were unable to follow up on unanticipated findings. It will be important for future research to build on our work by using complementary methods, like interviews and focus-groups.

Our choice of research method also entails that the data we investigated reflect self-reported language use, which may not necessarily be the same as actual language use. Nonetheless, selfreported data elicited with online questionnaires are at least less likely to be affected by social desirability biases than data elicited in face-to-face methods such as interviews and focus-groups (see Kircher 2022b for a more detailed discussion of the strengths and limitations of

questionnaires). In future research, our investigation of self-reported language use should be complemented by observational studies regarding actual language use.

An important direction for future research is underscored by the fact that almost two thirds of the participants in this study were learning Frisian merely to understand it. In Fryslân, there is a paucity of research regarding adult new speakers’ motivations for language learning. Consequently, the next step of our work will be an investigation of such motivations amongst both, participants aiming to become active Frisian speakers and those learning the language merely to understand it (Kircher & Vellinga, in preparation). Insights into the differences between these two groups will be beneficial for the development of language policy and planning to eventually foster language use amongst not only the former but also, potentially, the latter.

2 Language policy consists of ‘the broader political and sociolinguistic goals in response to which concrete language-planning measures are devised and implemented’ (Oakes, in press). Specific types of language planning are discussed below.

3 Dutch-based contact varieties referred to as Stadsfries (City Frisian) are spoken in several urban municipalities. To ensure stringency, L1 speakers of Stadsfries were excluded from our study.

4 Data were collected from 326 participants. However, 62 were excluded because they did not fit one or more of our inclusion criteria (established by items 2, 3, 7, 9) and/or because they had answered less than $70 \%$ of the key items (1-3, 5, 7, 10a-b, 13-21, 29-33, 36-39, 41-44).

5 We had pre-registered an additional research question that asked what variables correlate with new speakers’ frequency of Frisian use, thus constituting potential predictors. The variables we investigated included location, age, gender, aural-oral proficiency, attitudes towards Frisian, and the levels of comfort when conversing with traditional as well as new speakers. We ran regressions, which revealed no significant associations between any of these variables and participants’ frequency of Frisian use. This was likely due to the small participant sample for which we were able to run the regressions: levels of comfort were only elicited from participants with the goal of becoming active Frisian speakers, and all participants learning Frisian only to understand it therefore had to be excluded from the regressions. For reasons of space, we do not elaborate on the regression analyses and their results. The regression results can be found on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/4n3cf/?view_only $\mathbf { \bar { \rho } } = \mathbf { \bar { \rho } }$ 2eb0006ba5fb4e6ab2b9d867c71a1c43

6 We had pre-registered the use of a t-test. However, since a Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the data were not normally distributed (new speakers: $\mathrm { W } { = } . 9 8$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } . 0 1$ ; traditional speakers: $\mathrm { W } { = } . 9 0$ , $\mathrm { p } { < } . 0 1$ ), a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed instead.
