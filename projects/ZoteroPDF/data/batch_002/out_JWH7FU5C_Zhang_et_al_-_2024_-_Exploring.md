# ABSTRACT

Switching between languages requires the participation of executive functions (EFs) which comprise both the ‘hot’ affective aspects (hot EFs) and the ‘cool’ cognitive aspects (cool EFs). However, the role of these EFs in language switching is not clear. This study employed a word valence categorization task to explore the effects of hot (i.e. emotional valence and emotional congruency) and cool (i.e. inhibitory control ability, IC ability) EFs on high- and low-IC ChineseEnglish bilinguals’ language switching costs. The results showed smaller language switching costs for positive than negative emotional words, for emotional incongruent than congruent trials, for positive than negative emotional words in emotional congruent trials and for negative emotional words in emotional incongruent than congruent trials. Moreover, hot and cool EFs worked interactively, with larger language switching costs for negative emotional words and the same pattern in emotional congruent trials for high-IC participants over low-IC ones. These results indicate that various aspects of hot EFs affect language switching costs individually and interactively, while also modulate the effects of cool EF on language switching costs during Chinese-English emotional word comprehension. These findings have implications for extending the Bilingual Interactive Activation plus $( \mathsf { B } | \mathsf { A } + )$ model by incorporating both hot and cool EFs.

# Introduction

As a dominant topic in bilingualism, language switching can provide a unique testing ground for exploring the mechanisms underlying bilingual language production (Fricke and Kootstra 2016) and comprehension (Chen et al. 2020). Research on language switching reported that bilinguals’ first and second languages (L1 and L2) were activated simultaneously and non-target language must be inhibited to ensure the lexicons of target language were selected (Macizo, Bajo, and Martín 2010). Thus, inhibitory control (IC), an ability to suppress irrelevant and incongruent information (Korko and Williams 2017), plays a crucial role. Other research, however, reported that bilingual lexical access did not involve language suppression (Finkbeiner, Gollan, and Caramazza 2006). With more research on language switching being conducted, its underlying mechanisms generate a great deal of focused discussion.

# Bilingual language switching in production and comprehension processes

Bilingual language switching often incurs language switching costs in production and comprehension processes. These costs are identified as the reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) differences between language switching (the language of current and preceding trials is different) and repetition (the language of current and preceding trials is the same) trials. During production-based language switching, researchers found larger language switching costs in L1 switching relative to L2 switching, and reported that bilingual lexical selection in language production involved inhibition (e.g. Campbell 1999; Meuter and Allport 1999). For instance, Campbell (1999) observed larger language switching costs when bilinguals switched from L2 to L1 than vice versa, for divergent inhibition magnitudes of competing languages. The occurrence of asymmetrical language switching costs, as the index of inhibition implementation, is a common effect in production-based language switching (Declerck and Grainger 2017).

However, inconsistent findings were obtained regarding the language switching cost pattern in comprehension-based language switching (e.g. Declerck and Grainger 2017; Macizo, Bajo, and Paolieri 2012). For example, Declerck and Grainger (2017) observed asymmetrical language switching costs when participants practiced L1 words in pure language blocks prior to L1 and L2 mixed language blocks, indicating that comprehension-based language switching relies on IC. This finding was supported by Macizo, Bajo, and Martín (2010) reporting that bilingual language selection in language comprehension relied on inhibitory processes. Yet, Macizo, Bajo, and Paolieri (2012) did not find asymmetrical language switching costs, suggesting that inhibitory processes are not involved in language comprehension. The above findings not only indicate that the mechanisms of comprehension-based language switching are blurred, but also suggest that the mechanisms between comprehension- and production-based language switching may be different. Given the controversial role of IC, one of the core executive functions (EFs), in comprehension-based language switching, exploring the role of EFs in this process may unveil the nature of bilingual language comprehension and its distinct mechanisms from bilingual language production.

# Models proposed for bilingual language switching

Researchers have proposed several models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of bilingual language switching. In Green and Abutalebi’s (2013) Adaptive Control Hypothesis (ACH), the conceptual-affective-linguistic-sensorimotor representations activated in language production are governed by control processes to ensure the communicative goal. According to the Control Process Model (CPM) proposed by Green and Wei (2014), the activation from the conceptual-intentional system first activates bilinguals’ two language networks and then the competitive queuing networks to yield a serial output of the activated items. In Green’s (1998) IC model, each language has its associated language tag within the bilingual lexico-semantic system and language schema established by the supervisory attentional system. The two language schemata and language tags are activated simultaneously and compete for selection. When bilinguals switch languages, the new language schema must inhibit the previously active one, and an input in a different language must overcome the inhibition applied to its language tag in previous trial. Thus, two loci of inhibition appear: language schema inhibition and language tag inhibition. As inhibition is reactive, the more active L1 language schema and language tag will receive more inhibition than their L2 counterparts. Hence, when switching into L1, bilinguals have to spare more efforts to overcome the prior inhibition, thereby yielding larger L1 language switching costs.

Contrary to the above dominance-related language switching cost asymmetry, the language switching cost pattern is dominance-reversed in the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model (Dijkstra and van Heuven 1998), which is derived from the asymmetric top-down language-toword inhibition. Specifically, when a word appears, two language nodes related to it are active and lexical access is achieved via inhibition from intended language node to the words of unintended language. The amount of inhibition is determined by the activation intensity of the intended language node. That is, the higher the activation intensity, the greater the inhibition applied to the words of unintended language. As L1 language node are more active than L2 counterpart, the inhibition on L2 words will be greater than that on L1 words, thus resulting in larger L2 over L1 language switching costs.

Considering the limitations of the BIA model and the complementation of the IC model, Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002) proposed the $\mathsf { B } \mathsf { I } \mathsf { A } +$ model encompassing the word identification system and the task/decision system. The former includes three linguistic representations – orthography, phonology and semantics. The latter incorporates three non-linguistic task schema specifications, namely the specific processing steps for task in hand, the specification of receiving continuous input from the identification system and the decision criteria determining when a response is made based on relevant codes. According to this model, lexical selection relies on the crossing of a lexical item’s activation threshold. Specifically, the activation of a language is in reverse proportion to its recognition threshold during language switching, thus the higher the level of activation of one language, the easier it is to be recognized. Hence, language switching costs for L1 with higher activation are smaller than those for L2 with weaker activation.

Although different processes are involved, the above models all reveal the nature of bilingual language switching to a certain extent. However, the ACH, CPM and IC models are mainly used to explain language production processes, whereas the BIA and $\mathsf { B } \mathsf { I } \mathsf { A } +$ models are mainly used to explain language comprehension processes. As our focus is language comprehension, this study will specifically concentrate on the extension of the more comprehensive $\mathsf { B } \mathsf { I } \mathsf { A } +$ model in light of our empirical results. Through the extension, we will have a better theoretical understanding of the role of EF in comprehension-based language switching.

# Hot and cool EFs

EF (also called executive control) is a crucial top-down process required for goal-directed behavior and characterized by hot and cool aspects (Pellizzoni, Fontana, and Passolunghi 2021). Based on the distinction between hot and cool aspects, Zelazo and Müller (2002) distinguished hot EF from cool EF. Specifically, hot EF refers to the relatively affective functions in emotional and motivational situations, which can be elicited by stimuli with high affective involvement or activities involving the regulation of internal emotion and motivation; conversely, cool EF denotes the more purely cognitive functions operating in emotionally neutral contexts, which is more likely to be induced by relatively abstract and decontextualized stimuli, such as IC, working memory and shifting (Zelazo and Müller 2002). The distinction between hot and cool EFs is supported by the findings of prior studies (e.g. Pellizzoni, Fontana, and Passolunghi 2021; Séguin, Arseneault, and Tremblay 2007).

As hot and cool EFs work jointly as part of a more general adaptive function (Zelazo and Carlson 2012), researchers have combined these two types of EFs to explore the role of EF in cognitive process. Kouklari, Tsermentseli, and Monks (2019) reported that both hot and cool EFs played crucial roles in the development of theory of mind among school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder. Séguin, Arseneault, and Tremblay (2007) found the joint effects of hot and cool processes in response preservation, indicating that successful decision-making requires the efficient regulation of hot and cool EFs. However, the joint contribution of hot and cool EFs to language switching remains unknown, which needs exploration.

# EF and bilingual language switching

As research on the mechanisms of language switching progresses, the effects of EF on language switching have received considerable attention. A growing body of studies have explored the effects of bilinguals’ IC ability on production-based language switching and found reduced language switching costs for high-IC than low-IC bilinguals (high- and low-IC bilinguals were identified in the same way as those screened according to the Simon costs in the present article) (e.g. Chang, Bai, and Wang 2018; Liu et al. 2019). However, research on the pattern of language switching costs has not reached consensus. For example, high- and low-IC bilinguals showed symmetrical and asymmetrical language switching costs respectively in Liu et al. (2014). Liu et al. (2016) reported symmetrical language switching costs in both the pretest and posttest for high-IC bilinguals, but low-IC bilinguals showed asymmetrical language switching costs in the pretest and symmetrical language switching costs in the posttest.

The results of previous work indicate that bilinguals’ IC ability impacts language switching costs. However, this conclusion is mainly derived from the findings of production-based language switching studies. Recently, the effects of bilinguals’ IC ability on comprehension-based language switching have been explored by Jiao et al. (2022) and Zhang and Fan (2023). Jiao et al. (2022) examined the effects of bilinguals’ IC ability on language switching between newly learned German and Japanese, and found smaller Japanese switching costs for high-IC bilinguals, but no such effect was observed for German. Zhang and Fan (2023) reported that high-IC bilinguals showed larger English switching costs for negative emotional words than low-IC ones. These results indicate that bilinguals’ IC ability plays an important role in comprehension-based language switching. However, the mechanisms of bilingual language comprehension and their relationship with bilingual language production remain unclear, more empirical data are therefore needed. Thus, this study further explored the role of IC ability in comprehension-based language switching to reveal its nature and its relationship with production-based language switching.

The relationship between hot EF and language switching has also become the focus. Research on lying showed that bilinguals felt less emotional in L2 than in L1 during language switching (CaldwellHarris and Ayçiçeği-Dinn 2009). Tomić and Kroff (2020) reported that switching language preceding L1 taboo words could bring their emotionality down to the L2 word level. These results indicate that language switching can play an important role in emotion regulation. Contrary to this indication, Williams et al. (2020) reported that language switching may not have direct impact on emotion, for not predicting subsequent facial emotions. These discrepant findings imply an elusive link between hot EF and language switching. To better elucidate their relationship, researchers have employed emotional salient stimuli as experimental materials to induce the involvement of hot EF during language switching.

One special kind of stimuli is emotional words, having conceptual and emotional meanings (i.e. emotional valence) (Liu et al. 2010) and characterized by two distinct dimensions – emotional valence and arousal (Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert 1997). Emotional valence is a bipolar dimension dividing emotions into positive (e.g. glad) and negative (e.g. sad), and arousal is a unipolar dimension describing the intensity of emotions activated in appetitive and defensive motivation systems (Lang, Bradley, and Cuthbert 1997). Zhang, Fan, and Wang (2020) employed positive and negative emotional words to explore the processing mechanisms of emotional words during language switching. The results showed that bilinguals responded slower and less accurate to Chinese and English negative emotional words than positive ones. This study first reported that emotional valence of hot EF can modulate comprehension-based language switching.

Given the peculiarity of emotional words and the surge of interest in emotional conflict, researchers attempted to use emotional words and faces to create emotional congruency (congruent and incongruent) conditions to induce the involvement of hot EF. Stenberg, Wiking, and Dahl (1998) reported longer RTs in emotional incongruent than congruent condition, viz., emotional congruency effects. Fan et al. (2016; 2018) explored the automatic activation of bilingual emotional words and the emotional congruency effects in a blocked context (two monolingual lists: L1 and L2). The results showed that both Chinese and English emotional words were automatically activated, and the magnitude of emotional congruency effects reflecting language differentiation was greater for Chinese over English emotional words.

Due to the emotion regulation function of language switching and attenuated emotional response to subsequent emotional words during language switching (Tomić and Kroff 2020), the emotional word processing and emotional congruency effects in a mixed context (a bilingual list: alternate L1 and L2) may be different from those in a blocked context. In a comprehension-based language switching task, Zhang and Fan (2023) observed larger language switching costs when bilinguals processed negative relative to positive emotional words in emotional congruent condition, and larger language switching costs in emotional congruent than conflict condition. According to the emotion adaptation effect in Gratton, Coles, and Donchin’s (1992) conflict monitor theory, the conflict in emotional conflict condition can activate participants’ adjustment mechanism and raise their cognitive control to a high level in the same conflict task, thus leading to smaller switching costs in this condition. These findings indicate that emotional congruency and emotional valence of hot EF modulate bilinguals’ language switching costs during comprehension-based language switching.

The above effects of emotional congruency on language switching costs are in contrast with those of prior studies (Liu et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020) reporting larger language switching costs in incongruent than congruent context. To explicate this discrepancy, this study attempted to employ emotional face-word Stroop paradigm to create emotional congruency conditions. In these conditions, emotional words were superimposed across emotional faces, the facilitation and obstruction of emotional faces to emotional word processing were more direct. Thus, the magnitude of emotional intensity in these conditions was larger than that in Zhang and Fan (2023). Moreover, considering the relationship between hot and cool EFs, this study also delved into their relationship in comprehension-based language switching.

# The current study

Employing the word valence categorization task, this study set out to explore the effects of hot and cool EFs on language switching costs during Chinese-English emotional word comprehension. Specifically, this study was mainly designed to investigate the effects of emotional valence, emotional congruency, IC ability, as well as their relationships on language switching costs during language switching. Based on the findings of previous studies, we predicted larger language switching costs for positive over negative emotional words, for emotional incongruent over congruent trials, and for low-IC over high-IC bilinguals. As for their relationships, we hypothesized that these components of hot and cool EFs could jointly affect bilinguals’ language switching costs in comprehension-based language switching.

# Methodology

# Participants

Seventy-nine non-English major college students with normal or corrected-to-normal vision at Ningbo University in China participated in this study. All passed College English Test Band 4 (CET4), with Chinese as their L1 and English as their L2. They were required to sign written informed consent form and finish a language history questionnaire (Li, Sepanski, and Zhao 2006). Three participants were excluded for their higher ERs than $20 \%$ in the valence categorization task. The valid sample included 76 participants (29 males) with no experience of living in an L2 dominant speaking environment, aged 17–22 years $( M = 1 9 . 8 ,$ , $S D = 1 . 1$ ) and learning L1 from birth and L2 from 7–13 years $( M = 9 . 1$ , $S D = 1 . 5$ ). According to the Simon costs (subtracting the RTs and ERs of congruent from incongruent trials in the Simon task), they were divided into high- and low-IC ability groups. The results of independent samples $t$ -tests revealed no significant differences between their length of learning L1 and L2 (years), L2 age of acquisition (AoA) (years old), CET-4 scores (points), L1 and L2 using frequency in daily activities per day (percentages) and listening, speaking, reading and writing skills for two languages rated with a 7-point Likert scale $( p s > . 0 5 )$ . Moreover, their L1 proficiency [high: $M = 6 . 1$ , $S D = 1 . 0$ ; low: $M = 6 . 2$ , $S D = 0 . 8$ , t $( 7 4 ) = - 0 . 5 9 ]$ , L2 proficiency [high: $M = 3 . 5 _ { \cdot }$ , $S D = 0 . 8$ ; low: $M = 3 . 7$ , $S D = 0 . 8$ , $t ~ \left( 7 4 \right) = - 1 . 0 0 ]$ , as well as overall L1 and L2 proficiency [high: $M = 4 . 8$ , $S D = 0 . 7$ ; low: $M = 4 . 9$ , $S D = 0 . 6 , t ( 7 4 ) = - 1 . 0 1 ]$ did not reach significance $( p s > . 0 5 )$ (Table 1).

# Materials

The experimental stimuli were 320 emotional face-word pictures composed by superimposing 80 emotional words across 80 emotional faces. These faces were selected from Chinese Facial Affective Picture System (Gong et al. 2011) and rated with a 9-point Likert scale, including 40 positive (valence: 5.2–7.0; arousal: 5.0–8.0) and 40 negative (valence: 2.1–3.3; arousal: 4.3–7.7) faces with 20 males and 20 females for each valence. The results of independent samples t-tests revealed a significant difference between the valence of positive and negative faces (positive: $M = 6 . 2$ , $S D = 0 . 4 ;$ ; negative: $M = 2 . 7$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 3$ ), t $( 7 8 ) = 3 9 . 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , but no such effect was observed between their arousal (positive: $M = 6 . 0 $ , $S D = 0 . 8$ ; negative: $M = 6 . 2$ $S D = 0 . 8 )$ , $\textsf { t } ( 7 8 ) = - 1 . 0 8 , \ p > . 0 5$ .

The emotional words included 40 English and 40 Chinese words. English emotional words were selected from the Pocket Oxford English-Chinese Dictionary (Soanes 2009), Affective Norms for English Words (Bradley and Lang 1999), The Book of Human Emotions (Smith 2016) and appendices of previous studies (e.g. Harris, Ayçiçeği, and Gleason 2003; Kazanas and Altarriba 2016). Chinese emotional words were translations of English emotional words. According to the measurement results of a 7-point Likert scale, 20 positive (valence: 4.8–6.6; arousal: 3.8–5.4) and 20 negative (valence: 1.3–3.4; arousal: 3.7–5.3) emotional words were chosen for each language (see Appendix). The results of independent samples t-tests showed no significant differences in the familiarity [t $( 5 0 ) = 0 . 1 5 ]$ , arousal [t $( 7 8 ) = 0 . 7 8 ]$ , valence [t $( 7 8 ) = - 0 . 1 3 ]$ , abstractness [t $( 7 8 ) = - \ 0 . 2 4 ]$ , and word frequency [t $( 6 8 ) = 1 . 8 3 ]$ between Chinese and English emotional words $( p s > . 0 5 )$ ; no significant differences were shown in the familiarity [t $( 7 8 ) = 1 . 3 8 ]$ , arousal [t $( 7 8 ) =$ $- 0 . 1 5 ]$ , abstractness [t $( 7 8 ) = 0 . 3 6 ]$ and word frequency [t $( 6 8 ) = 1 . 3 3 ]$ between positive and negative emotional words $( p s > . 0 5 )$ , but their valence reached significance, $t ~ \left( 7 8 \right) = 3 1 . 7 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Table 2.

# Design

$6 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$ analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The between-subjects independent variable was IC ability (high vs. low) and the within-subjects independent variables were emotional valence (positive vs. negative), emotional congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and language (Chinese vs. English). The dependent variable was language switching costs calculated by subtracting the mean RT and ER of the overall language repetition trials from the overall language switching trials.

# Tasks and procedures

This study included two tasks. The Simon task was employed to divide participants into high- and low-IC ability groups, and the valence categorization task was adopted to measure participants’ performance in language switching. E-prime software 2.0 was used to present stimuli and record participants’ responses.

# Simon task

Each trial consisted of a $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ red fixation cross $( + ) ,$ a $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ filled red or blue square appearing at the fixation, on the left or right side of the fixation, and a $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ blank screen. Half of the participants pressed the ‘F’ key for red square and ‘J’ key for blue square and the other half vice versa. Participants performed 12 practice trials, and then 360 experimental trials of three blocks with 40 congruent (the square and the reaction key were on the same side of the computer), 40 incongruent (the square and the reaction key were on different sides of the computer) and 40 neutral (the squares appeared at the fixation) trials for each.

# Valence categorization task

Each trial consisted of a $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ red fixation cross $( + )$ , a $1 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s }$ emotional face-word picture, and a $5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ blank screen (see Figure 1). Emotional face-word pictures were presented in a language switching context. Participants pressed the ‘F’ key for positive valence of emotional words and the ‘J’ key for negative valence of emotional words, ignoring the facial expression in the picture. The key-valence association was counterbalanced across participants. After 12 practice trials, participants performed 320 experimental trials with four blocks of 80 trials each. There were 40 language repetition positive, repetition negative, switching positive and switching negative trials for both Chinese and English. Moreover, in terms of emotional congruency of emotional face-word pictures, four types of sequence relations for the preceding and current trials were constructed: congruent-congruent, congruent–incongruent, incongruent–congruent and incongruent–incongruent, with 80 trials per type. In congruent condition, the emotional valence of emotional words and faces was the same. For example, the positive emotional word ‘happy’ was overlaid on a positive emotional face. In incongruent condition, the emotional valence of emotional words and faces was different. For example, the negative emotional word ‘angry’ was superimposed across a positive emotional face.

# Statistics

The RT and ER data of 76 valid participants was analyzed with SPSS 17.0.

Figure 1. The flowchart of four experimental trials.

# Simon task

The data of trials with a wrong response $( 2 . 5 \% )$ and outliers beyond $M \pm 3 S D$ $( 1 . 2 \% )$ were deleted. The top 38 participants with larger Simon costs were classified as low-IC ability group and the bottom 38 participants with smaller Simon costs were classified as high-IC ability group. A twoway repeated-measures ANOVA with group (high-IC vs. low-IC) as between-subjects variable and congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) as within-subjects variable was conducted.

# Valence categorization task

The data of the first three trials of each block, wrong response trials $( 7 . 9 \% )$ , two trials below 200 ms $( 0 . 0 1 \% )$ and outliers beyond $M \pm 3 S D \left( 1 . 2 \% \right)$ were trimmed. The data of language switching costs were submitted to a 2 (emotional valence: positive vs. negative) $\times 2$ (emotional congruency: congruent vs. incongruent) $\times$ 2 (IC ability: high vs. low) $\times 2$ (language: Chinese vs. English) repeated-measures ANOVA.

# Results

# Simon task

High- and low-IC groups’ RTs and ERs in the Simon task were presented in Table 3.

# Discussion

# The effects of hot EFs on language switching costs

The observed larger language switching costs for negative over positive emotional words in this study indicate that the emotional valence of hot EF can modulate the language switching costs of emotional word comprehension. This finding is inconsistent with that of Zhang and Fan (2023) reporting insignificant difference between language switching costs of negative and positive emotional words. This disparity may be caused by the different modulating effects of emotional conflict on emotional valence under different experimental conditions.

In the present study and Zhang and Fan (2023), participants not only rely on cool EF to switch languages, but also resort to hot EF to complete the valence categorization task. The tasks in different experimental conditions have different demands on cognitive and emotional systems, leading to the allocation disparity of cognitive resources. Specifically, the emotional conflict in Zhang and Fan (2023) increased the demands on cognitive and emotional systems simultaneously. While performing the language switching task and the valence classification task, participants had to allocate a considerable amount of cognitive resources to resolve emotional conflict. Hence, insufficient cognitive resources were used for the valence classification task, resulting in insignificant difference between language switching costs of positive and negative emotional words.

Compared with Zhang and Fan (2023), the intensity of emotional conflict in the present study was greater, which may increase the competition between the cognitive resources of cognitive and emotional systems and place greater demands on the emotional system. Moreover, the greater emotional conflict itself may elicit more negative emotion (Li and Zhou 2008), which may in turn exacerbate self-control depletion (Li 2012), thereby producing larger language switching costs for the processing of negative emotional words as a whole.

Participants’ larger language switching costs in emotional congruent over incongruent trials indicate that the emotional congruency of hot EF can modulate the language switching costs during emotional word comprehension, which is in line with the results of Zhang and Fan (2023). The emotional conflict adaptation effect (van Steenbergen, Band, and Hommel 2010) and the sequential adjustment effect of emotional conflict (Etkin et al. 2006) can account for the above results. In terms of emotional conflict adaptation effect, the negative nature of aroused emotional conflict can strengthen participants’ behavioral adaptations to cognitive conflict and conflict-driven control in emotional incongruent trials, thus resulting in smaller language switching costs in the same conflict task. According to the sequential adjustment effect, the emotional conflict in preceding trials may activate participants’ anticipatory conflict-resolution mechanisms to facilitate emotional conflict resolution in current emotional incongruent trials, eventually inducing smaller language switching costs in the whole incongruent trials.

However, the above finding is contrary to the results of prior studies (Liu et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020) reporting larger language switching costs in incongruent over congruent context. The reverse outcome may be attributed to the disparate congruency conditions. Different from the non-emotional congruency conditions in previous studies, the congruency conditions in this study were emotional, thus congruency and emotion may interactively affect language switching costs. In emotional congruency conditions, incongruent and congruent emotions may activate participants’ aversive and appetitive motivational systems respectively. Compared to the congruent emotion in emotional congruent trials, conflicts as aversive signals (Fritz and Dreisbach 2013) in incongruent trials may evoke participants’ aversive motivational system, resulting in their taking of avoidance-related motor actions and invest less cognitive resources to solve the emotional conflicts. Thus, more cognitive resources are directed to inhibit the competition from non-target language during language switching, yielding smaller language switching costs in emotional incongruent than congruent trials.

Notably, consistent with the findings of Zhang and Fan (2023), this study reported smaller language switching costs for negative emotional words in emotional incongruent than congruent trials. In emotional incongruent trials, the conflict as aversive signals (Fritz and Dreisbach 2013) will reduce participants’ pleasure level, thus engendering greater conflict-driven adaptations (van Steenbergen, Band, and Hommel 2010). Not only that, the conflict incurred in emotional incongruent trials can also activate participants’ conflict monitoring system, which can in turn translate the occurrence of conflict into compensatory adjustments in cognitive control (Botvinick et al. 2001). Hence, more cognitive resources can be used to resolve the interference during language switching, leading to smaller language switching costs for negative emotional words in emotional incongruent than congruent trials. Additionally, consistent with the findings of Zhang and Fan (2023), participants in this study showed smaller language switching costs for positive over negative emotional words in emotional congruent trials. Compared with negative emotion, congruent emotion in emotional congruent trials may facilitate participants’ perception of positive emotion, which may in turn enhance their cognitive flexibility (Isen, Niedenthal, and Cantor 1992). Then, they can rely on their higher cognitive flexibility to adjust their cognitive control by reducing the information retention costs in tasks (Dreisbach 2006). Consequently, smaller language switching costs for positive emotional words were observed in emotional congruent trials.

# The impact of cool EF on language switching costs

In this study, the main effect of IC ability was insignificant, which is consistent with the findings of Zhang and Fan (2023) and contrary to our prediction and the findings of production-based language switching studies (e.g. Chang, Bai, and Wang 2018; Liu et al. 2019). The different stimulus properties may account for the disparity, namely non-emotional in language production studies and emotional in this study. Compared with non-emotional stimuli in language production studies, the emotional face-word pictures in this study may elicit competition between Chinese and English, between emotional words and faces, as well as between negative and positive emotions. Due to the shared processing resources between emotion and cognition (Pessoa 2008) and automatic processing of emotional information (Hermans, Houwer, and Eelen 2001), the presence of emotional stimuli can command a form of ‘hard prioritization’, thus high-IC participants may give priority to apportion more cognitive resources to suppress competition between different emotional information, rather than competition between language repetition and switching trials. As a consequence, the advantages of high-IC ability were weakened, resulting in no between-group differences in language switching costs.

The above discrepancy corroborated the different roles of IC in comprehension- and productionbased language switching. Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti (2016) proposed that the stimuli in language comprehension were univalent and no response competition was evoked, so there’s no need to rely on IC to resolve competition, resulting in insignificant differences between high- and low-IC groups. In contrast, the stimuli in language production were bivalent and generated response competition. Hence, high- and low-IC participants need to rely on IC to resolve competition, and the higher the IC ability, the smaller the language switching costs.

# The interactive effects of hot and cool EFs on language switching costs

Consistent with our prediction and the findings of Zhang and Fan (2023), the two-way and three-way interactions indicate that hot and cool EFs interplay during language switching. From data analysis, high-IC group’s larger language switching costs for negative emotional words were due to their longer RTs in English switching trials for negative emotional words. Given the low electrodermal reactivity to negatively valenced stimuli and decreased automaticity of L2 emotional processing (Pavlenko 2012), English negative emotional words in English switching trials may be activated weakly and occupy a small amount of processing resources. Then, large amount of processing resources will be diverted to high-IC participants’ language switching. Coupled with their IC advantage, they may exert greater inhibition on prior English trials, thus their RTs in English switching trials were longer for overcoming prior inhibition. Moreover, data analysis showed that high-IC participants’ larger language switching costs over low-IC ones in emotional congruent trials were due to their larger English switching costs. This may be due to the impacts of emotional content in emotional congruent trials on IC. Specifically, the emotional content in emotional congruent trials can enhance sensory representations of emotional items and these strengthened sensory representations will receive prioritized attention (Pessoa 2009). Thus, in these trials, high-IC participants may prioritize relying on their high IC ability to inhibit the competition between negative and positive valences in valence categorization task, leaving fewer cognitive resources to overcome the effects of non-proficient English on language switching task as compared to low-IC participants. Hence, high-IC participants exhibit larger English switching costs in emotional congruent trials, thereby producing larger language switching costs in these trials.

# Theoretical implications

The interactive effects of hot and cool EFs on language switching costs observed in this study, may to some extent, extend Dijkstra and van Heuven’s (2002) $\mathsf { B } | \mathsf { A } +$ model. Structurally, in view of the effects of emotional valence on language switching costs, the semantic representations in the word identification system can be divided into conceptual and emotional meanings. If the activated word is nonemotional, only its conceptual meaning can be activated. If it is an emotional word, both its conceptual and emotional meanings would be activated simultaneously or consecutively. As emotional meaning is activated earlier than conceptual meaning (Hermans, Houwer, and Eelen 2001), it should be put before conceptual meaning and interact with other representations to activate L1 and L2 language nodes. Furthermore, the results of our study indicate that bilinguals’ IC ability and emotional congruency can influence emotional word processing in the word identification system and the specification of ‘receives continuous input from the identification system’(Dijkstra and van Heuven 2002, 182) in the task/decision system. Thus, these two variables were added to the $\mathsf { B } \mathsf { I } \mathsf { A } +$ model (see the right box) to indicate their impacts on both the word identification system and the task/decision system. As emotional congruency modulated the effects of bilinguals’ IC ability on language switching costs, it was positioned above IC ability. Moreover, a bidirectional arrow was added between these two variables to indicate their interactions. Given the above extensions, an extended $\mathsf { B } \mathsf { I } \mathsf { A } +$ model is constructed (see Figure 4), awaiting more empirical evidence to demonstrate its validity.

# Conclusion

This study set out to explore the effects of EFs on language switching costs during ChineseEnglish emotional word comprehension. The results showed that emotional valence and emotional congruency of hot EFs modulated language switching costs independently and interactively, while also modulated the impact of cool EF on language switching costs. These findings to a certain extent reveal the processing mechanisms of language comprehension, and their similarities and differences from language production. However, there is a limitation in the universality of their comparative results, because no direct evidence has been obtained from production-based language switching studies. Future studies can explore the effects of cool and hot EFs on language switching costs during language production to provide direct evidence for their similarities and differences.
