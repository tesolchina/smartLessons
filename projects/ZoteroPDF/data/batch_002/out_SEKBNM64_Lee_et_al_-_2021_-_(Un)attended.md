This study reports findings of a comparative analysis of the use of (un)attended this/these in high- and low-rated L2 university student argumentative essays. Specifically, the analysis systematically compares the frequencies, antecedents, verb patterns, and attending noun stance options of (un)attended this/these in 174 assessed essays written by Chinese ESL undergraduate students in a first-year composition course, grouped into highand low-rated essays. Results reveal that high- and low-rated L2 students use this/these in different ways to establish rhetorical cohesion in building their arguments. Both groups tend to employ attended this/these more frequently, but the low-rated essays include significantly more unattended this/these. The low group relies more on copular verbs and phrasal antecedents, but the high group prefers lexical verbs and clausal/extended discoursal referents; however, with unattended this/these, both groups use copular and lexical verbs equally and the antecedents are predominantly clausal/extended discoursal referents. These two groups of student writers also select different types of stance options for attending nouns, especially in relation to the antecedent referents to which this/these plus noun indicates. We conclude with pedagogical implications for ESL composition instruction.

# 1. Introduction

In recent decades, a proliferation of research has been devoted to challenging long-held assumptions and purported rules of academic writing in style guides and textbooks to provide instructional advice based on descriptive practice rather than stylistic prescriptions. English for academic purposes (EAP) researchers have examined a wide range of features considered to be stylistically informal1 in academic writing. Chang and Swales (1999), for example, explored 10 commonly mentioned “informal” features in style manuals, including sentence-initial conjunctions/adverbs, contractions, and first-person pronouns, in 30 research articles (RAs) across three disciplines. More recently, Hyland and Jiang (2017) investigated these 10 elements in 360 RAs across four fields and time. Both studies found that these informal dimensions are highly represented across disciplines, thus showing incongruities between actual practice and prescriptive stylistic rules. Although “by small margins” (p. 48), Hyland and Jiang also discovered that academic writing has become more informal over the past 50 years.

# 1.1. This/these in specialist writing

Among features putatively considered to be informal, research focused on demonstratives, specifically the proximal anaphoric demonstratives this/these, has gained increasing attention in an effort to offer pedagogical guidance in this area considered to be problematic for novice academic writers (e.g., Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011; Jiang & Wang, 2018). Style manuals have long proscribed the use of pronominal this/these (or unattended this/these), as “[o]ut of control, the unattended this points to everywhere and nowhere” (Geisler, Kaufer, & Steinberg, 1985, p. 152). Even writing instructors for both firstlanguage (L1) and second-language (L2) students generally “advocate against employment of unattended this” (Wulff, Romer, € & Swales, 2012, p. 150). While acknowledging occasional use of unattended this/these in academic prose, Swales and Feak (2012) recommend that academic writers use the determiner this/these plus noun phrase (or attended this/these) “if there is a possibility your reader will not understand what this is referring to” (p. 43). However, both unattended and attended this/these have been found to be highly common in academic prose (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999). In fact, Swales (2005) reports that this is the 15th most frequent word and these is the 32nd most common word in the Hyland corpus of 240 RAs. Hyland and Jiang (2017) also found unattended this/these to be highly represented in RAs across soft and hard sciences.

However, as Gray (2010) rightly points out, most analyses of this/these have centered primarily on “verifying” their use and distributions in specialist texts with simple exploration of their context of use. In an effort to examine this problematic area systematically, a growing body of research has focused on various lexico-grammatical aspects and rhetorical contexts of this/ these in RAs. For example, investigating sentence-initial this/these in two disciplines, sociology and education, Gray (2010) not only analyzed the distribution of (un)attended this/these, 2 but she also identified and classified verb types and copular verb patterns following this/these; their antecedent referents; and the semantic types of nouns attending this/these. A particular category of attending nouns she analyzed was shell nouns (Hunston & Francis, 2000; Schmid, 2000), or a class of general abstract nouns that carry meaning only in their immediate context of use. As a follow up, Gray and Cortes (2011) examined these aspects of (un)attended this/these in applied linguistics and engineering RAs in three sentence positions (initial, medial, final). While both studies found a greater proportion of attended this/these, between $2 0 \%$ and $2 8 \%$ of this/these were unattended. Furthermore, both studies found that disciplines differ in the use of verb types, with engineering employing more lexical verbs than the soft fields, and that this/these plus shell nouns play an important role in establishing cohesion and recontextualizing prior textual information. Regarding referents, clausal antecedents were the most frequent with unattended this/these, followed by extended discourse. With attended this/these, the antecedent type varied depending on noun type: attended this/these followed by concrete nouns (e.g., car, teacher) nearly always referred to simple/complex noun phrase (NP) antecedents, while attended this/these plus shell nouns referred to clausal and extended discourse antecedents more frequently.

Jiang and Wang (2018), however, argue that, while “the choice of (un)attended this relates greatly to … textual interaction, previous studies have failed to fully explore the stance option of the interactional dimension of attendance” (p. 166). Rather than merely structuring discourse or specifying an empty shell’s content, attending nouns, which Jiang and Hyland (2015) call stance nouns, express a writer’s stance toward content, and thus these stance nouns play a critical rhetorical role in building an argument. Jiang and Wang (2018) studied the authorial practices of sentence-initial this in 160 RAs across eight disciplines. In addition to the distribution of (un)attended this, verb types, and antecedents, they examined the functional activities of lexical verbs and the stance options of attending nouns. Similar to previous findings, roughly $3 5 \%$ of this were unattended in RAs, and antecedent referents of unattended this were overwhelmingly clausal, followed by extended discourse. For attended this, a more even distribution of antecedents was found, though clausal referents were most frequent. Furthermore, they report that unattended this is more commonly followed by copular verbs while attended this is most frequently followed by lexical verbs functioning as research acts, or verbs referring to real-world objects, events, and procedures. Lastly, soft fields were found to include more instances of stance nouns called cognition nouns to express cognitive beliefs, attitudes, and reasoning, while hard science texts contained more event nouns to refer to actions, processes, or real-world evidence. Therefore, to fully appreciate authorial practices of this/these, it is critical, they argue, to not neglect the stance nouns that writers choose in “taking a persuasive authorial stance on the content they discuss” (p. 180).

# 1.2. This/these in student writing

While these studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the forms and functions of this/these in professional writing, they provide little insight into how students employ anaphoric demonstratives in academic writing, which pose a serious challenge for both L1 and L2 student writers (Swales, 2005). To gain a deeper appreciation of novice writers’ practices, Romer and Wulff (2010) € and Wulff et al. (2012) examined sentence-initial (un)attended this in the Michigan Corpus of Upperlevel Student Papers (MICUSP), a large corpus of high-rated papers written primarily by L1 final-year undergraduate through third-year graduate students across 15 disciplines. Romer and Wulff (2010)€ found that, while the undergraduates used unattended this more frequently, the proportional distribution of attended and unattended this “is very stable across all four [student] levels” (p. 118). Focusing on verbs accompanying this, Wulff et al. (2012) show that academic status, native speaker status, and gender have some influence on students’ verb choices.

Despite these efforts, little is known of L2 students’ use of this/these. A few studies have compared demonstratives in L1 and L2 student writing (e.g., Lenko-Szymanska, 2004; Oh, 2009; Petch-Tyson, 2000). Comparing L1 English student essays in LOCNESS (Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays) with L2 papers written by various European English as a foreign language (EFL) students in ICLE (International Corpus of Learner English), Petch-Tyson (2000) explored differences in demonstrative use. She reported that, besides French learners, L2 learners not only used fewer demonstratives overall, but they also employed a limited range of nouns attending this. Lenko-Szymanska (2004) compared low- and high-level Polish EFL learners’ use of demonstratives with an L1 reference corpus, yet her focus was on the choice between proximal (this/these) and distal (that/those) demonstratives. While no significant differences between the two Polish groups were found, she indicates that Polish learners favor that/those while L1 writers are partial to this/these. Among other informal features, Lee, Bychkovska, & Maxwell (2019) compared the use of anaphoric demonstrative pronouns in high-rated L1 and English as a second language (ESL) undergraduate students’ writing. L1 students were found to use more unattended this, and L2 students used more unattended that; however, both groups overwhelmingly preferred unattended this. Comparing LOCNESS essays with a corpus of low- and high-rated Korean EFL learner essays, Oh (2009) reported that both EFL groups “underused” overall demonstratives, unattended this, and attended these. Also, compared to the high-rated group, the low-rated learners underused overall demonstratives and the plural these, but no significant differences were found for this, that, or those. Recently, Jin (2019) compared (un)attended this/these in lower- and higher-level US-based ESL placement test essays. Her findings indicate that higher-level students employ significantly more this/these overall, with especially greater use of unattended this/ these. Additionally, antecedents in higher-level tests were more clausal and extended discourse compared to lower-level tests, whose antecedents were more frequently NPs. Attending nouns in lower-level tests were also found to be more concrete nouns while those in higher-levels tests were more frequently shell nouns.

These studies on L2 university student writing, however, are based on short texts “requiring no research or preparatory reading” (Leedham, 2015, p. 33) such as the ICLE (Petch-Tyson, 2000), timed in-class exams (Lenko-Szymanska, 2004), and timed placement tests (Jin, 2019). Such writing tasks, according to Leedham (2015), are artificial, restricted in scope, and highly decontextualized, and thus do not represent the types of writing expected of ESL undergraduate students at the university. Analysis of short-timed essays tells us little about how university students use this/these in source-based essays that are typically required of them. Furthermore, the use of this/these in these studies of short-timed texts may be influenced by such factors as writing prompts, which may ask students to offer opinions on topics they may have never considered previously (Leedham, 2015), and “task setting (time availability) and intertextuality (access to secondary sources)” (Adel, € 2008, p. 35). While research suggests great differences exist between general L2 English abilities and academic writing proficiency, we know very little about the use of (un)attended this/these in assessed source-based academic writing produced by matriculated ESL undergraduate students in US-based first-year composition (FYC), or the relationship between this/these and assessment of their writing in this context. Thus, limiting the analysis to short writing samples provides little guidance for FYC teachers in understanding matriculated ESL students’ rhetorical practices or how best to serve their needs at the early stage of university education (Bychkovska & Lee, 2017).

This study reports findings of a comparative analysis of the use of (un)attended this/these in high- and low-rated sourcebased argumentative essays produced by Chinese ESL undergraduate students in an FYC course. Through this comparison, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of how ESL academic writers’ choices relate to the assessment of their writing. Our study was guided by the following research questions:

1. To what extent do high- and low-rated ESL argumentative essays differ in their frequency of use of (un)attended this/these?   
2. To what extent do high- and low-rated ESL argumentative essays differ in the verb types and patterns following (un) attended this/these?   
3. To what extent do high- and low-rated ESL argumentative essays differ in the structural distribution of antecedents of (un) attended this/these?   
4. To what extent do high- and low-rated ESL argumentative essays differ in the stance options of attending nouns of this/ these?

# 2. Corpus and methodology

# 2.1. Description of the corpora

This study’s data consist of 174 assessed source-based argumentative essays written by Chinese ESL undergraduate students in a US-based FYC course. These essays are a subset of a large corpus of assessed ESL students’ writing, with grades ranging from A to F, and teachers’ written feedback at Ohio University called the Corpus of Ohio Learner and Teacher English (COLTE). We selected the argumentative essay because, regardless of disciplinary orientation, it is considered to be the most commonly assessed curricular genre in university settings, as “the development of an argument is regarded as a key feature of successful writing by academics across disciplines” (Wingate, 2012, p. 145).

The 174 essays selected derive from multiple sections of the first of two courses in the FYC sequence, specifically designed for international students and taught by L2 writing specialists with a minimum of an MA in TESOL/applied linguistics. This course is required for international students whose TOEFL iBT writing section score is below 24, institutional intensive English program’s (IEP) composition score is $5 / 6 ,$ , and/or IEP’s advanced writing course grade is a B or higher. Successful completion of this course permits students to enroll in the second course in the FYC sequence, which fulfills their FYC requirement for university graduation. The FYC course’s standardized curriculum develops students’ general academic writing skills in organization, coherence, idea development, paraphrasing, summarizing, source use, grammar, and vocabulary. However, at the time of data collection, no specific instruction was given to the use and functions of this/these.

The essays selected were the final draft of the final assessed, source-based argumentative essay project. For this assignment, students were required to select and research a topic, with instructor approval, and write a 900e1200 word essay using a minimum of four academic sources. Students wrote on various topics such as education (e.g., L2 learning, educational technology), military (e.g., military conflict, biochemical weapons), technology (e.g., social media, artificial intelligence), and environment (e.g., climate change, green energy). As the course adopts a process approach, this writing project required students to write a proposal, outline, and multiple drafts. For each draft, teachers provided written feedback using the same standardized grading rubric. Rubric categories include content, organization, source use, and language use. For draft one, teachers were expected to focus only on content and organization, while teachers graded and provided feedback on all categories for the remaining drafts, including the final draft.

Table 1 presents descriptions of the high- and low-rated Chinese ESL students from whom the essays were drawn. As the table shows, both groups’ average age was the same, but the high group resided in the US as well as studied English in the US and China slightly longer on average.

All essays were manually cleaned: we removed paper codes, titles, section headers, footers, and reference lists. Upon cleaning the papers, the total word count was 178,732. The data was then divided into two groups based on the grades assigned to the essays by course instructors: high corpus (HC) and low corpus (LC).3 The HC consists of essays earning grades of $9 0 \%$ or higher (A grades, $M = 9 4 . 5 2$ , $S D = 3$ ) while the LC is comprised of essays earning $7 9 . 5 \%$ or lower (C-F grades, $M =$ 71.35, $S D = 8 . 1 2$ ), as shown in Table 1. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of the study’s two corpora.

# 2.2. Methods of analysis

To identify this/these in the corpora, we first searched for all potential items using Antconc (Anthony, 2018). This search resulted in a total of 836 this/these in the HC and 302 instances in the LC. After retrieving all instances of this/these, we manually examined the concordance line and full textual context for each example because this/these can have multifunctional references: situational, time, anaphoric, cataphoric, and introductory references (Biber et al., 1999). Anaphoric demonstratives function as “verbal pointing” devices to create textual cohesiond“where the interpretation of some element in the discourse is dependent on that of another” (Halliday & Hasan, 1976, p. 4). They are referential structures that point back to earlier parts of the text to establish cohesion. We excluded all instances of this/these not used for anaphoric reference, as well as those appearing within quoted material. Each instance was then analyzed to determine its part of speech as a demonstrative pronoun (unattended this/these) or determiner (attended this/these) and its sentence position: initial (1), medial (2), or final (3).

(1) This has become a social phenomenon that has aroused people’s attention. (High)4 (2) However, for unpredictable reason that made this disease spread from the laboratory. (Low) (3) However, technology helps schools solve this problem. (High)

After identifying all instances of this/these, the main verbs following this/these were labeled as copular and lexical verbs. Adopting Gray’s (2010) syntactic classification of copular verbs, we categorized these verbs according to three main patterns: copular verb plus adjective: be adj (4); copular verb plus explanation: be because (5); and other patterns, primarily copular verb plus a noun phrase: other be (6).

(4) These robots are sophisticated in terms of size and precision. (Low) (5) This is because hybrid cars adopt petrol-electric mode so that cars do not consume gas constantly. (High) (6) Scientists think that these migratory waterfowl are the important reason to the spread of bird flu … (Low)

Based on a modified version of Hyland’s (2004) functional taxonomy of verb activities, lexical verbs were classified as mental acts, concerning cognitive processes (e.g., consider, regard), textual acts, involving verbal expressions (e.g., explain, discuss), and real-world acts, referring to real-world objects, events, and procedures (e.g., demonstrate, show).

Through a close reading of the preceding discourse, each antecedent referent was then identified and classified as a simple NP (7), complex NP (8), clause/sentence (9), or extended discourse (10), where the antecedent spans across multiple sentences, paragraphs, or whole text.

(7) Ebola is a kind of very rare disease....This disease has a high mortality … (Low)   
(8) … to accelerate the CPU which can speed up the whole computer, three main features inside the CPU could help to be faster. These are the clock speed, the multi-cores and the caches. (High)

(10) … technology has changed ways of learning maximally for students …. students could finish homework and search resources on computers recently …. students could check class notes online to take review …. online portfolios have a great number of benefits comparing with offline portfolios …. Technology gains students to have more opportunity to study some technical abilities more easily. For example, students can stay at home and use Twitter to exchange learning experiences or find many open-courses …. This is why technology has changed students’ leaning. (High)

Lastly, we explored the stance options of attending nouns of this/these, following Jiang and Hyland’s (2015) functional taxonomy of stance nouns. Previous studies (e.g., Gray, 2010; Jin, 2019) have classified these attending nouns in semantic rather than functional terms. According to Jiang and Wang (2018), such studies have been concerned with the discourse organizing features of these nouns, and thus “have failed to fully explore the stance option of the interactional dimension of attendance” (p. 166). Furthermore, as Jiang and Hyland (2018) underscore, “each instance of metadiscursive nouns should be examined in its lexico-grammatical context rather than classifying it by semantic meaning alone” (p. 518). Following Jiang and Wang (2018), we examined the stance options of attending nouns. Stance is defined as expressions of “personal feelings, attitudes, value judgments or assessments” (Biber et al., 1999, p. 99), enabling writers to convey their epistemic and affective position on the proposition. As Lancaster (2014) argues, stance can “play a role in shaping readers’ judgments of overall writing quality” of student writing (p. 28). Jiang and Hyland’s (2015) framework consists of three broad stance noun categories: entity, attribute, and relation. Entity nouns express a writer’s orientation to texts, events, discourses, or cognitive dimensions; attribute nouns convey a writer’s assessment of the quality, status, and formation of entities; and relation nouns concern a writer’s understanding of connections and relationships between entities. Using this classification system, each attending noun was coded in functional terms. In our data, many nouns following this/these were concrete nouns (e.g., robot, people) that can be touched physically:

(11) These robots help the individuals … (Low) (12) … they think these students have good sense of communication skills … (High)

Because concrete nouns do not convey some sort of stance on the antecedent, we excluded these nouns; only the stance of attending abstract nouns (e.g., process, idea) was analyzed (Table 3).

Each author worked independently to manually locate and analyze each item in both corpora in terms of positionality, verb type and pattern, antecedent, and stance option of the attending noun. Interrater agreement was assessed with Cohen’s kappa (k) for each of the main categories investigated: $\kappa = . 9 6$ for positionality, $\kappa = . 9 3$ for verb type and pattern, $\kappa = . 9 2$ for antecedent, and $\kappa = . 8 9$ for stance noun option. These kappa statistics indicate extremely high interrater reliability. Remaining discrepancies were discussed until full agreement was reached. Item frequencies were normalized to occurrences per 10,000 words (ptw). To determine whether the differences were statistically significant, we used the Mann-Whitney $U$ test, a nonparametric alternative to the independent samples $t \cdot$ -test. The alpha was set at 0.05 (two-tailed), with a Bonferroni correction applied where appropriate.

# 3. Result and discussion

# 3.1. Comparison of (un)attended this/these

Table 4 presents descriptive statistics of this/these by type and corpus. There were considerable differences in the mean frequencies between the two groups. The mean frequency of the total this/these in the LC is more than three times greater than that of the HC; it is also nearly three times that of the HC for attended this/these. For unattended this/these, the LC’s mean frequency is nearly six times higher than the HC. Previous studies (e.g., Jin, 2019; Oh, 2009) report that higher-proficiency L2 writing includes a greater frequency of this/these than lower-level essays. Our findings, however, show a reverse pattern: lowrated writers use this/these much more frequently than high-rated writers.

Comparisons of overall this/these show significant differences between the two corpora. A Mann-Whitney test, with a Bonferroni correction, indicated that the LC $M d n = 1 . 4 3$ ) includes significantly more this/these than the HC $M d n = 0 . 3 7 ;$ , $U =$ 848, $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 5 3$ ). It also showed significantly more unattended this/these in the LC $( M d n = 0 . 2 4 )$ ) than in the HC $M d n =$ .04), $U = 1 0 9 4 . 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 4 9$ ). In Jin’s (2019) study of ESL placement tests, higher-level students utilized significantly more overall and unattended this/these, but no difference was found for attended this/these. Corroborating Jin’s result, our finding also shows no difference for attended this/these between the LC $M d n = 0 . 7 1$ ) and HC $M d n = 0 . 2 9$ ), $U = 2 1 9 4$ , $p = . 0 6$ , $r = 0 . 1 8$ . However, as indicated above, opposite trends emerge for overall and unattended this/these. Dissimilar to Jin, our analysis shows that the low group uses significantly more unattended and overall this/these.

Comparisons of the percentages of this/these show a different pattern than the frequency differences. Similar to previous findings (Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011; Jiang & Wang, 2018; Jin, 2019), both groups used attended this/these much more frequently ${ \mathrm { H C } } = 8 5 \%$ ; $L C = 7 2 \%$ ), but unattended this/these “is clearly not a rare phenomenon” (Romer € & Wulff, 2010, p. 116). Furthermore, as the location of this/these in a sentence shifts from initial to final positions, both groups preferred to use attended this/these, as shown in Fig. 1.

Perhaps, it is not surprising that these demonstratives are more attended as they are positioned further along a sentence. As these devices move further away from their antecedents, attending this/these can reduce the ambiguity of the antecedents to which these markers point. Another observation to note is the preference for the sentence-initial position for both attended and unattended this/these. Irrespective of proficiency, the initial position remains the “locus classicus” of this/these (Swales, 2005). Also, similar to findings of RAs (Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011; Jiang & Wang, 2018), both groups overwhelmingly employed attended this/these, thus demonstrating students’ general adherence to stylistic prescription.

Fig. 1. Distribution of sentence position of (un)attended this/these in HC and LC.

Diverging from Jin’s (2019) findings, however, our study’s high-rated writers used unattended this/these proportionally much less frequently than low-rated students. While Jin argues that L2 learners increasingly use more unattended this/these as their writing abilities increase, our analysis demonstrates a reverse trend: higher proficiency undergraduate L2 writers use fewer unattended this/these than students with lower writing abilities. In their study of MICUSP writers, Romer and Wulff € (2010) found that the frequency of unattended this does not increase as students advance in their academic experience. They maintain that the proportional distribution of (un)attended this remains extremely stable across academic levels. However, they also observed that “final year undergraduate writers produce more cases of unattended this than their more advanced peers” (p. 118). Unlike Romer and Wulff, who only examined € this, our study included both this and these. We, therefore, decided to take a closer look at only this for comparison. In our data, this accounts for $6 4 . 5 \%$ and $6 5 . 5 \%$ of proximal demonstratives in the HC and LC, respectively. Among this, $3 8 . 3 \%$ is unattended in the LC while $2 0 . 5 \%$ is unattended in the HC. Perhaps, as Romer and Wulff report, when student writers achieve senior-level or above status, € “the ratio of 3:1 for attended and unattended this is very stable” across student levels (p. 118). For early-undergraduate L2 learners, however, higher proficiency students’ writing, unlike that of students with lower writing abilities, is more considerate of readers’ needs with the greater inclusion of attended over unattended this/these, which enhances the clarity of the writing.

Our findings, therefore, do not support Jin’s (2019) claim that there is “an increased share of the pronoun this/these with an increase in learners’ skill levels” (p. 67). In fact, our findings show an opposite patternda decrease in unattended this/these with increasing abilities. These differences may be due to a number of factors. This study’s data included final drafts of sourcebased essays written by undergraduate students in a FYC course on topics they selected and researched over several weeks with feedback provided by instructors throughout the process of writing. Jin’s study, however, included both undergraduate and graduate students, and they wrote short essays (240e300 words) under timed conditions $( 3 0 \mathrm { \ m i n } )$ ) on assigned test topics: opinion-based essays on a selected topic for undergraduate students and response essays based on a chart/graph or news/survey excerpt provided for graduate students. Thus, dissimilarities in such factors as writing task, communicative purpose, essay length, time availability, topic familiarity, genre differences, and secondary source use (Adel, 2008 € ) may explain some of the differences between Jin’s (2019) and our findings.

# 3.2. Comparison of verb patterns

Overall comparisons of verb types following this/these show significant differences between the two corpora. A MannWhitney $U$ test, with a Bonferroni correction, shows that the LC $( M d n = 0 . 2 4 )$ includes more copular verbs than the HC $( M d n = 0 . 0 7 $ ), $U = 1 6 2 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 3 4$ , and lexical verbs used in the LC $( M d n = 0 . 3 6$ ) also differed from the HC $( M d n = 0 . 1 5 )$ , $U = 1 8 2 7 . 5$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $r = 0 . 2 7 .$ There were, however, no significant differences for the subcategories of lexical verbs: mental acts $U = 3 0 5 5$ , $p = 1 _ { : }$ , $r = 0 . 0 9$ ), textual acts $U = 2 7 5 4$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ ), and real-world acts $U = 2 2 9 2$ , $p = . 2 3$ , $r = 0 . 1 5$ ). If we compare percentages, we also observe that the LC $( 3 5 \% )$ includes more copular verbs than the HC $( 2 7 \% )$ ; however, the high group $( 7 3 \% )$ employed more lexical verbs than the low group $( 6 5 \% )$ . The high group’s behavior is similar to Jiang and Wang’s (2018) findings of RA writers, who utilize copular verbs approximately $2 2 \%$ of the time. Looking at only attended this/these, a Mann-Whitney U comparison indicates that no statistical differences exist for any verb types following attended this/these: copular verbs $( U = 2 1 6 0 , p = . 0 3 , r = 0 . 2 1 )$ and lexical verbs $U = 2 3 5 3$ , $p = . 3 7$ , $r = 0 . 1 4 $ ). Proportionally, both groups relied less on copular verbs with attended this/these, but the LC $( 2 6 \% )$ still contains more copular verbs than the HC $( 2 0 \% )$ . In Jiang and Wang’s study, the proportional distribution of copular verbs with attended this in RAs was $1 6 \%$ while $8 4 \%$ were lexical verbs. In our data, $8 0 \%$ of verbs in the HC are lexical while $7 4 \%$ are lexical in the LC. Verb type percentages in the HC, thus, match more closely with RAs than the LC. This finding suggests that, with greater proficiency, L2 students tend to rely less on copular verbs with attended this/these.

For unattended this/these, a Mann-Whitney U comparison also shows that no statistical differences exist for any verb types following this/these: copular verbs $U = 2 2 4 0$ , $p = . 0 3$ , $r = 0 . 2 1$ ) and lexical verbs $( U = 2 3 7 8 , p = . 1 7 , r = 0 . 1 6 )$ . If we compare the percentages of verbs used, both groups used copular $\mathrm { T } \mathrm { C } = 5 2 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 5 0 \%$ ) and lexical verbs $\mathrm { H C } = 4 8 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 5 0 \%$ in equal proportions. Previous research has shown that copular verbs following unattended this in RAs range between $3 3 \%$ and $5 0 \%$ (Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011; Jiang & Wang, 2018), with applied linguists using copular verbs $5 0 \%$ of the time. With both attended and unattended this/these, the high-rated writers’ verb use generally matches more closely to those of RA writers, thus suggesting that language proficiency may influence the verb types used following this/these.

Analysis of the copular verb patterns of this/these indicates that the syntactic construction be adj is significantly more frequent in the LC $M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ) than in the HC $\textprime M d n = 0 . 0 0 $ ), $U = 2 0 5 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 2 6 \AA$ ), while no differences were found for beþbecause ( $U = 2 7 2 6$ , $p = . 4 4$ , $r = 0 . 1 1$ ) and other be $U = 2 3 6 6$ , $p = . 1 6$ , $r = 0 . 1 5$ ). Examining the percentages, other be is the most common pattern in both corpora $\mathrm { H C } = 6 1 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 5 0 \%$ ), similar to RAs (Jiang & Wang, 2018). However, the high-rated writers used proportionally more of the other be pattern while the low-rated students utilized more of the be adj ${ \mathrm { T } } \mathbf { C } = 3 6 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 4 3 \%$ ) and beþbecause $. \mathrm { H C } = 3 \%$ , $L C = 7 \%$ ) patterns.

Upon analyzing more closely the syntactic patterns of copular verbs following attended and unattended this/these separately, some interesting trends emerge. With attended this/these, no statistical differences exist for any of the patterns: be adj $U = 2 4 6 5$ , $p = . 2 0$ , $r = 0 . 1 4$ ) and other be $U = 2 8 6 2$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0$ ); neither group used be because with attended this/ these. However, the percentages demonstrate that the high-rated writers used be adj $( 5 1 \% )$ and other be $( 4 9 \% )$ equally while $6 4 \%$ are be adj and $3 6 \%$ are other be in the LC with attended this/these. For unattended this/these, there were no statistical differences for any of the three patterns: beþadj ( $U = 2 6 0 3$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 1 5$ ), beþbecause $U = 2 7 2 7$ , $p = . 4 4$ , $r = 0 . 1 1$ ), and other be ( $U = 2 6 9 0$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 6$ ). Proportionally, both groups used more other be $\mathrm { H C } = 7 7 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 6 2 \%$ ) than $b e +$ adj $\mathrm { \Delta H C } = 1 7 \%$ ; $\mathrm { L C } = 2 4 \%$ ) and beþbecause ( $\mathrm { H C } = 6 \%$ ; $L C = 4 \%$ ). While the use of other be increases proportionally in both groups with unattended this/these, we can observe that the high-rated writers used this pattern much more commonly with unattended this/ these.

In Gray’s (2010) study, be adj accounted for only a quarter of copular verbs following unattended this/these in RAs with frequent adjectives including significant, relevant, and consistent. Yet, in our data, no such evaluative adjectives appear. In fact, the only frequent adjective in the LC is helpful $3 / 7$ cases), but no adjective patterns appear in the HC. High-rated students used a range of adjectives including useful, better, important, and difficult. According to Jiang and Wang (2018), adjectives in this copular pattern allow writers to rhetorically “express an evaluation of the proposition carried along” with this/these (p. 175), yet both groups do not appear to take full advantage of what this syntactic pattern affords. This finding may indicate that, at this stage of university education, L2 students’ vocabulary for expressing evaluation with this patten may be restricted.

# 3.3. Comparison of antecedent referents

Overall comparisons of the antecedent referents of this/these show significant differences between the two groups. A Mann-Whitney $U$ test, with a Bonferroni correction, shows that the LC $M d n = 0 . 4 8$ ) includes significantly more simple NP referents than the HC $M d n = 0 . 1 5$ ), $U = 5 9 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 6 0$ , while no statistical differences were found for the other antecedent referents: complex NP $U = 2 4 8 2$ , $\pmb { p = . 5 7 , r = 0 . 1 1 } .$ ), clause $( U = 2 1 8 1 , p = . 0 7 , r = 0 . 1 8 )$ , and extended discourse ( $U =$ 3128, $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 8$ ). The percentage comparisons indicate that nearly $5 1 \%$ of the antecedents in the HC are clauses and extended discourse, but less than $4 0 \%$ are of these types in the LC. Previous research of RAs shows that between $5 3 \%$ (Gray, 2010) and $7 4 \%$ (Jiang & Wang, 2018) of antecedent referents are clauses and extended discourse.

Turning to attended this/these, significant differences were only found for simple NP referents, similar to overall this/these. The low-rated writers $M d n = 0 . 4 8$ referred to simple NPs with attended this/these more frequently than the high-rated students $( M d n = 0 . 0 7 )$ ), $U = 7 1 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 5 7$ ; however, no differences exist for the other referents: complex NP $U =$ 3367, $p = . 1 6$ , $r = 0 . 1 6 \mathrm { \ : }$ ), clausal $U = 2 8 6 4$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 0 1$ ), and extended discourse $U = 2 9 9 5$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ ). Our findings partially support Jin’s (2019) study, where she also found that lower-level students refer significantly more to simple NP referents. Diverging from Jin, however, our analysis shows that both groups referred to simple NPs most regularly with attended this/these $\mathrm { H C } = 4 3 \%$ ; $L C = 6 3 \%$ ), as shown in Fig. 2. Nonetheless, with attended this/these, Fig. 2 shows that less than $3 0 \%$ are clausal or extended discourse referents in the LC while $45 \%$ are of these referents in the HC. Jiang and Wang (2018) report that $6 4 \%$ of the referents are clauses or extended discourse with attended this/these, and Gray (2010) found that approximately $5 2 \%$ of referents are of these two types in RAs. In Jin’s (2019) study, $4 2 \%$ of antecedents in lower-level tests were clauses or extended discourse while $6 4 \%$ were of these two types in higher-level tests. Thus, our findings appear to suggest that high-rated writers point to referents in ways more similar to other advanced writers than low-rated students because of their, perhaps, greater implicit awareness to extend the referents of attended this/these more frequently beyond the local cohesion to previous NPs.

Antecedents of unattended this/these reveal a slightly different picture. The comparison shows that the LC $( M d n = 0 . 0 0 $ ) included more simple NP referents than the HC $M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ), $U = 2 2 1 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 2 7 ,$ , and the LC $( M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ) also referred to complex NPs more frequently than the HC $M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ), $U = 2 3 1 2$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 2 9$ ). No significant differences were found for clauses $U = 2 2 7 5$ , $p = . 0 9$ , $r = 0 . 1 7$ ) or extended discourse $U = 2 9 4 0$ , $p = 1$ , $r = 0 . 0 4$ ). Our findings partially support Jin’s (2019) study, where she found that the simple NP referents were more frequent in lower-level tests while both clausal and extended discourse referents were more common in higher-level tests, with no difference for complex NPs. However, in terms of proportional distribution, Fig. 2 shows that clausal and extended discourse referents combined are far more attested in both corpora than NPs $L C = 6 7 \%$ ; $\mathrm { H C } = 8 0 \%$ ), similar to other studies (Gray, 2010; Jiang & Wang, 2018; Jin, 2019). In Gray’s (2010) study, clausal and extended discourse types constituted $8 7 \%$ of unattended this/these uses in RAs, while Jiang and Wang (2018) found that approximately $9 2 \%$ of antecedents in RAs are of these two referents. Jin (2019) reports that $7 3 \%$ and $8 9 \%$ of referent types are clauses and extended discourse in lower- and higher-level ESL tests, respectively. The distribution of these antecedent types in our study’s high-rated essays more closely match both higher-level ESL placement tests and RAs, thus supporting the developmental progression for antecedent referents with unattended this/these proposed by Jin. Our analysis also suggests that L2 writers “depend more on structurally complex and indirect reference created by demonstratives” (Jin, 2019, p. 70), as their writing proficiency increases.

# 3.4. Comparison of stance options of attending nouns

Before reporting and discussing the stance options of attending nouns of this/these, it is important to note that nearly $4 8 \%$ of the nouns following this/these in the LC express no stance (i.e., concrete nouns), while over $8 5 \%$ of the nouns in the HC convey some type of stance.

Overall comparisons of the stance options of attending nouns of this/these show significant differences between the two groups. A Mann-Whitney $U$ test shows that stance nouns in the LC $( M d n = 0 . 4 8$ ) differed significantly from the HC $( M d n =$ 0.22), $U = 1 9 8 8$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $r = 0 . 2 3$ . The HC $M d n = 0 . 1 5$ ) includes significantly more of the entity category than the LC $M d n =$ 0.00), $U = 3 5 8 8$ , $p = . 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 1 9$ , and the high group’s use $( M d n = 0 . 0 7$ ) of the entity subcategory event nouns differed significantly from the low group’s use $M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ), $U = 3 7 6 4$ , $\mathbf { p } = . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 2 4$ . No significant differences were found for the other stance categories (attribute: $U = 2 3 9 4$ , $p = . 1 0$ , $r = 0 . 1 3$ ; relation: $U = 2 6 2 8$ , $p = . 1 8$ , $r = 0 . 1 0 \AA$ ). Similarly, a comparison of the proportional distribution shows that HC includes more entity nouns $( 5 7 \% )$ , especially the event type $( 4 6 \% )$ , than the LC $( 4 9 \% )$ , while the LC contains a greater percentage of attribute $\mathrm { H C } = 3 9 \%$ ; $L C = 4 3 \%$ ) and relation nouns $H C = 4 \%$ ; $L C = 8 \%$ ). In his study of L1 English and Chinese EFL undergraduate students’ use of stance nouns, Jiang (2015) found that the EFL students made less frequent use of entity nouns but more frequent use of attribute nouns. Employing fewer entity nouns, he argues, “would undermine the students’ ability to fulfill the generic convention of argumentative essays,” as readers of this genre would “expect the proposition and perspective in an essay to be built on factual events” (p. 95). As examples 13 and 14 show, the high-rated writers frequently used entity nouns (fact and examples, respectively) to position the antecedents as observable events in order to develop their arguments on factual evidence:

(13) American college students are the group of people who are using social media frequently. Given this fact, it has a strong influence to use social networking sites … (High)

![](img/0fb4ea90e93c8349a21abf17bc5e8fcd7cba978429a93748dce872d996882778.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Distribution of antecedent referents of (un)attended this/these in HC and LC.

(14) The stock market is another area which has been deeply impacted by fake news …. John Kowalewski (2017) mentioned a story which happened in China. The fake news released by the Chinese news website directly caused the stock price of the company to plummet between 2012 to 2013 …. In a similar way, in America, hackers used the Associated Press’ twitter to send out false news which claimed that President Obama was injured in the blast, and stock worth \$130 billion instantly evaporated (Rapoza, 2017). These real examples are enough evidence to suggest that fake news has a big impact.... (High)

In contrast, greater reliance on attribute nouns in low-rated essays reveals their greater “propensity to express their attitudinal evaluation and value-laden judgements of entity’s attributes” in building their arguments rather than basing arguments on factual events (p. 96), as shown in examples 15 and 16:

(15) … parents who have generation gap would gradually reduce communication with their children. To solve this problem, Facebook is a good communicate channel … (Low)   
(16) … some researches about vegetarian children show that people who being a vegetarian as a child are lack three main nutrition in their body, which are iron, vitamin D and vitamin B12. Thus, these deficiencies have bad influence on children. (Low)

One contradictory case is that of the relation category. $8 \%$ of the nouns in the LC constitute relation nouns while the HC only includes $4 \%$ of this option. According to Jiang, greater use of relation nouns “can open up discursive space for writers to extend discussion and argue for a further viewpoint” (p. 96). Based on the percentages, the high-rated writers seem to take less advantage of this opportunity. However, the difference between the two groups, as indicated above, is not significant. It, thus, appears that both groups rarely use this stance option to make connections or relationships between ideas to open dialogic spaces to further their argumentation.

Digging deeper into the stance options, we examined whether the use of these nouns would differ depending on the antecedent referents: simple/complex NPs and clause/extended discourse. Similar to the overall distribution, when the antecedent is a simple/complex NP, a Mann-Whitney $U$ test shows that the HC $M d n = 0 . 0 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) includes significantly more entity nouns than the LC $\textprime M d n = 0 . 0 0 $ ), $U = 3 7 2 6$ , $p = . 0 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 2 4$ , and the high group $M d n = 0 . 0 7$ ) also used the entity subcategory event nouns more frequently than the low group $\textprime M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ), $U = 3 6 1 0$ , $p = . 0 0 4$ , $r = 0 . 2 2$ . No differences were found for the other categories (attribute: $U = 2 4 6 4$ , $p = . 1 1$ , $r = 0 . 1 2$ ; relation: $U = 2 7 2 0$ , $p = . 2 3$ , $r = 0 . 0 9$ ). Also, when the antecedent is a simple/complex NP, the percentage for entity nouns in the HC $( 7 0 \% )$ increases greatly while it decreases in LC $( 4 2 \% )$ ; conversely, attribute nouns increase in the LC $( 4 3 \% )$ while they decrease in the HC $( 3 9 \% )$ , but there is no change for relation nouns.

In contrast to NP referents, the analysis reveals a different stance pattern when the antecedent referents are clausal/ extended discourse. A Mann-Whitney $U$ test shows that the HC $M d n = 0 . 0 7 )$ ) includes significantly more attribute nouns than the LC $( M d n = 0 . 0 0$ ), $U = 3 7 1 6$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $r = 0 . 2 4$ . Specifically, the high-rated essays used significantly more of the attribute subcategories quality $U = 3 3 8 3$ , $p = 0 . 0 1$ , $r = 0 . 1 9$ ) and manner nouns $U = 3 3 8 2$ , $p = . 0 3$ , $r = 0 . 1 7$ ). With clausal/extended discourse referents, the HC $M d n = 0 . 1 5$ also included significantly more total stance nouns than the LC $( M d n = 0 . 0 0 )$ , $U =$ 3665, $p = . 0 0 4$ , $r = 0 . 2 2$ , but no differences were found for the other two categories (entity: $U = 3 3 7 8$ , $p = . 0 6$ , $r = 0 . 1 4$ ; relation: $U = 2 7 6 9$ , $p = . 5 4$ , $r = 0 . 0 5$ ). It seems to be the case that high-rated writers tend to use more of these stance types to evaluate the attribute of entire clauses or extended discourse, thus making “their claims significant and persuasive” (Jiang & Wang, 2018, p. 177):

(17) We cannot expect the driverless car to make a moral decision in some dilemma; and the responsibility cognizance of accidents caused by driverless cars is still unclear. Furthermore, privacy issue has not been solved primarily, even there has been no policy on it. However, to solve these problems is not impossible.

The use of attribute nouns to point to clausal and extended discourse antecedents allows writers “to offer a higher-level recontextualization of the previous text” (Swales, 2005, p. 3), and thus “impose an … evaluation/stance on the antecedent while at the same time building on which to base subsequent propositions” (Gray, 2010, p. 177). As Fig. 3 shows, the antecedent influences the stance options for both groups. In the LC, we observe an increase in the use of entity nouns and a decrease in attribute nouns when the referent changes from NP to clause/extended discourse. In the HC, we see an opposite trendda decrease in entity nouns and an increase in attribute nouns as the antecedent changes from NP to clause/extended discourse. By combining a greater number of entity nouns, pointing to NPs to build their argument on factual evidence, and attribute nouns to refer to clauses and extended discourse to evaluate the evidence, we argue that high-rated writers are able to craft their texts with claims that are not only built on facts but those that are highly persuasive. This combination may contribute to the positive assessment of their papers.

# 4. Conclusion

This comparative analysis of (un)attended this/these in source-based ESL undergraduate student essays reveals that highand low-rated L2 students use this/these in different ways to establish rhetorical cohesion in building their arguments. Supporting previous findings (e.g., Jin, 2019), unattended this/these is well attested in the writing of L2 university students, although the overwhelming majority of this/these used are attended. Unlike Jin (2019), however, our findings reveal that highrated L2 students employ fewer pronouns than low-rated students; instead, they use a greater number of attended this/these, thus adhering more closely to prescriptive rules. Additionally, low-rated students tend to utilize a higher frequency of copular and lexical verbs than high-rated writers overall, most likely due to their greater reliance on this/these in their writing. With unattended this/these, however, both groups use copular and lexical verbs in roughly the same way. In terms of copular verb patterns, copular verb plus noun phrase is more common in high-rated essays, similar to RAs (Gray, 2010; Jiang & Wang, 2018), while low-rated writers appear to favor the copular verb plus adjective structural pattern. Supporting Jin (2019), our findings also suggest “a developmental pattern in the structural distribution of antecedents” for L2 student writers (p. 28): a decrease of NP referents and increase of clausal/extended referents with increasing writing abilities. Antecedent referents in low-rated essays tend to be more phrasal overall, and especially with attended this/these, but referents are more clausal/extended discourse in high-rated essays. With unattended this/these, antecedents in both groups are predominantly clausal/extended discourse, but high-rated writers point more to these referents than low-rated writers. Finally, when it comes to choosing nouns for attended this/these, the two groups select different types of stance options, especially in relation to the antecedent referent to which this/these plus noun refers. For NP referents, high-rated writers prefer entity nouns while attribute nouns are used by the low group. In contrast, high-rated writers favor attribute nouns, though also using event nouns frequently, for clausal/extended discourse referents unlike low-rated students who prefer entity nouns.

These findings suggest that high-rated L2 writers construct a cohesive argument based on factual evidence, and, at the same time, take “a persuasive authorial stance on the content they discuss” (Jiang & Wang, 2018, p. 180). They do this with their judicious use of unattended this/these and more frequent employment of attended this/these followed by a more balanced selection of event and attribute nouns, especially with clausal and extended discourse referents, and lexical verbs. Thus, the careful deployment of (un)attended this/these seems to contribute to the positive assessment of their writing, as writing teachers may tacitly perceive their texts as being cohesively persuasive.

Approaching the analysis of (un)attended this/these from multiple perspectives allowed us to examine ESL undergraduate students’ stylistic practices in great detail, but a few methodological limitations exist. First, while all attempts were made to establish an even distribution of high- and low-rated papers, we must admit that the two groups are unbalanced. Furthermore, the dichotomization of continuous data could lead to some information being lost, especially the variance in the data set, which may impact the generalizability of our findings. Future research could compare more equal-sized groups across grade tiers using correlation or regression to account for variance in determining the extent to which proficiency impacts students’ use of this/these. An analysis such as this may lead to greater precision of results. Additionally, because we analyzed the assessed writing of Chinese ESL students in an FYC course at only one US institution, our findings may not be generalizable to the variety of L2 writing contexts. It might be instructive for future research to examine the writing practices of students in a diversity of educational settings. Lastly, our study examined source-based argumentative essays within FYC, so differences found between this study and others may be due to the writing context, writing task, time availability, topic familiarly, genre, and secondary source use. As Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1999) note, “demonstrative usage might be quite genre specific in written discourse” (p. 308). For this reason, future research could use a balanced corpus of a range of student genres across proficiency levels in various rhetorical situations to determine whether it is proficiency or rhetorical situation, or a combination of these variables, that influences students’ use of demonstratives in their writing.

# 5. Pedagogical implications

Despite these limitations, this study offers implications for L2 writing instruction. As scholars have explained, the decision to use attended or unattended this/these is a complex and problematic area for L2 student writers, since, as Jiang and Wang (2018) note, the use of this/these is a rhetorical and stylistic issue rather than a grammatical one. Geisler et al. (1985) highlight a tradeoff between clarity and economy. With attended this/these, writers may produce a text that is “clear, but ponderous” while resigning to unattended this/these may lead to a “fluent, but fuzzy” prose (p. 149). We agree with Swales’ (2005) response to the question of whether L2 students should be “encouraged to match” the rates of unattended this/these found in professional academic writing: “Probably not” (p. 14). It is obviously clear now that unattended this/these is not uncommon in either professional or student writing, but we would caution against advocating for greater inclusion of pronominal this/these. Including more unattended this/these may lead to increasing chances of ambiguity of the antecedents to which these demonstratives refer, especially in L2 student writing. As the present study shows, students who earned lower grades on their writing included more unattended this/these. Thus, while we do not support proscribing the use of unattended this/these, utilizing attended this/these appropriately, as Swales (2005) recommends, not only “helps to give a professional cast to the text,” but this/these plus noun phrase can also “reduce the chances of ambiguity” and aid reading processes (p. 14).

In line with other EAP scholars, then, writing instructors would need to raise students’ awareness of the rhetorical purposes of (un)attended this/these and the interactional functions of attending nouns to help students make appropriate decisions in their writing. Rather than simply focusing on the grammar of this/these, composition teachers could engage students in various consciousness-raising tasks to sensitize students to the ways in which proximal demonstratives create textual cohesion, clarity, and interaction in a text. Using authentic texts, for instance, students could be asked to identify what the demonstratives in the texts point to in order to raise awareness of the textual purposes of demonstratives. Further, students could engage in tasks that enhance their understanding of the rhetorical effect that substituting this/these  NP with simply this/these or other pronouns (e.g., that, it) can have on readers. Writing teachers could also help students understand the stance that attending nouns convey and the effect these nouns can have on readers’ understanding of the proposition. Teachers, for example, could provide students with texts followed by options of sentences with different attending nouns, and then instruct them to choose among the options, explain what stance is conveyed through the choice they select, and what stance is expressed in the other options. In addition to introducing students to various linking adverbials (e.g., furthermore, additionally, however) used to create cohesion, we believe that L2 writing instructors need to expand students’ understanding of the important role other devices such as (un)attended this/these can play on textual cohesion and the interactive effects attending nouns have in constructing sophisticatedly cohesive and persuasive arguments in academic writing.
