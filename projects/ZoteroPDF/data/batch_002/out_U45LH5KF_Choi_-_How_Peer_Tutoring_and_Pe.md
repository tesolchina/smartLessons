This study investigates the effect of peer tutoring and peer tutor training program on Korean university students' EFL writing. Six tutors and twelve tutees have participated in the experiment. The tutors were divided into untrained and trained groups each of which was assigned to teach six tutees. The three peer tutors in the experimental group received training on how to give peer tutoring. After the pre-test, the tutees wrote series of drafts on three topics and received written feedback from their peer tutors via email. The results of the post-test showed improvement in writing scores in both groups. The tutees in the trained peer tutor group, however, showed much greater improvement. Their improvement was also more consistent, and the score differences between the two groups increased over time. Analysis of the peer tutors' written feedback indicated that the trained tutors focused more on the higher order concerns in writing than the untrained ones did. In the questionnaire all tutees responded positively to the peer tutoring experience. The results indicate that peer tutor training programs may have beneficial effects on Korean university students’ writing abilities especially in the elements of higher order concerns.

# I. INTRODUCTION

The instructional roles of peers in classroom learning have long been discussed. A well-known term in this regard is peer feedback. Peer feedback refers to learners working together to review, revise and provide comments on each other’s work, which naturally involves reciprocal learning. Studies on peer feedback have reported its beneficial influences on various aspects of second language development. Some of them (e.g., Ji-Hye Yi, 2009) investigated the effects of peer feedback on speaking and listening, but most (Min-Seon Bong, 2007; Hyo-Jin Kim, 2008; Yanghee Kim & Jiyoung Kim, 2005; Kurt & Atay, 2007; Jee Hyun Ma, 2006; Eun-Young Park, 2004; Yong & Lee, 2008) were about its roles on various aspects of second language writing instructions and improving writing abilities in the target language.

Peer tutoring, on the other hand, refers to more advanced students or upper-class students teaching lower-level students but not the other way around. Topping (1996) defined peer tutoring as “specific role taking at any point someone has the job of tutor while the other(s) are in the role of tutee(s)’’ (p. 322). Since the tutors and the tutees involved are both students in nature, peer tutoring is also considered less threatening and intimidating (Ferris, 2003). A tutor can establish rapport and bond with a tutee as being more at their own level. In addition, peer tutors do not take on the role as a grade-giver on the papers like the teacher does, which can reduce anxiety of the tutees in their interactions with the tutors.

Research on peer tutoring so far has reported benefits and concerns. Some illustrated that the treatment provided by the peer tutors can contribute to tutors' and tutees' academic and social development (Berg, 1999; Fremouw & Feindler, 1978; Greenwood, Delquadri, & Hall, 1989; Kulik, & Kulik, 1982; Maxwell, 2000; Mittan, 1989; Swengel, 1991; Tang & Tithecott, 1999; Tsui & Ng, 2000). However, the effectiveness and the benefits from tutors’ intervention may be compromised by their academic deficiency (Willis & Crowder, 1974), general lack of knowledge about writing (Ransdell, 2001), tendency to focus more on surface errors than high order concerns in writing (Stanley, 1992), and by similarity in age and achievement level with their tutees (DePaulo et al., 1989).

Not many research studies, however, have been conducted on the effects of peer tutoring and of peer tutor training in Korean educational context. It is perhaps because Korean culture, heavily influenced by Confucianism respecting the authority of a teacher, makes it difficult to implement a peer teaching model (Turner, 2006). This study aims to explore this highly uninvestigated area to show whether peer tutoring techniques and peer tutor training programs increasingly used in writing classes in Western countries can be applied in tertiary-level EFL classroom in Korea to help improve students’ academic writing abilities. In order to achieve this goal, the present study proposed the following specific research questions:

1. What effects does peer tutoring have on improving Korean college students’ writing?

2. What effects does peer tutor training have on improving Korean college students’ writing? 3. What effects does peer tutor training have on the course of peer tutoring?

# II. LITERATURE REVIEW

# 1. The Roles of Peer Tutors and Peer Tutoring

The definition and roles of peer tutors and peer tutoring have been discussed by a number of researchers. According to Topping (1996), peer tutoring is a type of collaborative learning, in which ‘‘people from similar social groupings who are not professional teachers help each other to learn, and learn themselves by teaching’’ (p. 322). Gillespie and Learner (2003) argued that tutors should focus on the writer's development and establish rapport, making sure the writer takes ownership, asking questions, and comment on things that are working well instead of giving advice, looking for things to improve, or telling writers what to do. Raforth (2000), on the other hand, described peer tutors as constructive critics and a real audience to the writers’ writings. Some other researchers (Lunsford, 1995) emphasized the role of tutors as those who respond and converse rather than correct, which enables the students to become more involved in their learning through peer collaboration.

One of the strong supporting arguments for peer tutoring comes from the idea of learning by teaching for the tutors (Goodlad & Hirst, 1989). The learning effect of peer tutoring is initially grounded by the fact that it enhances cognitive processing in the tutor by increased motivation for and attention to the task. Also tutoring demands review of currently existing knowledge and renewal of their skills, which consequently yields restructuring of them and creates newly established associations. Tutoring refreshes one’s schemata and provides opportunities for further metacognitive and cognitive development, especially in terms of simplification, clarification and exemplification (Sternberg, 1985).

Another theoretical ground for peer tutoring can be made by the social interactionists’ view of cognitive development (Vygotsky, 1978). The theory supports peer assisted learning by its premise that one (a tutee) can reach his/her potential level of development on any cognitive area through social and cognitive interactions with a more capable peer (a tutor) on a task of which the difficulty level is within the tutee’s zone of proximal development.

Research on peer tutoring has been providing positive evidence on various instructional topics in a variety of contexts. Researchers have contended that peer tutoring can help English learners from the perspective of reading (Atherley, 1989), spelling (Lane, 1997), getting over learning disabilities in English class (Greenwood, Arreaga-Mayer, Utley, Gavin, & Terry, 2001; Saenz, Fuchs, & Fuchs, 2005; You-Jin Seo, 2005), speaking and affective sides (Hye-Rahn Yang, 2006) and others (Ye-Ji Jang, 2009).

Peer tutoring has also been argued to be effective in improving performances in other subject matter areas like science and math Suk Young Kang, 2010; Gyu Moung Lee, 2000; Hyun Hwa Park, 2007) and in its positive influences on other aspects including self-efficacy, anxiety, and classroom management issues (Hwang-June Choi, 2011; Griffin & Griffin, 1998; Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, & Simmons, 1997).

A growing number of peer tutoring research studies have been investigating tutors’ functions and the roles of collaborative discourse between tutors and the tutees in writing centers (Boquet, 2001; Carino, 1996; Harris, 1986; Mackiewicz, 2002; McDonald, 2005). With the extension of the arguments by Varga, Ilko, Weaver and Kenzie (2008) on the roles of a writing tutor, the ultimate roles or peer tutors in any fields may well include, not just guiding of surface corrections, but encouraging and guiding the tutees to develop critical thinking and analytical understanding of their own processes of development in skills, thereby the students can gain confidence and enjoy their work to become more responsible and autonomous learners.

# 2. Research on Peer Tutor Training in Education

As the importance of the roles of peer tutors in education especially in writing instruction grew, researchers have noticed the importance of training peer tutors’ tutoring skills. Researchers (Gillespie & Lerner, 2007) and studies (Berg, 1999; Stanley, 1992) have emphasized and shown that with the untrained tutors learners may not gain the due benefits from the tutoring, thus training peer tutors about how to perform peer tutoring appropriately and effectively is a critical factor in the success of peer tutoring.

Training peer tutors is a complex task and one of the major concerns of writing centers in Western countries. Training peer tutors is not a simple matter particularly because the trainer has to be well-informed of the theories that the guidelines are based on and are also familiar with practices that promote them. Many researchers have presented their opinions on what areas tutors have to be trained. Murphy and Stay (2006) said that the trainer has to provide the tutors with the strategic knowledge to enact practices rooted in theories in teaching tutees. Shamoon and Burns (1995) emphasized the importance of training interpersonal skills in tutors to be more friendly, supportive, nurturing, and responsive. Reigstad and McAndrew (1984) suggested four principles to in tutor training: the tutor must establish and maintain rapport; the writer must do the work;

higher-order concerns should be dealt with before lower-order ones; and tutors do not have to be experts.

Empirical studies on peer tutor training generally support the effects of training. After an experiment with thirty ESL college students divided in trained and untrained groups Stanley (1992) found that the trained group students provided more specific responses to their peers, showed greater engagement and commitment to the task. Berg (1999) investigated whether trained peer response shapes ESL students’ revision types and writing quality. The results of the study revealed that the trained group made progress in overall quality of the writing and wrote more of the meaning-based revisions than the form-based or surface-level revisions.

Reviewing a collection of empirical studies on the effect of peer tutor training, Sharpley and Sharpley (1981) meta-analyzed 82 studies conducted in school settings. They concluded that peer tutoring yield significant cognitive benefits for both tutees and tutors and training of tutors made a meaningful difference in the improvement rates. Cohen, Kulik and Kulik (1982) also reported that in 45 studies out of 65 studies comparing the tutored and untutored groups of students, the tutored students performed better than the other group. The trained tutor groups in comparison with the untrained ones showed greater experimental effects. Whether the tutoring was highly structured or not also seemed to be a factor.

Most other research on tutoring and tutor training has centered around such issues as the nature of interaction between tutors and tutees (Lockhart & Ng, 1995; Villamil & de Guerrero, 1996), the tutoring process, perceptions and expectations, and developing a tutoring practice (Gillespie & Lerner, 2003; Murphy & Sherwood, 2003).

As discussed so far, research studies have confirmed that peer tutors and peer tutor training have contributed in helping learners in a number of ways. However, very few studies have been conducted on the effect of peer tutoring and peer tutor training programs in Korean EFL context. This study investigates their effects on college students’ writing performances. Within the scope of the present study, the facilitating role performance of cross-age peer tutors is of particular interest.

# III. RESEARCH METHODS

# 1. Participants and the setting

The participants of this study were six graduate students and twelve undergraduate students attending a large university located in one of the big cities in Korea. Participating tutors and tutees were recruited based on their TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication) scores and divided into two homogeneous groups following the results of the pre-test: the trained group (experimental group) and the untrained group (control group). The group members were organized in a way that the mean difference of the pretest scores between the trained group (11.33) and the untrained group (10.83) is not statistically significant. All of the undergraduate students had low proficiency in English (TOEIC scores below 790) and received tutoring from the graduate students who were in the intermediate level (TOEIC scores between 850-930). They came from varying fields with none involved in English major. At an interview prior to the experiment these twelve tutees showed high motivation to improve their writing abilities and enthusiasm about the experiment and the peer tutoring program. The six graduate peer tutors were either engaged in English-related fields or highly interested in English equipped with the same proficiency level. They were also highly motivated about the experience of helping other students through peer tutoring. The profiles of the tutees and the tutors are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

# 2. Data Collection Procedure

After the experimental and the control groups were formed, the researchers distributed peer tutoring directions and rubric documents to the participants. The tutees received directions for their writing assignments on three consecutive topics. For each topic the tutees submitted three drafts in total through e-mail. For the first and the second drafts, the tutors provided feedback comments also through e-mail using the Microsoft Word editing function (see Appendix C for example).

The peer tutoring program in this study took place for 3 weeks through email exchanges. The 6 tutees in the experimental group were tutored by 3 peer tutors who received training on how to perform peer tutoring. The peer tutor training involved a course of meetings offered by a male native English-speaking instructor who has a Master’s degree in ESL writing and 12 years of EFL teaching experiences in Korean universities. This peer tutor trainer has been training peer tutors for years and was well aware of the goals and the process of the study. There were three training sessions each of which lasted around two hours. The training sessions were organized around exploring the roles and responsibilities of a peer tutor and introducing the fundamental research based knowledge and skills of effective peer tutoring in writing. The other 6 students who were in the control group were tutored by the 3 peer tutors who did not receive the specially designed peer tutor training. The procedures of the experiment in the two groups are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 below. The tutors and the tutees went through the following process for each of the three writing topics given.

![](img/17bec01c30bba96263fb87a10803ded8c74eb9596cbf3df6fa2eeab702fdccc2.jpg)

The series of drafts on each of the 3 topics written by the 12 tutees were collected, and rated by two reliable raters. Both raters were native English-speaking ESL instructors who have Master’s degrees in TESOL and 10 or more years of teaching experiences. They were fully informed of the evaluation rubric as a scoring guide. The same raters evaluated the participants’ pre-test and the post-test drafts as well. The scores on the same draft were averaged for comparison within and across groups.

After the three weeks’ experiment, all the participants took the post-test consisted of another writing assignment asking to choose from three topics (see Appendix A). All feedback comments provided by the tutors in each group were collected for analysis and comparison. The researchers then administered questionnaires customized for the tutor groups and the tutee groups to see their reactions to the peer tutoring experiment.

# 3. Instruments

# 1) Pre-Test and Post-Test Materials and Drafts on Three Topics

The pre-test and the post-test writing assignments were administered to all participating tutees in order to examine the differences in their writing abilities before and after the peer tutoring experience. Between the pre-test and the post-test, the tutees were given three separate topics for which they were asked to write a short paragraph. The written materials obtained from the pre- and the post-test and the three types of first drafts and final drafts on the three topics were evaluated with the same rubric. The types of the three topics on the experiment included persuasive writing, compare and contrast writing and cause and effect writing, respectively, so that the tutees can experience different styles of writing and that their writing abilities on varying topics can accurately be reflected. The topics and instructions for the three writing assignments are in Appendix A.

# 2) Email Written Feedback Materials

The six peer tutors’ feedback comments were compiled and yielded 585 comments in total. They were initially analyzed by the four categories in the evaluation rubric (A: Evidence and Analysis, B: Focus, C: Complexity, D: Coherence). As the analysis went on, however, the need for further categories arose and thus two (E1: Minor grammatical errors that have few effects in scoring of writing, E2: Etc. (elements such as greetings, chatting and compliments) were added to the list of categories. These analyses were intended to examine which areas of writing in the rubric the tutors in each group focused on and also to compare the differences in distribution of the areas in comments provided by the trained and the untrained groups of tutors.

3) Evaluation Rubric

Prior to the experiment the evaluation rubric was given to all tutors and tutees to let them know of the criteria that their writings would be evaluated on. The rubric was adopted and revised from Sample Analytic Scoring Guide (O'Neill, Moore, & Huot, 2009, p. 170, see Appendix B). In order to establish inter-rater reliability, two native English-speaking EFL instructors evaluated the pre- and the post-test, 3 first drafts and the 3 final drafts on each of the 3 topics written by the participants.

# 4) Questionnaires

When the experiment was over, a questionnaire was administered for all participating tutees (See Appendix D) to obtain their perceptions on English writing and their reactions to the peer tutoring experience. The tutees had no knowledge of whether their tutors were the trained ones or not. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: tutees' attitudes toward English writing, needs for learning English writing and their perceived usefulness of peer tutoring. Peer tutors in both trained and untrained groups were also given questionnaires asking about their perception of peer tutoring and its effectiveness.

# IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# 1. Effects of Peer Tutoring on Writing Abilities

In order to examine whether the peer tutoring sessions and the peer tutor training program have actually improved the tutees’ writing abilities, the submitted writings for the pre-test and the post-test were rated and compared. Comparing the means of the pre-test and the post-test scores of the tutees in the experimental and the control groups, Table 3 illustrate that the tutees in both groups have greatly improved in their writing scores from 10.8 to 15.3 and 11.3 to 19, respectively.

TABLE 3 Descriptive Statistics of Pre- and Post-Test Results   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="3">Pair 1</td><td></td><td>Mean</td><td>N</td><td>Std. Deviation</td><td>Std.

Table 4 shows the tutees’ obtained scores in both experimental (trained) and the control group (untrained) and the improvement rates. The tutees in the trained tutor group improved by $6 7 . 6 \%$ in average and those in the untrained group showed $4 1 . 5 \ \%$ of improvement in their average scores in the post-test. The compared scores of the tutees in two groups revealed that all students who participated in the peer tutoring program, with the exception of K, have improved in their writing scores regardless of whether their tutors received peer tutor training or not. This result indicates that peer tutoring itself may have a potentially positive influence on improving college students’ writing. This statement is further supported by the observation that all of the 12 participating tutees improved in their writing abilities on all of the 4 specific categories in the evaluation rubric (I- Evidence and Analysis II-Focus III-Complexity IV- Coherence) on their pre- and the post-test with the exception of K student on the Focus (II) category where his score decreased from 5 to 4 on the post-test.

Improvement Rate $4 1 . 5 \%$

# 2. Effects of Peer Tutoring Training on Writing Abilities

The second research question addressed in this study regards the effects of peer tutor training on university students’ writing abilities. As Table 4 demonstrates above, the six tutees in the trained group showed greater improvement rate $( 6 7 . 6 \% )$ compared to those from the untrained group $( 4 1 . 5 \% )$ by $2 6 . 1 \%$ . Table 5 shows the results of the Paired Samples Test based on the difference between the two variables: pre-test and post-test in each group. The results indicate that the mean score differences of the tutees’ pre- and the post-test in the experimental group are highly significant by the $p$ value of .006 $( p { < } . 0 5 )$ while those of the control group are relatively less by the $p$ value of .06. This means that the effect of peer tutoring in the untrained group is closely approaching the significance but not to the level of $p { < } . 0 5$ statistically, while the effect of peer tutoring on the students’ writing in the trained group is much greater and statistically significant.

The analysis of the data also indicated that the tutees in the trained group showed better performances in their writing as the peer tutoring progressed. As Figure 3 shows, the scores of the tutees in the experimental group increased more consistently over time. The experimental group with the trained peer tutors surpassed the control group in writing scores of their three final drafts on each of the 3 topics. Moreover, the gap between the average scores on each topic between the two groups increased over the experiment period as the peer tutoring progressed. This result is strong supporting evidence that peer tutor training program does have positive effects on consistent improvement of the students’ writing performances. Figure 3 also shows that all tutees tended to receive relatively lower marks on their first drafts than on their corresponding final drafts. This means that the peer tutors' feedback comments actually helped improve the tutees’ writing performance.

# 3. The Analysis of the Tutors’ Feedback Comments

Through the analysis above we have seen that the tutee group under trained tutors outperformed the other group in terms of writing performance. In order to investigate the factors that may have affected the differences and changes in the scores, the tutors' feedback comments were collected and analyzed. The tutors’ comments were 585 pieces in total and they were categorized to see which areas of writing strategies were effectively commented on to influence the tutees' English writing performances.

TABLE 6 Comparing the Peer Tutors’ Feedback Comments in Two Groups   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>A(%)</td><td>B(%)</td><td>C(%)</td><td>D(%)</td><td>E1(%)</td><td>E2(%)</td><td>Total(%)</td></tr><tr><td>Untrained</td><td>7(2.5)</td><td>14(5.5)</td><td>100(35.5)</td><td>27(9.6)</td><td>125(44.3)</td><td>9(3.2)</td><td>282(100)</td></tr><tr><td>Trained</td><td>55(182)</td><td>26(8.6)</td><td>51(16.8)</td><td>46(15.2)</td><td>74(24.4)</td><td>51(16.8)</td><td>303(100)</td></tr></table></body></html>

(A- Evidence and Analysis, B- Focus, C- Complexity, D- Coherence, E1- minor grammatical errors, E2- greeting, chatting and compliments)

Table 6 shows the frequency distribution of the feedback comments written by the peer tutors. The items A to D are the same characteristics as the rubric used for evaluating tutees' writing. The categories of E1 and E2 were added as the analysis went on and the need for further categories arose for minor grammatical errors and for all the other elements in the tutors’ comments such as greeting, chatting, and complements. Examples of the tutors’ actual comments categorized as each category are presented in Table 7 (translated).

The analysis in Table 6 indicates that the total number of tutor feedback comments that the trained tutors made on three topics was slightly higher (303) than that of the other group (282). Secondly, it is observed that the comments made by the tutors in the trained group show evener distribution across the categories with 4 (A, C, D, and E2) of them ranging from percentages around $1 5 \mathrm { - } 1 8 \%$ . This means that the trained tutors tried to balance their comments on different areas of writing, whereas it was not the case for the untrained ones. In particular, it is interesting to note that the trained tutor group showed a higher rate of providing affective comments such as expressions of encouragement and compliments $3 . 2 \%$ vs. $1 6 . 8 \%$ ).

In addition, the untrained tutors paid most of their attention on commenting on areas of minor grammatical errors (E1) and complexity (C). While the minor grammatical error corrections consisted of $24 \%$ of the trained tutors’ feedback comments, they did as much as $44 \%$ of the untrained tutors’ comments. Likewise, the untrained tutors gave nearly twice as many feedback comments on the area of complexity as those by the trained ones $3 5 . 5 \%$ vs. $1 6 . 8 \%$ ). This naturally yielded lower rates of comments on areas such as evidence and analysis, focus, and coherence in the untrained group.

The fact that the trained peer tutors were observed to focus more on the areas like coherence and evidence while the untrained ones tended to focus on minor grammatical errors in their feedback comments is highly important. It means that the training may have developed in the tutors the general tendency of giving more weight to the higher order concerns in writing, such as organization, focus, complexity and coherence. Higher Order Concerns (HOCs) are the "big picture" elements such as thesis or focus, audience and purpose, organization, and development in writing (Reigstad & MacAndrew, 1984). A number of researchers and experts in writing instruction have argued that these elements should be dealt with first before the "Lower Order Concerns (LOCs)" such as sentence structure and grammar in tutoring (Gillespie & Lerner, 2007; Reigstad & Donald, 1984). It is listed as one of the four principles in tutoring by Reigstad and MacAndrew (1984) as introduced earlier. From the interview with the tutor trainer it was learned that he placed an emphasis on the higher order concerns in writing as part of the contents of the training, which may account for the trained tutors’ greater attention to them. These findings indicate that the peer tutor training possibly had a considerable effect on the peer tutors’ commenting skills and areas of foci in tutoring, which actually made a difference in writing performances between the two groups.

# 4. Tutees’ Reactions to the Peer Tutors’ Tutoring

In order to examine the tutees' perception of writing and the effect of peer tutoring, the tutees’ questionnaire responses were administered and analyzed. The questionnaire consisted of ten questions with some multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. The responses of the students in the control and the experimental group were compared. Most of the students responded positively to the importance of writing and negatively to the question asking whether the regular school curriculum satisfied their needs for improving their writing skills. All tutees in both the trained and untrained groups responded positively to receiving the peer tutoring and they all felt that it was useful and effective. Yet 1-2 students out of 6 in the trained group responded that they felt the peer tutoring was less helpful in the grammar and vocabulary parts than they expected. As discussed earlier, it is probably because the trained tutors commented more on the other higher order concerns.

# V. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

This study aimed to investigate whether the Western-style peer tutoring techniques and peer tutor training program have effects of improving university students’ academic writing performances in Korean context. The results of the study yielded three major findings.

First, the students in both trained and untrained tutor groups have improved their writing abilities through peer tutoring for the experiment period by large percentage rates. With just one student’s exception on an area, all of the participating tutees regardless of their groups have improved their writing on all specific areas of writing in the evaluation rubric. This means that peer tutoring itself can be of help in improving students’ writing in Korean EFL context.

Secondly, although post-test scores of tutees in both group have greatly increased, those of the tutees in the trained group showed greater improvement with statistical significance. The scores of the trained tutor group also showed more gradual development over the course of the experiment period, creating larger gaps with the scores of the untrained group over time.

The analysis of the tutors' feedback comments indicated that peer tutor training played an important role in improving the writing abilities of the tutees in the trained peer tutor group, especially in the areas of higher order elements. The trained tutors were observed to try to balance their comments on all areas of writing in the rubric while the untrained ones heavily focused on minor grammatical errors and vocabulary. The trained ones’ comments were largely distributed for the higher order concerns instead.

The findings of the present study cast some important pedagogical implications regarding writing instruction in Korean context. They offer empirical data to some conservative Korean students and teachers who are resistant to the idea of peer tutors that such interactions, even through e-mail exchanges, can be of substantial benefit in improving one’s writing abilities. In addition, since this study showed that peer tutoring and peer tutor training can work in Korean university setting, we can try designing and adopting peer tutoring and peer tutor training programs as part of EFL teaching methods in higher education in Korea. For this, establishing writing centers and recruiting tutors are primary. Also the system should allow the tutors to be paid or receive credits in a course for their participation, which is used in many Western countries.

From the discussions so far, it is clear that trained peer tutors are more effective in helping EFL learners improve their writing skills than their untrained counterparts. A prerequisite for it would be well-organized and effective tutor training programs led by qualified trainers. The result of the study showed the trained tutors’ preferred and balanced commenting behaviors on higher order concerns after training and how they entailed their tutees’ improvements in scores at the writing tasks and the post-test. This offers empirical evidence that the knowledge and skills gained from the training can be directly transmitted to the tutors’ tutoring behaviors and consequently reflected in their corresponding tutees’ writing performances through peer tutoring even within a short period of time. This necessitates and emphasizes the importance of a good tutor training program.

This study provides a stepping stone for future studies on the effect of peer tutoring and peer tutoring programs in EFL contexts. With the peer tutoring model described in this study, further developments and adjustments can be made to accommodate each context of learning and teaching. Most of all, this study presented peer tutoring as a viable alternative teaching method to traditional teacher-oriented writing classes in Korean EFL context where the number of students who want feedback far surpasses the number of teachers available to give it face to face. Instead of teaching all students in person, one teacher can train 3 tutors and they can teach 6 lower level students. Peer tutoring is not only effective in reducing teacher’s workload but also beneficial for the tutors themselves for many reasons as discussed in the literature review.

This study is not without its limitations due to the relatively small number of participating students and the duration of experiment. Future research projects involving greater number of students for longer periods of time are warranted to ensure the research findings of the present study and to further explore the roles of peer tutoring and of peer tutor training programs in the writing process, allowing EFL students to reach their goals through developing academic writing skills.
