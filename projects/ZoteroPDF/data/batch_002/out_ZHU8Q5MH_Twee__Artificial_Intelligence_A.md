# Abstract

Teaching materials supplement language input in second language classrooms, requiring teachers to possess the ability to develop their own materials to meet practical teaching needs. However, teachers often face constraints such as time limitations and insufficient training. To address these challenges, this review explores the use of , an online platform utilizing artificial intelligence and its integration with language teaching. Additionally, this review deliberates on potentials of  to enhance multimodal input and facilitate vocabulary learning.

# Introduction

Teaching materials are vital in the second language (L2) classroom, yet L2 teachers face challenges in developing them due to time limitations, cost constraints and the lack of training (McGrath, 2013). These problems undermine teachers’ motivation to create materials and can have negative influence on students’ achievement. To propose a possible solution, this review will introduce the affordance of a useful tool Twee, as well as its potentials to enhance multimodal input and facilitate vocabulary learning.

Twee is an online platform based on generative artificial intelligence technology, which can help teachers design and develop teaching materials. After entering the website, users can click on ‘Tools’ to explore 33 tools categorized into seven different aspects, with detailed descriptions of each tool’s specific functions (see Figure 1). This article outlines three primary functions of Twee. First, Twee can quickly generate various types of questions based on selected videos, which teachers can use to improve students’ concentration and assess their understanding of the content. Second, it can create new texts based on specific topics and keywords, allowing users to adjust the length, level and genre of the text, thus providing reading materials that may cater for learners’ varying proficiency levels. Lastly, Twee enables the swift creation of fill-in-the-gap vocabulary exercises based on the generated texts, which is expected to consolidate students’ vocabulary knowledge.

# Potentials of Twee to Enhance Multimodal Input

Researchers in the field of language learning highlight the significance of integrating verbal and visual elements, as proposed by the dual coding theory (Paivio, 2014) and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), which suggests that a combination of verbal and visual stimuli enhances the efficient processing of new information. These two theories provide evidence supporting the positive correlation between foreign language learning and the use of videos.

Current research has proved that incorporating authentic video as a reinforcement tool can enhance overall language learning (Benitez-Galbraith and Galbraith, 2021). In this regard, teachers can utilize platforms such as YouTube to find videos relevant to their lesson content, and then copy the video link to Twee to generate a series of questions tailored to the content, including open questions, multiple-choice and true or false questions (see Figure 2). Twee also allows for customization of question difficulty and video length. For instance, in the lead-in session, teachers can present some questions to students before viewing the video, thereby enhancing students’ concentration levels and enabling them to get enough background information. In the while-viewing session, teachers can raise these questions afterwards to check students’ overall understanding of the video. At the same time, students’ listening and viewing skills can be practised.

# Potentials of Twee to Facilitate Vocabulary Learning

Research on incidental vocabulary learning has suggested that the frequency of encountering an unfamiliar word in context significantly influences how likely learners will learn that word successfully (Peters and Webb, 2018). For other aspects of word knowledge such as collocation and word class, repeated exposures are needed. Through Twee, teachers can increase students’ exposure to the target vocabulary items through tailored text generation and exercises. By inputting keywords, educators can generate texts of varying types, levels and lengths, enhancing the number of times that students encounter these keywords within diverse contexts. For example, in the while-reading session, after learning a text about tourist attractions in Peru, teachers can enter the theme and set keywords to generate a summary text (see Figure 3). Keywords can also be omitted for a new text for gap-fill practice to consolidate learners’ vocabulary comprehension (see Figure 4).

In the post-reading session, teachers can use Twee to produce texts about tourist attractions in other countries by using the same keywords utilized in previous exercises, to increase the repetition of keywords. This approach allows students to encounter keywords and their collocations throughout different stages of the class, with appropriate intervals between each recurrence to improve vocabulary retention.

Through Twee, teachers can increase frequency of encountering an unfamiliar word in different contexts to facilitate vocabulary learning and enrich vocabulary knowledge.

# Challenges, Conclusion and Implications

Though Twee is helpful in providing abundant teaching materials for language teaching and learning, there are still some challenges in practice. First, the validity of questions generated by Twee should be reassessed by teachers with the help of some basic theories of language testing. For example, according to Bachman and Palmer (1996), test items should be designed to measure the intended skills and knowledge without introducing bias. However, some items generated by Twee have uneven length, which may inadvertently cue students toward certain choices. Second, each target word will only appear once in the generated text. This means that if a target word has multiple usages, such as ‘still,’ which is often used as an adverb but can also function as an adjective meaning ‘not moving,’ it needs to be presented differently. In such cases, the chatbot and virtual assistant ChatGPT can be used to clarify the meanings or usages of the target vocabulary items in the texts generated by Twee.

This review introduces the affordances of Twee and assesses its potentials to enhance multimodal input and facilitate vocabulary learning. In terms of teaching practice, teachers can use Twee to generate additional classroom materials to prepare students for exposure to versatile language materials and for language input and output in specific contexts.
