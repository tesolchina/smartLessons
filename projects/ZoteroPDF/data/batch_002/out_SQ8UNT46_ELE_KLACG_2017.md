# Preamble

The development of the Hong Kong school curriculum has advanced into a new phase of ongoing renewal and updating. It ushers in a new era for curriculum development to keep abreast of the macro and dynamic changes in various aspects in the local, regional and global landscapes in maintaining the competitiveness of Hong Kong. For the ultimate benefit of our students, schools are encouraged to sustain and deepen the accomplishments achieved since the Learning to Learn curriculum reform started in 2001, and to place new emphasis on future needs in curriculum development for achieving the overall aims and learning goals of the school curriculum.

The eight Key Learning Area (KLA) Curriculum Guides (Primary 1 — Secondary 6) have been updated and recommended by the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) 1 to support the ongoing renewal of the school curriculum at the primary and secondary levels.

In updating the KLA Curriculum Guides, the respective KLA committees under the CDC have taken into consideration the concerns, needs and suggestions of various key stakeholders including schools, principals, teachers, students and the public at large. A series of school briefing cum feedback collection sessions coupled with a territory-wide school survey were conducted in 2015 to gauge schools’ views on the major updates of the respective Curriculum Guides.

The eight KLA Curriculum Guides (2017) supersede the 2002 versions. Each KLA Curriculum Guide presents the updated curriculum framework which specifies the KLA’s curriculum aims, learning targets and objectives, delineates the direction of ongoing curriculum development at the KLA level, and provides suggestions on curriculum planning, learning and teaching strategies, assessment, as well as useful learning and teaching resources. In addition, updated examples of effective learning, teaching and assessment practices are provided for schools’ reference. Supplements to some KLA Curriculum Guides and subject curriculum guides are also available to provide further suggestions on their implementation at specific key stages. Schools are encouraged to adopt the recommendations in the KLA Curriculum Guides, taking into account the school contexts, teachers’ readiness and learning needs of their students.

For a better understanding of the interface between various key stages and connections of different learning areas, and how effective learning, teaching and assessment can be achieved, schools should make reference to all related curriculum documents recommended by the CDC and the latest versions of the Curriculum and Assessment Guides jointly prepared by the CDC and the HKEAA for the senior secondary curriculum to ensure coherence in curriculum planning at the school, KLA and subject levels.

As curriculum development is a collaborative and ongoing process, the KLA Curriculum Guides will be under regular review and updating in light of schools’ implementation experiences as well as the changing needs of students and society.

Views and suggestions on the development of the English Language Education KLA Curriculum are always welcome. These may be sent to:

# English Language Education Key Learning Area

The English Language Education Key Learning Area (KLA) is an integral part of the school curriculum that provides students with a wide range of learning experiences to enhance their:

English language proficiency for study, work and leisure; personal and intellectual development, and social skills; cultural understanding; and   
global competitiveness.

# Entitlement of Students

All students from Primary 1 to Secondary 6 are entitled to opportunities for developing the above capabilities in the context of English Language Education. $1 7 \%$ to $21 \%$ of the total lesson time is allocated to the English Language curriculum for each key stage from Primary 1 to Secondary 3.   
The senior secondary English Language curriculum, which builds on the effective learning and teaching practices promoted in previous key stages, accounts for a flexible range of $12 . 5 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time.   
Literature in English, as an elective subject in the senior secondary curriculum to further enhance students’ language proficiency, accounts for $10 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time.

# Overall Aims

The overall aims of the English Language Education KLA curriculum are:

to provide every student of English with further opportunities for extending their knowledge and experience of the cultures of other people as well as opportunities for personal and intellectual development, further studies, pleasure and work in the English medium; and   
to enable every student to prepare for the changing socio-economic demands resulting from advances in information technology; these demands include the interpretation, use and production of materials for pleasure, study and work in the English medium.

# The Central English Language Education KLA Curriculum: An Open and Flexible Framework

The curriculum framework for English Language Education is the overall structure for organising learning and teaching for the subjects of English Language and Literature in English. The framework comprises a set of interlocking components including:

subject knowledge and skills, which are expressed in the form of learning targets under the Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience Strands, as well as learning objectives;   
generic skills; and   
positive values and attitudes.

# Connecting School Curriculum Development with the Central Curriculum

The flexibility of the central curriculum allows plenty of space and scope for wholeschool curriculum development. Following the general direction and recommendations provided in the central curriculum, schools are encouraged to:

develop a suitable, balanced and coherent school English Language Education curriculum;   
design and carry out innovative curriculum plans and build on good practices; vary the organisation of learning content, learning and teaching strategies, pace of learning and teaching, homework requirements, as well as criteria and modes of assessment, taking into consideration factors such as students’ needs, teachers’ readiness and school contexts; and   
make plans for the effective use of lesson time based on the needs of students on a developmental continuum.

# Learning and Teaching

Schools are encouraged to enrich English language learning and teaching through:

incorporating the updated Four Key Tasks (i.e. Moral and Civic Education: Towards Values Education, Reading to Learn: Towards Reading across the Curriculum, Project Learning: Towards Integrating and Applying Knowledge and Skills across Disciplines, and Information Technology for Interactive Learning: Towards Self-directed Learning);

life-wide learning;   
task-based learning and teaching;   
learning and teaching of text grammar;   
e-learning; and   
embracing learner diversity, including students with special educational needs (SEN) and gifted students.

In addition, schools are encouraged to create a language-rich environment by:

providing greater opportunities for students to use English for purposeful communication both inside and outside the classroom;   
making use of student-centred instruction to promote learner independence; making greater use of literary or imaginative texts to promote critical thinking and encourage free expression and creativity;   
assigning quality homework to provide language practice in meaningful contexts, instead of meaningless mechanical drills;   
inviting students to read a wide range of materials with different subject content and text types to facilitate the development of a culture of “reading to learn” and “Reading across the Curriculum” (RaC), and designing appropriate tasks for students to appreciate the value of reading; and   
promoting the development of strategies, values and attitudes that are conducive to effective, self-directed, independent and lifelong learning.

# Assessment

Schools are encouraged to promote teacher assessment literacy through:

placing emphasis on both formative and summative assessments;   
adopting diversified modes of assessment and designing purposeful assessment tasks;   
using formative and summative assessments for reviewing and improving teaching plans and strategies;   
making effective use of internal and external assessment data to gain insights into students’ strengths and weaknesses and to inform learning and teaching;   
advising teachers to provide quality and timely feedback to inform students of their performance and how to make further progress; and   
extending formative assessment from “assessment for learning” to “assessment as learning”.

# Resources

Schools are encouraged to enhance English language learning and teaching through:

utilising a variety of print and non-print resources which include quality textbooks, language arts and non-fiction materials, electronic materials with multimodal features, multimedia resources such as videos, e-books, interactive games, application software and authentic online resources;   
making the most of the resource materials, services and programmes provided by community partners, different government departments, non-governmental organisations and educational institutions; and   
maximising the use of available resources including learning and teaching materials, human resources, equipment and facilities.

# Direction for the Ongoing Renewal of the English Language Education Curriculum — Sustaining, Deepening and Focusing

In the coming five to ten years, schools are encouraged to sustain and deepen the accomplishments achieved over the past decade in enhancing the learning and teaching of English Language and Literature in English, and to continue with existing good practices in enriching students’ learning experiences through:

developing a coherent school English Language Education curriculum that helps connect students’ learning experiences across different KLAs as well as in and outside class;   
adopting a greater variety of strategies to address the diverse learning needs of students, including students with SEN and students who are gifted;   
providing more opportunities for the learning and teaching of language forms, functions and skills for purposeful communication as well as the development of language awareness and appreciation skills through the use of creative and information texts in both print and non-print forms;   
developing students’ capabilities for self-directed and lifelong learning; and strengthening assessment literacy in the subject panel(s) with due consideration given to students’ learning progression, interests and abilities, and engaging students in the assessment process to promote self-reflection and self-directed learning.

In view of the challenges and opportunities arising from the significant developments in our society and around the world in various fields, and for the ultimate benefit of student learning, schools are encouraged to incorporate the following Major Renewed Emphases (MRE) of the ongoing curriculum development into the English Language Education curriculum through focusing on:

promoting Language across the Curriculum (LaC) to help students connect their learning experiences, and to enhance their language proficiency and application of language knowledge and skills for non-language subjects;   
leveraging information technology to facilitate e-learning, develop new literacy skills, enhance collaboration and interaction inside and outside the classroom, build learning networks, motivate self-directed learning to prepare students better for the challenges in the rapidly changing digital world, as well as promoting information literacy to equip students with the ability and attitude for effective and ethical use of information;   
strengthening values education through the use of a wide array of learning and teaching resources which provide contexts for students to explore a wealth of value-laden issues and stimuli for critical and imaginative responses; and promoting RaC and cross-curricular/KLA collaboration in support of STEM education to broaden students’ knowledge base and strengthen their ability to integrate and apply knowledge and skills.

# Chapter 1 Introduction

The English Language Education Key Learning Area Curriculum Guide (Primary 1 — Secondary 6) (2017) (this Guide) is prepared by the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) Committee on English Language Education. It is an updated version of the English Language Education Key Learning Area Curriculum Guide (Primary $l ~ -$ Secondary 3) (2002) and has been extended to include the three-year senior secondary English Language education to provide reference for teachers in developing a coherent school English Language Education curriculum.

The direction for the development of this Guide aligns with the Seven Learning Goals of Primary and Secondary Education (see Appendix 1 for the Seven Learning Goals of Primary Education and the Updated Seven Learning Goals of Secondary Education) and the major recommendations in the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I - \delta )$ (2017). This Guide provides the overall direction for the development of the English Language Education KLA curriculum in the five to ten years to come. It reinforces the curriculum emphases provided in the English Language Education Key Learning Area Curriculum Guide (Primary 1 — Secondary 3) (2002) to enhance learning and teaching and puts forth Major Renewed Emphases (MRE), which take into account the significant developments in our society and around the world in various fields to promote student learning. This Guide is accompanied with examples relevant to different key stages of learning to illustrate the concepts and ideas introduced and to narrow the gaps in curriculum implementation. These examples can be accessed online at http://www.edb.gov.hk/eleklacgexamples. A supplement to this Guide, which provides further suggestions on the implementation of the English Language curriculum at Key Stage 3 (Secondary 1 — 3), will also be issued in due course.

Schools should make reference to the following curriculum documents for a better understanding of the interface between various key stages, as well as the curriculum planning and strategies for enhancing learning, teaching and assessment at different key stages in the two subjects of English Language and Literature in English:

English Language Curriculum Guide (Primary 1 — 6) (2004)   
English Language Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Secondary 4 — 6) (2007)   
(with updates in November 2015)   
Literature in English Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Secondary 4 — 6) (2007)   
(with updates in November 2015)

# 1.1 What is a Key Learning Area?

A Key Learning Area (KLA) is an important part of a curriculum. It is founded on fundamental and connected concepts within major fields of knowledge which should be acquired by all students. A KLA provides a context for the development and application of generic skills (e.g. communication, critical thinking and collaboration skills, creativity), subject-specific skills as well as positive values and attitudes through appropriate use of learning and teaching activities and strategies. It serves as a context for the construction of new knowledge and the development of understanding. The studies offered in each KLA may have an academic, social or practical orientation or a combination of these, depending on their purpose(s). They can be organised into subjects, modules, units, tasks or other modes of learning.

The three interconnected components of the curriculum framework, i.e. Knowledge in Key Learning Areas, Generic Skills, and Values and Attitudes, can be represented in the figure below:

![](img/d876cec4dc20be8038ca75c5eb70f7cd8dde251768180bd4dcce8c73f62b509c.jpg)

Generic Skills

The English Language Education Key Learning Area is an integral part of the school curriculum (see p.2 for the figure showing the Hong Kong School Curriculum). As a Key Learning Area, English Language Education seeks to develop students’ English language proficiency for study, work and leisure; provide them with opportunities for personal, intellectual and social development; extend their knowledge and experience of other cultures through the English medium; and nurture their generic skills as well as positive values and attitudes to prepare them for the challenges of the rapidly changing world and the keenly competitive knowledge-based society of Hong Kong in the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century.

Every student is entitled to English Language Education. The English Language Education KLA comprises two subjects, namely English Language and Literature in English. While English Language is a subject for all levels of school education from Primary 1 to Secondary 6, Literature in English is an elective subject offered to students at the senior secondary level. Literature in English serves to complement the subject of English Language and further enhance students’ English language proficiency by providing them with opportunities to interact with literary texts and explore the aesthetic, intellectual, cultural and emotional aspects of language learning.

# 1.3 Rationale and Direction for Development

The English Language Education curriculum framework aims to build on the existing good practices in the learning and teaching of English Language and Literature in English in Hong Kong. It provides suggestions on how schools could sustain and deepen the good efforts made, focus on new areas in view of the challenges and opportunities brought by significant developments in various aspects, and provide students with meaningful language learning experiences that help them develop capabilities for lifelong learning and prepare them better for further studies, future careers and the demands of the modern world.

# 1.3.1 Building on Strengths

Over the past decade, a strong partnership has been developed between the Education Bureau (EDB) and the school sector, resulting in considerable achievements in the implementation of the English Language Education curriculum. In many English Language and Literature in English classrooms, emphasis has been placed not only on helping students master language forms and features and develop language skills, but also on enhancing their learning experiences by creating an English-rich environment. There have also been deliberate attempts to develop a reading culture, address diverse learning needs and promote “assessment for learning”. Such efforts are well appreciated, and teachers are encouraged to build on the existing effective practices to enrich students’ learning experiences through:

developing a coherent school English Language Education curriculum that helps connect students’ learning experiences across KLAs as well as in and outside class;   
adopting a greater variety of strategies to address the diverse learning needs of students, including students with special educational needs (SEN) and students who are gifted;   
providing more opportunities for the learning and teaching of language forms, functions and skills for purposeful communication as well as the development of language awareness and appreciation skills through the use of creative and information texts in both print and non-print forms;   
developing students’ capabilities for self-directed and lifelong learning; and strengthening assessment literacy in the subject panel(s) with due consideration given to students’ learning progression, interests and abilities, and engaging students in the assessment process to promote self-reflection and self-directed learning.

# 1.3.2 Major Renewed Emphases of Curriculum Development

The past decade has witnessed significant economic, scientific, technological and social developments in our society and around the world. To prepare our students well for the challenges and opportunities arising from the changes (e.g. the Belt and Road Initiative, which is envisaged to facilitate regional and international co-operation as well as intercultural exchange), schools have to consider their own contexts and develop a school curriculum that fosters whole-person development and lifelong learning, and equips students with the knowledge and skills essential for further studies and future careers. Besides sustaining and deepening the accomplishments in curriculum implementation, it is necessary to focus on the MRE in the school curriculum planning and set the direction for their implementation at the KLA and subject levels.

The following delineates the MRE of the English Language Education KLA:

# Language across the Curriculum (LaC)

The fine-tuned medium of instruction (MOI) arrangements for secondary schools, which have been in place since the 2010/11 school year, provide students with more opportunities to be exposed to and use English in schools. Based on students’ needs and school contexts, arrangements can be made, by class or by session, for the adoption of English as the MOI in non-language subjects. Secondary schools are encouraged to devise their whole-school language policy, conduct Extended Learning Activities and promote LaC so as to create a favourable environment for English learning and connect students’ learning experiences.

LaC, which advocates the integration of language learning and content learning, is an approach through which schools can enhance students’ language proficiency and understanding of the academic content. Non-language subjects provide a context for language learning while effective language development facilitates the learning of these subjects. Such an approach allows students to assimilate new concepts and manifest their new learning in various disciplines through language, thus enhancing both their subject knowledge and their understanding of the ways language is used in these subjects. Effective implementation of LaC enables students to conceptualise the subject content through language and practise their language skills for communicating clearly about the content based on subject-specific conventions and styles. For the sake of a stronger interface across key stages, it is desirable for LaC to be implemented from the primary level to support students’ learning of other subjects in English at a later stage.

Schools can promote LaC through encouraging students to read across the curriculum. Time can be allocated for cross-curricular reading within and outside lessons. Collaboration among different stakeholders including language and content subject teachers, teacher-librarians and parents is crucial in developing students’ interests and habits in reading a variety of texts including non-fiction texts on different themes.

# Information Technology in Education (ITE)

Advances in technology have had a significant impact on education. New and emerging technologies challenge the traditional process of learning and teaching, and the way assessment is done. The wide application of digital technologies in daily life allows easy worldwide communication and instant access to a vast array of information. Schools are encouraged to leverage information technology to enhance learning, teaching and assessment through e-learning, and promote information literacy to prepare students better for the challenges in the rapidly changing digital world.

e-Learning refers to an open and flexible learning mode involving the use of electronic media such as digital resources and communication tools to achieve the learning objectives. Teachers can integrate e-learning in the design of learning, teaching and assessment activities to complement the traditional mode of learning, enhance learning and teaching effectiveness, and accommodate the diverse needs of students.

Information literacy, which refers to the essential abilities and attitudes that lead to effective and ethical use of information, is essential to lifelong learning and self-directed learning. The incorporation of information literacy into the school curriculum provides opportunities for students to develop the skills and attitudes to manage and make good use of the vast amount of information across different channels or media.

Traditionally, “literacy” refers to the ability to read and write effectively to achieve desired goals or outcomes and develop one’s knowledge and potential. With the rapid development of IT and social media, “literacy” has taken on a new meaning as texts are no longer a linear form of presentation limited to words but are composed of various modes of communication (e.g. images, animations, sounds, graphics). Students, therefore, need to be equipped with new literacy skills to process and create multimodal texts in which messages are conveyed in different modes (e.g. linguistic, audio, visual, gestural, spatial), and the skills to search for and manage information.

# Values Education

Cultivation of positive values and attitudes is essential to whole-person development and hence the promotion of values education, including Basic Law education and life education, is crucial. Schools are encouraged to focus on the seven priority values and attitudes (i.e. perseverance, respect for others, responsibility, national identity, commitment, integrity and care for others) and provide a variety of learning experiences to help nurture them in students. Schools are also encouraged to focus on the positive values and attitudes that align with their school mission, school contexts, stakeholders’ views, students’ needs and major concerns (e.g. the rule of law, responsibility, sustainability, cultural inclusion, respect for pluralism, mutual respect and acceptance), and integrate them into the school curriculum.

Values education can be strengthened through the use of a wide array of learning and teaching resources which provide contexts for students to explore a variety of valueladen issues and stimuli for critical and imaginative responses.

# STEM Education and Entrepreneurial Spirit

STEM is an acronym that refers to the academic disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. In the Hong Kong curriculum context, STEM education is promoted through the Science, Technology and Mathematics Education KLAs.

The objectives of promoting STEM education in relation to student learning are:

to develop among students a solid knowledge base and to enhance their interest in science, technology and mathematics for further studies and careers in face of the changes and challenges in the contemporary world; and to strengthen students’ ability to integrate and apply knowledge and skills, and to nurture students’ creativity, collaboration skills and problem solving skills, as well as to foster the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit as required in the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century.

In support of STEM education, schools are encouraged to step up cross-curricular/ KLA collaboration such as Reading across the Curriculum (RaC) or project learning to broaden students’ knowledge base, help them connect their learning experiences and provide opportunities for integrating and applying knowledge and skills developed in different KLAs/subjects.

Please refer to Chapter 3 “Curriculum Planning” of this Guide for more details on how to incorporate the above MRE into the school English Language Education curriculum.

While it is desirable to build on the strengths and achievements over the past decade, schools are encouraged to take into account the suggestions and MRE set out in Sections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, and select those relevant to their needs and set priorities for incorporation into their school English Language Education curriculum.

Some strategies for development in the next five to ten years are suggested below to facilitate ongoing curriculum renewal:

# Chapter 2 Curriculum Framework

The curriculum framework for English Language Education is the overall structure for organising learning, teaching and assessment for the subjects of the English Language Education KLA. The framework comprises a set of interlocking components including:

subject knowledge and skills, which are expressed in the form of learning targets under the Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience Strands, as well as learning objectives;   
generic skills; and   
positive values and attitudes.

Below is a diagrammatic representation of the framework:

# English Language Education Curriculum Framework

# Overall Aims of the English Language Education Curriculum

![](img/1952d34e87cf6dc65f537583bf8ac77fb1806cc0ed5b4f872068038cb101c1ea.jpg)

The framework sets out what students should know, value and be able to do at various stages of schooling. It gives schools and teachers flexibility and ownership to plan and develop their school English Language Education curriculum to meet the needs of their students.

# 2.1 Aims and Subject Targets

# 2.1.1 Aims

The overall aims of the English Language Education curriculum are:

to provide every student of English with further opportunities for extending their knowledge and experience of the cultures of other people as well as opportunities for personal and intellectual development, further studies, pleasure and work in the English medium; and   
to enable every student to prepare for the changing socio-economic demands resulting from advances in information technology; these demands include the interpretation, use and production of materials for pleasure, study and work in the English medium.

# 2.1.2 Subject Targets

The English Language Education curriculum comprises two closely related subjects: English Language and Literature in English. English Language is the core subject from Key Stages 1 to 4 (KS1 – 4). Literature in English is the extended subject and one of the elective subjects to be offered in the three-year senior secondary curriculum (KS4). Each of these subjects has its own specific target, which sets the main direction for the learning and teaching of the subject.

The subject target of English Language is for students to develop an ever-improving capability to use English:

to think and communicate; to acquire, develop and apply knowledge; and to respond and give expression to experience; and within these contexts, to develop and apply an ever-increasing understanding of how language is organised, used and learnt.

The subject target of Literature in English is for students to develop the ability:

to understand, enjoy and appreciate literary or creative works in English by writers from different cultures;   
to give expression and respond to ideas and experiences in literary or creative works freely and imaginatively;   
to critically interpret, discuss and evaluate literary or creative works; and   
to improve their proficiency in English.

In general, the relationship between the subjects of English Language and Literature in English lies in:

the affinity they share in raising students’ language proficiency, critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, creativity and cultural awareness; and the complementary role of the subject of Literature in English in reinforcing the learning of the subject of English Language by seeking to strengthen the emotional and cultural content that is part of language learning.

# 2.2 Strands, Learning Targets and Learning Objectives

# 2.2.1 Strands and Learning Targets

Strands are categories for organising the curriculum. Their major function is to organise content for the purpose of developing knowledge, skills, and values and attitudes as a holistic process. They also define the broad purposes of learning English Language and Literature in English.

The contents of English Language and Literature in English are primarily organised around three interrelated strands – Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience. As one of the purposes of learning Literature in English, an extended and elective subject in KS4, is to enrich English learning, there is an additional strand on Language Enhancement to better illustrate the purposes of learning the subject.

The learning targets of English Language and Literature in English set out what students are expected to learn throughout the different stages of schooling in the two subjects. The learning targets are complementary to the interrelated strands and can be grouped under each strand. The list of learning targets for KS1 – 4 under the various strands are provided in Appendix 2.

# 2.2.2 Learning Objectives

The learning objectives describe explicitly the essential focuses of learning and what students are expected to learn and use at each key stage in order to work towards the learning targets for that key stage. They serve as a reference list for curriculum, lesson and activity planning. The English Language and Literature in English subjects share some common learning objectives in the development of generic skills and positive values and attitudes. The subject-specific learning objectives are outlined below.

# English Language

The subject-specific learning objectives for English Language are organised under the following general areas:

language forms and communicative functions; language skills and language development strategies; and attitudes specific to English language learning.

# Language Forms and Communicative Functions

In order to develop an ever-improving capability to use English for the various purposes identified in the learning targets, students need to master different aspects of the language system such as text types, vocabulary and grammar, and be able to make use of this knowledge in completing tasks. It is not sufficient for students merely to know the rules and focus on the forms. They must also learn how to apply such knowledge to engage in purposeful communication in real-life or simulated situations. Meaningful use of language items should be given as much emphasis as mastery of their forms. The following sections will discuss how different aspects of the English language system can be dealt with to facilitate learning and teaching.

# Text types

Text types refer to different forms of speech and writing. The intended purpose and audience of each text type determine its structural, stylistic and linguistic features.

To assist students in their development as proficient users of English, it is important that they are introduced systematically to a good variety of text types. Different text types provide meaningful contexts for the learning and purposeful use of specific language items and vocabulary. An awareness of the demands of different text types is essential for successful and effective communication.

The range of text types widens at higher levels of learning. At the same time, the text types that students are exposed to and expected to produce increase in complexity according to the levels of learning. The selection of text types will depend on students’ needs, experiences and interests and it may also partly depend on the resource materials available for students. While students may only be required to produce a limited range of text types in writing and speaking, they can be exposed to other text types through reading and listening.

The text types that students are expected to have encountered from KS1 – 4 are provided in Appendix 3. The list is not intended as a checklist. Rather, it suggests the variety and range of texts that students may be exposed to and produce at each key stage.

# Vocabulary

The vocabulary items that students encounter, acquire and use at each key stage vary with the tasks and the amount of language support that students experience in the learning process. Students need to be exposed to an increasingly wider range of vocabulary items, including phrasal verbs, idioms and fixed expressions to help them communicate and carry out various learning tasks effectively. Vocabulary is best introduced in context using reading, listening or multimodal texts, and practised through tasks and language games. In helping students build vocabulary, besides identifying whether the target words are for active or passive use, teachers should also take note of their frequency of occurrence across different text types and the vocabulary demand in non-language subjects. At both the primary and secondary levels, it is not advisable to prescribe a vocabulary list out of context or provide a list of unfamiliar words with explanations and their different parts of speech for rote learning.

In addition, it is essential to introduce students to a range of vocabulary building strategies such as:

using knowledge of word formation;   
using knowledge of collocations;   
using knowledge of lexical relations;   
guessing meaning and inferencing with available clues;   
using dictionaries and thesauri;   
creating word webs to record words learnt; and retaining words using mnemonics.

# Language items and communicative functions

Language items include a range of grammatical forms and structures that students need to develop as they perform various communicative functions. The range and complexity in the use of language items and communicative functions increase at more advanced key stages of learning. Language items learnt should be consolidated and extended to a greater level of complexity when students move towards a higher level of learning. In addition to functions for general communication (i.e. English used in everyday life), rhetorical functions for academic purposes (i.e. English used in more formal contexts) should be introduced to support students in learning other subjects through English and prepare them for further studies. The lists of language items and communicative functions for KS1 – 4 are provided in Appendix 4.

# Language Skills and Language Development Strategies

In order for students to be able to use English effectively for the various purposes described in the learning targets, it is essential that they develop competence in the skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Students also need to develop language development strategies in order to be responsible for their own learning and become motivated, independent and self-directed learners. The lists of language skills and language development strategies for KS1 – 4 are provided in Appendix 5.

# Attitudes Specific to English Language Learning

The development of positive attitudes, along with knowledge and skills, is an integral part of the English Language Education curriculum. Opportunities for exploring, developing and encouraging positive attitudes should be provided in all English learning tasks. Some positive attitudes, e.g. confidence in using English should be further developed when students move towards a higher level of learning. Some other positive attitudes, e.g. awareness of English as an international language of communication, will only be consciously developed in specific tasks. The list of attitudes specific to English language learning for KS1 – 4 is provided in Appendix 6.

# Literature in English

The learning objectives for Literature in English are organised under the following general areas:

knowledge of literary or creative works; skills of literary comprehension and appreciation; literacy competence development strategies; and attitudes specific to Literature in English learning.

# Knowledge of Literary or Creative Works

A key focus of the curriculum is to examine literary or creative works in the genres of prose, poetry, drama and film. Through exploring these texts, students are encouraged to achieve a range of other objectives, including the skills of literary comprehension and appreciation, and literary competence development strategies.

# Skills of Literary Comprehension and Appreciation

In order for students to understand, enjoy and appreciate literary or creative works and respond to them critically, it is essential for students to master a range of literary comprehension and appreciation skills. Some examples of these skills are:

examining and discussing form and content;   
comparing and contrasting literary texts in terms of themes, characterisation, language, technique and style;   
expressing feelings and ideas in response to literary texts;   
making connections between literary texts and other cultural media and/or issues of importance in society; and   
applying techniques learnt to one’s creative works.

# Literary Competence Development Strategies

To facilitate literary comprehension and appreciation, students are encouraged to develop a range of sub-skills. These include information skills (e.g. using different sources and searching for required information), communication and collaboration skills (e.g. discussing, debating and negotiating ideas and meanings of literary or creative texts, planning, producing and reviewing group presentations) and reflective thinking skills (e.g. planning, managing and evaluating one’s own learning, reviewing progress, identifying actions for improving performance).

# Attitudes Specific to Literature in English Learning

The development of positive attitudes, along with knowledge and skills, is an integral part of the English Language Education curriculum. Literature in English, in particular, provides opportunities for students to develop:

a keen interest in reading, viewing and responding to literary or creative works; empathy with others;   
an increased awareness of human relationship and the interaction between the individual and society; and   
appreciation of the beauty of language and different cultures and belief systems.

A detailed list of the learning objectives for the subject can be found on pp.9 – 11 of the Literature in English Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Secondary 4 – 6) (2007) (with updates in November 2015).

# 2.2.3 Generic Skills

Generic skills are fundamental in enabling students to learn how to learn. The following nine generic skills have been identified as essential for student learning for the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century in the school curriculum:

Collaboration Skills Communication Skills Creativity Critical Thinking Skills Information Technology Skills Mathematical Skills\* Problem Solving Skills Self-learning Skills\* Self-management Skills

Based on the past experience of implementing the curriculum reform and in response to the dynamic changes in society and recent research, the nine generic skills are grouped in three clusters of related skills, namely Basic Skills, Thinking Skills and Personal and Social Skills for better integrative understanding and application in a holistic manner (see the table below for details).

<html><body><table><tr><td>Basic Skills</td><td>Thinking Skills</td><td>Personal and Social Skills</td></tr><tr><td>Communication Skills</td><td>Critical Thinking Skills</td><td>Self-management Skills</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematical Skills</td><td>Creativity</td><td>Self-learning Skills</td></tr><tr><td>IT Skills</td><td>Problem Solving Skills</td><td>Collaboration Skills</td></tr></table></body></html>

The nine generic skills are to be developed through learning and teaching in all KLAs. The English Language Education KLA provides greater opportunities for the development of collaboration skills, communication skills, creativity, critical thinking skills, problem solving skills and self-learning skills.

When completing a more complicated learning task, the generic skills are often applied in an integrative manner rather than in isolation. Some generic skills are more likely to be used together. For example, collaboration skills are often used with communication skills and problem solving skills; critical thinking skills tend to be used with problem solving skills and creativity. The former cluster of generic skills can be referred to as “collaborative problem solving skills” and the latter as “holistic thinking skills”. Schools are encouraged to plan learning and teaching activities in a holistic manner whereby the clusters of skills can be suitably developed and effectively applied.

Details of the nine generic skills, and examples and suggestions of how the English Language KLA contributes to the development and integrative use of the generic skills are provided in Appendix 7.

# 2.2.4 Values and Attitudes

Values are explicit or implicit belief systems that students develop, which guide their conduct and decision making, while attitudes are personal dispositions towards particular issues. They are qualities that an individual or society considers important as principles for conduct and are intrinsically worthwhile.

To help students become informed and responsible citizens, schools should promote values and attitudes (e.g. the rule of law, responsibility, sustainability, cultural inclusion, respect for pluralism, mutual respect and acceptance) in accordance with their school mission, school contexts, stakeholders’ views, students’ needs and major concerns, and infuse them into the school curriculum.

A variety of learning experiences in KLAs, moral and civic education, life-wide learning, etc. can strengthen values education through:

deepening students’ understanding of positive values and attitudes (cognitive); nurturing their empathy and positive attitudes towards life (affective); and promoting learning-by-doing in authentic situations (behavioural).

A proposed set of values and attitudes for incorporation into the school curriculum is provided in Appendix 8. Among all of these, perseverance, respect for others, responsibility, national identity, commitment, integrity and care for others have been identified as the seven priority values and attitudes.

Values and attitudes can be effectively developed through learning activities. For example, teachers can help students learn to be independent by allowing them to choose a topic that they regard as interesting and appropriate to work on. They can also help students learn to be open-minded and have mutual respect by encouraging them to accept different points of view and different ways of doing things.

Among the learning objectives for the English Language Education KLA, the language development strategies, literary competence development strategies and attitudes specific to language and literature learning are especially relevant to the development of the generic skills, and the personal and social values and attitudes broadly recognised and valued in all KLAs.

Examples of how the English Language Education KLA can facilitate the development of personal and social values and attitudes from KS1 – 4 are provided in Appendix 9.

# 2.3 Curriculum Organisation

# 2.3.1 Learning Time

In the English Language Education KLA, learning is not confined to English lessons or to the school itself. Students’ learning time includes:

lesson time (i.e. English lessons);   
school time other than lesson time (e.g. assembly, recess, lunch, before/after school, open day, post-examination activity day); and   
time during holidays (e.g. Sundays, Christmas holidays, summer holidays).

With reference to the recommended lesson time allocation for each KLA (see Appendix 10 for details), schools can allocate $1 7 \%$ to $21 \%$ of the lesson time to the English Language Education KLA for each key stage from Primary 1 to Secondary 3 (KS1 – 3). English Language, as a core subject of the senior secondary curriculum, accounts for a flexible range of $12 . 5 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time over a course of three years in KS4. Literature in English, as an elective subject of the senior secondary curriculum, accounts for $10 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time over a course of three years in KS4.

Schools may vary the percentage of time allocation for different year levels of a key stage as long as the total lesson time falls within the recommended range.

Schools are reminded that learning time is not rigidly calculated according to the number of English lessons per week or cycle. The concept of total learning time within a year or even a key stage has to be adopted. To facilitate learning and teaching through effective curriculum organisation, schools are encouraged to make flexible use of the time during and outside school hours. For example, $1 9 \%$ and $8 \%$ of the total lesson time is reserved for schools’ flexible use at the primary and junior secondary levels respectively. Flexibility is provided for schools to deploy the flexible time to conduct cross-curricular activities such as those for additional common reading for students’ whole-person development. With due consideration to holistic planning at the wholeschool and KLA levels, schools can flexibly make timetabling arrangements to enrich students’ English learning experiences in collaboration with other parties.

As for the senior secondary level, $10 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the time allocation is set aside for Other Learning Experiences (OLE). Schools should give due consideration to the overall planning and co-ordination among different KLAs and subjects with flexibility to organise OLE during and outside school hours.

Please refer to Section 3.5 of this Guide for suggestions on how to make plans for the use of lesson time allocated to the English Language Education KLA.

# 2.3.2 Modules of Learning

The concept of modules, units and tasks is recommended for organising the learning and teaching of the English Language Education curriculum. A module is an organising focus which can be broken down into units and tasks that are thematically or conceptually related. These themes and concepts are explored through tasks and help students make connections between their learning experiences. Extended tasks and projects can be further developed from tasks to help students develop further knowledge and skills.

For example, in the English Language curriculum, the unit “Travelling and Visiting” under the module “Cultures of the World” at KS3 allows students to examine different related areas of knowledge such as travel and discovery, and customs, food and clothing of different places. Well-sequenced tasks can be designed to provide students with opportunities to use English to learn about, discuss and experience different cultures in a variety of ways (e.g. acting as tour guides to introduce a country or city, and writing recipes for and inviting people to join an international food festival) (see Appendix 11 for the suggested modules and units for KS 1 – 4). Due consideration should be given to the contexts for designing learning tasks under these modules and units to engage students in the use of English for intellectual, personal and social development at different key stages of schooling.

Similarly, works with related themes from the same literary period or of the same literary genre can be grouped under the same module in the planning and implementation of the Literature in English curriculum. Learning and teaching activities can be designed to facilitate the development of critical thinking, literary analysis and appreciation skills through cross-text comparison.

Teachers may develop modules of their own by selecting relevant textbook units, set texts and/or authentic resource materials to suit the needs, interests and abilities of their particular group of students. While learning modules can be enriched or developed by designing activities that extend and deepen learning experiences of the more able students, they can also be adapted or developed for the less able students to help them progress. Different learning activities and modes of assessment can be incorporated into the learning modules to develop students’ multiple intelligences and generic skills, stimulate their learning and sustain their interests. Exploring real-life topics and concepts through tasks also lends itself well to providing students with ample hands-on practice to consolidate learning.

# Chapter 3 Curriculum Planning

# 3.1 Guiding Principles

The English Language Education curriculum framework allows for flexibility and innovation in curriculum planning. A balanced and coherent English Language Education curriculum emphasising the active role of students in the learning process and providing a variety of learning experiences should be developed in schools. When planning and developing the school English Language Education curriculum, teachers are encouraged to:

work as a team to identify the direction for school curriculum development and set clear focuses (e.g. strengthening reading across the curriculum (RaC), development of new literacy skills) for a specific year level and across year levels to ensure horizontal and vertical alignment in curriculum planning;   
aim for a balanced and comprehensive coverage of the learning targets and objectives, ensuring that the learning tasks or activities stress the integration of skills and a balance of learning experiences in the Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience Strands — rather than focusing on isolated skills or just one strand at the expense of the others;   
plan and devise appropriate and purposeful language learning materials, tasks, activities and projects to develop students’ language abilities, learning to learn strategies, information literacy and positive values and attitudes conducive to lifelong learning, and to provide opportunities for integrative use of generic skills; follow the whole-school language policy and create a language-rich environment (e.g. English Days, debates) to engage students in the active use of English and collaborate with other KLAs to reinforce content and language learning through exposing students to reading texts from different disciplines and organising crosscurricular project learning;   
adapt textbooks and other language learning resources, and supplement them with interesting authentic materials and e-resources to suit students’ needs and foster the development of a broader range of literacy skills, including new literacy skills to process and create visual/multimodal texts;   
make flexible use of lesson time (e.g. the inclusion of more double or even triple periods per week or cycle in the school timetable) to facilitate a task-based approach to language learning and to allow for continuous stretches of time for

English tasks and projects as well as co-curricular activities (e.g. watching videos or movies, taking part in drama workshops);

enrich and extend students’ language learning experiences in real contexts and authentic settings through English-related life-wide learning activities (e.g. visits, community services, drama performances, job shadowing) which revolve around the Five Essential Learning Experiences, i.e. Moral and Civic Education, Intellectual Development, Community Service, Physical and Aesthetic Development and Careerrelated Experiences;   
promote learner independence and autonomy by engaging students in language learning activities beyond lesson time (e.g. pre-lesson preparation for “Literature Circle” and “Flipped Classroom”); and   
formulate an assessment and homework policy that promotes “assessment for learning” (AfL) and “assessment as learning” (AaL), including providing specific and timely feedback to encourage reflection and using different modes of assessments and assignments (e.g. role plays, projects, portfolios) instead of just relying on penand-paper assessments to collect evidence to inform learning and teaching.

# 3.2 Central Curriculum and School Curriculum Development

This Guide provides a central curriculum which, in the form of an open and flexible framework, sets out the following key learning elements that schools are encouraged to include in their school curriculum to help students achieve lifelong language learning capabilities:

subject knowledge and skills, which are expressed in the form of learning targets under three interrelated strands as well as learning objectives;   
generic skills; and   
positive values and attitudes.

Because of its flexibility, this framework allows schools to pursue innovative practices in curriculum planning and implementation. Schools are strongly encouraged to capitalise on it and develop their school English Language Education curriculum based on the general direction provided in the central curriculum, taking into consideration factors such as students’ needs, interests and abilities, teacher readiness and the school context. For example, schools may focus on increasing motivation in learning through the promotion of Language across the Curriculum (LaC), or fostering independent and lifelong learning through the promotion of language development strategies, e-learning and self-access language learning (see Section 1.4 of this Guide for the suggested strategies for renewing the English Language Education curriculum).

Please refer to Chapter 2 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary 1— 6) (2014) and Booklet 2 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary 1— 6) (2017) for details on the planning of a whole-school curriculum.

Besides developing modules, units and tasks for organising learning and teaching (as mentioned in Section 2.3.2 of this Guide), schools may take the following into consideration when planning the English Language Education curriculum:

# 3.2.1 Integrating Classroom Learning and Independent Learning

Learning is most effective when students play an active role in the learning process and when they take charge of their own learning. The promotion of learner autonomy and independence should start at an early age. While self-directed learning is regarded as an integral part of students’ ultimate achievements, more effort should go into demonstrating how to monitor the learning process and providing opportunities for students to develop metacognitive strategies. In the learning process, teachers can help students:

learn how to learn;   
make choices as to what, when and how they want to learn;   
use a range of language development strategies;   
carry out self-assessment and reflection;   
plan, monitor and evaluate the strategies adopted and their own learning effectiveness, which forms the basis for goal-setting in subsequent tasks or activities; and develop the knowledge, skills and strategies, attitudes and perseverance to foster lifelong language learning.

# 3.2.2 Learning English outside the Classroom

Language learning taking place beyond the confines of the classroom can provide relevant, pleasurable and meaningful learning experiences for students.

Schools can:

promote judicious use of online resources (e.g. e-books, social networking sites, online forums) to maximise students’ opportunities to use English outside class time;

utilise their resources to enhance the language environment so as to provide students with enjoyable learning experiences in the use of English through various types of co-curricular activities (e.g. language games, puppet shows, drama activities, choral speaking, reading clubs, filming short commercials, movies); and explore opportunities for experiential learning in the community (e.g. attending talks and story-telling sessions delivered in English, going to plays or live theatre shows in English, sharing life and learning experiences with their peers through the social media, conducting inter-school English activities/camps, inviting English-speaking guests to exchange ideas and share experiences) to widen students’ exposure to the authentic use of the language.

For further ideas of how to extend English learning outside the classroom, see Example 1.

# 3.2.3 Promoting e-Learning and Information Literacy

Schools are encouraged to enhance students’ learning experiences through making effective use of IT to enhance collaboration and interaction inside and outside the classroom, build learning networks, and promote self-directed learning. To facilitate the implementation of the English Language Education curriculum through e-learning, schools can:

create an IT-friendly environment (e.g. easy access to the Internet and e-resources) for students to seek, share and use information and resources for learning as well as to interact with teachers, other students and people around the world;   
provide room for professional capacity building to enhance teachers’ repertoire of strategies in implementing e-learning in the school English Language Education curriculum;   
make use of a range of e-resources and e-learning tools to motivate students and enhance learning and teaching effectiveness; and   
use e-assessment that facilitates the understanding of students’ learning progress, the provision of feedback and the implementation of AfL or AaL.

To help students manage the vast amount of information in the digital age, teachers can:

work closely with the teacher-librarian and IT co-ordinator to create a favourable learning environment with easy access to a wide variety of information and reading materials;

provide students with opportunities to apply IT skills to process and create multimodal texts, and share information and ideas through online platforms; facilitate discussion and evaluation of the power, accuracy and reliability of information, and the effectiveness of different sources in conveying information (e.g. websites, documentaries, news articles, advertisements);   
guide students to identify the bias and stereotypes conveyed in different kinds of texts;   
design learning activities and projects that require students to evaluate, extract, organise and synthesise information and ideas from different sources, and create new ideas of their own; and   
promote ethical use of information (e.g. acknowledging sources of information properly, preventing cyberbullying) and respect for intellectual property rights.

# 3.2.4 Strengthening Values Education

Values education can be promoted in different domains of the school curriculum such as moral and civic education, life education, religious education, sex education, environmental education and Basic Law education. It aims to develop in students positive values and attitudes and provide them with all-round learning experiences conducive to their whole-person development. The English Language Education curriculum provides a flexible framework for promoting a wide range of positive values and attitudes including the seven priority values and attitudes (i.e. perseverance, respect for others, responsibility, national identity, commitment, integrity and care for others). Through careful curriculum planning, students can be provided with opportunities to explore a wealth of value-laden issues (e.g. human rights and responsibilities, sustainability, equal opportunities) in order to:

deepen their understanding of positive values and attitudes from multiple perspectives and develop their capabilities to analyse issues in a rational and objective manner; and   
nurture their abilities to reflect on and apply their beliefs, including identifying, clarifying and evaluating values and attitudes in different situations, and adopt positive values and attitudes as the guiding principles in making judgements and decisions.

Teachers should focus on the positive values and attitudes that align with their school mission, and take into consideration stakeholders’ views, students’ needs and major concerns when planning to promote values education in the English Language Education KLA. Based on the understanding of the school context and students’ needs, interests and abilities, teachers can flexibly use, adapt and develop a wide array of learning and teaching resources which provide stimuli for critical and imaginative responses. Language arts materials (e.g. short stories, poems, lyrics, films) which deal with universal issues such as human relationships, nature, love and growing up can be used as resources for simulating activities to enable students to develop positive values, think from different perspectives and make thoughtful and reasonable judgements. Non-fiction materials (e.g. documentaries, biographies, news/magazine articles) which present students with inspiring stories of people, controversial issues and thoughtprovoking happenings in the world can be used to generate topics for discussion or debate to inculcate positive values and attitudes in students.

The materials mentioned above should be complemented with well-designed learning activities not only to guide students to consider and accommodate diverse views, remove bias, re-prioritise choices and show respect for multiculturalism, but also to provide them with opportunities to practise the language skills in meaningful contexts. Some examples of these activities include:

story-telling and reader’s theatre on books or texts about interpersonal relationships; writing critically on the theme of a short story;   
discussions and debates on the controversial issues raised in an editorial;   
comparing the life stories of two successful people or the ways to face adversities; designing pamphlets and posters which introduce the cultures and traditions of different countries;   
writing an alternative ending, a possible sequel, or an imaginary dialogue based on a film; and   
doing projects which entail investigation into real-life problems from various perspectives and presentation of information in various modes.

# 3.2.5 Cross-curricular Planning

To enable students to explore knowledge and gain experience in a more comprehensive and coherent manner, teachers can adopt a cross-curricular approach when planning their whole-school curriculum. As students progress to the secondary level, more opportunities should be provided for exposure to, and use of, English in non-language subjects, which would help enhance their confidence in using English. Language across the Curriculum (LaC) can be promoted to create a favourable environment for English learning and connect students’ learning experiences. To this end, the fine-tuned medium of instruction (MOI) arrangements allow secondary schools more flexibility in using English as the MOI. For example, schools can allocate no more than $2 5 \%$ of the total lesson time (excluding the lesson time for English Language) to Extended Learning Activities (ELAs) in English for non-language subjects. Teachers, however, need to understand the language demands of different KLAs and the connection between English for general purposes and English for academic purposes. For example, the learning and teaching of a particular science topic may require input of a combination of language items and structures. To maximise learning that integrates language and content, cross-curricular collaboration could focus on appropriate entry points such as text types (e.g. argumentative writing), rhetorical functions (e.g. defining, making suggestions), academic vocabulary commonly used across disciplines (e.g. decline, analyse) or vocabulary building strategies (e.g. using prefixes “aqua-”, “geo-” and “bio-” to form subject-specific words, understanding word collocations to increase productive knowledge).

With language focus systematically and strategically implemented in non-language subjects, students can be supported to develop their thinking skills and apply the language knowledge and skills in subject-specific contexts (see Example 2).

When students make connections among ideas and concepts, their motivation will be enhanced. The knowledge they acquire, the language and thinking skills and attitudes they develop in each KLA will also be deepened. To develop cross-curricular modules or support students in making the most of the ELAs, teachers of English can:

collaborate with teachers of other KLAs to identify entry points, set realistic goals, draw up a plan or schedule of work, and develop and evaluate the learning, teaching and assessment materials and activities;   
promote RaC and develop students’ reading skills necessary for processing academic texts on themes related to non-language subjects, and provide opportunities for application and consolidation in collaboration with other KLAs/subject panels; highlight the academic vocabulary encountered and provide scaffolding for students to retain and use these words;   
offer suggestions for language learning tasks or activities to be implemented in nonlanguage subjects, with due emphasis on particular grammar items and structures, communicative functions or language skills; and

create opportunities for students to develop a broad range of generic skills that can be applied in other KLAs (e.g. self-learning skills, critical thinking skills).

# 3.2.6 Managing the Curriculum

School heads/principals and primary school curriculum leaders/prefects of studies play a crucial role in steering holistic curriculum planning and implementation through fostering collaboration, experience sharing and knowledge building among the teaching staff. While the chairpersons and all members of the English Language and Literature in English panels have the responsibility of initiating change to facilitate learning and teaching in the English Language Education KLA, teacher-librarians also have a part in ensuring the smooth implementation of the curricula. The roles they assume may vary from school to school, depending on the school context.

# School Heads/Principals

School heads/principals take the leading role in planning, directing, and supporting whole-school curriculum development. They work closely with the deputy heads and the English Language/Literature in English panel chairpersons to:

develop a whole-school language policy that facilitates the learning of English Language and Literature in English and plan the curriculum, instructional and assessment policies across KLAs;   
set up a curriculum development group to facilitate the planning of a school English Language Education curriculum and professional development, with due consideration given to students’ needs, the school’s development plan and teacher readiness; provide support for trying out new initiatives in the learning and teaching of the two subjects by creating curriculum space and time through flexible timetabling, and allowing opportunities for professional development and collaborative lesson preparation;   
ensure adequate resources needed for the implementation of the school English Language Education curriculum;   
appreciate and commend progress made, sustain appropriate curriculum initiatives, and value quality rather than quantity;   
promote a positive and harmonious school culture in which teachers can work collaboratively for a shared goal in the learning of English Language and Literature in English;   
support the English Language and Literature in English panel chairpersons in setting up a community of practice among the subject teachers within the school and

encourage networking with other schools to facilitate professional exchange of knowledge and experience in learning and teaching of the subjects, and solicit support from community partners when appropriate; and establish and maintain positive relationships with parents to help them understand the school’s beliefs, rationale and practices in the implementation of the English Language Education curriculum, and their roles in supporting students at home.

# Primary School Curriculum Leaders (for primary schools only and previously known as “PSMCD”)/Prefects of Studies (for secondary schools only)

Primary school curriculum leaders/Prefects of Studies assist school heads/principals in implementing the whole-school curriculum and support teachers in improving learning and teaching. For further curriculum development, they take the lead to:

devise and facilitate implementation of the whole-school curriculum;   
guide teachers in trying out innovative learning and teaching strategies and conducting action research; and   
co-ordinate different subject panels to support cross-curricular English learning activities or programmes.

# English Language Panel Chairpersons

English Language panel chairpersons plan, lead, manage and evaluate the school English Language curriculum and its implementation. They are also the “bridge” between the school management and English panel members.

To develop the school English Language curriculum, the English panel chairpersons lead the panel to:

keep abreast of the latest trends and innovations in education in the development of the English Language curriculum which is aligned with the school vision and central curriculum framework;   
provide appropriate student-centred language programmes with reference to students’ needs, interests and abilities, teachers’ strengths and the school context;   
create a language-rich environment in the school through promoting crosscurricular language learning activities and providing students with opportunities to participate in a variety of activities to use English in and outside class for purposeful communication; develop plans and set priorities for curriculum development in the English Language Education KLA in collaboration with other KLA/subject panels in order to empower students to transfer the knowledge and skills from one subject to another, and direct curriculum and instructional changes in school; assist school heads/principals in implementing the whole-school curriculum and managing the provision and deployment of resources in support of curriculum development;   
ensure vertical curriculum coherence by taking into consideration the learning experiences and achievements of students in the previous key stages of learning, as well as developing and reinforcing students’ English knowledge and skills progressively through opportunities for consolidation and application; and enhance assessment literacy through promoting the use of a variety of activities for different pedagogical and assessment purposes, the provision of quality feedback, and the collection and analysis of evidence of student learning to inform learning and teaching.

To facilitate co-ordination and collaboration among panel members, and monitor the implementation of the curriculum, English Language panel chairpersons are advised to:

work closely with level co-ordinators to ensure coherence in curriculum planning, implementation and evaluation across year levels, and promote a culture of collaboration among panel members through regular exchange of teaching ideas and reflections (e.g. peer coaching, lesson observation, action research, collaborative lesson planning);   
evaluate the effectiveness of the school English Language curriculum through collecting and analysing assessment data and stakeholders’ views, which provides feedback on curriculum planning and learning/teaching strategies for the betterment of student learning;   
facilitate professional development of panel members through setting up a community of practice within the school and encouraging them to attend courses or workshops and organising or participating in research projects and inter-school networking activities; and   
review and adjust deployment of English panel members and provide them with regular feedback through performance appraisal.

# English Language Teachers

English Language teachers can help bring about an effective school English Language curriculum by contributing to the development of a whole-school language policy, assisting their panel chairpersons as individuals or in collaboration with their fellow teachers. They can also take the roles of curriculum leaders and initiate innovation and change.

In implementing the school English Language curriculum, English Language teachers are advised to:

strengthen students’ development of the language skills through engaging them in diverse learning activities that stress a balanced coverage of the strand targets as well as language knowledge and skills;   
adopt appropriate pedagogical approaches to motivate students in English learning (e.g. introducing them to a wide variety of texts on different themes, facilitating discussions through the use of flexible grouping strategies, introducing different assessment modes and strategies, providing constructive feedback which helps them reflect on their own learning and set personalised learning goals);   
take the initiative in trying out innovative teaching strategies with fellow teachers or external supporting agents;   
foster the development of a broader range of literacy skills by making use of a variety of authentic language learning materials such as web-based resources, multimodal materials, short stories, documentaries and news/magazine articles; actively engage in professional development and lifelong learning through reflecting on daily practices, discussing issues, sharing knowledge and experience with fellow teachers, attending courses, seminars and conferences, and participating in communities of practice and inter-school networking activities;   
make use of community resources and expose students to meaningful use of English in various contexts;   
devise student-friendly success criteria and performance descriptors derived from the school curriculum aims and objectives, with a view to identifying strengths and weaknesses of students and providing them with constructive feedback for improvement; and   
help parents understand their children’s performance in both formative and summative assessments.

# Native-speaking English Teachers (NETs)

NETs enrich the English language learning environment in schools and strengthen teachers’ capacity through professional development and collaboration with fellow English teachers.

In the role of a resource person, NETs are advised to:

collaborate with other panel members in developing and delivering the school English Language curriculum;   
cultivate students’ interest in, and understanding of, the English language, its cultural assets and the socio-historical traditions of English-speaking countries; enhance the learning and teaching of English with authentic materials such as language arts resources with a view to developing in students the habit of reading in English and providing them with opportunities to communicate with each other in English with confidence;   
create an English-rich environment in the school through planning and organising activities that provide opportunities for students to use English for authentic purposes (e.g. English Day, debating competitions); and   
promote professional development by sharing good teaching practices, co-teaching with other panel members, organising workshops (e.g. questioning techniques, communication skills) and advising on how English is used naturally in different contexts.

# Literature in English Panel Chairpersons (for secondary schools only)

Literature in English panel chairpersons monitor the implementation of the curriculum and facilitate co-ordination and collaboration among panel members. They lead the panel to:

keep abreast of the latest trends and innovations in education in the development of the Literature in English curriculum and align it with the school vision and central curriculum framework;   
develop plans for implementing the Literature in English curriculum in collaboration with the English Language panel chairperson whenever necessary to ensure a good foundation is laid at the junior secondary level for the study of this elective subject at the senior secondary level through incorporating language arts in the junior secondary English Language curriculum;   
assist school principals in making arrangements and deployment of resources (e.g. timetabling, selection of literary texts and reference materials, use of special rooms for lessons, organising literary activities such as screening and drama performances) in support of curriculum development and implementation;   
create room and opportunities for professional development;   
evaluate the effectiveness of the school Literature in English curriculum through collecting and analysing assessment data and stakeholders’ views, which provides feedback on curriculum planning and learning/teaching strategies for the betterment of student learning; and   
encourage language and literary activities (e.g. drama competitions, choral speaking) in the school to provide students with pleasurable and meaningful learning experiences.

# Literature in English Teachers (for secondary schools only)

Literature in English teachers can facilitate the effective implementation of the school Literature in English curriculum by assisting their panel chairpersons and working in collaboration with their fellow teachers. They can also take the roles of curriculum leaders and initiate innovation and change.

In implementing the school Literature in English curriculum, Literature in English teachers are advised to:

choose appropriate learning and teaching materials that suit students’ interests and needs, and strengthen their skills in literary appreciation and analysis; adopt a student-centred approach and guide students to explore the ideas, feelings and thoughts expressed in literary texts and how these are conveyed; design appropriate learning activities (e.g. role plays) and assessment tasks (e.g. essay writing) to develop students’ ability to understand and interpret literary texts, as well as to respond critically and imaginatively to them;   
adapt the materials and teaching strategies to cater for the different abilities and needs of students;   
create an open classroom atmosphere in which creative self-expression and personal responses are highly valued, and provide timely feedback on students’ strengths and weaknesses and suggestions for improvement;   
encourage students to broaden their reading and viewing experiences and increase their exposure to literary texts and related art forms (e.g. musicals, drama performances); and   
attend professional development programmes (e.g. networking activities, seminars) to enrich subject and pedagogical knowledge.

# Teacher-librarians

Teacher-librarians should capitalise on their professional knowledge and experience to promote a reading culture in the school and develop students’ literacy skills, which are indispensable for the development of their learning to learn capabilities.

Teacher-librarians are advised to:

help students use the library in ways that are conducive to learning to learn such as:

providing easy access to information in different modes, including e-learning resources,   
developing a variety of resource-based programmes to enhance the independent learning skills of students,   
developing strategies to nurture an interest in reading and to inculcate a regular reading habit in students,   
providing training on locating, retrieving and using information; work collaboratively with all teachers in procuring library resources according to school curriculum focuses;   
encourage the use of a wide range of information sources in support of the promotion of reading to learn and RaC;   
work with teachers in implementing KLA-based and cross-KLA activities (e.g. reading programmes, cross-curricular projects, STEM activities) to provide students with positive learning experiences relevant to their needs, interests and abilities; facilitate the development of information literacy within the school;   
keep abreast of the latest developments in the promotion of a reading culture and curriculum development in different KLAs; and   
ensure the availability of library resources and teaching aids and that they are wellmaintained.

# 3.3 Smooth Transition between Different Key Stages and Multiple Pathways

# 3.3.1 Building a Strong Interface

Educational transitions are crucial processes for students. Students need to adapt to the changes in their school environment during the transition from Kindergarten to Primary 1, and from one key stage to the next. Given its importance to all students, parents and schools are encouraged to collaborate closely to ensure smooth transition from one level of schooling to another to cater for student learning and adjustment needs. With students gaining confidence in using English at each key stage of learning, they will gradually develop their independent learning abilities and good learning habits. The framework of learning targets for the English Language Education curriculum in Appendix 2 is designed to facilitate continuity and a smooth transition across the levels as it reflects the purposes of learning and using English from Primary 1 to Secondary 6, and suggests how the learning and teaching of English should be developed from one key stage to the next.

To ease the transition process and sustain students’ interest in learning English at different stages of schooling, some suggestions are provided below. These suggestions are applicable across key stages and should be introduced based on students’ needs.

# Kindergartens

Kindergarten teachers are advised to:

cultivate children’s interest in language learning and motivate them by creating a stimulating language-rich environment;   
provide opportunities for children to learn the language through multisensory exploration and expose them to pleasurable and age-appropriate English activities (e.g. games, songs, action rhymes, stories) rather than teach it formally;   
engage students in meaningful listening and speaking activities in group settings to develop their confidence in using simple English to interact with people in daily life contexts and facilitate their oracy development;   
introduce the basic concepts of English language (e.g. alphabet knowledge, book and print awareness, phonological awareness) to children progressively through reading aloud and shared reading (i.e. reading to and reading with students); and   
avoid requiring children to memorise spellings of words and doing dictation in a formal manner.

# Primary schools

Lower Primary (KS1)

While continuing the above suggestions as appropriate, schools can also:

organise learning and teaching using modules, units and tasks to help students connect their English learning experiences;   
use interesting and meaningful activities (e.g. games, songs, rhymes, stories, role plays) to motivate students;   
introduce a variety of reading materials and teach basic reading skills explicitly to help students decode words, foster their interest in reading and develop good reading habits (i.e. reading by students);   
introduce phonics skills through reading and task-based learning activities to help students recognise the basic letter-sound relationships and apply such knowledge for reading and spelling (i.e. decoding and encoding words) (see Example 3); teach grammar in context through reading materials and adopt task-based activities to develop students’ language skills and generic skills (e.g. communication skills and creativity); and   
avoid pen-and-paper dictation in the first few months of Primary 1 to provide a stress-free learning environment for students to learn English.

# Upper Primary (KS2)

While continuing the above suggestions as appropriate, schools can also:

introduce a greater variety of themes and text types, including information texts, to further develop students’ reading skills and engage them in meaningful interactions with a wide range of print and non-print resources in English (see Example 4); provide opportunities for students to communicate and express their own ideas and opinions in different forms (e.g. role plays, spoken response to suggestions, PowerPoint presentations, journal entries) for a variety of purposes and audience;   
provide opportunities for students to develop their referencing and information skills and practise the integrative use of language for authentic communication in a multimedia environment;   
engage students in extended English learning tasks and projects on an individual or group basis and engage them in self or peer assessment to develop their capabilities to become independent and self-directed learners; and   
enhance grammar learning by providing a wide range of materials and activities in which students have to apply what they have learnt in context, and reduce the use of mechanical grammar drills.

# Secondary schools

# Junior Secondary (KS3)

While continuing the above suggestions as appropriate, schools can also:

organise bridging programmes such as pre-Secondary 1 summer English Week or English Day to help students overcome the anxiety of learning English in a new environment and in particular to support those who need to learn content subjects through English;

include the learning of phonics skills in the school’s regular English lessons by drawing students’attention to the letter-sound relationships in words and help them develop strategies to pronounce and spell less familiar words;   
promote a culture of reading by exposing students to a wide spectrum of reading and viewing materials (both print and non-print) covering a wide range of topics/ themes (ranging from familiar to less familiar topics), and text types with different stylistic elements, information density and abstractness (e.g. information, literary and imaginative texts);   
promote RaC to provide opportunities for students to develop a wide range of reading skills, extend learning of the content and connect their learning experiences across KLAs;   
facilitate LaC and the integrative use of English to develop students’ generic skills and linguistic competence for effective communication in different contexts; make greater use of language arts materials in English Language classes and engage students in literary activities to develop their critical abilities, aesthetic awareness and cultural awareness, as well as to cultivate their interest in studying Literature in English at the senior secondary level; and   
provide opportunities for students to reflect on and identify their strengths and areas for improvement, and the strategies they find most useful at different stages of the English learning process.

# Senior Secondary (KS4)

While continuing with the above suggestions as appropriate, schools can also:

prepare students for productive use of English through various means (e.g. eliciting and providing vocabulary items through brainstorming, demonstrating how to organise ideas through constructing a concept map);   
make use of a broad range of activities and materials (including multimodal materials) to enhance students’ motivation and provide opportunities for the integrative use of generic skills to prepare them well for more complicated challenges;   
provide additional support (e.g. materials adaptation, promotion of cross-curricular language learning and self-access language learning) to prepare students for the switch to the English medium of instruction at KS4, if appropriate; provide a wide range of life-wide learning and career-related experiences by collaborating with other professionals of different fields, practitioners and people from different cultural backgrounds to organise relevant activities (e.g. visits or talks on specific topics in English) to enhance students’ understanding of the use

of English in the local community and in the work context;

develop self-directed learning skills to promote independent and lifelong language learning; and   
extend students’ language exposure and use beyond English for general communication, and engage them in the learning of rhetorical functions, text structures and language items typical of academic texts to raise their academic language awareness and prepare them for tertiary education.

For more information about transitions between kindergarten and primary levels, primary and secondary levels, and junior and senior secondary levels, see Chapter 9 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 8 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary 1 — 6) (2017).

# 3.3.2 Supporting Students in Educational and Vocational Pathways

While the six-year primary curriculum focuses on laying the foundation of English language development, the secondary curriculum at both junior and senior levels provides opportunities for the appreciation of the language and its application for various purposes. Through a coherent school English Language Education curriculum which attaches importance to the progression and deepening of learning experiences, students can be adequately supported to develop the language knowledge and skills essential for a variety of post-secondary educational and career pathways, particularly in the fields of media production, performing arts, education, business, law and social sciences.

There is much to offer in the English Language Education curriculum in preparing students for vocational and professional education and training, and allowing them to explore and develop their potential talents and career interests. For instance, the recommended modular approach allows schools to introduce a number of work-related topics under the suggested unit “Occupations, Careers and Prospects” for KS4. The module “Learning English through Workplace Communication” in the Elective Part of the senior secondary English Language curriculum also opens up further opportunities for students to learn and apply knowledge and skills in the workplace context. Further, the development of the four language skills and language development strategies such as information and reference skills equips students with the essential skills for Applied Learning (ApL) courses (e.g. courses on “Media and Communication”, one of the areas of studies for ApL) and work in different sectors of the economy.

# 3.4 Collaboration within the English Language Education KLA and CrossKLA Links

To achieve the focuses set out in this Guide, close collaboration among curriculum leaders is necessary. Example 5 shows how such collaboration facilitates language learning and teaching. A diagram illustrating the school head/principal’s role in the development of a school English Language curriculum is also provided for reference in Appendix 12.

Regular consultation with parents should be organised through parent-teacher meetings. Schools might also consider networking and collaborating with other schools, tertiary institutions and/or organisations on professional development concerning curriculum leadership and implementation of the English Language Education curriculum, in particular, ways of providing students with more opportunities for life-wide learning.

# 3.4.1 Collaboration within the English Language Education KLA

Close communication in the form of formal or informal meetings, experience sharing, professional development days or communities of practice should be maintained and organised within the KLA. More sharing of learning resources is encouraged, and this should not be done just among teachers of English, but also between teachers of English and teachers of Literature in English. With some creativity and imagination, learning or teaching materials for Literature in English can often be turned into interesting and motivating language arts materials for the English classroom. Teachers of the two subjects can also work together to equip students at the junior secondary level with the language and skills required in studying Literature in English at the senior secondary level.

# 3.4.2 Collaboration with Other KLAs

It is advisable for teachers of English Language Education to collaborate with teachers of other KLAs to promote language learning through a cross-curricular approach (see Section 3.2.5). When effectively used, this approach enables students to learn English more effectively through exposing them to a wide range of themes or topics as well as enhancing subject learning in other KLAs. The following outlines the relationship between English Language Education and the other KLAs.

English Language Education KLA helps:

develop students’ language skills and world knowledge, which enables them to better meet the specialised demands of the other KLAs;   
develop students’ skills in “Reading to Learn” through providing exposure to a wide range of materials with different themes and text types conducive to knowledge building and language learning;   
provide students with opportunities to develop a broad range of generic skills as well as positive values and attitudes that they can apply in other KLAs, leading to increased lifelong learning capacity;   
reinforce students’ ability in learning English through the knowledge, skills and learning experiences that they gain in the other KLAs; and   
broaden students’ learning experiences through language learning activities that are related to one or more of the other KLAs.

The following table presents examples of links between English Language Education and the other KLAs. They are illustrative rather than exhaustive.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Key Learning Area</td><td>Examples of Links Links are made to the KLA listed on the left hand column when students:</td></tr><tr><td>Chinese Language Education</td><td>compare and discuss the cultural events, literary works, lifestyles and values of Chinese and Westerners..</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematics Education</td><td>plan surveys, present research findings, and prepare arguments using statistics.</td></tr><tr><td>Personal,Social and Humanities Education</td><td>read and discuss texts that examine social issues or topics (e.g.. interpersonal relationships, relationship between the individual and society, civic education and environmental protection).</td></tr><tr><td>Science Education</td><td>discuss ideas and clarify purposes prior to and in the process of an investigation; and. read or research information on science-related topics (e.g.) energy, the earth, the solar system) or works of science fiction.</td></tr><tr><td>Technology Education</td><td>explore and communicate ideas and information on the development or impact of modern technology.</td></tr><tr><td>Arts Education</td><td>engage in different forms of creative writing (e.g. poems, short. stories, plays, film scripts) or give a dramatic presentation of a short play or a scene from a play; and. discuss or critique an advertisement, a poster, a film or the illustrations in a text..</td></tr></table></body></html>

<html><body><table><tr><td>Key Learning Area</td><td>Examples of Links Links are made to the KLA listed on the left hand column when students:</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Education</td><td>engage in learning activities that examine the pros and cons of various physical activities.</td></tr></table></body></html>

The English Language Education curriculum also contributes to the learning and teaching of Liberal Studies, a core subject of the senior secondary curriculum. The flexible English Language Education curriculum framework allows a wide range of themes and topics, including social issues, to be covered throughout the different key stages of learning and helps students develop a broad knowledge base, higher-order thinking skills and the language skills essential to the learning of Liberal Studies. Activities such as role plays and debates on current issues can be conducted to provide links to the learning and teaching of Liberal Studies.

Schools may also consider leveraging the efforts of different KLAs to promote a wholeschool initiative while facilitating English learning (e.g. promoting STEM education to provide a suitable context for the collaboration between teachers of English Language Education and STEM-related KLAs). To promote STEM education, English teachers can:

introduce relevant English reading materials to guide students to discuss critically the issues related to mathematics, science and technology, and appreciate the contributions and achievements of famous and successful people in these areas to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit, i.e. resilience, innovativeness, willingness to take calculated risks and to cope with challenges and adversities;   
design tasks, activities and projects to encourage students to work out innovative solutions to problems or create new ideas or things to enhance their creative capacity (e.g. designing a product and the marketing strategy, writing a short story about a zany invention);   
create a learning environment that draws students’ attention to innovation and creativity related to mathematics, science and technology (e.g. posting up quotes by famous people in the related fields on campus, organising STEM education competitions involving the use of English for presentations); and   
connect learning experiences through RaC and life-wide learning/Other Learning Experiences (OLE) activities (e.g. visiting museums, designing apps to promote English learning).

# 3.5 Time Allocation

As mentioned in Section 2.3.1, schools can allocate $1 7 \%$ to $21 \%$ of the lesson time to the English Language Education KLA for each key stage from Primary 1 to Secondary 3 (KS1 – 3). The senior secondary English Language curriculum, which builds on the effective learning and teaching practices promoted in previous key stages, accounts for a flexible range of $12 . 5 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time over a course of three years in KS4. Literature in English, as an elective subject in the senior secondary curriculum, accounts for $10 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ of the total lesson time over a course of three years in KS4. Schools may vary the percentage of time allocation for different year levels of a key stage as long as the total lesson time falls within the recommended range. Schools may also capitalise on their professional autonomy to maximise the use of lesson time, leading to the achievement of a wider range of learning targets and objectives.

Suggestions on how teachers can make plans for the use of lesson time allocated to the English Language Education KLA for different key stages are provided below.

# Primary (KS1 and KS2)

Two key components, namely General English Programme and Reading Workshops, can be included in the primary English Language curriculum. The General English Programme, which accounts for about $60 \%$ of the total lesson time for English Language, focuses on the learning and teaching of English knowledge and skills and their integrative use. Activities such as dictation and listening can be conducted in the lesson time allocated to the General English Programme. In the Reading Workshops, which take up about $40 \%$ of the total lesson time for English Language, teachers are encouraged to help students “learn to read” and “read to learn” through careful selection of reading materials that complement, or are related to, the General English Programme. The component of “Reading Workshops” is not confined to the development of reading skills and strategies. Activities that build on the reading materials can also be designed to develop students’ listening, speaking and writing skills as well as positive values and attitudes.

# Junior Secondary (KS3)

With the groundwork laid at the primary level, students should have accumulated some reading experiences and developed the basic reading skills and strategies by the time they start Secondary 1. In this respect, schools are encouraged to flexibly allocate lesson time to strengthen literacy development to enable students not only to further develop and apply English knowledge and skills in a holistic manner, but also to connect their learning experiences in English Language and the other KLAs. Specifically, initiatives to promote RaC are instrumental in developing advanced reading and generic skills. Through exposure to a variety of text types and texts of different levels of complexity and on various subjects and disciplines, students’ knowledge base is broadened and reading experiences enriched, providing a firm foundation for self-directed and lifelong learning. To maximise the benefits gained from reading, teachers can design writing activities which not only require students to borrow or integrate ideas from the reading input, but also allow them to use the vocabulary, communicative functions and text features they have learnt for meaningful and purposeful communication.

# Senior Secondary (KS4)

# English Language

Both the Compulsory and Elective Parts in the senior secondary English Language curriculum include the learning of English Language in the Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience Strands. They complement each other and comprise the same learning objectives, which embody the essential content of learning for English Language at the senior secondary level. For the sake of curriculum coherence and effective use of lesson time, the learning and teaching of the Compulsory Part and the various modules in the Elective Part could be integrated, with due consideration given to the commonality shared by these curriculum components:

Language knowledge   
Language skills   
Language development strategies   
Generic skills   
Values and attitudes

The integration of the curriculum components facilitates the consolidation and transfer of knowledge and skills between the Compulsory Part and the elective modules. When adopted flexibly and meaningfully, this integrated approach not only provides a coherent learning experience but also allows teachers to streamline the curriculum and make more effective use of the lesson time (see Example 6).

# Literature in English

Equal emphasis should be placed on the different strands in order to ensure a balanced curriculum and to help students develop a good understanding of literary forms and conventions, appreciative and interpretative abilities, as well as language skills and awareness. The lesson time for Literature in English can be flexibly used to address students’ needs with due consideration of their strengths and weaknesses. For effective use of lesson time, teachers can adopt instructional strategies such as “Literature Circle” and “Flipped Classroom” to engage students in independent research, lesson preparation and self-directed learning outside class time.

Schools are greatly encouraged to make flexible use of the learning time during and outside school hours to facilitate learning and teaching. Confining the learning of English to the classroom, compartmentalising lessons into the learning and teaching of the language skills, and designating lessons for dictations or drills for examinations in a rigid manner are not encouraged as they may not facilitate students’ construction and application of knowledge and skills in a coherent and integrative manner. Instead, schools can:

arrange for more double or triple period sessions per week or cycle and include half-day or whole-day activity sessions shared among different KLAs in the school timetable to allow continuous stretches of time for extended tasks, projects, visits, student or professional performances;   
set aside a short, regular period of time per day for reading, in addition to the regular lesson time, for the development of reading skills and strategies, and to help students develop a good reading habit for lifelong learning;   
plan their timetable and calendar flexibly (e.g. adjusting the number and arrangement of lessons in each term to cater for the special requirements of the learning programmes, exploring the use of Saturdays and long holidays to encourage life-wide learning and independent learning);   
make use of weblogs, online forums or social learning networks to facilitate interaction and instant feedback, and support the building of a learning community among teachers and students in school and in the wider world;   
introduce to students the use of web-based resources in the form of online interactive learning platforms, computer software packages and multimodal materials such as interactive books and videos to help students pursue individualised learning goals outside class according to their learning interests, progress and needs; and   
provide opportunities for engaging students in e-assignments on the school intranet, such as posts on online forums, collaborative writing and audio-visual clips, to add variety to their learning experiences and facilitate cross-fertilisation of ideas.

# 4.1 Guiding Principles for Learning and Teaching of English Language and Literature in English

Teachers play an important role in implementing the English Language Education curriculum effectively. Given the wide range of abilities and needs of students at different stages of language development, teachers should make use of the open and flexible curriculum framework presented in Chapter 2 of this Guide to develop effective learning, teaching and assessment activities for the two subjects of the English Language Education KLA, i.e. English Language and Literature in English.

The following are the major guiding principles for the learning and teaching of English Language and Literature in English:

Student-centredness is a significant notion in the learning and teaching of the two subjects. Learning effectiveness is enhanced when teachers take into account students’ needs, interests and abilities. As these may vary at different stages and in different settings, teachers should, with a view to embracing learner diversity, adapt the curriculum appropriately, employ a variety of teaching methods and strategies, and select suitable learning materials and activities.   
Context is important to the learning and teaching of both subjects. For English Language, meaningful contexts provide opportunities for the use of the language for purposeful communication. Hence, teachers should design contextualised learning tasks under modules and units to engage students in meaningful practice and purposeful use of the language. For Literature in English, textual and cultural contexts are critical to the appreciation and interpretation of literary texts. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to analyse the use of language in different textual and cultural contexts, so that they can understand the dynamic interplay between text and context and develop greater awareness of the subtleties of language.

Language learning and teaching should always be connected to real life. As language use in everyday life is always integrative, opportunities for applying different language knowledge and skills integratively to complete tasks should be provided in the learning and teaching of English Language. The task-based approach, under which the language skills and other learning elements are interwoven in communicative tasks, should therefore be adopted to enable students to interact naturally in, and appreciate the richness and complexity of, the language. As for Literature in English, the study of literary texts should also be connected to the real world and students’ daily life. Learning activities that encourage students to explore the relationship between literature and society (e.g. examining the historical and socio-cultural background underpinning the creation of literary works) and to develop critical response through relating the texts to their personal experiences should be designed to enhance students’ cultural understanding.

# 4.2 Approaches to Learning and Teaching

# 4.2.1 Four Key Tasks

The Curriculum Development Council recommended in the report Learning to Learn — The Way Forward in Curriculum Development (2001) the use of the Four Key Tasks (i.e. Moral and Civic Education, Reading to Learn, Project Learning and Information Technology (IT) for Interactive Learning) as learning and teaching strategies to help students progress towards the vision of whole-person development and learning how to learn. Since then, schools have gained considerable experience in using them to facilitate learning and teaching in the English Language Education KLA. While some schools identified and adopted one of the Key Tasks as an entry point based on their needs, the others incorporated strategically more than one Key Task into their learning and teaching programmes. Building on these successful experiences, schools can devise a holistic plan for curriculum development to sustain and deepen the impacts of the Four Key Tasks. Under the context of ongoing renewal of the school curriculum, the Four Key Tasks have been updated as follows:

Moral and Civic Education: Towards Values Education   
Reading to Learn: Towards Reading across the Curriculum   
Project Learning: Towards Integrating and Applying Knowledge and Skills across   
Disciplines   
IT for Interactive Learning: Towards IT for Self-directed Learning

The updated key tasks are applicable in the English Language Education KLA to enliven learning and teaching, and to help students achieve whole-person development and become self-directed learners. (see Chapter 3 of the Basic Education Curriculum

Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary 1 — 6) (2014) and Booklet 6 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary 1 – 6) (2017) for details.)

Below are some suggestions on promoting the updated Four Key Tasks in the English Language Education KLA.

# Moral and Civic Education: Towards Values Education

Moral and Civic Education (MCE) has been introduced as one of the Four Key Tasks since 2002 to support the Learning to Learn curriculum reform. Building on the experience in implementing MCE, schools are encouraged to extend it to values education to cover a wider range of positive values and attitudes in different domains such as MCE, life education, religious education, sex education, environmental education, Basic Law education, so as to provide students with all-round learning experiences conducive to their whole-person development. Example 7 illustrates how environmental education can be promoted through the study of a poem.

To promote values education in the English Language Education KLA, teachers should focus on the positive values and attitudes that align with the school mission and school development plans, and seek opportunities for collaboration with other KLAs/school committees in planning for cross-curricular activities for enhancing English language learning and cultivating a wide range of positive values and attitudes. Due consideration should also be given to the following seven priority values and attitudes for personal and social development when incorporating values education into their school English Language Education KLA curriculum:

Perseverance Respect for others Responsibility National identity Commitment Integrity Care for others

In the context of the English Language Education KLA, positive values and attitudes can be nurtured in the learning and teaching process through encouraging students to explore relevant themes or topics and participate in co-curricular activities. Learning opportunities within and beyond the classroom should also be provided for students to develop and reflect on their values and attitudes. Teachers can achieve these, for example, through:

using themes such as “Appreciating Chinese Culture” as a focus to develop theme-based activities, in which students can be asked to introduce some aspects of Chinese culture in English to the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET); and scheduling co-curricular activities (e.g. during assembly or lunch breaks) in which students share stories, read poems, sing songs or stage short plays with elements of values and attitudes (e.g. honesty, responsibility), or view and discuss films or multimedia materials on life education.

Example 5 shows how one set of theme-based English learning activities originally designed for one year level could be gradually extended to become a whole-school project involving the participation of a social service agency as well as parents to promote values education.

To leverage collaborative efforts, the two subject panels can work with other subject panels, committees and schools or make use of community resources to promote values education, for example, through:

providing life-wide learning experience to promote sex education by collaborating with professionals or practitioners of different fields or organisations to arrange activities such as talks, forums and debates; and   
organising cross-curricular programmes on environmental education to provide opportunities for students to express concern about social issues, and building in opportunities for reflection.

# Reading to Learn: Towards Reading across the Curriculum

Reading is important to students of diverse learning abilities at all key stages of schooling. It helps develop thinking skills, enriches knowledge, enhances language proficiency and broadens life experience. Since the curriculum reform in 2001, emphasis has been placed on motivating students and enhancing their learning to learn capabilities through reading. Example 9 illustrates how Reading to Learn can be promoted through meaningful learning, teaching and assessment activities. Building on their existing strengths and experience in promoting reading, schools should continue to set Reading to Learn as a sustainable Key Task while due emphasis should be placed on reading across the curriculum (RaC) to help students establish links between concepts and ideas acquired in different KLAs and further enhance their interest in reading and ability to process reading texts in a more in-depth way.

In implementing RaC, teachers of the English Language Education KLA are encouraged to:

identify reading materials in both print and non-print forms with suitable entry points (e.g. themes, text types, language features and vocabulary) for connecting students’ learning experiences in different KLAs;   
help students develop the reading skills and strategies necessary for understanding and analysing language use in English texts written for general or academic purposes (e.g. text structures, rhetorical functions and vocabulary); design reading activities that reinforce students’ ability to integrate the knowledge, skills and learning experiences gained in different KLAs; and   
collaborate with teachers of other KLAs to develop learning activities that provide students with opportunities to consolidate the knowledge and skills acquired across KLAs, and develop the essential attributes that go beyond individual subjects or KLAs such as humanistic qualities and entrepreneurial spirit.

For illustration of how to promote RaC at the primary and secondary levels, see Examples 10 and 11.

# Project Learning: Towards Integrating and Applying Knowledge and Skills across Disciplines

Project work in the English Language Education KLA usually involves a theme-based enquiry that engages students in the integrative use of language and/or analysis and appreciation of literary works. To step up project learning, effort should be made to develop students’ ability to integrate and apply knowledge and skills across disciplines through cross-curricular initiatives such as STEM education and Language across the Curriculum. Teachers of the English Language Education KLA should work collaboratively with teachers of other KLAs in designing cross-curricular projects to help students connect their learning experiences, provide opportunities for applying language skills and language learning strategies, and maximise learning that integrates language and content. Co-ordination across KLAs may be required to ensure that students are not assigned too many projects at the same time.

Taking into consideration students’ readiness, teachers can also further develop students’ self-directed learning capabilities and habit by giving them more autonomy in learning, for example, by encouraging students to formulate their own enquiry questions, and to decide on the topic of enquiry and the investigation methods. Teachers play a crucial role in project learning. At various stages of the project, teachers need to switch between the different roles of co-ordinator, facilitator, counsellor, co-learner, language consultant, supervisor and assessor in order to provide different types of support.

Advantages of English projects, which engage students in integrating and applying knowledge and skills across disciplines, include:

Providing an effective framework for language use and language learning — Through the processes of planning, information search, note-taking, interviewing, data analysis, drafting and re-drafting, discussion and presentation, which are often involved in project work, students are able to use language skills and language learning strategies to process and produce texts related to different subjects/ KLAs in an integrated way. This enriches students’ language learning experiences and improves their language proficiency.

Developing learner independence and a sense of responsibility —

Project work enables students to develop skills to achieve the goal of “Learning to Learn”. Through pursuing a topic of interest, setting their own learning targets, and planning and reflecting on their course of action, students learn to take charge of their own learning and become independent, autonomous learners.

Facilitating lifelong and life-wide learning —

Project learning encourages students to move out of the classroom and into the community, allowing them to connect what they learn at school with the working world and the world at large. It often involves the other three Key Tasks when students are engaged in a variety of activities such as planning, organising and participating in real-life investigations in which students are required to explore a problem or research a topic from various perspectives, to read and present information in various modes, and to make conclusions. Students develop not only language knowledge and skills but also generic skills and positive values and attitudes that are conducive to lifelong learning.

For more ideas about how project learning can be implemented, see Examples 5 and 8. Suggestions regarding assessment of project work are provided in Section 5.2.2 of this Guide.

# IT for Interactive Learning: Towards Self-directed Learning

IT is an effective tool to facilitate both classroom and self-access language learning. The prevalence of online learning opportunities and easy access to the Internet allow students to assume greater responsibility in their own learning. Therefore, schools should leverage technology to promote self-directed learning, i.e. to help students plan for, monitor and evaluate their own learning. The success of promoting self-directed learning hinges largely on teachers’ instructional practices and guidance in the use of technology-enhanced learning and teaching resources. To achieve this, teachers of the English Language Education KLA are encouraged to:

advise students to make use of e-platforms for quick and easy access to information and learning resources within and outside the school campus;   
enhance students’ motivation in language learning by identifying suitable e-resources to cater for their interests, abilities, learning pace and styles;   
develop students’ language learning strategies by encouraging them to use different e-learning tools (e.g. online dictionaries, concordancers, search engines) and features of various e-resources (e.g. interactive features of e-books/webpages) to facilitate their understanding of some abstract concepts and complex ideas;   
develop students’ information literacy skills and guide them to think critically and evaluate the data or information on the Internet;   
develop students’ metacognitive skills (e.g. knowledge management skills), which are essential for future studies or work and lifelong learning, by allowing them to take charge of their own learning (e.g. setting learning goals, monitoring learning progress, conducting self-reflection) with the use of e-learning tools and e-resources; and foster students’ interaction and mutual support as well as encourage peer learning and feedback by engaging them in collaborative work through the use of e-platforms.

Examples 12, 13 and 14 illustrate the effective use of IT in the learning and teaching of English Language at the primary and secondary levels. For more ideas on how to promote learner independence, see Section 4.2.6 of this Guide. For more information on how to further promote this Key Task, see Chapter 3D of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary 1 $- \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 6D of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I - \delta )$ (2017).

# 4.2.2 Life-wide Learning

Learning is by no means limited to the classroom. It can take place at any time, in any place (including the home and community) and in any form. Teachers of the English Language Education KLA should enrich and extend students’ language learning experiences in real contexts and authentic settings through English-related life-wide learning activities. To help create a language-rich environment to support life-wide

learning, teachers are encouraged to:

interact with students in English both inside and outside the classroom (e.g. encouraging students to join English language camps as campers, camp helpers or camp leaders);   
provide students with greater exposure to authentic and integrative use of English (e.g. inviting poets and writers to give talks in English, using the media as a language learning resource, visiting international schools, business firms and institutions, or charitable organisations);   
encourage students to seek and create opportunities to learn and use English in natural and realistic settings (e.g. collecting authentic materials or samples of the use of English in the community and sharing them with peers and teachers, searching for information in English on the Internet, watching films or TV programmes in English, listening to English radio programmes, interacting with people from nonChinese-speaking backgrounds in English);   
maximise the use of space and resources in school (e.g. ensuring students’ easy access to computer facilities for language learning beyond lesson time, setting up an English Corner or posting authentic materials and students’ work on the bulletin boards, the walls or the school’s intranet to facilitate wide reader access); and promote learning through co-curricular activities and English-related competitions (e.g. drama performances, inter-school debating competitions, participating in English radio programmes, visits to public libraries and museums).

For illustration of how to plan and design language learning tasks or activities to provide life-wide learning at the primary and secondary levels, see Examples 1 and 15.

# 4.2.3 Task-based Learning and Teaching

The task-based approach is recommended to help students achieve the learning objectives and progress towards the learning targets of the English Language curriculum. Through the use of tasks, students are provided with meaningful contexts where they can learn and use English for purposeful communication, and develop generic skills (e.g. creativity, critical thinking skills, collaboration skills, self-learning skills) as well as positive values and attitudes (e.g. perseverance, responsibility) conducive to independent and lifelong learning.

Tasks are contextualised activities in which students are required to draw together a range of elements in their framework of knowledge and skills to convey meaning and achieve the desired outcomes. They are characterised by an emphasis on active participation, flexible differentiation and purposeful communication among the participants through a variety of modes and media. Every English learning task should have the following five features:

A task should have a purpose and involve students in using English to achieve the various purposes set out in the learning targets and objectives (see Chapter 2 of this Guide for details).   
A task should have a context from which the purpose for using English emerges. A task should involve students in a mode of thinking and doing.   
A task should have a process which requires students to draw upon their framework of knowledge and skills.   
A task should engage students in carrying out a purposeful activity leading towards a product.

Language learning tasks could be designed to help students develop the capabilities for learning. They provide opportunities for students to connect and apply the knowledge and skills acquired purposefully in authentic contexts so as to achieve deep learning. An effective English task which contributes to deep learning should embody the following characteristics:

It involves communicative language use in which students’ attention is focused on meaning as well as linguistic structures.   
It is authentic and close to the real world and daily life experience of students. The texts (including oral, written and multimodal) which students generate through creating and using new knowledge and the data required to be handled are often authentic and relevant. It involves various contextualised activities which equip students with the skills and attributes necessary for the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century (e.g. holistic thinking skills, information literacy, global awareness), and which provide opportunities for students to take the initiative to learn, negotiate meaning and make choices in what, when and how to learn.   
It provides language learning opportunities for students to manipulate and practise specific language forms, develop language skills, practise the integrative use of language, apply language development strategies and use language meaningfully and creatively.   
It is easily adapted to suit students of different abilities.   
It involves the effective use of information technology to facilitate self-directed learning and address the different needs of students.

# Modules, units and tasks

The concept of modules, units and tasks is recommended for organising the learning and teaching of the English Language Education curriculum. A module is an organising focus which can be broken down into units and tasks that are thematically or conceptually related. These themes and concepts are explored through tasks and help students make connections between their learning experiences. Extended tasks and projects can be developed from tasks to help students develop further knowledge and skills.

The following diagram shows how units and tasks can be developed and organised under the module “Cultures of the World” (one of the modules suggested for students at the secondary level), and the relationship among tasks, extended tasks and projects:

![](img/30cd527f9909f15a88928d5648b2004e459d21668f194301672bca51abe94b7b.jpg)

For a full list of the suggested modules and units for KS1 – 4, see Appendix 11. Through using or adapting a variety of resources and authentic materials, teachers may develop modules of their own to suit the needs, interests and abilities of their particular group of students.

For illustration of how to promote English language learning through the task-based approach, see Examples 4, 18, 20, and 28.

# Student-centred Instruction

Students learn most effectively when teachers treat them and their learning as the focus of attention. Student-centred instruction may be provided through:

designing learning activities that cater for students’ age, needs, interests, abilities,   
learning experiences and learning styles;   
engaging students in group work or pair work for genuine communication;   
applying suitable questioning techniques to stimulate thinking, encourage   
experimentation and facilitate knowledge construction; and   
encouraging students to contribute to the learning process by: sharing their views and learning experiences; playing an active role in consulting the teacher; and negotiating with the teacher on the learning objectives and assessment criteria, helping select learning materials, and choosing appropriate activities such as role plays, games, debates and projects.

# Integrative and Creative Language Use

Language use in real-life situations is almost always integrative and creative. Such important characteristics of authentic language use should be stressed in the English Language Education KLA. In this regard, the use of tasks or projects is encouraged to facilitate the integrative and creative use of an extensive range of language knowledge, skills and strategies. In the learning process, teachers are advised to:

develop students’ information literacy skills by providing them with opportunities to search for and manage information, and design tasks for the integrative use of the language with the information collected;   
stimulate students’ imagination, sharpen their aesthetic sensitivity, provide opportunities for the development of generic skills and positive values and attitudes, promote the sharing of experiences, and foster intercultural awareness and understanding; and encourage students to use English creatively to respond and give expression to real and imaginative experiences.

Examples 6 and 16 show how teachers can promote critical thinking and creativity through the use of language arts at secondary and primary levels respectively.

# Learning and Teaching Grammar in Context

Grammar is a means to an end rather than a body of knowledge to be learnt for its own sake. Grammar is best learnt in meaningful contexts, where students are exposed to authentic language use and can make connections between language forms and functions. The task-based approach to English language learning readily lends itself to the learning and teaching of grammar as it provides a context and purpose for engaging students in a task which requires the effective use of the language for its completion. Through learning and teaching grammar in context, students can gain a better understanding of how, why and when to use particular language items and structures.

Task-based grammar learning can take place in the following stages:

Pre-task: Before the task, the teacher identifies the language items and structures needed for completing the task and considers the language support required by students.The teacher then engages students in exercises or activities to help them understand and practise the forms and functions of the target language items and structures.   
While-task: During the task, students apply their grammar knowledge in an authentic context that involves meaningful use of the target language items and structures to complete the task. Students are guided to evaluate their own learning and reflect on how grammar makes meaning in the process.   
Post-task: Extended tasks or projects which provide new contexts for the use of the language items and structures previously learnt can be provided for further application and consolidation purposes. Concepts about the use of the target language items and structures are clarified and reinforced.

Examples 17 and 18 show how grammar can be effectively taught using the task-based approach.

# 4.2.4 Learning and Teaching of Text Grammar

The task-based approach engages students in interacting and communicating in the target language with their attention principally focusing on its meaningful use rather than the language form. Tasks, which often involve the use of different types of texts (e.g. information, persuasive, literary, imaginative), provide opportunities for the learning and teaching of text grammar, which enables students to see how the choice of language items is affected by the context and how it shapes the tone, style and register of a text. Knowledge of text grammar also enables students to understand the organisation and structure of texts. In extending grammar learning from the sentence level to the text level, teachers can guide students to note the forms and functions of the target language items through exploring the salient grammar features (e.g. imperatives, passive voice, relative clauses) of a text and making hypotheses about the communicative functions they perform in awareness raising activities such as text comparison and guided discovery activities.

For the learning and teaching of text grammar, teachers are encouraged to select a variety of text types (e.g. advertisements, biographies, manuals, speeches), themes and content so that students can better understand the features associated with a particular text type and apply the knowledge acquired in writing and creating relevant texts.

# 4.2.5 Adopting e-Learning in the English Language Education Classroom

e-Learning refers to an open and flexible learning mode involving the use of the electronic media, including the use of digital resources and communication tools to achieve the learning objectives. In the context of the English Language Education KLA, e-learning not only fosters purposeful communication and interaction among students and between students and teachers, but also contributes to effective learning and teaching. The following examples illustrate how e-learning can be integrated into the English Language Education classroom:

# Strengthening Interaction and Motivation with the Use of e-Platforms

To encourage more interaction, teachers can upload a discussion topic to an e-platform set up exclusively for a particular group of students. Students can be invited to express their ideas on the topic and leave messages in response to the comments made by others. Interaction among students and between teachers and students is no longer confined to the classroom as students can communicate with their teachers and one another without geographical or time constraints.

The use of e-platforms also enhances students’ motivation in using English for communication. Students can be required to submit their work which can be written, oral or multimodal, by uploading it to the platform. Realising that their work will be shared with and/or evaluated by their peers, students are more likely to exercise extra caution, which provides a drive for them to try their best in completing the task. For suggestions on effective use of e-platforms, see Examples 12 and 13.

# Making Effective Use of Lesson Time with the “Flipped Classroom” Strategy

To prepare students for a writing lesson, teachers can select or record a short video clip about the language features of the text type concerned, and upload it to an e-platform for students to watch prior to the lesson. The video clip can include an illustration of the text structure, the related language items and their communicative functions. During the lesson, teachers can check students’ understanding of the language and text features, clarify their misconception and conduct more cognitively demanding activities such as an in-depth analysis of the text to further enhance students’ understanding of the various features. The use of the “Flipped Classroom” strategy can promote self-directed learning, cater for the needs of students with different proficiency levels and facilitate effective use of lesson time. Students watch the assigned video clip at their own pace in their own time while teachers make good use of the lesson time by engaging students in activities that generate quality interaction and/or require higher-order thinking skills.

For more information about using e-learning for enhancing student learning, see Chapter 3D of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 6D of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I - \delta )$ (2017).

# 4.2.6 Learner Independence

To enable students to become motivated and independent language learners, teachers should promote self-directed learning. This mode of learning has the benefit of helping students develop the essential skills, strategies and attitudes for lifelong learning. To facilitate self-directed language learning, teachers are encouraged to:

create opportunities for students to make choices or decisions in their learning by providing a wide range of interesting and creative texts (e.g. literary, information and multimodal texts), learning materials (e.g. radio programmes, videos) and activities (e.g. drama, debates, projects) to explore their interests;

help students set realistic learning goals;   
enable students to monitor, review and assess their own performance by building selfand peer assessment procedures into the learning materials and activities (e.g. answer keys, evaluation checklists, success criteria);   
help students improve their work through providing constructive feedback; develop language learning tasks or activities that encourage students to make meaningful use of the self-access corner or centre in school;   
guide students to develop learning to learn capabilities through the use of e-resources such as online dictionaries, thesauri and concordancers; and   
help students develop enabling skills such as phonics skills and vocabulary building skills.

Example 3 provides suggestions on how learner independence can be promoted through developing primary students’ phonics skills and vocabulary building skills using shared reading and various follow-up learning activities. Example 19 illustrates how secondary students’ writing skills can be enhanced through self-directed learning. For more information about enhancing self-directed learning, see Chapter 4 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 3 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I - \delta )$ (2017).

# 4.2.7 Meaningful Homework

Homework is an important component of the learning and teaching process. It allows students to extend learning outside lesson time. Meaningful English homework should help monitor students’ progress towards the learning targets and objectives set out in the teaching schedule, consolidate students’ learning and extend their understanding of language use, and enable teachers to identify students’ strengths and weaknesses so that they can adjust their teaching strategies and provide timely feedback. Due consideration should also be given to the quality, quantity and variety of homework. Meaningful tasks or activities, instead of mechanical drills, should be assigned to provide language practice.

Appropriate use of IT is encouraged to add variety and motivate students to learn English. For example, while working on the unit on “Travelling and Visiting” in the English lessons, in addition to practising the appropriate use of tenses and vocabulary to introduce different activities in a travel blog, students can be asked to enliven their work by adding digital images, videos, sounds and music on their own or in groups to deepen their understanding of how to create an effective text to convey the intended messages. Teachers can then provide feedback on their work, invite students’ comments and generate discussion on an e-platform (see Example 20 for details).

For Literature in English, teachers can adopt the “Flipped Classroom” strategy and ask students to watch a video about the use of sounds in poems at home to prepare themselves well for more demanding work during lessons on poem analysis.

Further guidelines on how to make use of homework to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness are provided in Chapter 8 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I \ - \ 6 )$ (2014) and Booklet 4 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I \mathrm { ~ - ~ } \delta )$ (2017). Schools should also refer to the Education Bureau circular on “Guidelines on Homework and Tests”, formulate the school homework policy, and allow space and time for students to participate in meaningful social and extra-curricular activities conducive to whole-person development.

# 4.3 Embracing Learner Diversity

Every class is made up of individuals who are different in terms of motivation, learning styles, preferences, needs, interests and abilities. Teachers can cater for learner diversity through effective curriculum planning and appropriate learning, teaching and assessment strategies.

# 4.3.1 Curriculum Planning

The curriculum can be appropriately adapted by trimming learning content and materials, making additions or a combination of both to suit students of different needs, interests, abilities and learning styles.   
The concept of modules, units and tasks can be adopted to organise learning and teaching to accommodate the needs of different students of the same year level or the same class. For the more able students, learning modules can be developed with challenging units and tasks that aim at expanding and enriching their learning experiences; whereas for the less able ones, learning modules should be designed with the inclusion of units and tasks that aim at helping them overcome their weaknesses in language learning and make progress (e.g. practising particular language forms).

Effective strategies should be devised to support the development of the less able students and to maximise the potential of the more able ones in learning English, for example, by:

creating enhancement or enrichment activities such as storytelling competitions and creative writing workshops for both the more able and the less able students; devising remedial and intervention programmes to help the less able students catch up with school work; and   
incorporating e-learning to address the learning needs of students with diverse abilities and learning styles, engage students in active and self-paced learning and create more opportunities for co-operative learning.

# 4.3.2 Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies

Learning and teaching strategies which could be adopted by teachers to cater for learner diversity include:

employing a variety of strategies to enhance interactive learning (e.g. drawing upon students’ existing knowledge to construct concept maps with the class, giving timely feedback, using IT);   
making use of graded learning tasks and exercises;   
providing students with the same tasks and exercises, but   
varying the expected output of different students; or   
varying the amount and style of teacher input and support to provide extra help for the less able students and challenge the more able ones;   
making use of open-ended tasks;   
selecting, adopting and adapting appropriate texts that incorporate different modes of representation, providing multisensory learning experiences to cater for students’ diverse learning styles and preferences;   
breaking tasks into small steps to facilitate understanding and sequencing the steps in the tasks;   
providing different support in learning tasks for students with different learning styles (e.g. visual cues for visual learners, verbal cues for verbal learners);   
connecting the design of learning materials to students’ life experiences to sustain their motivation and attention;   
making use of flexible grouping according to the nature and purpose of the tasks (e.g. grouping students of similar abilities together to make it less intimidating to the less able students, arranging a more able student to be seated next to a less able one to offer help when necessary); and

engaging students in active and self-directed learning through the use of IT (e.g. e-platforms, “Flipped Classroom” strategy) to enhance learner autonomy and allow students to learn at their own pace.

Standardised assessment, to a certain extent, may have its limitations if students’ abilities are diverse. To ensure that students are appropriately assessed so that they can demonstrate their learning progress and achievements, teachers should adopt different assessment practices giving consideration to the content, modes of assessment and their expectations of students. Teachers are encouraged to:

promote formative assessment to provide effective and timely feedback, both formal and informal;   
adopt different modes of assessment (e.g. short assignments, assessment tasks, projects, questioning) to address the needs of students, identify the strengths and weaknesses of students and decide on the appropriate content, and learning and teaching strategies;   
help students develop the necessary skills to assess and monitor their own learning through self-assessment so as to enable them to learn better;   
promote peer assessment through which students can develop a better understanding of the learning objectives and assessment criteria, and what is expected of them; and use e-assessment such as the Student Assessment Repository (STAR) platform accessible at https://star.hkedcity.net/en/ to help identify students’ strengths and weaknesses and facilitate analysis of their performance.

For further ideas about how to meet the diverse needs of students in the English classroom at the primary and secondary levels, see Examples 21, 22 and 23.

# 4.3.3 Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in the Mainstream English Language Education Classroom

There is an increasing concern about the special educational needs (SEN) of some students and how to support them in the mainstream English Language Education classroom. There are eight types of SEN: Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD), Intellectual Disability (ID), Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Physical Disability (PD), Visual Impairment (VI), Hearing Impairment (HI) and Speech and Language Impairment (SLI) (for detailed information regarding each type of SEN and the respective intervention strategies, see the Operation Guide on the Whole School Approach to Integrated Education (EDB, 2010)). Teachers should understand that students with SEN can be different in their abilities and may require different types and levels of individualised support based on their specific needs.

In addition to the strategies suggested in Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.3 of this Guide, teachers of English Language Education can also consider the following to address the needs of students with SEN in learning, teaching and assessment:

Providing clear instructions for students by:

introducing tasks with a clear and simple organising framework (e.g. diagram, chart, preview and a one-paragraph overview) and setting goals at the beginning of the tasks;   
giving emphasis on important information verbally (e.g. paraphrasing, repeating the information, using questions) and non-verbally (e.g. using gestures, symbols, colours); and   
speaking clearly, naturally and at a normal pace, and without unnecessary pauses between words.

Helping students in writing through:

providing manipulatives such as plastic/ceramic letter tiles and word cards to select from to express their ideas;   
providing planning and writing frameworks for them to follow;   
reducing assignments that require too much copying;   
encouraging shared note-taking among students; and   
allowing students to submit audio or video recording of their assignments occasionally.

Helping students in reading through:

raising students’ phonological awareness for better understanding of the letter-sound relationships;   
providing visual aids to facilitate easier and better reading (e.g. separating words with a marker, using colour-coding for highlighting key points, using larger font sizes, providing pictures, videos, graphic organisers to help students “visualise” what is being read);   
using suitable adaptive devices such as screen magnifiers and reading machines to help students with visual problems participate in learning activities more easily;   
limiting the number of new ideas from a text in each lesson;

guiding students to summarise what has been read, ask questions and make predictions during the reading process; and assigning a student to read the text aloud to the student in need.

Adjusting assessment arrangements through:

making flexible assessment arrangements to ensure students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their learning progress and achievements, which may involve the provision of aids, support and prompts, special design for the format of question papers and answer sheets, and adjustment of the length of examination time and breaks; and   
giving simple, direct and clear assessment instructions with examples, and including diagrams and signs which are familiar to students in the assessment papers to help them identify the various parts of the papers and understand the questions and the procedure of assessment.

For further ideas on how to address the needs of SEN students, see Example 24.

# 4.3.4 Maximising the Potential of Gifted Students in the Mainstream English Language Education Classroom

Students who are gifted in English are often seen to have an intense and sustained interest in language learning. They also demonstrate a heightened awareness of language features, and can recognise grammar patterns and writing styles easily. While teachers are usually able to identify gifted students, they are often confronted with the demands of providing appropriate learning opportunities to match these students’ exceptional abilities. The following strategies can be considered to facilitate gifted students’ effective mastery of more advanced skills and knowledge in the learning of English Language and Literature in English:

Allowing flexibility with the school English Language Education curriculum to   
address differences in the rate, depth and pace of learning through: implementing a multi-level curriculum that facilitates a more complete and in-depth study of topics and themes at students’ own pace and according to their language abilities; developing a curriculum that encourages thinking, enquiry and self-reflection; sourcing learning resources that provide input for designing learning tasks with increased task demand and text complexity to stretch gifted students’ potential; incorporating into the curriculum language learning tasks that involve more advanced and in-depth questions and more complex requirements; and

developing tiered assignments with more challenging questions and demanding learning activities on the same content.

Promoting creativity and original thinking through:

equipping students with strategies to generate new ideas, reorganise knowledge, seek alternatives purposely, and evaluate ideas and solutions;   
encouraging students to identify problems instead of always providing them with problems and solutions;   
giving autonomy to students by allowing them to decide on how to present their products/work;   
encouraging transforming existing knowledge or input into new forms by allowing students to use different modes of representation; and   
displaying/publishing creative work to create an environment that values originality.

Encouraging students to pursue independent projects or study based on their interests and abilities through:

providing opportunities for enquiry of more complex and abstract concepts to enhance students’ development of problem solving and research skills, as well as their language abilities to engage in what they read in greater depth and to produce ideas critically and creatively; encouraging cross-curricular projects or projects that require products or solutions that focus on complex real-world issues to elevate learning; and guiding students to conduct independent studies to pursue areas or topics of their personal interest through coaching them to decide on a focus, develop a plan of action and follow it through and monitor the process.

Empowering students to assume ownership of their learning through:

guiding students to set individual goals that are specific, measurable, ambitious yet realistic, and choose appropriate learning strategies and achieve the goals within a reasonable time frame; and   
developing students’ language learning strategies and metacognitive skills to facilitate independent learning and self-reflection.

For further ideas on how to cater for the needs of gifted students, see Example 21.

# Chapter 5 Assessment

This chapter highlights the guiding principles of assessment, describes different modes of assessment and provides suggestions on how to develop an assessment policy and conduct assessment in schools to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness and promote self-directed learning. It should be read in conjunction with Chapter 5 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 4 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I \mathrm { ~ - ~ } \delta )$ (2017), which give further details about the ideas and principles underlying assessment.

# 5.1 Guiding Principles

Assessment is the practice of collecting and interpreting information about student learning. It is an integral part of the learning, teaching and assessment cycle. Assessment should be aligned with learning and teaching and guided by the following principles:

It should serve a variety of purposes, from measuring attainment to informing learning and teaching through providing quality feedback, but the prime purpose should always be facilitating and improving student learning.   
It should involve making considered judgements on the learning processes and outcomes.   
It should be based on standards or criterion-referencing principles by which student performance is evaluated and described in relation to criteria rather than how other students perform. The assessment criteria should also be made clear to students so that they understand what is expected of them.   
There should be an appropriate coverage of learning targets and objectives, generic skills, and positive values and attitudes.   
There should be diversified modes of assessment, with a balance between formative and summative assessments.

# 5.2 Formative and Summative Assessments

In the context of the English Language Education curriculum, assessment serves the principal aim of promoting learning by providing information about students’ achievements in relation to the learning targets and objectives, thereby helping students, teachers and parents understand students’ progress and enabling them to plan for further improvement. To match the learning targets, objectives and outcomes, different modes of assessment serving formative and/or summative purposes are encouraged in the English Language Education curriculum.

As shown in the diagram on the next page, formative and summative assessments are two common school assessment practices. Formative assessment focuses on the ongoing evaluation of students’ performance and abilities. It is often informal and carried out during the learning process. Formative assessment, which typically involves close attention to small “chunks” of learning, may take place on a daily basis. The main aim of formative assessment is to improve learning and teaching through:

diagnosing students’ strengths and learning problems or difficulties;   
providing quick guidance, quality feedback, timely support and enrichment for students; and   
reviewing and improving teaching plans and strategies.

Summative assessment focuses on determining progress in learning and evaluating student performance and abilities. It is normally undertaken at the end of a period of instruction (e.g. end of a school term, a school year or a key stage of schooling) and reviews much larger “chunks” of learning. Its main purposes are to:

provide a comprehensive summary of students’ learning achievements during the period and their performance at that particular point of time; and help teachers check whether the major aspects of the learning targets and objectives have been achieved.

Summative assessment is closely related to “assessment of learning”, while formative assessment comprises “assessment for learning” and “assessment as learning”. The table below explains the three complementary assessment concepts, their relationship and the different purposes they serve.

<html><body><table><tr><td>sunnmnne</td><td>Assessment of Learning (AoL)</td><td>AoL describes the level students have attained in learning and shows what they know and can do over a period of time.

Building on their existing strengths, schools are encouraged to extend formative assessment from “assessment for learning” to “assessment as learning”, which empowers students to reflect on their own learning and develop their habit of mind and skills to monitor and evaluate their own progress. Teachers are also advised to adopt more diversified modes of assessment and make the best use of assessment data to inform learning and teaching.

# 5.2.1 Promoting Formative Assessment in the School English Language Education Curriculum

There are good educational reasons why formative assessment should be given more attention and accorded a higher status than summative assessment, on which schools tended to place a greater emphasis in the past.

There is research evidence on the beneficial effects of formative assessment when used for refining instructional decision-making in teaching and generating feedback to improve learning. For this reason, the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) report Learning to Learn — The Way Forward in Curriculum Development (CDC, 2001) recommends that there should be a change in assessment practices, with schools placing due emphasis on formative assessment and making it an integral part of classroom teaching.

Various tools have been developed by the Education Bureau (EDB) to support schools in implementing AfL. These include the Learning Progression Framework (LPF) and the Student Assessment Repository (STAR) for English Language. These tools provide concrete descriptions of students’ attainment and useful statistical data, enabling teachers to guide students to understand and monitor their own learning performance, identify areas of strengths and weaknesses, and to draw up plans for progressing to the next level of achievement.

The LPF at http://www.edb.gov.hk/LPFenglish provides a common scale and language for teachers to describe students’ performance and progress in English Language learning. It consists of different levels of learning outcomes (LOs) and descriptors about the growth of students on a continuum as they work towards the learning targets and objectives set out in the English Language curriculum. The continuum is divided into eight attainment milestones (ATMs) for each of the four language skills (i.e. listening, speaking, reading and writing) from the basic level (ATM 1) to the advanced level (ATM 8). While the ATMs are expressed in the form of outcome statements, which give general descriptions of students’ performance, pointers are specific examples of what students are able to do in demonstrating the LOs, which support the outcome statements. It should be noted that the pointers are meant to elucidate the LOs. They are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, and must not be regarded as a checklist for English language development. As these ATMs can provide a clear focus and direction for learning, teaching and assessment throughout primary and secondary education, schools are encouraged to make reference to the LPF when they plan and review the school English Language curriculum and assessment, instead of relying solely on the Basic Competency Descriptors for the Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which represent only part of the essential knowledge and skills to be acquired by students in relation to the learning targets and objectives for KS1 – 3.

The STAR is an online assessment platform developed by the EDB to enhance teachers’ assessment literacy and improve students’ learning by means of technology. The STAR platform provides a range of assessment items and online assessment data such as reports and qualitative descriptions about students’ performance to help schools understand students’ attainment and plan remediation and progression.

Formative assessment involves collecting evidence of student learning (e.g. through classroom observations, class activities, homework, quizzes), providing feedback and devising follow-up measures to promote better learning. However, formative assessment does not need to be conducted by teachers only. Students can also play an important role in it. To this end, peer review or evaluation, which is a valuable form of formative assessment, is encouraged as it enhances interaction and collaboration among students and enables them to understand each other’s points of view. Schools are also encouraged to extend AfL to AaL to allow greater involvement of students in the learning, teaching and assessment process. AaL can be promoted at an early stage of schooling. Opportunities should be provided to develop young students’ learning strategies (e.g. phonics skills, information skills, vocabulary building strategies) and awareness to reflect on their own learning through the use of appropriate guiding questions and teachers’ demonstration. Later on, students should be encouraged to set personalised learning goals, formulate plans to attain them, and monitor their own learning performance and strategies. When students engage in this ongoing metacognitive experience, they will develop a habit of mind to continually review their learning progress and make improvement. In this way, students gradually take ownership of, and responsibility for, their own learning. Example 25 illustrates how AaL can be practised to develop students’ reflection strategies and enhance their writing skills.

# 5.2.2 Different Modes of Formative Assessment

The following are some common modes of formative assessment which teachers are encouraged to use flexibly according to the school culture or policy, and the current educational context and practice. In addition to language knowledge and skills, other learning targets such as generic skills and values and attitudes should also be taken into consideration in formative assessment.

# Learning Tasks and Activities

When carrying out well-designed learning tasks and activities, students demonstrate their progress towards the learning targets. Such tasks may include games, quizzes and oral presentations, which are commonly used in the learning and teaching process. Evidence of learning collected should form the basis of feedback to promote further learning. It is not always necessary to record students’ performance formally.

# Performance Tasks

Instead of setting tests which consist mainly of discrete items to assess students’ learning, performance tasks can be provided for students to demonstrate their learning and understanding of the target language items learnt. These tasks entail the application of language knowledge for a communicative purpose specific to a given context, and are set on the basis of specific performance criteria. The products can take a variety of forms, be it linguistic (e.g. designing a poster, acting out a story, producing a radio drama, doing a role play, carrying out an interview and survey, conducting a debate in class, producing a short video clip) or non-linguistic (e.g. making origami based on oral instructions, drawing the setting for a story, making a dish following a recipe, producing charts and graphs to present survey findings). Performance tasks are particularly suitable for young learners who may not be too advanced in writing skills development. They allow students to demonstrate learning and apply knowledge and skills in hands-on activities or authentic situations, which adds an experiential element to the learning and assessment process.

Performance tasks have a strong formative component and allow teachers to provide quality feedback to students throughout the process. To maximise students’ learning through the assessment, the success criteria for the final product can be shared with students before the assessment. This would not only deepen their understanding of the task requirements but also facilitate peer and self-assessment.

# Projects

Teachers should assess the process as well as the product when assessing students’ performance in project work. They can use a variety of means such as observation, conferencing and monitoring the process of students’ writing. Continuous feedback should be given with the aim of stimulating students’ critical reflection and helping them improve their learning. Areas to be considered in assessing projects include:

content (e.g. relevance of ideas, coverage of topic);   
organisation (e.g. logical development of ideas, connection of ideas);   
language use (e.g. appropriateness, fluency, style, accuracy);   
generic skills (e.g. communication, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving); and   
attitudes (e.g. confidence in using English, keenness to participate in activities, respect for others, an awareness of the potential influence of language use on others’ feelings).

# Portfolios

A portfolio is a purposeful collection of a student’s work (e.g. samples of writing, recordings of speeches) that demonstrates progress in the development of knowledge, skills, and values and attitudes in a given area over a period of time. Guidelines for setting and assessing portfolios are provided in Appendix 13. Examples of two common types of portfolios for secondary students, i.e. theme-based portfolio and learning reflection portfolio are provided in Appendices 14 and 15 respectively.

# Process Writing

Well thought-out writing involves a process consisting of the recursive stages of planning (i.e. brainstorming, researching, outlining), drafting (i.e. writing, rewriting, revising) and finalising (i.e. editing). At appropriate stages of the writing process, teachers can give feedback on students’ drafts. With adequate preparation, students can also be asked to provide feedback on the drafts of each other and of their own. Based on the feedback, students can improve their drafts with suitable revisions. Initial feedback can focus on global concerns, i.e. on ideas, organisation and text type conventions. Thereafter, feedback can be given on local concerns, i.e. on language (including grammar and mechanics) and style.

Examples of feedback sheets for use at the secondary level are provided in Appendix 16. Teachers are encouraged to develop and use their own feedback sheets or guidelines with the appropriate criteria to suit the purposes of their writing activities and the needs of the students.

# $\pmb { e }$ -Assessment Tasks and e-Portfolios

e-Assessment tasks and e-portfolios are powerful tools for teachers to cater for learner diversity, provide timely feedback and promote AfL. e-Assessment tasks can be distributed, completed and marked automatically and administered electronically using the Internet or the local workstations. Some e-assessment platforms are equipped with an adaptive function, which can match items to students’ ability levels, and provide instant feedback so that students can have more active involvement in monitoring their own learning. e-Portfolios allow students to store, manage and showcase their work, which can be in the form of texts, images, and audio or multimedia files. They are both demonstrations of students’ abilities and platforms for self-expression, and can be regarded as a type of learning record that facilitates students’ reflection on their own learning.

Teachers are encouraged to make flexible use of e-assessment platforms, such as the following websites developed by the EDB and HKEdCity, to facilitate AfL and AaL:

# 5.2.3 Learning and Teaching Processes for Effective Formative Assessment

The following are some learning and teaching processes that facilitate effective use of the different modes of formative assessment outlined above:

# Observation

By observing students’ body language, their facial expressions, how they use language in class, how they respond to learning tasks and how they interact during group work, teachers can gain insights into students’ affective, linguistic and cognitive development as well as their attitude towards language learning.

# Effective Questioning

Through apt use of wait-time, cues, and a variety of question types (e.g. open and closed questions, content-centred questions, higher-order thinking questions, student-centred questions that prompt students to relate learning to their own experience), teachers can gather information about students’ performance in the development of language and generic skills as well as their values and attitudes towards specific topics or learning in general.

# Effective Feedback

To promote learning, students need to be informed not only about their performance but also how to build on their strengths and address their weaknesses to make further improvement. Much of this information will come as feedback from teachers but some will be through students’ direct involvement in assessing each other’s, or their own work. Effective feedback that is timely and specific enables students to understand where they are in their learning and what they should do next. It aligns with the assessment criteria and the learning objectives and helps promote self-reflection and the development of metacognitive skills essential to AaL.

One efficient and effective means of gathering and disseminating feedback for students is the use of feedback sheets (or checklists) for the various formative assessment tasks or activities. Examples of feedback sheets for common types of formative assessment are provided in Appendix 17. Please also see Chapter 5 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014), and Booklet 4 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I \mathrm { ~ - ~ } \delta )$ (2017) and the AfL website at: http://www.edb.gov.hk/afl_en for more information and examples on the topic.

# Peer and Self-assessment as Learning Activities

In addition to giving feedback, teachers are advised to provide opportunities for peer assessment and self-assessment. Peer assessment enables students to learn among themselves and encourages interaction while self-assessment promotes reflective thinking, which is vital for developing students’ capacity for lifelong and self-directed learning. Meaningful peer and self-assessment does not mean the mere provision of assessment forms for students to evaluate themselves or their peers. Instead, teachers are advised to guide students throughout the assessment process, discuss or negotiate with them the success criteria, provide sample work for discussion or illustration of the expected standards, and explicitly introduce metacognitive strategies (e.g. goal setting, the use of reflection tools such as K-W-L charts) that enhance the depth and quality of students’ self-reflection. Examples of self-assessment forms that encourage students’ self-reflection and enhance their metacognitive skills are provided in Appendices 18 and 19.

# Conferencing

Conferencing is generally held for the purpose of giving feedback and opening up communication between the teacher and students. Effective conferencing is focused and has specific achievable goals (e.g. revising a letter to better connect with the intended reader, discussing progress on a particular task or project).

During conferencing, teachers ask open-ended questions that encourage discussion and give students ample opportunity to ask questions and bring up issues. It is necessary to create a trusting atmosphere to facilitate effective conferencing. Teachers may contribute in a variety of ways (e.g. discussing problem-solving or time management techniques, modelling a revision or editing technique, offering feedback on ideas and language use), depending on the conference goals and the individual needs of students. Before ending the conference, it is important to summarise what has been covered and set plans for follow-up action.

For illustration of how teachers can make use of formative assessment to promote learning, see Examples 26, 27 and 28.

# 5.2.4 Implementation and Design of Summative Assessment

Teachers are encouraged to use assessment tasks to evaluate students’ performance against the learning targets. The design of summative assessment tasks for English Language and Literature in English is basically the same as that of learning tasks. However, in learning tasks, teachers need to conduct appropriate pre-task, while-task and post-task activities to engage students in constructing knowledge actively and progressively, as well as to provide appropriate support and scaffolding to facilitate students’ successful completion of the tasks, whereas in summative assessment tasks, students are often required to carry out the tasks independently so that teachers can assess their achievement.

When designing internal summative assessment tasks or papers, teachers should take into consideration the following:

There is an appropriate, balanced and adequate coverage of the learning targets and objectives. Summative assessment can comprise a number of tasks or activities that cover the major aspects of learning and teaching over a period of time. It should not focus mainly on specific language forms and features. Students’ knowledge and mastery of such language forms and features can be assessed through short quizzes or daily activities. The scope and level of difficulty of assessment items, tasks or papers suit the abilities and needs of students. Students should be given opportunities to attempt questions which vary in terms of linguistic and cognitive demands so that they can be reasonably challenged and progress along the developmental continuum.

Internal summative assessment is NOT confined to a pen-and-paper test only. Different assessment modes (e.g. reading aloud, discussion, individual presentation, performance task) should be adopted to promote the attainment of various learning outcomes (e.g. language knowledge, generic and subject-specific skills), and to allow students of varied abilities, interests and learning styles to demonstrate their achievements.   
The rubrics are clear, concise and correct. The choice of words is appropriate to students’ ability as well as the level of difficulty of the tasks.   
Task-specific criteria and marking schemes are agreed upon by teachers of the same level when deciding the extent to which the learning targets and objectives can be achieved. This in turn forms a solid basis for the diagnostic use of data gathered from internal assessments to inform learning and teaching.   
Due acknowledgement is given to fluency and effective expression of ideas in students’ performance in addition to accuracy.   
For the English Language subject, the design of the assessment tasks or activities stresses the importance of purposeful use of English for communication in meaningful contexts, the integrated use of the four language skills, and a balance of learning experiences in the Interpersonal, Knowledge and Experience Strands. Assessment tasks should be contextualised, related to students’ experience and wellconnected between parts to make the assessment an engaging learning experience for students. Open-ended questions, which can stimulate thinking and facilitate students’ integrative and creative use of language, can be included.

Examples of summative assessment tasks at the primary and secondary levels are provided in Appendices 20 and 21.

# 5.3 Internal and Public Assessments

Internal assessment refers to the assessment practices adopted in schools to track and evaluate student learning and it can be summative or formative in nature. In contrast, public assessment refers to the standardised assessment conducted territory-wide for all schools after a period of schooling. While internal and public assessments serve to complement each other, the purpose of internal assessment is not confined to preparing students for public assessments. Internal assessment should cover a wider range of learning outcomes and objectives and reflect students’ achievements in areas not easily assessed in public assessments (e.g. their learning attitudes).

# 5.3.1 Internal Assessment

A well-devised internal assessment policy enables teachers to:

review and monitor the progress of student learning;   
modify and improve teaching strategies for the needs and interests of students; and ascertain that the curriculum goals are achieved.

In formulating the internal assessment policy, due emphasis should be placed on formative assessment to make AfL and AaL an integral part of learning and teaching in the classroom.

The range of assessment tasks covered in Section 5.2.2 Different Modes of Formative Assessment (e.g. projects, portfolios, process writing) as well as summative assessment tasks designed along the principles stated in Section 5.2.4 Implementation and Design of Summative Assessment could be adopted as internal assessment to promote the attainment of the learning outcomes in English Language and Literature in English.

In addition to informing learning and teaching, data from internal assessment also provide evidence to facilitate communication with different stakeholders regarding students’ performance. As schools are encouraged to make use of both formative and summative assessments to gain a comprehensive picture of students’ performance and abilities, there is a need to ensure that the reporting system reflects students’ achievements in both. Schools are encouraged to reduce reliance on grades and marks in the reporting system and provide more qualitative and informative feedback to help students and parents understand the students’ learning performance, including their level of mastery of language knowledge, generic and subject-specific skills, as well as their learning attitudes.

Schools might consider using the LPF for English Language to develop a set of school-based criteria or descriptors that helps students understand their performance in assessment tasks or activities and engage in self-reflection and planning for improvement. Parents having been guided to use such information will have a better picture of how their children are progressing towards the intended learning outcomes, what their children’s strengths and weaknesses are, and where assistance is necessary. This will provide a firm foundation for home-school cooperation.

# 5.3.2 Public Assessment

In addition to internal assessment, students are required to take various public assessments at different key stages of learning for different purposes. Below are some examples:

# Pre-Secondary One Hong Kong Attainment Test (Pre-S1 HKAT) for English Language

The Pre-S1 HKAT facilitates the assessment of the performance of Secondary One (S1) entrants in English Language so that appropriate support measures could be designed. The sampled results of the Pre-S1 HKAT are also used as the scaling tool in the revised Secondary School Places Allocation (SSPA) System to scale the internal assessment results of the coming cohort of Primary 6 students proceeding to S1.

# Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA) for English Language

The TSA is a territory-wide assessment administered at P3, P6 (implemented in oddnumbered years since 2012) and S3. It facilitates AfL by providing schools with objective data on students’ overall performance in English Language at the end of KS1 – 3. The TSA reports and school reports provide information about students’ strengths and weaknesses against specific Basic Competencies. They help schools and teachers review their teaching strategies and curriculum plans in supporting student learning between key stages or year levels. The territory-wide data also help the Government review policies and provide focused support to schools. More information of the assessment can be accessed at: http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/sa_tsa/ tsa/.

# Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examinations for English Language and Literature in English

Upon completion of the six-year secondary education, students will take the HKDSE Examinations, which aim to measure their levels of attainment in a particular subject. The public assessment for English Language encompasses the four skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking and also includes the School-based Assessment component, which aims to encourage extensive reading and viewing. The public assessment for Literature in English centres on the comprehension and appreciation of literary texts and the ability to write essays based on the set texts. It also includes a Portfolio (until 2018)/School-based Assessment (from 2019 onwards) component, which aims to encourage independent literary enquiry. Schools may refer to the live examination papers regarding the format of the examination and the standards at which the questions are pitched. Details of the assessment design and framework are available at: http:// www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/hkdse/assessment/assessment_framework/.

Schools should be aware of the fact that public assessments are designed to assess students’ performance at the end of a particular key stage. It is therefore not advisable to drill junior form students prematurely for public assessments. Such an undesirable practice will also reduce learning and teaching time in class, increase teachers’ workload unnecessarily and put undue pressure on students. Schools are advised not to simply replicate the formats of public assessments in their internal assessment practices.

To align internal assessment practices with public assessments, schools should focus more on helping students understand the learning outcomes and assessment requirements of the public assessments. Students with a better understanding of what they are intended to learn and how their learning is assessed are more likely to attain the required standards of performance. It would be appropriate for schools to provide students with tasks which reflect the learning outcomes and assessment requirements of public assessments, and are pitched at a level of difficulty appropriate to students’ ability.

# Use of Assessment Data from Public Assessments

While public assessments, such as the TSA, Pre-S1 HKAT and HKDSE Examination, are conventionally perceived as summative assessment, the data from these public assessments can be used for reviewing the whole-school curriculum and effectiveness of the learning and teaching strategies. The TSA, administered at the end of P3, P6 and S3, provides objective data about students’ strengths and weaknesses against specific Basic Competencies for schools and teachers to formulate and review plans on enhancing students’ English Language learning at the school level. Similarly, the assessment data from the Pre-S1 HKAT help secondary schools identify the strengths and weaknesses of their incoming Secondary 1 students, adopt appropriate measures as well as adjust the whole-school curriculum and teaching strategies to address their learning needs. As for data from the HKDSE examination, they can be used to facilitate comparison of student performance across different student cohorts and enable schools to evaluate and review their existing curriculum plan and teaching practices to benefit the upcoming cohorts of students. Schools are advised not to impose excessive practice and mechanical drilling on students in preparation for the public assessments to avoid exerting undue pressure on them.

# 6.2 Quality Textbooks and Other Learning and Teaching Resources

Quality textbooks and other resource materials are crucial to learning and teaching. The English Language Education curriculum framework encourages the use of a wide range of learning and teaching materials, including textbooks, for effective language education. Quality learning and teaching resources enrich students’ experience, broaden their perspectives and enhance their cultural understanding. The materials that function most effectively are those that suit the students’ age, learning needs, interests and abilities.

# 6.2.1 Textbooks

Textbooks play an important role in supporting learning and teaching. Quality textbooks, supplemented by other related and stimulating learning and teaching resource materials, can help students develop adequate language knowledge and skills, generic skills, and positive values and attitudes, and work towards the learning targets. A set of guiding principles for quality textbooks has been formulated for schools’ reference in choosing textbooks appropriate to their students’ interests and abilities. It is accessible at: http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/resource-support/textbook-info/ GuidingPrinciples/index.html.

Schools can make reference to the Recommended Textbook List (RTL) and the Recommended e-Textbook List (eRTL) at: https://cd.edb.gov.hk/rtl/search.asp when selecting textbooks for their students. Printed or electronic textbooks placed on the RTL or eRTL are written in line with the curriculum documents issued by the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) and deemed acceptable in terms of content, learning and teaching, structure and organisation, and language used.

# 6.2.2 Choosing Textbooks

When selecting textbooks for the subject of English Language, teachers should take into account:

what the students already know and what they need to learn;   
what will enhance their motivation and learning effectiveness;   
whether the approach and coverage of the materials facilitate the development of the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes promoted in the English Language curriculum;   
the appropriateness of the content;   
the appropriateness of the examples, exercises and illustrations;   
the design and organisation of the tasks or activities;   
the quality of the language used;   
whether independent/self-access learning is encouraged; and   
the strategies to cater for learner diversity.

For printed textbooks, teachers should also consider the following:

the quality of print — whether the texts and images are clear or not;   
the quality of paper — whether it is durable and can be reused;   
the use and size of examples and illustrations — whether they facilitate learning and whether paper is used economically; and   
the weight of the textbooks.

For electronic textbooks, teachers should also consider the following:

the e-features for learning, teaching and assessment — whether there is demonstration of reading aloud continuous texts and dialogues, demonstration of pronunciation of key words and illustration of meaning of key words in audio and/or visual formats, and provision of audio scripts for the listening practices; the pedagogical use of e-features — whether there is access to an online dictionary for checking the meaning of unfamiliar words and expressions; and the provision of the print-on-demand function — whether it can help enhance the development of some learning elements or skills not easily developed by electronic means (e.g. penmanship, proofreading skills).

For more information on quality learning and teaching resources, see Chapter 7 of the Basic Education Curriculum Guide — To Sustain, Deepen and Focus on Learning to Learn (Primary $I - \delta )$ (2014) and Booklet 10 of the Secondary Education Curriculum Guide (Secondary $I - \delta )$ (2017).

# 6.2.3 Using Textbooks

Teachers should exercise their professional judgement and use textbook materials flexibly according to the needs, interests and abilities of their students. Teachers should not feel obliged to use a textbook from cover to cover. They are free to select or adapt relevant parts to suit their teaching purposes. If deemed desirable, parents should be advised on the rationale for this at appropriate meetings.

The following points should be considered when textbooks are used:

The learning targets and objectives of a key stage are attended to and the focus of each unit is identified.   
The textbook content is matched against the school’s English Language curriculum to ensure that there is a balanced coverage of the learning targets and objectives, not only at a particular year level but also across year levels.   
The textbooks are used selectively and teachers adapt tasks or activities to cater for students’ needs and interests. The more able students may skip the easier parts and the less able students may skip the more difficult parts.   
The textbooks are used flexibly according to students’ needs. The parts that overlap with what has already been taught should be omitted, and the parts that are insufficient should be supplemented with other materials. Activities are adapted to make them attractive to students. The interesting activities can be extended to promote further learning, and the less interesting activities can be modified or removed.   
Extended tasks and projects are designed to help students develop further knowledge and skills through activities such as extensive reading and viewing, and to encourage independent and self-directed learning.

# 6.2.4 Learning and Teaching Resources Other Than Textbooks

Apart from textbooks, teachers can make use of other resource materials to support learning and teaching during or outside class time. Language arts materials (e.g. short stories, poems, songs, films) can provide students with enjoyable experiences and enhance their cultural awareness and creativity. The use of non-fiction materials (e.g. documentaries, news, magazine articles) enables students to consider issues from different perspectives. Teachers can also make use of community resources to provide life-wide learning opportunities for students. To encourage active use of non-textbook resources for extended learning outside class time, teachers may:

promote the use of the school library and public libraries to encourage extensive reading and viewing;   
encourage the use of online resources for project work and other assignments; set up a class library, an English room or an English corner to provide a wide variety of learning materials and resources for students’ use during recess time or lunch hour; and   
organise visits to community facilities (e.g. museums, resource centres) to support project learning.

# 6.2.5 Choosing Learning and Teaching Resources Other Than Textbooks

Given the variety of resources available on the market, teachers should exercise their professional judgement when choosing resource materials for promoting English learning. The following are some considerations:

The resources should be relevant to students’ experiences and prior knowledge, and suit their needs, interests and abilities. The content should be interesting and challenging, and the language used should be accurate, authentic and purposeful but not too difficult for students. Resources which involve excessive use of mechanical drills and decontextualised use of English are not beneficial to the learning of English.

To promote reading to learn, teachers should not confine their choices of reading resources to stories, plays and rhymes. They should ensure that the selection covers a wide range of text types, including information texts appropriate to the level of the students. Teachers can choose reading materials on different themes relevant to the interests and daily experiences of their students. Books on different subjects can also be chosen to help students establish cross-curricular linkage in their learning and promote reading across the curriculum. The Internet is a powerful resource for language learning. Teachers should guide students in choosing online materials appropriate to their linguistic and cognitive abilities and develop activities to prepare them adequately for Internet-based tasks. Teachers may consider using multimedia resources and IT tools (e.g. e-books, application software (apps), interactive games, activities) to enhance student motivation and promote self-directed learning. However, given the variation in quality, care should be exercised in the choice of these materials. Good multimedia and IT resources should display the following characteristics:

They involve good models of English use; The teaching approach is based on sound pedagogical principles; The design is user-friendly, and graphics, sound and animation are used appropriately to increase students’ motivation and support learning; The activities promote the integrated use of language skills; and The resources promote interactive learning by encouraging student input, allowing students to work at their own pace and providing feedback to them.

# 6.3 Resources in Support of Curriculum Development

# 6.3.1 Education Bureau (EDB) Resources

The EDB has developed or funded the development of a number of print and electronic resource materials to support the implementation of the English Language Education curriculum. These resources, which have been disseminated to schools and/or are available online, include the following:

# 6.3.2 Community Resources

Many parties in the community and other stakeholders can make useful contribution to life-wide language learning. Schools and teachers are encouraged to explore learning opportunities available in the community to enrich students’ English learning experience and extend their learning beyond the classroom.

# Government Departments and Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs)

Government departments (e.g. the Leisure and Cultural Services Department) and NGOs (e.g. the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) offer a range of programmes, services and activities conducted in English, providing good opportunities for meaningful use of English outside the classroom to enrich students’ language learning experiences.

Schools may work in partnership with these departments and organisations and arrange activities (e.g. visiting museums, libraries, film archives and resource centres, watching shows and performances). They may also encourage their students to browse the websites of the Government departments and NGOs for access to various community resources.

A number of community resources have been identified and provided in Appendix 22 for teachers’ reference.

# Parents

Parental involvement in their children’s education contributes greatly to the latter’s academic, social and emotional growth. Schools may invite parents to serve as volunteer partners in organising English-related activities or solicit their support for their children’s participation in language learning activities organised by other parties in the community.

# Alumni

Schools are encouraged to draw on the alumni’s expertise and resources in supporting students’ language learning by inviting them to give talks, share their language learning experiences or provide services.

# Employers

Employers’ support may be sought for sponsoring language activities or funding award and scholarship schemes related to English learning. Some companies have customer service centres with information and resources in English, and some offer English guided tours. Schools are encouraged to make use of these resources to make language learning more interesting, meaningful and authentic.

# 6.3.3 Collaborative Projects

With a view to encouraging and facilitating school curriculum development, the EDB engages in collaborative projects with schools and teachers. Through such collaboration, valuable experience and knowledge in planning and implementing the school English Language curriculum are generated and disseminated.

# Collaborative Research and Development (“Seed”) Projects

Collaborative research and development (“Seed”) projects are geared towards promoting the learning capabilities of students, generating valuable experiences as well as leveraging synergy to facilitate the implementation of the whole-school curriculum in regard to the ongoing renewal of the school curriculum. Curriculum planning and development strategies for learning, teaching and assessment are the major focuses of the “Seed” projects.

The purpose of “Seed” projects in the English Language Education KLA is to:

generate useful knowledge, experiences and viable recommendations for the reference of schools, teachers and the community;   
develop teachers as curriculum reform facilitators and curriculum leaders, who would consistently reflect on and improve their teaching so as to strengthen the synergy to promote the key emphases of the ongoing renewal of the school curriculum; and   
act as an impetus to school curriculum development.

The experience generated from the “Seed” projects will be disseminated through effective channels (e.g. seminars, sharing sessions, reports, learning and teaching resource materials).

# School-based Support Services

University-School Support Programmes (USPs)

The EDB invites tertiary institutions to conduct USPs for strengthening English language learning and teaching in primary and secondary schools. The programmes aim at providing diversified school-based support services to cater for schools’ development needs through connecting research-based pedagogies with classroom practices. The support services serve as an impetus for schools to develop and sustain their good practices and empower students to develop their language skills.

For details of the recent USPs on the English Language Education KLA and other KLAs, please visit the EDB website at:   
http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/primary-secondary/applicable-to-primarysecondary/sbss/sbps/usp/index.html.

The PDS Scheme initiated by the EDB aims to empower frontline teachers to lead and engage in professional sharing on certain areas of expertise to facilitate interaction and cross-fertilisation of ideas among the partner schools involved in the Scheme. Primary and secondary schools with exemplary practices in English language learning and teaching are designated as PDS under the Scheme. Through inter-school activities such as collaborative lesson planning and observation, teaching experience and resources sharing and joint-school professional development programmes, teachers from the PDS as well as the partner schools can enhance their professional capacity and develop a collaborative culture in the long run.

For details of the recent PDS on the English Language Education KLA and other KLAs, please visit the EDB website at: http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/primary-secondary/applicable-to-primarysecondary/sbss/sbps/professional-development-schools-pds-scheme/index.html.

# EDB School-based Support Services

On-site school-based support services for English Language are provided by different sections of the EDB, including the Language Learning Support (LLS) Section, Nativespeaking English Teachers (NET) Section, and School-based Curriculum Development (Primary) (SBCDP) Section, to help build the expertise of teachers in developing a balanced and coherent curriculum based on the needs and abilities of students. Smallscale research and development projects and school-based tryouts are conducted to explore innovative and effective teaching strategies, develop curriculum resources and address specific issues related to learning and teaching of the participating schools. Successful experiences and good practices will be disseminated through networking activities and the EDB website.

For details of the support services provided, please visit the following websites:

It is important that the use of school resources, which include learning and teaching materials, facilities, equipment and human resources, is maximised to support student learning. The following are some suggestions to achieve this goal:

making good and flexible use of grants to purchase useful learning and teaching resources;   
making flexible and appropriate use of a wide variety of quality print, non-print and e-learning resources;   
building up a resource bank of teacher-designed and student-generated materials including reference books, audio-visual materials, e-learning resources, and useful learning and teaching packages;   
ensuring that the learning and teaching resources are appropriate to students’ needs, interests and abilities;   
maintaining a record of resources; and   
ensuring that students are able to access the wide range of resources and facilities (e.g. a substantial collection of language learning materials in print and nonprint format, easy access to the Internet and e-learning tools) during and beyond lesson time in the school library, multimedia learning centre or English Corner.

# Examples of Text Types for Key Stages 1 – 4 (P1 – S6)

A text is produced for a given purpose. Hence, the text types listed below can be of different natures such as narrative, informational, procedural, expository, persuasive, depending on the purposes they serve.

# Language Items and Communicative Functions for Key Stages 1 – 4 (P1 – S6)

Language items include a range of grammatical forms and structures that students need to develop and they perform different communicative functions. The following serves to outline the language items and communicative functions that students are expected to learn in each key stage. As the choice of language varies according to contextual elements, teachers are encouraged to provide meaningful contexts in which the language items can be used for purposeful communication.

Key Stages 1 – 2 (P1 – 6) The table below outlines the communicative functions that students are expected to learn in KS1 ‒ 2.

# Sentence Patterns

The following nine basic sentence patterns are for teachers’ reference. Primary students may learn to construct sentences following these patterns. Familiarity with these patterns also enables students to edit their writing on their own. With enough exposure, they will master the patterns for use in appropriate contexts. It must be emphasised that the use of grammar rules and terms should be kept to a minimum, especially in teaching KS1 students. Teachers should refer to the grammar items and introduce compound and complex sentences at appropriate stages of learning. Please refer to Sections 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 for further discussion on the approaches to learning and teaching grammar.

The sentence patterns listed as examples for KS1 should be consolidated and extended to cover more patterns and communicative functions in KS2. Teachers should not plan for the learning and teaching of the passive constructions of all possible patterns. It is recommended that passive constructions of simple language forms be introduced to students only when there is a genuine communicative purpose for using the passive.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">KS1 (P1 - 3)</td><td colspan="2">KS2 (P4 - 6)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Examples</td><td></td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Subject + Verb</td><td>The baby is sleeping. Sit down*.</td><td>Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object</td><td>My mother gave me a sandwich.</td></tr><tr><td>Subject + Verb + Object</td><td>I am brushing my teeth.</td><td>Subject + Verb (Be) + Complement (Possessive Pronoun)</td><td>That lunch box is mine.</td></tr><tr><td>Subject + Verb (Be) + Complement</td><td>Jo is a nurse. He is tall. (Noun or Adjective)</td><td rowspan="4">Passive construction</td><td rowspan="4">The poem is written by Anthony Browne.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Subject + Verb + I like swimming. Complement (Gerund)</td></tr><tr><td>It/There/This + Verb (Be) + Noun/Noun phrase</td><td>It is two o&#x27;clock There are ten balloons. This is a hamster.</td></tr><tr><td>Subject + Verb + Adverb phrase</td><td>The children are playing in the park.</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Types of Sentences

The following three types of sentences, formed with the nine sentence patterns mentioned before, can be used to achieve various communicative functions and learning targets in KS1 – 2.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Types of Sentences</td><td>KS1 (P1 - 3) Examples</td><td>KS2 (P4 - 6) Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Use declarative sentences to make statements</td><td>Ben is singing. Susan loves dogs. My brother is strong. The children like reading. There are many flowers. Mary came at two o&#x27;clock.</td><td>The Headmaster will sing us a song. The pictures are hers. The computer was stolen.</td></tr><tr><td>Use interrogative sentences to ask questions</td><td>Is Mr. Wong cooking? May I close the door?. Are you hungry? Do you like swimming? Are there many books? Is the dog playing in the garden?</td><td>Will May send you some flowers? Have you brought yours? Were the doors closed?</td></tr><tr><td>Use imperative sentences to give commands or make requests</td><td>Don&#x27;t shout. Draw a cat. Be quiet. Stop talking.</td><td>Bring me something to drink, please.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note:

Students in KS1 – 2 may need to recognise and use exclamations to express feelings and attitudes, as in the following examples:

Wonderful! Hurray, more cakes! Oh dear! I’m sorry. Oh! Look! How beautiful!

How kind of you! What a lovely picture! What a lovely baby he is! Well done!

These exclamatory expressions may not necessarily fall into the nine sentence patterns. Learning the sentence patterns for all these exclamatory expressions is too demanding and unnecessary for primary students. It is recommended that students be exposed to and practise some exclamatory expressions in appropriate contexts.

# Key Stages 3 – 4 (S1 – 6)

Students at the junior and senior secondary levels should have been exposed to most of the essential language items and structures of English in the previous key stages of learning. Items learnt in KS1 – 2 should be consolidated and extended to a greater degree of complexity at KS3 – 4.

# Developing Generic Skills in the English Language Education KLA

Communication Skills

Communication skills refer to the abilities to achieve the desired outcomes or goals in a process where two or more people interact (be it in a face-to-face or virtual context) through expressing or receiving messages using verbal and non-verbal means. To communicate effectively, students should learn to listen, speak, read and write competently. Not only should they express themselves in an accurate, organised and proper manner, but they should also understand and respect others’ views and expectations, and use appropriate information and means to convey a message in accordance with the purpose, context and audience. They should also evaluate the effectiveness of their communication and identify areas for improvement to achieve the best results.

# Collaborative Problem Solving Skills

Collaborative problem solving skills, an example of integrative use of generic skills, refer to students’ ability to solve problems with synergised efforts through effective division of labour, as well as incorporation of information from multiple sources of knowledge, perspectives and experiences. Compared to individual problem solving, collaborative problem solving has distinct advantages because it enhances the creativity and quality of solutions through stimulation brought by the ideas of other group members4 . In the $2 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ century, it is particularly important for people with different perspectives and talents to solve problems as a team with the effective use of communication technology.

The expected achievements of the students in collaborative problem solving skills are classified according to different levels of mastery.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Beginning</td><td>Developing</td><td>Mastering</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Collaboration</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Students will learn to</td></tr><tr><td>be ready to act responsively to reach the goals with team members follow the rules and. instructions set for the team work participate actively in</td><td>share other team members&#x27; perspectives on a problem and establish a common understanding identify and capitalise on the talents and potential of members</td><td>treasure working as a team and take the initiative to foster synergy for attaining the team goals show mutual respect and support when dealing with difficult people and situations take the initiative to propose</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Example of implementation in English Language Education

Unit: Baby Duck and the New Eyeglasses

Level: P1 – 3

# Lesson Design:

In the Reading Workshops, students read the narrative text Baby Duck and the New Eyeglasses, which is about how upset Baby Duck is because he does not like his new eyeglasses and how other family members try to cheer him up. Students then write a diary entry from the perspective of Baby Duck.

The lesson is designed to promote the integrative use of language skills and generic skills. It particularly facilitates the development of collaborative problem solving skills, which involve the application of collaboration, communication and problem solving skills. The learning activities emphasise synergy among students, team work and communication to enhance creativity and the quality of solutions.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Learning Activities</td><td>Generic Skills Involved</td></tr><tr><td>1. Students are guided to understand: the text structure and plot through drawing a story map;. and the language features of the text through identifying the. speaking verbs and the use of the simple past tense..</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2.

# Holistic Thinking Skills

Critical thinking skills, creativity and problem solving skills are conventionally categorised as higher order thinking skills. These three skills can be combined and employed integratively as holistic thinking skills to deal with complex issues. Holistic thinking skills enable students to deploy critical thinking skills to assess the validity of given information, creativity to explore other possibilities, and problem solving skills to examine the feasibility of each alternative.

The expected achievements of students in holistic thinking skills are classified according to different levels of mastery.

# Example of implementation in English Language Education

Unit: Hunger

Level: KS4, S4 – 6

# Lesson Design:

Students analyse the causes and impacts of a global problem, “Hunger”, and suggest ways to solve the problem from multiple perspectives.

The lesson is designed to familiarise students with the structure of expository texts and the use of more formal language to show the cause-and-effect relationship and propose solutions. It also facilitates students’ development of holistic thinking skills, which involve the application of critical thinking skills to assess and synthesise given information, creativity to explore possibilities, and problem solving skills to examine the feasibility of each alternative.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Learning Activities</td><td>Generic Skills Involved</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Students read a journal article and watch a video on hunger to compare the sentence structures used to express causes and effects and propose solutions in formal and conversational texts.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Working in groups, students:. research on the Internet and collect information about hunger from different sources (e.g. reports from the World Health Organisation, websites of non-governmental organisations (NGOs)); select three hunger-stricken countries and identify the different causes and effects of hunger in each country, organise and synthesise the information using a graphic organiser such as a fishbone diagram or a spider map; brainstorm as many solutions to hunger in these countries as possible, including unconventional ones and new possibilities; discuss and compare the cost and benefit of each solution from multiple perspectives; evaluate and rate the possible solutions based on their feasibility, cost and effectiveness and select a solution for</td><td>critical thinking creativity</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Roles of the Principal in Facilitating Learning to Learn in the “Jumble Sale” Activity of the Project “Charities and Helping Others”

The “Jumble Sale” is one of the English language learning activities in the project “Charities and Helping Others” organised by the students of a local secondary school to raise funds to support the cause of providing education for the children in a village in China. The activity started off at S2 level but gradually evolved to become a wholeschool event involving the participation of students of all year levels, teachers of English and teachers of other subjects, the principal, parents and a social service agency. The school principal plays multiple roles in supporting the event (as illustrated in the diagram below), leading to its success.

A vote of thanks: We would like to thank Cheung Sha Wan Catholic Secondary School for sharing their experience.

# Guidelines for Setting and Assessing Portfolios

1. Determine the learning/assessment aims in setting the portfolio assignment. To engage students in purposeful learning, the aims and assessment criteria of the portfolio should be clearly explained to the students in straightforward language.

2. Determine the activities that will make up the portfolio. Whenever possible, teachers should enhance students’ involvement and ownership of their own learning by allowing them to make choices on matters such as the topic, materials and approach(es) in carrying out and completing their work. This will facilitate reflection and selection, which are important learning experiences that portfolios should offer students. It is also advisable to encourage students to communicate directly with the reader (in the form of, say, an introductory letter or journal entries) explaining why or how the items are selected for inclusion.

3. Determine what will be assessed. For formative assessment purposes, the teacher can decide on whether to assess the portfolio as a single entity or specific parts of the portfolio (e.g. an introductory letter to the portfolio, the design of a questionnaire, an oral progress report) to reflect the learning process, or a combination of both.

4. Set general and task specific criteria before developing the portfolio assignment. Teachers should consider developing an initial feedback sheet that incorporates both general criteria and any known task specific criteria and go over them carefully with students at the start. Students should be encouraged to use the feedback sheet to facilitate self-reflection and peer feedback during the process of portfolio development.

5. Help students understand the task specific criteria for any task or activity they will carry out. This is clearly important and may involve negotiating with students to develop new criteria or feedback sheets to suit the task or activity.

6. Allow time for portfolio development. Portfolios require time for development and therefore teachers need to work out the times by which portfolios are due to be completed so that they do not all have to be handed in at the same time.

7. Build in formative feedback mechanisms throughout the process of portfolio development to provide self-reflection, peer feedback and teacher feedback opportunities in the form of written progress reports, teacher-student conferences, student diaries, and feedback sheets.

# Portfolios Example 1: Theme-based Portfolio

You are going to develop a portfolio about your favourite holiday.   
The purpose of developing this portfolio is for you to demonstrate your language ability and your ability to create a collection of related items that interests and informs your reader on a topic.   
You will need to select and carry out four of the tasks below. At least one must be selected from each of the lists. If you would like to work on something outside this list, talk about it with your teacher.   
You must include tasks which are related to one another and arrange them in a logical order in the portfolio. As you carry out each task, revise and edit your work carefully. You should ask your classmates and your teacher for feedback.   
After you have selected and carried out all of the tasks, write an introductory letter to the portfolio reader explaining why you have chosen them and what you have learnt from doing them.   
You will be given feedback on the relevance and quality of each of the completed tasks (according to the criteria on the various feedback sheets), and of the portfolio as a whole.

Choose at least one task from each of the three lists below:

Write a poem about your favourite holiday.

# Portfolios Example 2: Learning Reflection Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is for you to demonstrate your ability to reflect on your learning.

You will need to select four tasks you have completed during this term to include in the portfolio, e.g. a homepage, a comic strip, a poster, a letter, a survey report or an oral book report. You have to include tasks which are related to one another. You also need to arrange the tasks in a logical order in the portfolio.

You will need to write a journal entry about each of the four tasks. For each entry, you might like to consider covering the following areas, if appropriate:

What the task was and when you did it;   
Why the task was selected (state your selection criteria);   
What you liked and/or disliked about doing the task and why; and What you learnt from doing the task.

You may include tasks that you had difficulty with. These tasks are often the ones we learn most from.

You will NOT be re-graded on any of the tasks. You will be given feedback on the quality of your reflections.

# Sample Assessment Tasks (KS2) Notes to Teachers

# Design of the Assessment Paper

This set of assessment paper, which consists of three parts, is designed under the theme of “Winter World Festival”. The thematically-linked tasks aim to assess students’ mastery of the four language skills in a meaningful and interesting context, which makes the assessment less intimidating.

# Brief Descriptions of the Paper

Reading and Writing Part

˙ The reading part provides a number of tasks leading to the winning of two free tickets to the Winter World Festival. It includes reading three texts about the festival and answering some comprehension questions in the form of a quiz. ˙ The writing part assesses students’ communication skills and creativity. It includes writing an invitation card and a diary entry. The invitation card activity involves the use of information from the three reading texts. It is followed by the writing of the diary entry on a day spent at the Winter World Festival.

# Listening Part

˙ This part includes a listening task in which students are required to complete a quiz while listening to a conversation between an ice-cream chef and three children about some fun facts about ice-cream. To allow for the natural flow of conversation as in authentic situations, there will not be any “beep” sounds in the recording.

# Speaking Part

˙ This part includes two speaking tasks. The first task involves selecting and reading aloud the information extracted from the three reading texts about the Winter World Festival. The ending consonants $^ { \circ \mathfrak { c } } - \mathbf { S } ^ { 3 3 }$ and “-d”), which are the testing points for phonics skills in this task, are underlined in the extracts to raise students’awareness of pronouncing the sounds accurately. The second task is an experience-sharing activity based on the student’s choice in the first task. Teachers can conduct this assessment task using the suggested questions.

# Adaptation of the Paper

This set of assessment paper contains questions of different levels of difficulty. Schools are encouraged to modify or adapt the design and contents of the paper according to the school assessment policy. The following are suggestions on marks and time allocation:

˙ Reading and Writing $60 \%$ (50 minutes) ˙ Listening $20 \%$ (20 minutes) ˙ Speaking $20 \%$ (6 minutes per student)

# A Scoop of Fun Facts about Ice-cream

Dave : Welcome children and parents! I think you are all ice-cream lovers, aren’t you? Are you ready for the quiz?   
kids : Yes!   
Dave : I’d like to share with you some fun facts about ice-cream. Do you have a quiz card with you?   
kids : Yes!   
Dave : Great! Listen carefully and finish the questions on the card. You can get a free ice-cream cone if you get all the answers correct. Sounds nice?   
kids : Yeah! We like ice-cream!   
Dave : To start with, do you like ice-cream sundaes? Do you know how big an icecream sundae can be?   
kid 1 : Can it be bigger than a teddy bear?   
Dave : Much bigger! You know the biggest ice-cream sundae is taller than a door! A door is 2 metres tall but the ice-cream sundae is 1 metre taller than the door!   
kid 2 : Wow! It must be very big! Was it topped with chocolate sauce?   
Dave : I think so! Guess what the most popular topping for ice-cream is?   
kid 1 : Nuts?   
kid 3 : Cherries?   
kid 2 : Chocolate sauce?   
Dave : Bingo! It is chocolate sauce. Do you want to try some ice-cream, kids?   
kids : Yes!   
Dave : How fast can you finish a scoop of ice-cream?   
kid 3 : I can finish it in 2 minutes!   
Dave : Guess how many licks you need to finish one scoop of ice-cream. You know ‘licks’? (the sound of licking)   
kid 2 : Is it thirty?   
kid 1 : Thirteen? That’s impossible!   
kid 2 : No, I mean THIRTY, three zero!   
Dave : No, it’s more than thirty, but it’s a good try! Any more answers?

kid 1 : Is it fifty?

Dave : You’ve got it! It takes an average of 50 licks to finish a single scoop of icecream. Interesting, right? People in the USA eat a lot of ice-cream. They have a National Ice-cream Month in July. The third Sunday in July is their National Ice-cream Day!   
kid 3 : Is it the first Sunday?   
Dave : No, it’s the THIRD Sunday. Do you know why they celebrate it on a Sunday?   
kid 2 : Is it a holiday?   
Dave : Maybe, it’s because most people come to buy ice-cream on Sundays! Children, if you want to know more about ice-cream, you can go to the computer and surf the Internet. Now it’s time for you to complete the quiz. You have five minutes to finish.

# Sample Assessment Tasks (KS3)

# The Yearly Outing of the Community Youth Club (CYC)

# Situation

You are the secretary of the CYC. The club is organising a yearly outing to welcome new members and allow old members to socialise with each other. You have to complete three tasks in preparation for the event.

# Task 1: Choosing a Destination for the Outing

Part 1: Completing a comparison table

In the last meeting, the committee members of the CYC proposed two destinations to choose from and agreed on some criteria for selecting the destination. You have collected some information on the Internet about the two destinations suggested. Read the information below and complete the comparison table that follows by providing the necessary information and ticking $\boxtimes$ the right boxes.

# Plover Cove Country Park

General information

Plover Cove Country Park, located off Ting Kok Road in Tai Po, New Territories, is one of the most magnificent parks for families to visit.

# Transportation

From Tai Po Market MTR station, take bus No. 75K or minibus No. 20C

![](img/fbecce3c690d3a5c8df9cb437446234ff58a51ffd19d83303c52ebe3e442ffee.jpg)

# Activities

There are many activities that people can do for recreation and enjoyment such as barbecuing, hiking, cycling, kite flying and fishing. Plover Cove Country Park is a popular location for kite flying on windy days. The Plover Cove Reservoir Country Trail with a number of ups and downs is one of the toughest country trails in the territory and visitors might like to challenge themselves on a hike. The scenery around Plover Cove is spectacular.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Members</td><td>Comments</td></tr><tr><td>HelloMe:</td><td>Reviewed on 15/4/2016 I went there last weekend and the park was so crowded with people cycling, picnicking and barbecuing. I could not find a place to sit down, not to mention a barbecue space! The trail and the open area were also filled with rubbish.</td></tr><tr><td>Goswimmer:</td><td>Reviewed on 18/8/2015 It&#x27;s a pity that swimming is forbidden inside the Plover Cove Reservoir. Though I saw some people swimming in the streams nearby, they. were taking their own risks as there were no lifeguards around!</td></tr><tr><td>Hiker9:</td><td>Reviewed on 20/7/2015 Plover Clove is a hidden gem. I went there on a weekday and there. were not many people. The walk across the dam is a bit long but you will be rewarded with spectacular views across the reservoir and the surrounding hills and mountains.</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Cheung Sha Beach

# General information

Situated on the south coast of Lantau Island, Cheung Sha Beach is surrounded by scenic hills and peaks. Cheung Sha Beach is the longest beach in Hong Kong. In addition to the breathtaking scenery at Cheung Sha Beach, it offers a lovely view of the South China Sea.

![](img/e5b23bb076c9db07a51d8d88107f6b84a2b376b3fb853b5d7d9ae2a9fb6e2625.jpg)

# Transportation

From Central Pier No. 5,

catch a Mui Wo ferry take bus No. 1 or 2 to Tai O

# Activities

Cheung Sha Beach is never overcrowded. It is quieter than most Hong Kong beaches. It is not only a great place for barbecues as there are lots of barbecue areas but also an excellent place for swimming, kayaking and windsurfing because the water at Cheung Sha Beach is very clean. With lifeguard service provided from April to October, swimmers can enjoy swimming there. To further lower the risks of the swimmers, shark nets have been installed. The beach has excellent sand and is one of the best places in Hong Kong for making sandcastles. There are showers and a few small stores selling food and drinks.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Members</td><td>Comments</td></tr><tr><td>Sunbather:</td><td>Reviewed on 13/5/2016 Cheung Sha Beach provides toilets, showers and changing rooms. There are also shops around that sell swim suits, beach toys, soft drinks and a few snacks. Certainly looks like a place pretty much self-contained with everything you need for a day in the sun and water. I enjoy watching the stunning sunset and the breathtaking view of the South China Sea too.</td></tr><tr><td>Brisbaner:</td><td>Reviewed on 3/5/2016 The transportation to Cheung Sha Beach is not very convenient. It takes quite a long time to get there by taking a ferry from Central and then a bus. Other than nice scenery, the beach and the sand, Cheung Sha has little to offer and fails to excite me.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Dear

I have read some information about the two places suggested by committee members (i.e. Plover Cove Country Park and Cheung Sha Beach). It seems that is more suitable for our outing this year.

![](img/d34f62ef4967249e8e775232b3ceee7615f106acc4e5ed1b3ceef207d848ac99.jpg)

I hope you will agree with me. We need to decide on the destination as soon as possible and hold a meeting to discuss what to buy for the outing.

Regards,

# Task 2: Planning What to Buy

Members of the club have decided that they want to go barbecuing for their outing. Now the committee members are having a meeting to discuss what to buy for the barbecue. As the secretary of the club, you need to take notes. Listen to the discussion and complete the shopping list below.

# Tapescript

Chairperson: … Now let’s talk about what to buy for the barbecue. Any ideas?   
Chris: Let’s see. 50 members have signed up. That means we need to buy food and drinks for 50 people.   
Mary: That’s a lot. Shall we ask them to bring their own water and drinks?   
Chairperson: Good idea. We’ll remind them to do that — They bring their own water and drinks.   
Mark: Now what food should we buy?   
Anna: Chicken wings. Everybody likes chicken wings.   
Sarah: And sausages too.   
John: How about pork chops? Shall we get some of them as well?   
Chairperson: Okay, chicken wings, sausages and pork chops. How many of each do we need?   
Sarah: Will three chicken wings for each member be enough?   
Mary: I think so. That’s 150 chicken wings. How about sausages? Two for each?   
John: That sounds reasonable. So 100 sausages. How about pork chops?   
Mark: I love pork chops. Let’s get 4 for each.   
Anna: That’s too many, Mark. We already have chicken wings and sausages.   
Chairperson: Right. Three for each will do. 150 pork chops, got that?   
Mary: I suggest that we buy some oranges. How about one for each member?   
Sarah: Good. 50 oranges. I think that’s enough food. Now how about charcoal, skewers and all that?   
Mark: We need to buy 3 bags of charcoal and 50 skewers.   
Chairperson: Hold on. I think we have some charcoal left over from the last picnic.   
John: Two bags full. They’re still in my home.   
Anna: That means we need to buy one more bag. How about skewers?   
John: There are 30 left from last time. We need to get enough for everybody though.   
Chairperson: Okay, get at least 20 more. Have we left anything out? Oh yes, we need to have honey, paper plates, lighters, etc.   
Mary: Let’s buy 4 jars of honey and 50 paper plates.   
Sarah: And I’ll bring some lighters and old newspapers.   
Chairperson: Thanks Sarah. I think we’ll do the shopping tomorrow after school. Who’s coming along?   
Anna: Count me in.   
Mark: Me too.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Glossary</td></tr><tr><td>Term</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>(ApL)</td><td>Applied Learning ApL is an integral part of the three-year senior secondary curriculum. It takes broad professional and vocational fields as a learning platform to develop students&#x27; foundation skills, thinking skills, people skills, positive values and attitudes and career-related competencies, in order to prepare them for further study or work as well as lifelong learning. ApL courses complement the senior secondary subjects, adding variety to the senior secondary curriculum.</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment objectives</td><td>The outcomes of the curriculum to be assessed in the public assessment</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment of Learning</td><td>It refers to the assessment designed to provide evidence for making judgments on student achievement against learning targets, objectives or standards at a certain point of time.</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment for Learning</td><td>It is a formative and diagnostic kind of assessment where teachers collect ongoing information about students&#x27; learning progress, provide timely and quality feedback and adjust their teaching strategies for improving student learning.</td></tr><tr><td>Assessment as Learning</td><td>It refers to students&#x27; use of learning tasks and feedback to enhance their own learning. During the process, students actively develop an understanding of their learning, critically assess their learning effectiveness, adjust learning strategies, plan for follow-up actions, and set future learning goals. When implementing assessment as learning, feedback from teachers or self- and peer assessments help students reflect on their own learning, and identify their strengths and areas for improvement.</td></tr><tr><td>Co-construction</td><td>Co-construction is a process in which learners collaborate to work, share and reflect in the learning process, and contributes to the building of knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td>Core subjects</td><td>Subjects recommended for all students to take at the senior secondary level: Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics and Liberal Studies.</td></tr><tr><td>Curriculum framework</td><td>A curriculum framework provides a structure which helps schools flexibly plan and develop their own curricula based on the central curriculum to meet the varied needs of students. The major components of a curriculum framework are knowledge and concepts, generic skills, and values and attitudes relevant to each Key Learning Area. The framework sets out the knowledge, skills and values and attitudes that students should learn and develop at different key stages.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Direct instruction It is a structured approach with a high degree of teacher direction and control. It allows students to learn and apply knowledge systematically in the process.

e-Learning

It refers to an open and flexible learning mode involving the use of the electronic media, including the use of digital resources and communication tools to achieve the learning objectives. The essence of e-learning is to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness in schools and to develop students’ necessary qualities (e.g. selfdirected learning capabilities). Teachers may develop an e-learning repertoire, thereby enhancing, modifying and complementing some existing learning and teaching strategies.

Enquiry learning It refers to a learner-centred approach which enables students to acquire knowledge through active participation in the learning process. It emphasises higher-order thinking skills which involve analysis, problem solving, discovery and creative activities. Students are responsible for processing the data they are working with to reach their own conclusions.

Generic Skills

Generic skills are skills, abilities and attributes which are fundamental in helping students acquire, construct and apply knowledge. They are developed through the learning and teaching that take place in different subjects or key learning areas, and are transferable to different learning situations. Nine types of generic skills are identified in the Hong Kong school curriculum, i.e. Collaboration Skills, Communication Skills, Creativity, Critical Thinking Skills, Information Technology Skills, Mathematical Skills, Problem Solving Skills, Self-management Skills and Self-learning Skills.

Information Literacy (IL)

It is an ability or attitude that guides an effective and ethical use of information. It aims to help students i) identify the need for information; ii) locate, evaluate, extract, organise and present information; iii) create new ideas; iv) cope with the dynamics in the information world; and v) use information ethically (e.g. upholding intellectual property rights and understanding online respect and responsibility) and refrain from immoral practices (e.g. cyber bullying and infringement of intellectual property rights). The Four Key Tasks will provide opportunities for students to develop and apply IL.

Internal assessment

This refers to the assessment activities that are conducted regularly in school to assess students’ performance in learning. Internal assessment is an inseparable part of the learning and teaching process, and it aims to make learning more effective. With the information that internal assessment provides, teachers will be able to understand students’ progress in learning, provide them with appropriate feedback and make any adjustments to the learning objectives and teaching strategies they deem necessary.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Key Learning Area (KLA)</td><td>A way of organising the school curriculum around fundamental concepts of major knowledge domains. It aims at providing a broad, balanced and coherent curriculum for all students through engaging them in a variety of essential learning experiences. The Hong Kong curriculum has eight KLAs, namely, Chinese Language Education, English Language Education, Mathematics Education, Personal, Social and Humanities Education, Science Education, Technology Education, Arts Education and Physical Education.</td></tr><tr><td>Key Stage (KS)</td><td>There are four stages of schooling from lower primary to senior secondary levels, i.e. Key Stage 1 (P1 - P3), Key Stage 2 (P4 - P6), Key Stage 3 (S1 - S3), and Key Stage 4 (S4 -- S6).</td></tr><tr><td>Knowledge construction</td><td>This refers to the process of learning in which learners are involved not only in acquiring new knowledge, but also in actively relating it to their prior knowledge and experience so as to create and form their own knowledge.</td></tr><tr><td>Language across the Curriculum (LaC)</td><td>LaC premises on the notion that language learning can also take place in the non-language KLAs, which provide authentic contexts for learners to apply their literacy skills to construct knowledge and to facilitate their development into lifelong learners. While English/ Chinese language teachers focus on helping learners to master the accurate use of the language (e.g. vocabulary and grammar) as well as to recognise the importance of coherence, cohesion and appropriacy in texts, teachers of non-language KLAs can facilitate the transfer of such language knowledge and skills by emphasising the use of relevant language features for presenting the subject content and providing opportunities for application of relevant knowledge and skills.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Learning community

A learning community refers to a group of people who have shared values and goals, and who work closely together to generate knowledge and create new ways of learning through active participation, collaboration and reflection. Such a learning community may involve not only students and teachers, but also parents and other parties in the community.

Learning outcomes

Learning outcomes refer to what learners should be able to do by the end of a particular stage of learning. Learning outcomes are developed based on the learning targets and objectives of the curriculum for the purpose of evaluating learning effectiveness. Learning outcomes also describe the levels of performance that learners should attain after completing a particular key stage of learning and serve as a tool for promoting learning and teaching.

Learning targets set out broadly the knowledge/concepts, skills, values and attitudes that students need to learn and develop.

Learning objectives define specifically what students should know, value and be able to do in each strand of the subject in accordance with the broad subject targets at each key stage of schooling. They are to be used by teachers as a source list for curriculum, lesson and activity planning.

Public assessment

This refers to the assessments for all students at different key stages. For English Language, this includes the Territory-wide System Assessment at P3, P6 and S3, Pre-Secondary One Hong Kong Attainment Test, and the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education.

# Reading across the Curriculum (RaC)

RaC aims to provide opportunities for students to broaden their knowledge base, as well as applying and consolidating reading skills and strategies developed in language lessons. Non-language KLAs provide authentic contexts for the promotion of RaC. Teachers of non-language KLAs can select appropriate English/Chinese reading materials with related themes/topics to help students connect their learning experiences and raise their awareness of the language features typical in these texts.

# School-based Assessment (SBA)

SBA is administered in schools as part of the learning and teaching process, with students being assessed by their subject teachers. Marks awarded will be counted towards students’ results in the local public examinations conducted by the HKEAA.

Self-directed learning (SDL)

It refers to the skill that a learner, who takes the initiative and responsibility for learning with or without the assistance of others, possesses. A self-directed learner may identify his/her learning needs, formulate goals, and choose resources and strategies for learning. SDL enhances students’ sense of agency or control and metacognitive skills. SDL may be interpreted as self-regulated learning, self-learning or independent learning in other contexts.

Students with Special Educational Needs (SEN)

Students with SEN represent two poles of the spectrum of academic abilities. They include those with intellectual disability, visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical disability, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, speech and language impairment and Specific Learning Difficulties. They also include gifted students with high level of measured intelligence, specific academic aptitude in a subject area, creative thinking, remarkable talents in visual and performing arts, peer leadership, psychomotor ability, etc. Schools receiving students with SEN can make use of the opportunities to instil in all students the values of equal opportunities and social inclusion. Mainstream schools are encouraged to adopt a whole-school approach to catering for students with SEN.

School curriculum

Schools and teachers are encouraged to adapt the central curriculum to develop their school curriculum to help their students achieve the subject targets and overall aims of education. Measures may include readjusting the learning targets, varying the organisation of contents, adding optional studies and adapting learning, teaching and assessment strategies. A school curriculum is therefore the outcome of a balance between official recommendations and the autonomy of the schools and teachers.

Values and attitudes

Values constitute the foundation of the attitudes and beliefs that influence one’s behaviour and way of life. They help form principles underlying human conduct and critical judgement, and are qualities that learners should develop. Some examples of values are rights and responsibilities, commitment, honesty and national identity. Closely associated with values are attitudes. The latter supports motivation and cognitive functioning, and affects one’s way of reacting to events or situations. Since both values and attitudes significantly affect the way a student learns, they form an important part of the school curriculum.
