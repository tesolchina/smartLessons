# Abstract

First person pronouns are a rhetorical strategy which allows researchers to perform different discourse functions in the text, through which they construct a convincing argument that persuades readers of the validity and novelty of their claims and of their own competence. In this paper I explore how Spanish EFL Engineering students use first person plural pronouns in multi-authored report writing. The paper examines the discourse functions of the pronoun we in a corpus of 55 reports written by Spanish students. The analysis shows that these students fail to understand how expert writers use these pronouns to construct their authorial identities as knowledgeable members of the community. Students are unaware of the conventionalised use of phraseological patterns involving we to perform specific functions in academic genres. The results clearly suggest the need for an approach to academic writing in higher education which combines genre analysis, expert corpora and learner corpora.

# 1. Introduction

Corpus analysis has proved a useful tool to reveal a number of distinctive features of professional and academic discourse (e.g. Biber, 2004; Charles, 2006; Gledhill, 2000; Groom, 2005; Luzo´n, 2000; Oakey, 2002). One of the most interesting findings deriving from such analyses is the existence of a highly conventionalised phraseology, which poses problems to novice native speakers and especially to non-native writers.

Corpus-based studies of expert academic discourse no doubt provide valuable information for syllabus and material design. However, as several researchers (e.g. Aston, 2000; Bitchener & Basturkmen, 2006; Flowerdew, 1998; Gilquin, Granger, & Paquot, 2007) have pointed out, studies based on the analysis of expert or native corpora are not enough to inform the design of EAP teaching materials and must be complemented with studies which analyse students’ interlanguage. Aston (2000, p. 10) claims that the analysis of corpora of native speaker texts does not provide information on the relative difficulty and learnability of particular linguistic features or on the productivity of some features from the learner’s perspective. He, therefore, argues for the use of learner corpora to get relevant information on interlanguage development, which can help to identify features which teaching should emphasise and to evaluate their difficulty.

Studies based on learner corpora have revealed some of the main problems that non-native learners have when writing academic essays: errors involving the collocational patterning of words and phraseological infelicities (Flowerdew, 2000; Gilquin et al., 2007), pragmatic inappropriacy, e.g. anomalous use of modal verbs or hedges, overuse of emphatics and attitude markers, a high degree of writer visibility and involvement (Flowerdew, 2000; Granger & Rayson, 1998; Hewings & Hewings, 2002; Neff et al., 2004; Petch-Tyson, 1998), semantic misuse (De Cock, 2003; Gilquin et al., 2007), problems with discourse features, e.g. overuse, underuse or misuse of connectors, tendency to place connectors in sentence-initial position, errors involving signalling nouns (Bolton, Nelson, & Hung, 2003; Cortes, 2004; De Cock, 2003; Flowerdew, 2006; Granger & Tyson, 1996), lack of register awareness, i.e. overuse of lexical and grammatical features typical of speech and underuse of features of formal writing (Gilquin et al., 2007; Gilquin & Paquot, 2007; Granger & Rayson, 1998), overreliance on a limited set of linguistic items and overuse of high frequency vocabulary (Gilquin et al., 2007; Ringbom, 1998), extensive use of certain prefabs (De Cock, Granger, Leech, & McEnery, 1998). However, in spite of this upsurge of interest in learner corpora of academic writing, there are many aspects of this type of discourse which still remain under-researched.

Although several corpus-based studies have focused on the rhetorical functions performed by phraseological patterns in specific genres (e.g. Charles, 2006; Gledhill, 2000), few studies based on learner corpora have tackled this issue and there is a scarcity of research which relies on learner corpora to explore learners’ awareness of generic conventions and genre phraseology. Charles (2006) points to the need to combine discourse analysis and corpus investigation for the production of EAP teaching materials. She argues that this combined pedagogical approach can help students see the connection between rhetorical purposes and specific lexico-grammatical choices. In this study I start from the assumption that EAP materials should also make students aware of their own errors and infelicities, and that these materials should, therefore, be informed by the analysis of both expert and learner corpora.

First person pronouns are part of many phraseological patterns strategically used by expert writers to perform rhetorical functions in academic and professional genres. The aim of this paper is to analyse how Spanish EFL Engineering students use first person plural pronouns in report writing in order to ascertain whether this use is deviant from conventionalised use in expert academic writing. More specifically, this research addresses the following questions: (i) What is the frequency of we in the learner corpus, compared with its frequency in expert academic writing? (ii) What are the discourse functions of we in the learner corpus?; (iii) Which are the lexico-grammatical realisations of these functions?, i.e. Which are the phraseological patterns involving we associated to the discourse functions in the learner corpus?

# 2. First person pronouns1 in expert and student writing

A number of corpus-based studies have analysed the functions that first person pronouns play in academic writing (Flottum, Kinn, & Dahl, 2006; Harwood 2005a, 2005b, 2005c; Hyland, 2001, 2002a; Kuo, 1999; Luzo´n, 1996; Martı´nez, 2005; Mur, 2007; Tang & John, 1999), refuting the traditional view that this type of discourse is impersonal and objective (see Hyland 2002a for examples of textbooks and style guides where this view is adopted). These studies have revealed that first person pronouns are used by academic writers for such wide range of purposes as stating a purpose or goal, organising the text and making its structure clearer to the reader, staking knowledge claims, stating hypotheses, showing results or findings, expressing personal opinions, conveying a sense of novelty about the author’s research, explaining experimental procedures, creating a positive tenor of solidarity, and constructing the author’s identity as a member of the discourse community. Some studies have explored authorial presence by analysing the identity signalled by first person pronouns. Tang and John (1999), for instance, established a typology of six different identities behind the first person pronoun in academic writing (both expert and learner writing): representative, guide through the essay, architect of the essay, recounter of the research process, opinion-holder, originator. Flottum et al. (2006) proposed a taxonomy of author roles (researcher, writer, arguer and evaluator) as revealed by the verbs that collocate with first person pronouns. These roles/identities involve different degrees of visibility, which is strategically used by the writer for rhetorical purposes.

These studies suggest that the use of the first person pronoun as a strategic resource requires a high degree of genre awareness, which learners usually lack. Research has shown that first person pronouns are highly problematic for NNSs, who tend to use them for different purposes and with different frequency than native writers (Hyland, 2002a; Martı´nez, 2005). Some studies have reported the underuse or avoidance of first person pronouns by non-native writers (Hyland, 2002a; Ivani-c & Camps, 2001; Martı´nez, 2005). This underuse has been accounted for by the non-native writers’ misconception that first person is inappropriate in research papers or their perception that it connotes authority. Hyland (2002a) also points to the influence of the writer’s background, which may lead L2 writers from nonAnglo-American cultures to refrain from promoting an individual self. The informants of the studies above were writers with a high level of language proficiency (undergraduate students writing their final project in English, postgraduate students, or writers who had published papers in English). Other studies focusing on writer visibility and the use of first person pronouns by EFL students have yielded opposite results. Petch-Tyson (1998) examined the presence of the writer in NSs and NNSs essays and found that EFL student writers are much more overtly present in their writings that NS writers and this presence is frequently marked with first person pronouns. Similarly, Neff et al. (2004) show that student argumentative writing (both native and non-native) is characterised by excessive visibility of the writer and a high degree of involvement.

However, the way identity is constructed in academic writing does not only depend on the writer’s linguistic competence. Studies comparing the use of first person pronoun by native/expert writers in different academic genres and different disciplines have also revealed noticeable differences and opposing results. While Harwood (2005a) found that ‘‘methodological $\Gamma ^ {  \overrightarrow { } }$ (i.e. the use of personal pronoun to elaborate methodology) was more frequent in native postgraduate computing project reports than in Computer Science articles by experts, Koutsantoni (2006) found that students writing research these use a lower frequency of personal attribution than RA authors. The demands of the student genres and the status of the authors in academic discourse communities have been used to account for these differences. When comparing disciplines, Hyland (2002a) observed that the authorial pronoun is more frequently used by expert authors in soft fields than in hard fields. All these studies reveal that the way writers use personal pronouns to rhetorically construct their authorial identity is influenced by many factors, including writers’ variables, such as the writers’ linguistic competence and academic literacy (native vs. non-native speakers of English, expert writers/author published in academic journal vs. students of the discipline) or their cultural background, but also the genre they are writing and the discipline.

# 3. Corpus and method

# 3.1. The corpus

The learner corpus for this research was made up of 55 multi-authored final writing assignments by undergraduate Engineering students. Each assignment had a length of approximately 2,400e2,600 words, resulting in a corpus of 139,807 words. 23 texts were written by Computer Engineering students, 19 by Industrial Engineering students and 13 by Chemical Engineering students. Students were enrolled in the ‘‘Technical English’’ course offered in the fourth year of their degrees. During the course students are exposed to different types of academic and professional genres, although explicit instruction on how authorial identity is constructed in such genres is not provided. Existing course requirements include the submission of a report at the end of the course, after students have completed previous shorter writing assignments. The texts that students have to write for their final assignments are reports (in this case recommendation reports) because this is one of the fundamental genres of engineering writing (Kryder, 1999; McKenna, 1997). An important issue to take into account is that, although the students in the research are used to reading textbooks and research papers in English, this was the first time they had to write such a long piece of writing (either in Spanish or in English) and the first time they had to write a report.

Students wrote their assignments as response to a real-life task, where they were asked to produce a text reporting their research. The assignment sheet gave them details on aspects such as the type of research and the kind of writing expected, the length requirements, report format, or evaluation criteria. The following fragment from the assignment sheet for Computer Engineering students illustrates the kind of output the students were expected to produce.

You work for Mobtronics, Inc. a computer company interested in developing a PDA which incorporates a rollable electronic paper display. Since there are several electronic paper manufacturers, the company needs to know which kind of electronic paper will be more suitable for their purposes. You have to research different types of electronic paper displays and write a recommendation report which helps the company to decide which one to choose for their PDA.

Although most learner corpora are compiled from the writing of high-intermediate level students, this corpus was made up by the texts written by all the students taking the ‘‘Technical English’’ courses (low-intermediate to high-intermediate level), since the main purpose of the research was to identify the errors that our students (no matter what level) made.

# 3.2. Method

The corpus was analysed with the Worldlist and Concordance tools of the program WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2004). I have only focused on subject pronouns and, more specifically, on the plural pronoun we (both inclusive and exclusive we), since all the student assignments in the corpus were of multiple authorship. Frequency analysis was conducted to provide quantitative data for comparison with data from two previous studies of expert academic writing: Kuo’s (1999) and Harwood’s (2005c) analyses of the use of personal pronouns in scientific journal articles. I decided to use these studies for comparison purposes because they provided data on the use of we in hard field (Becher, 1989) corpora, partly consisting of Engineering texts. The corpus used by Kuo (1999), with 224,328 running words, contains 36 scientific journal articles from three scientific fields: Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, and Physics. The corpus used by Harwood (2005c) consisted of approximately 325,000 words and contained 40 single-authored papers from four disciplines (Business and Management, Economics, Physics, Computing Science). However, for comparison with the learner corpus I have only selected the results from the Physics and Computing Science subcorpora. Comparing the Engineering learner corpora with expert corpora consisting only of texts from hard fields can provide more reliable results, since authors in the soft and hard disciplines have been shown to differ in their use of personal pronouns, with figures lower for the hard disciplines (Hyland, 2002a).

While the ideal corpus for comparison would consist of engineering reports, I am unaware of any study of author pronouns in such a corpus. I have chosen to compare my results with those of research on engineering RAs because I consider that they share epistemological assumptions and disciplinary values with engineering reports and, therefore, the comparison could help to reveal non-expert behaviour in the learner corpus. Both report and RA engineering authors try to create an impression of objectivity and authority by relying on facts and results (Hyland, 2002a; Winsor, 1996). I am, however, aware, that RAs and reports are different genres and that differences in the frequency of authorial presence may be accounted for not only by the author’s variable but also by the genre variable. The fact that the report is a client-oriented genre, socially embedded in the relations between engineers and client (McKenna, 1997: 192), could lead to differences in the use of authorial presence in reports and RAs.

A second aspect of the quantitative analysis involved the construction of the concordance of we to find out its collocates and the clusters associated with it. Furthermore, a careful analysis of the cotext and context of the actual occurrences of we was carried out, in order to determine their discourse function and to detect deviant uses (i.e. uses not found in expert writing). To develop an initial classification scheme I drew on previous research on the functions of first person pronouns in academic writing and learner corpora (Flottum et al., 2006; Harwood, 2005b, c; Hyland, 2001, 2002a; Kuo, 1999; Luzo´n, 1996; Martı´nez, 2005; Mur, 2007; Tang & John, 1999). Then, a detailed analysis of the occurrences of we in the learner corpus was used to validate the categories present in the corpus and classify each occurrence as performing a particular function.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Frequency

Table 1 shows the normalised frequency of $w e$ in the learner corpus and the normalised frequency of $I + w e ^ { 2 }$ found in other studies of expert corpora.

Table 1 Frequency of first person pronouns in academic discourse.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Corpus</td><td>Normalised frequency of we+ I (per 1,000 words).</td></tr><tr><td>Learner corpus</td><td>10.3</td></tr><tr><td>Kuo (1999)</td><td>6.21</td></tr><tr><td>Harwo0d (2005c): hard disciplines</td><td>7.05</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 1 shows that, in agreement with Neff et al.’s (2004) results, learners use the first person pronoun more frequently than expert writers. An analysis of the context where we is used and of its functions can help to reveal the reasons for this overuse in the learner corpus.

# 4.2. Verbs that collocate with we

Table 2 shows the 40 verbs that most frequently collocate with we.

The high frequency of some of these verbs can be accounted for by their high use (sometimes deviant) by students to perform specific rhetorical functions (see section 4.4.). A few examples are worth commenting on. Have is the most frequent verb, because it includes the auxiliary form, but it is also very frequently used in the cluster ‘‘we have to’’ (see Table 3), where we is an inclusive pronouns (see 4.4.6.). The high frequency of want or need also reflects the use of these verbs with inclusive we as a solidarity strategy (see 4.4.6.). There are also cases of ‘‘inclusive we $^ +$ find, see, have’’ with existential meaning, i.e. ‘‘we have/we find/we see’’ are used instead of ‘‘there is’’ (see 4.4.6.). ‘‘Going to’’ always occurs in the cluster ‘‘we are going to’’ (see Table 3), used in the corpus to state purpose or to guide the reader through the text. The high frequency of think reflects the tendency of students to express their opinion in different parts of the report (see 4.4.8.).

We appears very frequently with ‘‘going to’’ (99 occurrences), ‘‘have to’’ (47 occurrences) and ‘‘want to’’ (36 occurrences). Other clusters where we appears include the verbs think, find, chosen, need, believe. Interestingly, most of these clusters were also found by Fortanet (2004) in academic lectures, which reveals the students’ lack of register awareness. These clusters will be related later on with the discourse functions of we in our corpus.

# 4.4. Discourse function

I adopt Kuo’s (1999, p. 130) definition of discourse function as ‘‘the function that a sentence containing a personal pronoun performs in the immediate discourse context’’, although the functions found in this research do not match those in Kuo (1999). Table 4 shows the distribution of occurrences of we in the learner corpus according to their discourse function. It also includes those cases that did not fit into any of the categories.

Table 4 Discourse function of we in student reports $( \% )$ .   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Functions</td><td>Raw</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td> Stating goals or purposes</td><td>57</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>Stating conclusions</td><td>87</td><td>6.2</td></tr><tr><td>Expressing final recommendation</td><td>68</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td>Guiding the reader through the text.</td><td>275</td><td>19.7</td></tr><tr><td>Recounting the research process</td><td>298</td><td>21.3</td></tr><tr><td>Showing results or findings</td><td>33</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Assuming shared experiences/knowledge, goals, beliefs</td><td>371</td><td>26.6</td></tr><tr><td>Emphasising or calling the reader&#x27;s attention</td><td>63</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Expressing opinion or volition.</td><td>108</td><td>7.8</td></tr><tr><td>Unclassified</td><td>36</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1396</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

This analysis revealed that we was used in the learner corpus for the following functions:

1. Stating goals or purposes   
2. Stating conclusions   
3. Expressing final recommendation   
4. Guiding the reader through the text   
5. Recounting the research process   
6. Showing results or findings   
7. Assuming shared experiences/knowledge, goals, beliefs   
8. Emphasising or calling the reader’s attention   
9. Expressing opinion or volition

In the remainder of this section I analyse the phraseological patterns involving we used to perform these functions in the learner corpus.

# 4.4.1. Stating goals or purposes

In order to state the purpose of the report or the purpose of the research at the end of the introduction, students usually resort to the structure ‘‘weþverb’’, but frequently in constructions not used by expert writers (e.g. ‘‘We are going to investigate’’). While several studies have shown that the phraseology of academic discourse is highly conventionalised and that expert writers use genre specific collocations (Charles, 2006; Gledhill, 2000; Luzo´n, 1996; Myers, 1992; Oakey, 2002), learners often use unconventional or unidiomatic expressions to state purpose. Luzo´n (1996) showed that the structure ‘‘we $^ +$ verb’’ used in research papers for the statement of purpose had specific features in terms of the verbs that collocated with we and the tenses in which these verbs tended to occur. Purpose in research papers is usually stated by verbs such as determine, assess, address, identify, study, analyse, report, present, describe, propose, discuss, compare, occurring in present tense or in infinitive. In fact, purpose is stated by highly conventionalised lexical bundles (e.g. ‘‘in this paper we report’’, ‘‘The purpose of this study is to determine’’) (Luzo´n, 1996; Myers, 1992) which are rarely used by students. The students in this research seem to be unaware of these conventions and use verbs that do not occur in the structure ‘‘we $^ +$ verb’’ when stating purpose, and frequently use the future or ‘‘going to’’ form:

(1) a. With this paper we want to give you a recommendation about how to create an appropriate website. b. In this paper we will make some valorations which help us to design our website. c. We are going to consider the advantages and disadvantages of designing a magnetic levitation train.

Some occurrences of we to express goal in parts of the text other than the introduction also involved rhetorical and semantic infelicities and lexical misuses:

(2) a. In fact, we purpose to build the main stations here. b. With this design we pretend to make the user have a competent image from us. c. With this example we try to make you realise that the best solution is the cheapest one.

In example (2a), ‘‘purpose’’ is used as a verb with the meaning of to intend. Although to purpose is in fact a verb with such meaning, it does not occur in academic writing to express goal, and its use in the students’ writing is probably the result of confusing word class and using the noun purpose. As for the use of ‘‘we pretend to’’ to express goal in example (2b), it is probably due to transference from the mother tongue, where pretender means to intend.

# 4.4.2. Stating conclusions

The most frequent expression to signal conclusions in the corpus was ‘‘we think’’ (19 occurrences), followed by ‘‘we believe’’ (7 occurrences) and ‘‘we (can) say’’ (6 occurrences). Other verbs and phrases that are used for this purpose are the following: decide, choose, come to the conclusion, reach the conclusion, reject, and conclude.

(3) a. In conclusion, we think the best option is PARC’s Gyricon e-paper because.. b. As a conclusion we can only say that the SiPix e-paper is perfect to make our lives more confortable. c. In conclusion, we have chosen AMP Testing, Inc (www.apmtesting.com) as the best web page.

The verbs that are used to signal conclusions are different from the verbs used by expert writers of research papers to state the main claim or the conclusion. In Luzo´n’s study (1996) the most frequent verbs used for this purpose were show, conclude, demonstrate, suggest and propose (e.g. ‘‘This study/this research $^ +$ has shown’’, ‘‘We propose/ conclude’’). The use of verbs such as show or suggest with a research subject (results, findings, research) is a rhetorical strategy to imply that the claim derives from the results (Hyland, 1998; Luzo´n, 1996). In the expert corpus analysed by Luzo´n (1996) there was no occurrence of decide, choose, come to the conclusion, reach the conclusion or reject to state conclusions. As for verbs such as think, believe or find, they were not used to signal conclusions but to hedge the author’s comments on the possibility that an interpretation, explanation or claim should be true or valid (e.g. ‘‘We think that such possibilities are unlikely’’).

In the learner corpus there were 6 occurrences of ‘‘we (can) conclude’’ in sections other than the conclusions, usually to sum up the preceding paragraph:

(4) So, we can conclude that electromagnetic suspension is a very versatile technology (To sum up, after presenting the features of the technology).

# 4.4.3. Expressing final recommendation

The most frequent verb to signal final recommendation in the corpus was recommend (26 occurrences), followed by suggest (6 occurrences). Although recommend and suggest are sometimes used correctly (e.g. ‘‘we would recommend the SiPix’s electronic paper’’), in other cases there are problems with the lexico-grammatical patterning of these verbs.

(5) a. We strongly do not recommend using Maglev Technology in Saragossa, because . b. We suggest to choose Fujitsu device.

# 4.4.4. Guiding the reader through the text

One of the most frequent uses of we in the learner corpus ( $1 9 . 7 \%$ of the occurrences) is in statements that signal the different parts/sections of the text and present the content of the subsequent discourse in order to make the structure of the text clear to the reader.

At the end of the introduction there are a high number of occurrences of we to outline the content of the paper. In this case the structure ‘‘we $^ +$ will/going to $^ +$ infinitive’’ (see example 6) is preferred by students, instead of $^ { 6 6 } \mathrm { w e } \mathrm { \textrm { + } }$ present tense’’, which is conventionally used by expert writers in the step ‘‘Indicating research article structure’’ (Swales, 1990). To indicate the parts of the paper where different aspects will be dealt with, students sometimes use verbs such as begin, continue, finish (e.g. ‘‘in this paper we begin explaining’’, ‘‘we will finish the paper making a recommendation’’). This suggests difficulties in using deictics to refer to the parts of the paper and adverbs to signal sequencing. A frequent mistake in the expressions including we to indicate structure at the end of the introduction is the use of unconventional lexical phrases involving a delexical verb and a discourse noun, e.g. ‘‘we will make an explanation’’, ‘‘we give a series of recommendations’’.

(6) First, we are going to talk about the main problems that this report tries to solve. Secondly, the report shows the requirements that an electronic paper has to carry out. After that, we will make an explanation about the different options that we have investigated.

When we occurs in any other part of the text to announce what comes next (either the contents of a section or the contents of the subsequent paragraphs), the verbs that follow it also tend to occur in the future form (‘‘will/going toþ verb’’). Some of the expressions used by the students to guide the reader through the text reflect their lack of register awareness. There are 43 occurrences of expressions that are very frequent in oral discourse but unusual in written discourse:

(7) a. Now we will move on to the second point. b. Now we will have a look at the most important features that an electronic paper displays. c. Apart from that, we should talk about the colour. d. Now we come to the cons that the construction would involve.

The verb talk, which is typical of the register of oral academic discourse (Fortanet, 2004) and would not be expected to occur in written genres, is the most frequently used to announce what comes next in the text (26 occurrences). But there are other verbs and verbþnoun combinations whose use is incorrect or which are inappropriate in written professional/academic genres. The following list shows some unconventional expressions found in the corpus:

(8) a. We will talk about the conclusions obtained b. We want to show a personal recommendation c. We are going to tell in a short brief the main ideas that we have extracted, d. We expose the advantages and disadvantages, e. We are going to explain the conclusions obtained

There are cases of semantic infelicities, such as the use of expose as a synonym of discuss, probably due to the transference from Spanish, where the verb exponer could be used in this context. There are also semantically inappropriate collocations (e.g. show $^ +$ recommendation, tell $^ +$ ideas).

In some cases we is used to present a table or to comment on the results displayed in a table. The most frequent structures found in research papers written by experts to refer readers to a table where results are presented are the following: ‘‘Table/Figure $\mathrm { X + }$ active verb’’ (e.g. ‘‘Table 1 shows the results.’’), ‘‘passive verb $^ +$ Table/Figure X’’ (‘‘Results are presented in Table 1’’) (Luzo´n, 1996). Since students are not familiar with these structures, they use expressions involving we to introduce tables and figures.

(9) a. After that, we are ready to make a comparison table. The table shows. b. We have created a comparative table with the main features of each site.

Similarly, the students taking part in the study do not seem to be familiar with the structures which expert writers use to comment on the results presented in tables in written discourse (e.g. ‘‘Table 3 shows/demonstrates that’’, ‘‘As Figure 1 shows’’), and they therefore resort to other structures for that purpose (see example 10), some of them typical of spoken discourse.

(10) a. If we have a look at the table above, we can see that the explanations about the.. b. We will centre on the comparative table shown at the beginning of the paper.

As in expert writing, ‘‘we $^ +$ verb’’ is used anaphorically to refer to preceding fragments of discourse. Students use a variety of formulae, with different metatextual expressions, verbs and verb tenses (present perfect or past tense). In these formulae several types of anomalous uses can be observed, i.e. the use of incorrect metatextual expressions, such as before, previously, instead of above, to refer to preceding stretches of text, the use of inappropriate verbs (i.e. exhibit, talk), the use of incorrect tenses.

(11) a. As we said before/previously b. As we have mentioned/exhibited before c. As we have told in the previous part of the paper

Finally, we is also used in deviant expressions whose function is to change the subject slightly by referring to a different but related topic. In example (12) students use ‘‘if we refer to’’ or ‘‘when we talk about’’ instead of as for, regarding, etc.

(12) a. If we refer to the accuracy of the web’s information, we can see a table with the different materials and their characteristics. b. When we talk about amounts of power, three displays are at the same level

# 4.4.5. Recounting the research process

We also occurs in the learner corpus to describe methodology, different steps of the research process, or actions related to the research process. First person plural pronouns are also very frequent in expert writing when recounting the research process (Kuo, 1999; Harwood, 2005b, 2005c). Harwood (2005b, p. 1213) points out that the use of pronouns to describe process helps writers to highlight their own contribution to the work and mark the methodology as their own. Although in expert writing this function is usually realised by ‘‘weþ material process verbs’’ in past tense, in the learner corpus different tenses are used (past tense, present perfect, present simple, future):

(13) a. Thirdly, we studied the accuracy and currency of the different webpage b. First, we have visited different web pages of other laboratories in order to compile.. c. The points that we will use to analyse and compare all the pages are shown below. d. We are going to measure this criterion in dots per inch

There were 13 occurrences of $^ { \circ \circ } \mathrm { W e } +$ present tense verb’’ in the learner corpus used to talk about ‘‘general principles’’ regarding method. This inclusive we was also found to occur in Harwood’s (2005c) corpus, as a way to guide the reader through general methodology and thus construct solidarity by suggesting that the procedures can be carried out by other members of the audience:

(14) When we analyse a website, we have to take into account that it is updated.

# 4.4.6. Showing results or findings

There are only 33 occurrences of we to show results or findings ( $2 . 4 \%$ of the occurrences). Although the most frequent phrase to perform this function is we found, students also used we realised, we find and we note.

(15) a. At E-ink’s and Fujitsu’s web page the values that we found are $1 { , } 2 \mathrm { m m }$ in the case of E-ink and $0 { , } 8 \mathrm { m m }$ in the case of Fujitsu. b. E-ink’s update time is $7 4 0 \mathrm { m s }$ , and we note that SiPix’s update time is $8 8 0 \mathrm { m s }$ .

4.4.7. Assuming shared experiences/knowledge, goals, beliefs

Most of the cases of inclusive we in the corpus fall into this category. The most frequent use of we in the learner corpus $( 2 6 . 6 \% )$ is as a generic first person pronoun or as a proxy representing a larger group of people. In many cases, passive voice or sentences with inanimate subjects would be preferred in expert writing, as in example (16), where ‘‘This page is orderly and easy to understand’’ is clearly a better option:

(16) a. Electronic paper is getting now closer than ever to changing the way we read. b. This page is orderly and we can understand it quite well.

Inclusive we was often used to refer not to people in general but to a smaller group, such as the audience of the paper (139 occurrences). In these cases, we collocated very often with need to, have to, don’t need to, want to, should. We is used with modals and semi-modals as a solidarity strategy intended to involve the reader and build a working relationship.

(17) Fujitsu is a well-known brand in electronics, so if we want to ensure our success with our Mobtronic PDA, we must choose Fujitsu.

There were 42 occurrences of ‘‘inclusive we $^ +$ verb (usually find, see and have)’’ which have an existential meaning.

(18) a. Nowadays we can find a wide range of different displays. b. This site is well structured and at the top we have a toolbar with deployable links.

c. In Fujitsu, we have an e-paper with a slimness of $0 . 8 \mathrm { m m }$ .   
d. Related to the previous characteristic we have the ease to use.

In these cases expert writers tend to use other devices that make the author less visible. ‘‘We can find’’ in example (18a) and ‘‘we have’’ in example (18b) could be replaced by ‘‘there is’’. In examples (18c) and (18d) ‘‘we have’’ simply denotes the existence of a particular state of affairs, and in both cases there are more appropriate expressions (‘‘Fujitsu’s e-paper is $0 . 8 \mathrm { m m }$ thick’’, ‘‘The ease of use is related to the previous characteristic’’).

We need is sometimes used in our corpus instead of an impersonal structure such as ‘‘it is necessary to’’, ‘‘X is necessary’’ (21 occurrences), showing the students’ tendency to underuse adjectives as a device to express modality:

(19) a. For movement of the train we need permanent magnetic field. b. To polarise railway we need to make an electric current on railway with this current.

Harwood (2005c) found that the phrases we need and we have were often used in Computing Science and Economics research papers to guide the audience through the complex mathematical explanations, proofs, and models authors needed to expound. Example (20) is provided by Harwood to illustrate such point:

(20) Letting Yt denote aggregate production of intermediate goods, we have $\mathrm { Y t } = \mathrm { N F } ( \mathrm { k t } / \mathrm { N }$ , ztHt/n) (ECON 9)

Harwood (2005c, p. 361) also points out that we have can ‘‘serve to enhance the reader-friendliness of the text in Economics RAs when propositions are introduced’’, e.g. ‘‘we have the following proposition’’. These uses seem to be a discipline-related convention which helps to convey a more informal and friendlier tone in Computing Science and Economics research papers. The use of we need and we have in the learner corpus is clearly different, it being probably related to the students’ tendency to use features of spoken discourse in written discourse.

# 4.4.8. Emphasising or calling the reader’s attention

Writers of research papers use phrases such as ‘‘it should be noted’’ to draw the reader’s attention to a specific aspect. The verbs used for this purpose in Luzo´n’s corpus of research papers (1996) were note $( 8 3 . 3 3 \%$ of the occurrences) emphasize, notice, point out, stress. The verbs occurred in one of the following structures: ‘‘Note that’’, ‘‘it is interesting/important, etc. to note that’’, ‘‘we note that’’, ‘‘It should be noted that’’.

In the learner corpus we was used 63 times $( 4 . 5 \% )$ to appeal to the reader, and it only collocated with note in six instances. The most frequent verb used for this purpose was the verb say (23 occurrences), usually in the cluster we must say that (typical of oral discourse) (see example 21), followed by emphasize, make it clear, highlight, bear in mind, comment on, forget, add and consider. The verbs used to call the reader’s attention in expert discourse collocate with adjectives such as important, interesting, or with the modal verb should. In the learner corpus they collocated with should but also with would like to (‘‘We would like to point out/to make it clear’’) can (‘‘We can/could emphasize’’), have to (‘‘we have to comment on’’), must (‘‘we must say/highlight that’’), need to (‘‘we need to add that’’), can’t and mustn’t (‘‘we can’t forget’’, ‘‘we mustn’t forget’’).

(21) Finally, we must say that E-ink offer is very complete.

Again, these collocations, which do not tend to occur in expert writing, show the students’ lack of awareness of the phraseology of such discourse. Although the use of modals is highly conventionalised in professional and academic discourse (Thompson, 2002), our students are not aware of the functions of modals in this type of discourse.

There are some occurrences of ‘‘weþverb (usually the verbs see or say)’’ that are used as a sort of hedge, either to emphasise or to minimize a claim, but would be omitted in expert writing.

(22) The only disadvantage that we see is that clarifying links do not appear within texts.

Flottum et al. (2006) observed that see, which they regard as a reader-inclusion verb, is very frequent in Linguistics to open up for reader interaction. For instance, when writing ‘‘we see from the context that’’, authors are asking the reader(s) to follow their observation. However, in the occurrences of we see in our learner corpus (see example 22), we is not an inclusive, but an exclusive pronoun, and the verb see is used to indicate epistemic achievement.

# 4.4.9. Expressing opinion or volition

A high number of occurrences of we $( 7 . 8 \% )$ collocate with verbs expressing opinion or volition (e.g. think, believe, want). There are 54 occurrences of the collocation we think in the corpus, and 12 of the collocation we believe. Although we think/we believe occur very frequently to introduce the conclusion or recommendation, opinion verbs (think, believe, find, consider) occur in fact in any section of the student reports.

(23) a. As we can see E-Ink is thinner than Fujitsu. We believe that this is why the Fujitsu’s ink can reproduce the colour. b. Finally, since we consider that the contact with the company is very important.

The high frequency of such verbs can be accounted for by several factors. One of them is the nature of the report they have to write: students were asked to evaluate, conclude and recommend, and they associate these actions with opinion verbs. Another reason for the overuse of $^ { 6 6 } \mathrm { w e } +$ opinion verb’’ is the underuse of other linguistic devices to express epistemic modality, i.e. modal verbs, adjectives and adverbs such as possible, possibly, probably, likely.

There are also examples of we with volition verbs used to express functions not found in papers by expert writers. There are 53 occurrences of we want and 5 occurrences of we wish in the corpus. We wish is used as a sort of ending formula. Since most students taking part in this study lack genre awareness, they have problems with the moves used at the beginning and end of texts, and thus finish their writings in unconventional ways. Example (24) is the last sentence of one of the reports:

(24) We wish the need for the implementation of this kind of trains in our city to become more evident in the future.

# 5. Conclusions and pedagogical implications

The present study aimed at analysing how learners use the pronoun we in academic writing, and more specifically at determining the discourse functions of this pronoun in the writing of EFL Engineering students. The objective was to ascertain whether students were aware of how expert writers use first person plural pronouns strategically to perform specific discourse functions.

The study has highlighted the difficulties many NNSs students face when they need to write academic and professional genres. Generic conventions and language choices are determined by the epistemology and social ontology of the community that owns the genre. Since undergraduate students are novice members of the community, it is difficult for them to grasp such generic conventions and to use language accordingly. The results show that Spanish Engineering students are unaware of how expert writers use first person pronouns to construct their authorial identities as competent and knowledgeable members of a community.

The number of occurrences of first person pronouns in the learner corpus was higher than in expert writing, which confirms findings from previous studies regarding the higher visibility of the author and the higher use of spoken language features in NNS students’ writing (Neff et al., 2004; Petch-Tyson, 1998). Spanish Engineering students fail to understand the implications of authorial presence in the genre and are not adept at using first person pronouns to convey authority to different degrees and at resorting to other linguistic devices to reduce author’s visibility when necessary.

The study has shown the different purposes for which the students writing the reports use first person pronouns and has revealed that they are not aware of the wide range of rhetorical purposes for which the first person pronoun is used in academic writing. Although lexical phrases involving we occur in the corpus performing functions such as stating purpose or making structure clearer to the reader, they are rarely used to perform some other functions found in academic writing, and, by contrast, they occur in cases where expert authors would not be visible. Even in the cases where we is used to perform the same functions as in expert writing, the phraseological patterns that realise these functions are usually deviant. Students are unaware that language choices in genres are rhetorically motivated, intended to meet the communicative needs of the genre in question. The study has also shown that Spanish undergraduate EFL students have problems with phraseology at a more general level. This explains many of the errors involving collocations, lexico-grammatical patterning of verbs, or semantic misuse.

The present study has also confirmed results from previous research that reveals students preference for features of spoken discourse (e.g. Gilquin & Paquot, 2007). Although this seems to be a feature shared by learners from different cultural backgrounds, in our case some occurrences of expressions typical of spoken discourse could be accounted for by L2 instruction. During the course students get instruction on oral presentations and they probably transfer expressions from this genre, not realising that working with a different genre and a different register calls for different linguistic expressions.

A possible limitation of this work, already pointed out in Section 3.2., springs from the corpora that have been used for comparison. Although engineering RAs and reports share disciplinary values, the engineering report is a clientoriented genre, which may result in specific uses of the pronoun we that are not found or are less frequent in RAs. Further research could use a corpus of expert reports to compare authorial presence (frequency, use and phraseology) with student reports. Another issue is the use of a simulation-based approach to L2 writing instruction and to the compilation of the learner corpus. Students are certainly aware that the audience described in the task is not a real audience, and therefore, they will probably feel less constrained to position themselves in relation to that audience. However, I consider that simulation-based writing provides an ideal tool to raise the students’ awareness of generic features and that the corpus is representative of academic writing by Spanish EFL Engineering students. Future research could interview students to get insight into their motivations for using the pronoun we, and into how their perception of the audience for whom they are writing influences their linguistic choices. Despite these limitations, this research provides useful information on non-expert behaviour and phraseology in student reports and can be replicated to analyse the phraseological patterns used by students to perform rhetorical functions in other genres.

The findings of this study have interesting implications for teaching academic writing. Solving the problems outlined above involves helping students develop advanced academic literacy, which encompasses a proficient level of English and knowledge of how linguistic options are used rhetorically in their discipline. Previous research has put forward consciousness-raising activities as the most appropriate way to help students use authorial presence effectively (Hyland, 2002b; Harwood, 2005a) and to address the learners’ lack of register awareness (Gilquin et al., 2007). These include activities that raise students’ awareness of how they use the language themselves, activities where students engage in the analysis of features in expert texts, and activities that help learners become aware of register variation. I suggest that when analysing personal pronouns in expert texts, students should be asked to pay attention to the co-text of the pronoun, to the phraseological patterns of which they are part, and to how these patterns help to achieve specific rhetorical strategies. Hyland (2002b) advocates for the use of concordance programs to enable students to look for patterns of use and Harwood (2005a) proposes using both learner and expert corpora of target genres. These activities should be part of an approach to academic writing in higher education based on three keystones: genre analysis, expert corpora and learner corpora. To really help students become competent writers in their discipline it is necessary to familiarise them with the conventions of their disciplinary community, develop their rhetorical awareness and focus on the linguistic resources on which expert writers draw for performing such functions. In addition, it is also essential to analyse student genres in order to address the specific problems that NNSs encounter, by showing them, or making them become aware of, their lexico-grammatical errors and rhetorical infelicities in context.
