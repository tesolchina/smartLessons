Disciplinary epistemology

Signalling nouns (SNs, hereinafter) as grammatical metaphors serve as effective clues to disciplinary epistemology. Based on self-built corpora, this study explores disciplinary variation in the use of SNs by investigating marketing and economics research articles (RAs, hereinafter). The results show that marketing RAs employ SNs with significantly higher frequency than economics RAs. In terms of grammatical patterns, marketing RAs prefer the $^ { \mathfrak { s } } \mathbf { N } +$ $_ { t o }$ -infinitive" pattern, whereas economics RAs tend to use the $^ { \mathfrak { s } } \mathbf { N } +$ that-clause" structure. Semantically, marketing researchers prefer modal fact and idea nouns to show a greater tendency for writer visibility, greater interest in factors influencing consumer purchasing behaviors, and the more empirical and experimental nature of marketing. In contrast, economics researchers prefer fact and idea nouns to explore the decision-making process of economic agents, and reveal the more hypothetical, econometrical, and abstract reasoning nature of this discipline. The choices of SNs reflect distinct disciplinary epistemologies between marketing and economics. This study sheds new light on the significance of SNs in revealing disciplinary variations, and creates a database of detailing the characteristics of SNs used in both disciplines, which can aid EFL learners and EAP practitioners to better use SNs to construct interpersonal relations with readers in academic writing.

# 1. Introduction

Abstract nouns have received considerable attention from applied linguists in recent decades as a significant way of investigating disciplinary variation. They function as cohesive and evaluative devices in constructing disciplinary knowledge and can express authorial stance (e.g., Benitez-Castro, 2021; Charles, 2007; Dong et al., 2020; Jiang, 2022; Jiang & Hyland, 2018) toestablish social relations with readers. As a sub-set of abstract nouns, signalling nouns (SNs, hereinafter) are usually lexical superordinates equipped with both constant and variable meanings (e.g., atitde, dificulty, result) (Flowerdew & Forest, 2015). The variable meanings of SNs can get extended in the context through lexico-grammatical patterns. This study focuses on the post-nominal complement constructions (i.e., $\mathbf { S N + }$ that-clause, $\mathbf { S N } + t$ o-infinitive, $\mathbf { S N + }$ % $^ +$ ing), as they are acknowledged as significant and frequently used grammatical

constructions in establishing intra-clausal cataphoric links between SNs and the succeeding discourse flow (Flowerdew & Forest, 2015;   
Jiang, 2022; Schmid, 2000).

Theoretically speaking, SNs are \*instances of the broader phenomenon which Halliday calls grammatical metaphor" Flowerdew & Forest, 2015, p. 17), which packages aclause into a nominal structure. Grammatical metaphor can create "technical taxonomies" and "chains of reasoning (Halliday, 2004, pp. 60-61), and is \*probably the most important concern as far as academic discourse is concerned" (Dreyfus et al., 2016, p. 68). The importance of SNs as grammatical metaphors has triggered studies on disciplinary variation between soft and hard fields (e.g., Flowerdew & Forest, 2015). However, scant research examines disciplines with closer epistemologies such as marketing and economics.

Disciplinary epistemology refers to \*the actual form and focus of knowledge within a discipline" (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p.23), closely linked to disciplinary culture. The reciprocal relationship betwen disciplinary culture and knowledge form can be clearly seen in the arguments below:

In practice, academic cultures and disciplinary epistemology are inseparably intertwined. The flow of causation is not one way, rather the relationship is mutull infused: disciplinary knowledge forms are to a large extent constituted and instantiated sociall. Meanwhile their constitution has a reciprocal effect on the cultures from which they spring (ibid).

Although marketing has been observed as a discipline with the model-developing and empirical nature, and the nature of economics is more speculative, theoretical, and model-testing (Bondi, 2006; Hemais, 2001; Hyland, 199), their distinct epistemic conventions have not been well adressed. These conventions may influence the way of knowledge construction, negotiation, and dissemination (Malavasi & Mazzi, 2010), which may in turn constrain the choice of SNs.

Therefore, this study aims to explore how the intra-sentential use of SNs signal disciplinary variation in marketing and economics research articles (RAs, hereinafter) by addressing the following research questions:

1. How are the grammatical patterns of SNs used in marketing and economics RAs?   
2. How are the semantic categories of SNs used in marketing and economics RAs?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Signalling nouns

The investigation of SNs is developed on studies of abstract nouns under different terminologie. Halliday and Hasan's (1976) work on general nouns' and Winter's (1977) study on 'type 3 vocabulary' have laid foundations for later research under other terms, including 'anaphoric nouns (Francis, 1986), status nouns (Hunston, 1989), carier nouns' (Ivanic, 1991), 'metalanguage nouns (Winter, 1992), labeling nouns' (Francis, 1994), shell nouns Schmid, 200), and general nouns' (Mahlberg, 2005). Among the various abstract nouns, shell nouns (Schmid, 2000) are acknowledged as "probably the most frequently cite terms for these types of nouns to date (Jiang, 2022, p. 20), which include a wide range and a delicate classification of these nouns. However, this study considers Flowerdew and Forest's (2015) cassification of SNs more apropriate for the reason that the data they rely on only focalizes on disciplinary discourse, which corresponds to the research purpose of this study and provides a rather tailor-made classifying guideline for our investigation.

Drawing on Halliday's insights on grammatical metaphor, Flowerdew and Forest (2015) extend the notion of SNs to include nominalizations derived from verbs, adjectives, and nouns of logical coherence relations (p.17), and classfy SNs into six semantic groups (Table 1). The firs thre catgories lael the prouct f actions r events (ct), mental xperience (idea), and verl activities or other forms of semiosis (locution). Fact SNs represent information or realities about the world, corresponding to non-modalized propositions or mental and verbal activities. Modal fact SNs provide modalized information of probability, usualit, obligatorines, inclination, and ability. Circumstantial fact SNs present circumstantial information in terms of where, when, how, and why it i being presented.

Regarding SN membership, it is important to note that not all abstract nouns occurring in $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { * } \mathbf { S } \mathbf { N } +$ complement clauses"' are counted as SNs. Flowerdew and Forest (2015) propose "encapsulation' as the principal criterion for SN identification, suggesting "equative encapsulation with lexical specifics provided elsewhere in the text" (p. 48). More specificll, abstract nouns followed by adverbial to-infinitive clauses of purpose and postmodifying that clauses are not counted as SNs. For instance, to assgn patients (example 1) functions as the purpose clause of \*using this information', and \*that we present in the next paragraph .. (example 2) is a post modifying that clause. These two clauses fail to form a semantic equivalence with their head nouns infomation and resuls respectively.

Table 1 Examples of SNs (Flowerdew & Forest, 2015, pp. 29-33).   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Act</td><td>Process, change, attempt, adjustment, regulation, effort, reaction</td></tr><tr><td>Idea</td><td>Theory, idea, assumption, prediction, view, concept, belief</td></tr><tr><td>Locution</td><td>Argument, conclusion, proposition, disclosure, suggestion</td></tr><tr><td>Fact</td><td>Fact, proof, case, evidence, effect, result, ground, example</td></tr><tr><td>Modal fact</td><td>Chance, possibility, ability, need, option, tendency, propensity</td></tr><tr><td>Circumstantial fact</td><td>Way, method, approach, pattern, technique, tool, moment, extent</td></tr></table></body></html>

With respect to SN classification, some SNs may be categorized into different semantic groups across their contexts. The noun point is a case in point. Poin refersto  loction noun by pojecting the ontent of verbal activitie i example (3), whereas point in extract (4) is counted as a circumstantial fact noun representing information in terms of how it is presented.

(1) .. in the self-managed system, they use this information to assign patients. [Economics]   
(2) In the more detailed results that we present in the next paragraph ... [Marketing]   
(3) Our point that a principal might choose agents for incentive reasons is distinct from the focus in this liteature . [Marketing]   
(4) .. it would confuse other decision makers to the point that they might not trust or use the model. [Marketing]

# 2.2. Signalling nouns in disciplinary variation

Previous studies on SNs or other abstract nouns predominantly investigate isciplinary variation with clear disciplinary boundaries (e.g., Benitez-Castro, 2021; Charles, 2007; Flowerdew & Forest, 2015; Jiang, 2022; Jiang & Hyland, 2018; Liu & Deng, 2017). For instance, Charles (2007) compares disciplinary variations in the use of the noun that pattern in stance construction between a social science (politics/intenational rlations) and a natural science (materias science) discipline, pointing out that the detected variations are due to interdisciplinary differences in reearch practices and knowledge construction. Benitez-Castro (2021) explores how problem and way are used in student writing from disciplines of sociology, busines, and engineering. Although Jiang and Hyland (2018) examine the use of abstract nouns in eight disciplines, they draw conclusions simply from the perspective of soft and hard knowledge groups, without further emphasizing differences within soft or hard disciplinary groups.

It is noteworthy that Flowerdew and Forest (2015) explore SNs in natural and social sciences, using a 0.61-million-word corpus from three academic genres (lectures, journals, and textboos). Their results show that social sciences contribute approximately $7 0 \%$ of SNs, whereas natural sciences account for only $3 0 \%$ . Both divisions allocate the most SNs to the category of facts and the least to modal facts.

Prior research demonstrates that SNs or other abstract nouns are important linguistic devices to reveal disciplinary variations. Nevertheles, most studies are more interested in distant disciplinary groups with distinct disiplinary epistemologies, yet few studies focus on the discrepancies between theoretcll and epistemologically related disciplines. To ill the gap, this study endeavors to explore disciplinary variations in SNs uses by investigating marketing and economics RAs.

# 3. Data and method

# 3.1. Corpus

This study is based on a 3-million-word corpus of 278 RAs published in 2016 across marketing and economics. RAs were downloaded from six prestigious jounals (Appendix A) with relatively high impact factors and rankings released by JCR (Journal Citation Reports). The imbalance of artice in each discipline would not influence frequency comparion, since the final ra frequencies f SNs were normalised (raw frequency/corpus s $\mathrm { i z e } \times 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 )$ , grounded on the claim that \*normalization is a way to adjust raw frequency counts from texts of diffeent lengths so that they can be compared accurately (Biber et al., 1998, p.263).After data cleaning, all the texts were tagged with part-of-speech through Treetagger which can achieve $9 6 . 5 3 \%$ accuracy (Schmid, 1999). Finally, the two sub-corpora were constructed and are referred to as CMRA (Corpus of marketing research articles) and CERA (Corpus of economics research articles). The detailed corpus information is presented in Table 2.

# 3.2. Analytical procedures

Three steps were involved to obtain al the qualified SNs and to best interpret results: concordances extracting and annotating, intra-coding and inter-coding, and data analysis. In the first step, regular expressions of the three constructions $\mathbf { S N + }$ that-cl, $\mathbf { S N + }$ toinfinitive, and $\mathbf { S N + }$ of+ -ing-cl) were searched and annotated from the tagged corpus for potential SNs through AntConc (Anthony, 2020).2 Building on the principle of "encapsulation" mentioned in the last section, this study elaborates the following situations to exclude non-SNs during the annotation process.

a. Some verbs such as challenge, experience, and result were wrongly tagged as nouns by Treetagger. b. Nouns whose meanings are constant across contexts (e.g., government, society, commsson) and referring to concrete etities were not SNs.

c. When examining nouns in the $^ { \mathrm { N + } }$ to-infinitive pattern, abstract nouns as objects to causative verbs such as force, use and allow, have higher possibility to be counted as non-SNs (e.g., information in example 1).   
d. Nouns occurring in the $\mathrm { ~ N ~ } +$ that-cl pattern followed by postmodifying clauses were discarded (e.g., results in example 2).   
e. When examining potential SNs in $^ { * } N +$ of-ing' clauses, nouns functioning as the prepositional head of the post-modifying gerundive phrase were not an SN (e.g., impact in example 5).   
f. Nouns occurring in \*prefabricated patterns" (Flowerdew & Forest, 2015, p. 59) (e.g., sense in in the sense that) were not SNs.   
g. Nouns seem to be SNs at first sight but fail to form semantic equivalence with thir complement clauses (see reason in example 6).

It is notable that abivalent signalling noun (ibid, p.55 typically licenses two complements, only one of which is strictl quative. The two structural analys f reason +toinintiv is a case in point. The first i that the nsuing infintive clause f reson functions as an appostive clase, in this cas rso is counted as an . he scond is that the toitive funtions a  ative clase, in this case reason being not counted as an SN (example 6).3

(5) The impact of opening weekend viewership on viewership in subsequent weekends falls pproximately exponentiall over time. [Economics] (6) Plainly, there is no reason to confine ourselves to binary decisions by the firm. [Economics]

In the second step, inter-coder and intra-coder reliability tests were conducted upon Cohen's (1960) kappa statistics to increase the reliability of SNs identification. As for the inter-coder measurement, two of the three authors independently coded $5 7 . 2 \%$ of concordances extracted through the three grammatical structures in the CERA. The intra-coder reliability was conducted by the first author re-coding the SNs two weeks after the initial coding. The results showed that both the inter-coder and intra-coder agreement were highly consistent, with 0.96 and 0.94 respectively. In view of the high consistency of both coders, the remaining concordances of SNs were coded individually. Disagreements were discussed until raching consensus. The identified SNs were then classified according to the six semantic categories of SNs. When the identified SN was not listed in Flowerdew and Forest's (2015) checkliss, we would categorize it based on the identification principles.

In the third step, data analysis including statistical measures as well as collocation and concordance analysis was conducted. To begin with statistical measures were primarily conducted to identify frequency and effec size differences between the two sub. corpora. Log-likelihood (LL hereafter) is used to determine statistical significance, since it \*makes no assumption of a normal distribution, with Chi-square becoming unreliable when the number of examples isvery small (McEnery & Hardie, 2012, p.52). In order to reduce noisy information, this study chose a minimum LL measure of 6.63 (equivalent to $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 1 \dot { } } \end{array}$ ) as the significant value. It is noteworthy that p-value only informs the preence or asence f a signficnt ifferce, but fail to show how big a give difference is. Therefore, log rati Hardie, 2014), an \*effec-ie" measure highlighting the ractical mportance f oserved effts and rereenting the size f the difference, was also used to complement L. The minimum threshold of log ratio s set to be 1.0, indicating that the relative frequency for a dataset is at least twice that of the comparison data. Both measures can be calculated through an online LL and effect size calculator designed by Rayson (2016).

Collocation and concordance analysis were then simultaneously carried out in the procedure of data analysis and results inter. preting. When analyzing colocation, MI (mutual information) was used to \*calculate collcations by indicating the trength of the cooccurrencerelationship between a node and collocate" (McEnery & Hardie, 2012, p. 247). An MI score of "3 or higher can be taken to be significant" (Hunston, 2002, p. 71). To be more specific in this step, the MI score was calculated between an SN and is collocates when analyzing results (Section 4). In addition, concordance analysis was also employed to explore the wider context of SNs and their collocate, which could help signal disciplinary epistemologies and reveal disciplinary variations betwen marketing and economics (see discussions in Section 5).

# 4.1. Overall SN uses by grammatical pattern

As can be seen in Table 3, marketing RAs employ SNs with significantly higher frequency than economics RAs $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 0 1 . 6 1 $ $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } <$ 0.0001; log ratio $= 0 . 3 5$ , with a preference for the pattern $^ { \mathfrak { s o } } \mathbf { N } +$ to-infinitive", whereas economics authors prefer $^ { \mathfrak { s o N } + }$ that-clause".

# 4.2. SN uses by semantic category

Among the three high-frequency SN types (modal fact, idea, and fact nouns) shown in Fig 1, marketing RAs employ more modalfact and ideas nouns than economics RAs, but use fewer fact nouns which are extensively utilized in economics RAs. That-clauses predominantly generate SNs representing facts and ideas, whereas both of $^ +$ -ing clauses and to-infinitive clauses largely express modal facts and ideas (Table 4). There are four shared nouns (eidence, fact, abilit, probability) between the two disciplines (Table 5), and the remaining high-frequency SNs in the top 10 list are more discipline-specific in one sub-corpus than the other. The following analysis further explores high-frequency SNs to signal disciplinary variation between marketing and economics.

# 4.2.1. Modal facts

Modal SNs are the most frequent category in the two sub-corpora. Results show that the CMRA employs significantly more modl SNs than the CERA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 6 9 . 6 9 $ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 7 5$ , particularly the repeated uses of likelihood, willingness, and ability (Fig. 2).

The occurrence of likelihood is more than eight times more common in the CMRA compared to the CERA $( \mathrm { L L } = 2 2 0 . 9 5 $ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ log ratio $= 3 . 1 1$ ), and probability is significantly more frequent in the CERA compared to the CMRA $( \mathrm { L L } = 9 0 . 6 5 $ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 4 7 $ . In the CMRA, the two strong collocates of likelihood - branding $( \mathbf { M I } = 3 . 8 1 $ ) and ANOVA $( \mathbf { M I } = 5 . 8 1 $ ) signal that marketing researchers show great interest in examining the proces of branding (instance 7), and employing statistical methods such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to present more reliable results (instance 8).

(7) We do find a more positive efect of the hard-discounter share on the likelihood of using store-banner branding for economy tiers $( 8 6 = 0 . 2 2 7 , \mathfrak { p } < 0 . 0 1 )$ than for premium tiers. [Marketing]   
(8) A one-way ANOVA on the likelihood of purchasing the compromise option yielded similar results: the male dyads indicated lower likelihood of purchasing the middle option than the male ..[Marketing]   
(9) In summary, in this experiment an increase in the itial number of buyers reduces the probability of buying a house and raises the probability of selling a house. [Economics]   
(10) Similarly, being the runner-up (instead of third place) increases the probability of running again from 31.9 percent to 36.3 percent in Indian state elections and the probability of winning from 7.8 percent to 11.2 percent. [Economics]

The frequent probabilit-of pattern shows that economics researchers use the econometric paradigm to testify model, as evidenced by the cluster th robabilit f bying/ellin (34 entrie) in example (9. The custer incres th probabilit f (17 etries) refrcesthe understanding of economists' interest in investigating mathematical relations between variables (example 10). More than ${ \bf 1 0 \% }$ of instances of the probability-of pattern show writer presence in the CERA, but more instances $\left( 1 3 . 4 3 \% \right)$ of this pattern convey authorial presence in the CMRA.

The CMRA uses willingness four times more than in the CERA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 3 6 . 9 0$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 2 . 3 7$ ), with $3 6 . 1 0 \%$ of instances of the willingness-to pattern expressing authorial presence. Around $3 6 \%$ of the occurrences of this pattern appear in the cluster consumers willingnessto pay (15 times, as shown in example (11). However, the willingnes-to pattern is far less employed in the CERA with $7 . 9 4 \%$ revealing authorial presence. The importance of marginal is highlighted (example 12), which is a strong collocate of willingness $ { \mathrm { T } }  { \mathrm { I I } } = 7 . 2 1 $

Fig. 2. Distribution of typical modal SNs (pmw).

Ability is another comparatively more frequent SN in the CMRA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 8 . 3 3$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 6 3$ ), with $1 7 . 3 5 \%$ of the abilit-to patten denoting the self-representation of marketing researchers. Firms (14 times),consumers (8 times), and advertising (8 times) are ability's important collocates, which also signal the research subjects of markting, such as consumers' abilit to find a desired brand (example 13). Economics research subjects are mainly signaled by the colocates their (24 times) referring to macroeconomic agents such as govenment or state regulating the operations of firms (example 14), and microconomic agents such as firms (8 times) making economics decisions.

# 4.2.2. Ideas

Idea SNs representing conscious and mental states are represented by mental process clauses involving a human participant named Sensor who fees, thinks, wants, or perceives, and a Phenomenon which is felt, thought, wanted or perceived Halliday & Mat thiessen, 2014, p. 251). The CMRA $\mathrm { ( L L = 1 0 3 . 6 8 }$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 6 8 \mathrm { \check { } }$ contains significantly more idea SNs than the CERA (Fig. 3). The CMRA overwhelmingly uses SNs showing volition -motivation and desire, whereas the CERA shows a preference for testing a hypothesis or assumption.

Statistical analysis shows that motivation is over 32 times more common in the CMRA than the CERA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 6 3 . 7 8$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 6 . 8 7 \mathrm { \cdot }$ , and desire is also significantly more frequent in the CMRA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 2 . 2 9 $ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 9 4$ ). Both SNs occur the most in the $N \mathrm { . }$ to pattern, with many instances indicating marketing authorial presence (Appendix B). Marketing researchers also prefer presenting the sensor of the motivation such as customers (example 15). In contrast economics researchers pay les attention to the sensor of desire, only stating the phenomenon (example 16).

(15) Likewise, customers who have a greater motivation to seek information, are more tech savvy .. [Marketing] (16) The desire to satisfy the working clases from one military regime to the next can be considered as aform of autocratic populism ... [Economics]

As shown in Fig. 3, the frequency of hypothesis is nearly the same in the two sub-corpora $( \mathrm { L L } = 0 . 0 5$ $\mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 0 6$ Although both disciplines highlight hypothesis they show variations in validating a hypothesis. Marketing researchers prefer finding literature support or empirical evidence to test a hypothesis as can be noted in the cluster evidence for the hypothesis that (example 17). In contrast economics researchers directly support or reject a hypothesis through thir own statisical analysis (example 18). Author presence of the hypothesis-that pattern is more visible in the CERA $( 5 3 . 3 3 \% )$ than the CMRA $( 2 8 . 0 5 \% )$

(17) .. there is ittle empirical evidence for the hypothesis that a higher rate of progress is demotivating. Marketing (18) ... we reject the hypothesis that the cost-sharing coefficients are $) ( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ... [Economics]

Assumption is overwhelmingly more frequent in the CERA $( \mathrm { L L } = 6 4 . 6 9 $ A $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 1 . 7 0$ , and is commonly used in the Nthat clause. Around $1 7 \%$ of the assumption-that patterns show authorial presence in the CERA. Disciplinary objects and procedures of economics can beexplored through the collocates or the clusters ofassumption. This SN tends to be pre-modified by elements clarifying economics tradition such as Ricardian $( \mathbf { M I } = 7 . 2 9 )$ , or co-occurs with model $( \mathbf { M I } = 4 . 5 )$ . For instance, example (19) reflects the Ricardian tradition of economists in making assumptions, and highlights that \*all the models are built with assumptions" (Mankiw, 2018, p. 22). Economics rearchers also prefer the cluster under th assumption that (36 entries) to report the reearch findings relevant to the assumption made before $( 4 7 . 2 2 \%$ of instances, example 20).

Marketing researchers only employ $1 0 . 1 7 \%$ of instances of the assumption-that pattern to reveal writer visibility, which is lower than economics researchers. It is notable that marketing researchers regard investigating consumer behaviors as the central topic (example 21), as shown by the collocate consumers (7 entries, $\mathrm { M I } = 5 . 0 3$

(19) Our model has two key elements. (a) We make the Ricardian assumption that products can be ordered by the scarcity of quality capabilities. [Economics]   
(20) Results in the first row simulate hiring under the assumption that employers see only workers resumes, not who was rferred. [Economics]   
(21) At the core of the compromise efect lie the assumption that consumers can recognize the inherent trade-offs between product options and deliberately make cognitively demanding comparisons between them ...[Marketing]

# 4.2.3. Facts

Fact SNs in the CERA are employed significantly more in the CERA than the CMRA $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 0 7 . 4 0$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 8 9$ Fig. 4 shows that evidence is more frequent in the CMRA and fact in the CERA.

The typical fact noun evidence is used slightly more frequently in the CMRA, with no statistical difference $( \mathrm { L L } = 0 . 5 6$ $\mathsf { p } > 0 . 0 5$ ; log ratio $= 0 . 1 1 \dot { }$ ). Instances of the evidence that pattern are more frequent in marketing $( 2 7 . 9 2 \% )$ than in economics $( 2 4 . 4 6 \%$ to reveal the self-representation of researchers. In the CMRA, thevidence that pate co-occurs the most with the verb provide (106 times) and ind (45 times), revealing marketing researchers' preference for using evidence to justify their research (example 22). The empirical and experimental nature of marketing can be noted by empirical (15 times) and experiment (12 times) as collocates of evidence. I i worth mentioning that the concordances of evidence in marketing are mainly customer-centered, as exemplified by consumers (10 times) and customer (5 times). In contrast, economics researchers favor finding evidence (31 times) more than providing evidence (27 times). They rely on different kinds of evidence, e.g., suggestive (11 entries), empirical (7 entries), and strong (7 entries, shown in example 23)

(22) Experiment 4 provided converging evidence that the desire to preserve savings was associated with responsibilit, using an experimental game with real costs (Hj). [Marketing] (23) However, we also find strong evidence that referrals contain information about worker performance and turnover. [Economics]

It is intriguing that the SN fact occurs four times as frequently in the CERA than the CMRA (log ratio $= 1 . 9 2$ ), with a highly significant difference $( \mathrm { L L } = 1 9 8 . 2 1 $ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ . Less than $5 \%$ of instances of this SN show authorial presence in the two sub-corpora. Verbs occurring before the fact that in economics include reflect (20 times) capture (10 times), and use (8 times), demonstrating the ways of exploring facts. Economics researchers mainly regard firms' marketing decisions as disciplinary objects, as evidenced by the collocate of fat e.g., firm (13 entries) in example (24). The cluster arise/esult/follow/come/originate from the fact that (19 entries) is used to justify the research findings (example 25), whereas despite the fact that (19 entres) mainly explicates the findings that are inconsistent with the known fact (example 26). In contrast, verb collocate preceding this pattern are les variable in marketing, with only the verb highlight occurring 4 times.

(24) We can see how much it matters whether a researcher takes into account the fact that virtully al firms produce more than one product by considering two approaches to measuring firm output. [Economics]   
(25) ..the correlation between appeal and marginal cost is positive, which arises from the fact that higher marginal costs are associated with higher appeal products, which tend to have higher sales. [Economics]   
(26) We find that, despite the fact that i is understood that the lottry outcome iscompletely random, the incumbent party tends to obtain relatively more votes in these provinces. [Economics]

# 5. Discussion

Disciplinary epistemology is perceived as how agentive subjects, disciplinary objects and procedures define the ways of constructing, negotiating, and disseminating knowledge in disciplinary contexts (Bondi, 2006; Hemais, 2001; Hyland, 1999; Malavasi & Mazzi, 2010). It determines the most basic question of what to say and how to say it, retricting the choice of language in discplinary discourse accordingly. As result, i is of great importance to move from descriptions of frequency in form to variations in meaning at the level of epistemology" (Hood, 2011, p. 106). In view of the importance of disciplinary epistemology, this section aims to explore the variations in the use of SNs between marketing and economics from the dimensions of agentive subjects, disciplinary objects, and disciplinary procedures by looking at their collocates.

# 5.1. Agentive subjects

Agentive subjects refer to how researchers show authorial presence in RAs through self-mention expressions. Our analysis shows that $1 7 . 8 6 \%$ of the high-frequency SNs in the CMRA are situated in complement clauses signalling writer presence, which is higher than that in the CERA $( 1 3 . 4 4 \% )$ (Appendix B). Only when testing hypotheses or making assumptions is the percentage of writer presence much higher in the CERA, reflecting the active involvement of economists in testing hypotheses and models.

The general pattern of greater writer visibilit in marketing corresponds to Hyland (2003), which finds an overwhelming preference for slf-mention in marketing RAs within the softfield. We, the most common self-mention expression in the CMRA, is also a self-representation keyword in Malavasi and Mazz (2010). In contrast, the lower writer presence in economics RAs may be aributed to its comprehensive disciplinarity - an astract disciline that \*straddes the boundaries of hard and soft, pure and aplied (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 187). By using fewer self-mention expressions, economics researchers could \*strengthen the objectivity of their interpretations and subordinate their own voice to that of unmediated nature' (Hyland, 2003, p. 256).

# 5.2. Disciplinary objects

Disciplinary objects refer to the research topics investigated by agentive subjects in a discipline. Findings of this study show that marketing researchers mainly investigate the factors influencing consumers purchasing behaviors and the process of building corporate brands. Firstly, the consumer-centered nature can be reflected in the cluster of consumers wllingnessto pay, as well as by consumer as the frquent colloat offact, evidece, and assmption. Scondy, branding aarenesscan be nt in the collocat fact - brands $( \mathbf { M I } = 3 . 3 1$ ) and that of likelihood - branding $( \mathbf { M I } = 3 . 8 1 $ ). Concerning branding goes hand in hand with emphasis on customers in marketing, as "one of the most valuable intangible assts of a firm is its brands . A strong brand commands intense consumer loyalty" (Kotler & Keller, 2016, p. 299).

Economics researchers, however, are more interested in studying the mathematical relations among variables" (Mankiw, 2018, p. 37) and how economic gents make decisions, as reflected in the cluster increase the probability of (17 entries) and the collcates of ability such as firms (8 times) signalling microeconomic agents. More specificall, economics investigates \*how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets", and "economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth" (ibid, p.27), as evidenced by the co-occurrence of the SN ability and their (24 times). Our analysis suggests that macroeconomic agents such as government or state play a role in regulating firms' operations to promote economic growth and guarantee employment.

# 5.3. Disciplinary procedures

Disciplinary procedures rfer to the ways that researchers investigate disciplinary objects. This study reveals that both models and statistical measure are important reearch methods in economics and marketing, but they exhibit different ways of gathering satistics and evidence to test hypotheses.

In marketing RAs, collocates of likelihood, hypothesis, and evidence indicate the more empirical and experimental nature of mar. keting. Researchers generally establish links with previous studies to provide evidence to justify ther reearch. Furthermore, asastrong collocate of likelihood $( \mathbf { M I } = 5 . 8 1 $ ), ANOvA is a more specific statistical method in marketing to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.

Differently, economics researchers build models based on assumptions (Mankiw, 2018), and use probability which is an important mathematical tool to describe statistics (Cacchiani, 2018) for data analysis. In this sense, the chain of disciplinary procedures in economics - the macro-spech acts of hypothesis, analysis/interpretation/generalization and prediction' (ibid, p.24) is fulilled. When justifying models and hypotheses, economics emphasizes the abstract reasoning process through inding evidence and embodies a more fact-reliant nature, as well supported by the extensive use of facts.

This study confirms and complements previous findings on disciplinary variations between economics and marketing. The model. testing and speculative nature of economics in contrast to the model-developing and empirical characteristics of marketing (Bondi. 2006; Hemais, 2001; Hyland, 199; Hyland & Bondi, 2006; Malavasi & Mazzi, 2010) is afirmed. We further enrich the understanding that marketing researchers prefer greater writer visibility and the use of empirical evidence or support from the iterature to test a hypothesis, whereas economics researchers deploy less writer visibilit, and prefer directly supporting or rejecting a hypothesis through investigation. The present study also complements Flowerdew and Forest's (2015) exploration by using alarge-sized corpus, highlighting the significance of modal facts (e.g., ability, desire).

# 6. Conclusion

Adopting a corpus-based discourse approach, this study has identified key disciplinary variations in marketing and economics RAs. Overall, marketing adopts significantly more SNs than economics with a preference for $^ { \mathfrak { s e } } \mathbf { S } \mathbf { N } +$ to-infinitive" clauses, while economics uses more $^ { \mathfrak { s e } } \mathbf { S } \mathbf { N } +$ that-clauses'. Semantically, marketing RAs prefer modal fact and idea nouns, whereas economics RAs frequently employ fact and idea nouns. Our findings suggest that SN choices are ffective clues to disciplinary epistemology with a view to the agentive subjects, disciplinary objects and procedures defining the construction of knowledge in marketing and economics.

This study has pedagogical implications for both EFL learners and EAP practitioners. Firstly, corpus-informed entries can assist in collecting productive SN uses by experts of a discipline. Based on the concordances generated from the discourse that students may be exposed to, course designers can better taior course designs and instructional material. Furthermore, teachers can draw students attention to the gap between their SN outputs and the way typicall used by experts by providing more expert-like SN inputs with contextualied examples. Additionall, given that SNs exhibit istinct patterns in different isciplinary envionments, it is crucialfor teachers t raise learners awarenessof isciplinary epistemology. Through engaging in SN-related input-processing and output tasks and activities, learners can retrieve, utilize, and manage appropriate SNs under the guidance of disciplinary epistemologie in their extended writing.

There are some gaps to be filled by future research. Firstly, the CERA did not distinguish between theoretical and applied economics, which impels subsequent research to further divide the two fields, to investigate whether the SN uses in applied economics show a similar trend to that in marketing. Secondly, this study did not investigate other intra-sentential uses of SNs for limit of space, which may also display useful disciplinary features for further considerations. In adition, subsequent research on disciplinary variation may conduct participant interviews to better demonstrate solidarity with the disciplinary community members.
