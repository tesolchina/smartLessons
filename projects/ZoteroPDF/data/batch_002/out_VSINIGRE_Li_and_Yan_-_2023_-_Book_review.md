As an essential language skill, academic writing is an important research topic infirst language (L1) and second language (L2) acquisition research. In recent decades corpus-based methods have gained popularity as a way to analyse academic writing texts, because these methods can yield reliable findings that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of academic writing (Romer, Cortes, & Friginal, 2020). However, to our knowledge, few books have taught researchers to do academic writing reearch with corpus and programming software. Given this gap, Philip Durrant's newly published book entitled Corpus Linguistics or Writing Development A Guide for Research will be a helpful handbook for academic writing study, and will be welcomed by L1 and L2 writing researchers, especially novice researchers.

As a part of the Routledge Corpus Linguistics Guides series, this book provides a summary of corpus techniques and ofers a practical demonstration of analyses using $R$ a programming language. The book comprises four parts in total. The first part introduces the corpus-based study of academic writing development and the programming language R. The following thre parts focus on vocabulary, grammar and formulaic language respectively in academic writing. Each part comprises two chapters, the first introducing the study area of the chapter, and the second ilustrating how the analysis introduced in the previous chapter can be implemented in $R$

This book starts by introducing corpus inguistics, including its advantages and limitations in writing development research (Chapter 1). On the one hand Durrant point out that corpora facilitate the study of large numbers of text, while on the other he cautions that corpus research may be limited to easily identified features. Durrant also explains in this part how writing development relates to vocabulary, grammar and formulaic language. According to Durrant, writing development can be investigated from many different perspective, including genres, types of tasks, types of classroom input, motivations of particular writers, and more. When attempting to capture the full picture of writing development, vocabulary, grammar and formulaic language can serve as lenses through which aspects like genres and motivations can be studied..

Afer introducing the macro blueprin for the volume, the book expands on three main research themes, i.e. the development of vocabulary (Chapter 3), grammar (Chapter 5) and formulaic language (Chapter 7). Regarding vocabulary research (Chapter 3), Durrant provides measures of vocabulary development, including lexical diversity and lexical sophistication. Lexica sophistication is elaborated in particular, and six measures are introduced, including word length, word frequency, register-based measures, contextual distinctivenes, semantic measures, and psycholinguistic measures. Durrant aso invites readers to consider some possible issues that researchers may face, and offes relevant guidance. For example i is mentioned in this chapter that it can be difficult to distinguish whether a writer is truly using diverse and sophisticated vocabulary, or whether they are simply listing infrequent words without repeating them. Given this ssue, Durrant points out that more research measures are needed to help us capture a whole picture of vocabulary knowledg. Subsequently, he provides three promising solutions to this ssue based on this book's three themes: register approriateness (vocabulary), usage-based models of language (grammar), and formulaic language. The latter two measures are further introduced in Chapter 5 and Chapter 7 respectively.

When discussing grammar development research, Durrant firs offers an overview of some broad principles, namely \*choosing between different models of grammar to work with, identifying specific grammatical features to study, and thinking about how to interpret those features' (p. 95). Regarding the selection of grammatical frameworks, he points out that some frameworks may be more suitable for investigation than others, either because their categories are easier to identify or they can be easily annotated by automated parsers. Durrant aso cautions that it is esential to consider why the chosen features are worth studying in order o enhance the meaningfulnes of the research. Subsequently threeapproaches to grammar research are introduced, including approaches based on grammatical complexity, multi-dimensional analysis, and usage-based language models. Whil different approaches serve different research purposes, each also has particular limitations. For example, grammatical complexity can be easily quantified by measures like words per t-unit, words per clause, words per sentence, and more, but these measures may fail todistinguish betwen different types of complexity (such as phrasal complexity and clausal complexity).

The final theme is formulaic language research on academic writing. Here Durrant specifies the two types of formulaic language well-suited to corpus analysis collocations and lexical bundes. He expands on how to aply frequency-based approaches to formulaic anguage stdie, ad then intodces the pais of reeach tchnques. The first pair s rerrence and cooccurrence, which aly to lexical bundle and collocation research respectively. The second is fixed and flexible equences, which determine whether derivation or inflection is allowed. The last pair is corpus-intenal and corpus-external approaches; the former uses data from a leaner corpus, while the lattr uses data from a reference corpus.In addition, Durrant outlines three association measures for collocation reseach, each of which compares the overallfrequency of a word pair with the frequency of it component words in a distinct manner. These measures are evaluated regarding their advantages and drawbacks, enabling researchers to select sutable measures based on their research goals.

Each odd-numbered chapter (Chapters 1, 3, 5 and 7) is followed by a practical discussion with detailed instructions for quantifying linguistic features and visualising the results (Chapters 2, 4, 6 and 8). Chapter 2 starts from the begining of programming by showing how to prepare a computer for $R$ and presenting fundamental concepts in corpus linguistics like encoding, markup, and annotation. Durrant also explains in detail how to annotate a corpus for part f speech (POs) and syntacticrlationships. Chapter 4 demonstrates how to measure vocabulary diversity with. $R$ and how to use information from a reference corpus. Chapter 6 discusses how to check grammar accuracy in academic writing research. Chapter 8 approaches collocation research in a similar way to Chapter 4by using a self-cratd ist of acdmic olloations. n l thee ads-onchapters rrnt prs nsay scripts i screshseders can follow each analysis step.

One of the advantages of this book, in our view, is it applicabilit forallL1 or L2 writing reearchers with diverse needs in terms of research methods. For those who are commencing academic writing research using computer programming, this book is particularly useful because it assumes no prior knowledge of programming on the part of the reader. In addition, Durrant provides a variety of necessary tools like the Stanford CoreNLP (a natural Ianguage processing tool) and CLAwWs (a POS tagger as well a sample corpora like the Growth in Grammar (GiG) corpus of children's academic writing and the British Academic Written English (BAwE) corpus, Which are all downloadable from the companion websit. These easily accessble toos and materials will save readers the effort of looking for apropriate toos and materials by themselves. Meanwhile, readers who wish to study their own self-buil corpus can follow the bookto annotate their corpus and write personalised programmes based on their partiular rearch needs. Finall, if readers hope to learn more about vocabulary, grammar and formulaic language, they may refer to the selections of books and papers listed in the "Taking it further' sections at the end of Chapters 3, 5 and 7 for additional reading suggestions.

Another advantage of the book is its reader-friendly organisation and lucid language style. The chapters in this book are clearly organised in pairs, with one focusing on theories and the other demonstrating corresponding operations. This enables readers to easily navigate the information they need without reading the entire book. In addition, the book's engaging style makes it easy to read. Instead of adopting a serious tone, Durrant often shares his experiences of corpus research and encourages readers with difficult procedures, creating a sense of face-to-face conversation while readers are reading.

Despite the merits mentioned above, the book has a minor drawback, namely, the limited scope of writing features addressed. Perhaps due to space constraints, only three fundamental features of writing development are covered in the book. In the current academic writing rearch, attention has gradually hfted toward multi-dimensional analysis, disciplinary variaton, reister variation and other aspects. Integrating discussion of these emerging trends could bette bring readers up to date on cutting-edge ides to inform their own research methods.

Overall, however, this book is avaluable guide on academic writing development research. Anyone who wants to learn about the theoretical background and achievements of this field or the operation of quantitativeapproaches based on R will fin itinspiring and helpful. Despite the minor disadvantage noted above, we believe this book will be a ich source of inspiration for researchers, and will make a valuable contribution to academic writing development research.
