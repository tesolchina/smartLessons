Researchers in second language (L2) writing studies are increasingly focusing on examining complex noun phrases (NPs). However, recent studies on NP complexity show a preference for examining advanced learners’ writings, despite the fact that English writings of early L2 learners already contain many NPs. In the present study, we used a corpus-based approach to investigate the development of NP complexity in argumentative and narrative compositions written by En glish as a foreign language (EFL) learners with different proficiency levels. The results show that eight NP complexity features presented patterns of growth at different proficiency levels. Among the eight features, attributive adjectives and -ing participles as post-modifiers can both reflect the development and characteristics of Chinese EFL learners’ writings. We also found that genre ef fect on NP complexity growth was the result of both task-related factors of genres and learners’ genre exposure. Our results largely corroborate the developmental index proposed by Biber et al. (2011), and confirm that NP complexity starts to grow from early stages of learning among L2 English learners with genre-specific features.

# 1. Introduction

In second language (L2) writing research, complexity has been proposed as a valid and basic descriptor of L2 performance, and as an index of language development and progress (Bult´e & Housen, 2014; Crossley & McNamara, 2014). Measuring complexity in L2 writing development helps teachers, test developers and researchers expediently determine and describe a learner’s developmental level or global proficiency in the target language (Larsen-Freeman, 1978; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998).

Among the sub-components of L2 linguistic complexity, syntactic complexity is recognized as an important construct in L2 writing instruction and research. At the observational level, theoretical notions of syntactic complexity can be manifested in sentence complexity, clausal complexity and phrasal complexity (Bult´e & Housen, 2012). Traditionally, syntactic complexity studies have been restricted to sentence and clausal complexity, and have mainly relied on clausal embedding and subordination measures. Phrasal complexity, however, regardless of a growing body of literature (e.g., Egbert, 2015; Jiang et al., 2021; Lu, 2011; Paquot, 2019; Shao et al., 2022), has not received equal attention like the other two constructs (sentence complexity and clausal complexity). As a component of phrasal complexity, noun phrase (NP) complexity is particularly underinvestigated. Because of the high frequency of the use of nouns and children’s visual and motor experiences when interacting with various categories of nouns, nouns are reliable and robust learnable constructions (Ellis et al., 2016). As learners’ proficiency increases, more noun modifiers are used to convey information in a variety of contexts, adding to the structural complexity of noun phrases (Bult´e & Housen, 2012). According to Biber et al. (1999), only the headword and the determiners are compulsory elements of the NP. Therefore, NP complexity is defined by the presence of non-compulsory elements in the NP structure and the use of recursive embedding.

Current L2 research on NP complexity, derived from syntactic complexity research on research articles, exhibits a preference for certain groups of learners, such as undergraduate students and graduate students. The development of NP complexity from elementary to proficient L2 learners across various types of writings has also been inadequately explored. Additionally, L2 learners’ written language may develop as a result of and in accordance with the changing communicative needs of their learning contexts. Therefore, other types of writings other than research articles should also be considered, as they vary in communicative characteristics and result in different language use.

In light of the aforementioned concerns, the present study has two aims. One is to explore NP complexity in writings from low-level to high-level English as a foreign language (EFL) learners, which is currently a less-studied area in NP complexity research. Another is to investigate the genre effect on NP complexity development. A corpus-based approach will be adopted to ascertain the development of students’ writing proficiency, and Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental index will be used as a measure of NP complexity features.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. L2 syntactic complexity research: from T-unit based measures to noun phrases

Complexity shows the extent to which the language produced in performing a task is elaborated and varied (Ellis, 2003). Objective and reliable metric is needed to gauge learners’ writing performance. Among the measures used in L2 syntactic complexity research, clause-based omnibus measures i.e., a measure that combines analysis of multiple structural and syntactic distinctions into a single quantitative variable (Biber et al., 2020), have been enjoying popularity over the years. However, recent research has criticized the traditional approach to studying complexity. The most prominent one was Biber et al. (2011), which suggested that clause-based structures are more representative in conversation than academic writing. Unlike previous complexity studies, they formulated their hypothesis based on a large-scale first language (L1) spoken and written corpus. With empirical evidence, they challenged the practicality of T-unit based measures in language testing applications, criticized their weak theoretical linguistic foundation, and also maintained that traditional methods failed to yield consistent results because of these shortcomings.

From their observations, Biber et al. (2011) found that novice writers, who are more acquainted with spoken language, rely more frequently on conversational features, i.e., clausal complexity features, in their writings. Meanwhile, they also found that embedded noun phrases in written texts were more complex, from a processing perspective, than alternative structures with dependent clauses (Biber & Gray, 2016). Based on these complexity features, Biber et al. (2011) proposed a five-stage developmental progression scale of grammatical complexity, and the noun modifiers in it serve as a systemic index of noun phrase complexity. The developmental index was initially raised to fully describe the range of grammatical features found in advanced L1 English academic writings, and made a new premise of developmental research. To date, its applicability has been examined across diverse L1 backgrounds, such as L1 Turkish (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021), L1 Persian (Ansarifar et al., 2018), L1 German (Kreyer & Schaub, 2018), and L1 Chinese (Gray et al., 2019; Lan & Sun, 2019), demonstrating a reasonable degree of generalizability. With the growing volume of research, the proposal of the developmental scale has also become the centre of the shift from traditional T-unit based measures to complexity within NPs.

# 2.2. Noun phrases in L2 learners’ writings: from advanced learners to novice learner

Biber et al.’s (2011) index highlights the importance of the use of noun phrases in registers that demand a high information density, such as research articles. Consequently, noun phrases are seen as a key indicator of a mature academic style (Durrant & Brenchley, 2023), and considerable attention has been paid to the development of phrasal features in English for academic purposes (EAP) writings by advanced learners (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Lan & Sun, 2019; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples et al., 2016).

For instance, Staples et al. (2016) examined the writings of L1 English undergraduate and graduate students and found that phrasal complexity features expanded as educational levels increased. In contrast, clausal complexity features decreased as educational level increased. In the case of L2 English learners, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) found that more proficient MA writers rely more frequently on complex phrasal modifiers. Ansarifar et al. (2018) analysed abstracts from theses and dissertations of L2 English learners, and provided insights into how phrases became more complex as MA students progressed to PhD students. The results generally supported Biber et al.’s (2011) predictions, and the competing use of clausal and phrasal features with traditional notions of complexity in EAP studies triggered investigations of complex noun phrases in the past decade.

While NPs are characteristically dense in advanced academic writings (Biber et al., 2011), they are not exclusive to advanced-level learners. In a study of lexical bundles, Wojtalewicz and Reppen (2020) found that the writings of grade 5 and 6 elementary school students contained more complex noun phrases compared to those of grades 3 and 4. Furthermore, it is also observed that as young learners progressed in proficiency, regardless of their first language backgrounds, their texts displayed fewer features of spoken discourse. Another pertinent study, Gray et al. (2019), which examined the development of grammatical complexity in independent and integrated writing tasks completed by low and intermediate level Chinese high school English learners, found that independent writing responses gave the clearest pattern of development of grammatical complexity, particularly through the use of attributive adjectives. Kreyer and Schaub (2018) analysed argumentative writings from the Marburg Corpus of Intermediate Learner English (MILE), a database comprising compositions from L1 German secondary school students. However, they found that although some features supported the acquisitional stages hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011), their data do not readily reveal a common pattern of progression. Compared to Gray et al. (2019), Kreyer and Schaub’s (2018) longitudinal designs helped precisely examine the devel opment of NP complexity at specific levels, but three grades of participants (Grade 10 to Grade 12) might not be enough to reveal the development of NPs in terms of time span. Ouyang et al. (2022) examined the syntactic complexity in the writings of Chinese EFL learners. According to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), they categorized the writings into seven proficiency levels, ranging from Pre-A1 to C2. By utilizing both traditional syntactic complexity measures and dependency distance measures, they found that noun phrases, instead of subordinations, were more frequently employed by advanced learners to increase the complexity of the sentences. Although those developmental investigations had a wide inclusion of proficiency levels in their corpus, their research focus was on comparing the predictive power of two sets of indices for L2 writing proficiency, without further investigating the specific development of NP complexity.

To sum up, the existing research of NP complexity still has room for improvement. The main concern is the participants, who have been mostly higher proficiency learners, despite the fact that there is a surge of interest in lower proficiency learners in the past decade. For the studies that targeted lower proficiency learners, longitudinal designs are normally used, which is desirable. But the drawback is that the time span is too short, and there is not enough time for the lower proficiency learners to become higher proficiency learners. Thus, the results are often incomplete or inconsistent. Therefore, one aim of our present study is to examine the development of NP complexity in the writings of L2 learners from low-level to high-level.

# 2.3. Noun phrase complexity and genres

Genres are socially constructed language practices that serve specific social purposes (Halliday & Hasan, 1985), and writing performances in the writings of different genres may be affected by different communicative demands. Since learners’ writing development may occur both through and in response to shifting communicative demands in their learning experiences (Durrant & Brenchley, 2023), we consider genre as a crucial variable in investigating NP complexity development. Consistent with prior learner corpus-based studies (e.g., Goulart et al., 2022; Staples & Reppen, 2016), this present study employs “genre” as a general cover term to refer to different types or categories of student writing that students in school education are most frequently exposed to, such as narration, argumentation, and description.

For L1 writers, it has been noted that NPs in expository texts are more complex than those in narrative texts, especially among learners from high school and onwards (Ravid & Berman, 2010). For L2 learners, evidence from Staples and Reppen (2016) also showed that attributive adjectives and pre-modifying nouns were significantly different across argumentative essays and rhetorical analyses. Yoon and Polio (2017) reported a significant genre effect on the complex nominals per clause and complex nominals per T-unit, suggesting that L2 English learners use more complex NPs in argumentative essays than narratives. Moreover, Zhang and Ouyang (2023) compared linguistic complexity indices across integrative writings and independent writings, and found indices of noun phrase complexity had strong and stable predictive power across different genres. However, due to the limited number of indices in their research, differences of complex noun phrases across different genres were of limited coverage. Despite these findings, genre is a topic that has received relatively less attention in NP complexity research. Based on the lacunae of the evidence reviewed, the other aim of our present study is to explore the development of NP complexity in different genres. We will address the following two questions in our study:

RQ1 What is the general pattern of the development of NP complexity in the writings at different proficiency levels? RQ2 How does genre influence NP complexity in L2 writings at different proficiency levels?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Data

The data examined are a subset of our self-built corpus with 821 Chinese EFL learners’ compositions. The participants range from junior high school students to postgraduate students, aged 13 to 24. The L1 for the participants is Chinese, and no participants have had the experience of living in an English-speaking country for longer than half a year. After getting the full approval from our university’s ethics committee, we informed the participants that their compositions would be used for academic research and we obtained verbal consent either from the participants themselves or their guardians. All the writings were completed in class within 30 mins under the supervision of their teachers, and the students were not allowed to use any reference materials as if they were taking a test.

In our study, we chose argumentation and narration to represent two distinct genres, because these two genres represent two types of discourses that have intrinsically different social purposes. Narratives focus on people, their actions and motivations, and express the unfolding of events in a temporal framework (Longacre, 1996), while argumentative essays, as a prototypical genre of academic writing, may include some distinctive features of academic texts (Yoon & Polio, 2017). Also, argumentation and narration are the genres that most frequently occur in EFL classrooms in China. For argumentative essays, we used “City life and country life, which one do you like better?” and “Should everyone learn to play a musical instrument?” as topics. For narrative essays, the topics include “My Father/Mother” and “My Favourite Teacher”. The students were asked to provide specific examples in their narration. The whole corpus has 148497 words in total, with four different topics. There are about 35000 words for each topic.

After the compositions were collected, they were faithfully keyboarded into the computer in exactly the same way as they are. All the compositions were kept in a TXT format. Each composition was double rated according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) writing assessment grid (Council of Europe, 2020) and The CEFR grids for writing developed by ALTE members (Cambridge University Press, 2019). By adopting the CEFR, we can also classify the texts into different levels, such as elementary (A1, A2), intermediate (B1, B2) or advanced (C1, C2) levels. During the double rating process, a third rater was involved in the case of disagreement about the CEFR level of a specific composition. The three raters are Chinese teachers who have been teaching English as a foreign language in universities for more than 10 years. Before the formal scoring, they were required to familiarize themselves with the rating materials relevant to the grids for scoring (See Appendix A). Then the raters were further trained on the standardization set of chosen essays, after which the formal scoring started. Sample essays with their scores and comments are provided in Appendix B. Rater reliability of the double rating was assessed by calculating an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) on absolute agreement (two-way mixed model). The result of ICC was .89, indicating an acceptable inter-rater reliability.

After the rating process was completed, we randomly selected 30 essays at 5 levels (from A1 to C1) for each genre from compositions written by junior high school students and above. Table 1 presents the summary of number of essays and words of the subcorpus of this study. Tables 2 and 3 show the distribution of student compositions across different grades and five CEFR levels.

# 3.2. Measures and instruments

Noun phrase complexity indices of this study are based on the developmental stages hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011), with reference to the indices from Ansarifar et al. (2018) and Sarte and Gnevsheva (2022), which focused on NP complexity in intermediate L2 English learners’ writings. This adaptation was necessary since certain structures in Biber et al. (2011) are not NP modifiers, such as finite adverbial clauses. In our adaptation, participial premodifiers were separated from other adjectives, following the approach advocated by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014). Meanwhile, prepositional phrases with abstract and concrete/locative meaning in the original developmental index were not distinguished, as the categorization of the phrases and the distinction of “abstract” and “concrete/locative” are problematic because of the lack of a definition (Kreyer & Schaub, 2018). Moreover, since prompts could exert a large influence on the use of premodifying nouns (Bychkovska, 2021), we excluded certain structures from the statistical analyses such as the prompts “Musical instruments”, “Favourite teacher” and “City life”. Table 4 shows the noun phrase complexity structures in our study, which is adapted from Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental scale. The first stage does not involve complexity in noun phrase structures, so we removed the first stage from the index.

The corpus tagging was firstly done by Stanford Parser 3.6.0 (de Marneffe & Manning, 2008). Although the parser reaches an accuracy of $9 4 \%$ , errors still occur and need to be corrected. Thus, we manually checked the POS taggings and the syntactic relations of words from the output of the parser. The extraction of linguistic features was based on the labels of POS and syntactic relations.

# 3.3. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were based on the standardized frequencies of the 13 noun phrase complexity structures in Table 4. In general, a minimum text length of 100 words is needed to ensure reliable normalized rates of occurrence (Biber, 1993). In this study, the fre quency of those features was normalized at a rate of per 200 words to fit the mean length of each text. An R script (R Core Team, 2014) was used to analyse our statistics. In response to the questions about developmental patterns and genre differences, we adopted a series of multiple regressions to examine whether noun phrase complexity differs in terms of proficiency and genre. In the multiple re gressions, standardized frequencies of each type of NP modifiers were set as the responsive variables. Genre and proficiency were set as predictor variables, and Bonferroni adjustment was used in the pairwise corrections. Since five pairwise comparisons were made, we divided the significance value .05 by 5, adapting the significance level at .01.

# 4. Results

The first aim of our research is to investigate the pattern of change of NP complexity along with the development of writing proficiency. To achieve this, we first investigated the distributional patterns of 13 types of modifiers. Descriptive statistics are provided in Appendix C. Several Q-Q plots were used to determine whether the standardized frequency of each modifier followed a normal distribution. Since the plots showed that standardized frequencies of all modifiers followed normal distributions, a series of multiple linear regressions were implemented, with results being summarized in Table 5.

Based on the results in Table 5, we found that there were eight modifiers that showed significant differences in frequency across proficiency levels. Those modifiers are attributive adjectives, relative clauses, nouns as pre-modifiers, -ing participles as postmodifiers, of phrases, prepositions as noun post-modifiers other than of, complement clauses controlled by nouns and to-infinitive clauses. The standardized frequencies of use of those modifiers are visualized in Fig. 1 to facilitate further explorations.

Fig. 1 provides an in-depth visualization of the dynamic changes of the eight noun modifiers. Among them, attributive adjectives display a consistent increase from the initial proficiency level (A1) to the final level (C1). Relative clauses and of phrases show an upward trend from A1 level and plateau at the B2 level. Prepositional phrases other than of, -ing participles as post-modifiers, and toinfinitive clauses generally exhibit a growth from B1 to C1 in argumentative writings. Premodifying nouns and complement clauses controlled by nouns in argumentative writings are infrequently used until the students reach B2 level, and grow steadily to C1 level.

The second aim of our research focuses on NP complexity in the writings of the two genres. Attributive adjectives have an evident increase from A1 to C1 in argumentative writings, whereas in narrative writings, they show a slower rate of growth after A2 level. Nouns as premodifiers, -ing participles as post-modifiers in narrative writings show an earlier increase in frequency at B1 level, and slow down at B2 level. In argumentative writings, the growth in frequency begins at B2 level and then accelerated, resulting in significant differences between the two genres. When reaching C1 level, premodifying nouns and -ing participles as post-modifiers are more frequently used in argumentative writings. The frequencies of to-infinitive clauses and complement clauses controlled by nouns increase slowly in narrative writings after reaching A2 level, but in argumentative writings, they continue to increase until C2 level.

Although there is no modifier that can significantly reveal genre differences at all proficiency levels, the trajectories suggest potential connections between genre and noun phrase complexity to some extent.

Although there is not a single modifier that can significantly reveal genre differences at all proficiency levels, the trajectories suggest some potential connections between genre and noun phrase complexity to some extent. On the whole, from Table 5 and Fig. 1, we can see that compositions of higher proficiency levels are associated with an increased frequency and range of noun modifiers. The growth periods for different noun phrase modifiers exhibit a sequential pattern. The results generally supported Biber et al.’s (2011) development scale. Regarding genre-related features, lower-level learners produce more NP structures in narrative writings than in argumentative writings. Conversely, higher proficiency learners tend to use more noun modifiers in argumentative writings than in narrative writings. We also discovered that the general differences in NP complexity across genres may not be significant at each proficiency level, but the pattern of growth is different, which will be discussed in the next section.

# 5. Discussion

The present study investigated the development of NP complexity in Chinese EFL learners’ argumentative and narrative writings. Of the 13 complexity features, eight (attributive adjectives, relative clauses, of phrases, prepositional phrases other than of, -ing participles as post-modifiers, nouns as premodifiers, to-infinitive clauses, and complement clauses controlled by nouns) show clear patterns of development with the increasing proficiency for both genres $( p < . 0 0 1 )$ . However, their developmental patterns and the influence of genre vary, which will be discussed in the following sections.

# 5.1. Developmental trajectory of NP complexity at different proficiency levels

Fig. 1 shows that attributive adjectives started to grow from a very early stage (A1, A2), and it is the type that underwent a linear pattern of development from the lowest frequency at A1 to the highest frequency at C1. This developmental trajectory diverges from Biber et al.’s hypothesis which suggests that attributive adjectives are more prevalent among lower-level learners’ writings. For example, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) observed that the less proficient EAP group relied more heavily on attributive adjectives compared to the more proficient MA group. Similarly, Bychkovska (2021) found that students in the less proficient group produced more attributive adjectives than those in the more proficient group, as anticipated by the hypothesized scale. In our study, however, it is not necessarily the case that attributive adjectives are less frequently used by higher-level learners. In fact, higher level learners still used a number of basic adjectives, as shown in Example 1, where attributive adjectives are bolded.

Example 1. (Narrative, C1).

Standing outside the airport, far from crowded people, I saw a middle-aged man, with his hair becoming grey. At that minute, I felt a strong sense of sorrow.

Our results align with the findings in Lan et al. (2019), Taguchi et al. (2013), and Casal and Lee (2019), which also discovered that high-proficiency students produced basic noun modifiers (i.e., attributive adjectives, participle modifiers and relative clauses) more than expected. It can be seen that attributive adjectives are still an effective means in conveying informational content among proficient learners. This could be a result of some other factors, such as preferences of the instructor (Casal & Lee, 2019), and in this study, the topics.

Relative clauses show a linear pattern of increase in both genres from A1 level. At B2 level, we see the highest frequency and diversity of relative clauses. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the different proportions of two types of relative clauses between B1 and B2 levels indicate a wider variety of use of relative clauses among B2 level learners.

The production of relative clause sees a sudden decrease at C1 level. Such result concurs with previous research, which suggests that for higher-level EFL learners, relative clauses are used less frequently (Biber et al., 2011; Staples & Egbert, Biber et al., 2016). Similar to the use of relative clauses, the use of of phrases is found to be significantly different among different proficiency levels. Such result also echoes Sarte and Gnevsheva (2022), which noted a constant growth of of phrases in the writings from low B1 level learners to high B1 level learners. However, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) did not find a significant difference in the use of of phrases between the higher and the lower proficiency groups. The inconsistency might attribute to the participants’ language proficiency, as most of the students in Parkinson and Musgrave’s study where high-proficiency learners who had completed undergraduate education. In addition, we found in our dataset that students of low proficiency tended to use possessives to indicate the relationship between particular nouns and their modifiers instead of of genitives (instruments’ experience in Example 2), and misuse possessives in some cases. In Example 2, an acceptable form of expression could be “My experience of learning to play a musical instrument was bad.”

# Example 2. (Argumentative, A1).

My learning to play a musical instrument’s experience was bad.

As students’ writing proficiency improved, they gradually acquired the usage of of phrases and used them more frequently, which enabled them to convey information more accurately. Our findings again provided evidence to the explanation that of phrases are used frequently in English in general, and may easily collocate with a wide range of words to construct expressions.

In the case of prepositional phrases other than of, the higher frequency of which among higher-level learners is similar to Parkinson and Musgrave’s (2014) results. Their observation suggested that fewer prepositional phrases other than of occurred in the writings from EAP group (lower proficiency) and more in the writings from MA group (higher proficiency). Moreover, we found that prepo sitional phrases other than of started to appear at a higher proficiency level (B1 level), unlike of phrases, which started at A2 level. Though categorized on the same developmental stage, of phrases may be easier for Chinese EFL learners to acquire.

Another feature, -ing participles as post-modifiers, is even less common for compositions below B1. As mentioned by Biber et al. (1999), only a small set of verbs are common in -ing participles. In our corpus, the verb “live” was the most commonly used verb with this construction (e.g., farmers living in my hometown, any person living in this stress-filled world). This usage didn’t appear until B1 and -ing participles were widely used from B2. Corroborating Biber et al.’s (2011) claim, -ing participles in our study were observed to accelerate from B1 to B2 level in narrative writings, and B2 to C1 in argumentative writings. Once students had mastered this usage, they were able to use -ing participles in a variety of forms, including those with embedded prepositional phrases, as shown in Example 3.

# Example 3. (Narrative, B2).

A classical paragraph in Zhu Ziqing’s works describing father’s love is demonstrating my father’s deep love towards me.

Similar results were found in Sarte and Gnevsheva (2022), in which -ing participles as post-modifiers in B2 displays a higher count than in high B1 writings for a certain topic. However, in some studies of different L1s, e.g., Staples et al. (2016), the frequency of -ing participles as post-modifiers did not change significantly. This suggests that the developmental increment of -ing participles as post-modifiers may be a unique feature of Chinese EFL learners.

Lastly, premodifying nouns, to-infinitive clauses, and complement clauses controlled by nouns exhibit a growing pattern starting at B2 level and above. For Chinese L2 English learners, premodifying nouns were acquired and employed at higher proficiency levels, despite the fact that it is listed as a type of lower stage modifier according to the hypothesized scale. From Fig. 1, a noticeable surge of frequency is observed between B1 and B2. Such acceleration might be attributed to the progressing ability of using nouns from B1 level. While nouns as pre-modifiers at B1 level were rather monotonous (e.g., math problems, math paper), premodifying nouns at B2 level represented a more varied combination of words (school life, car window, etc.). Reflecting higher informational purpose in our study, though, nouns as pre-modifiers were not frequently observed as developing features among EFL learners in previous studies (e. g., Gray et al., 2019; Kreyer & Schaub, 2018; Lan et al., 2019). We infer that such a phenomenon was a result of the limited time span or proficiency levels included in their study designs, which might have impeded researchers from discerning substantial progress made by the students. Likewise, to-infinitive clauses were not frequently used until the learners were getting more proficient (e.g., “passion to play musical instruments” from a B2 level composition, and “courage to overcome obstacles” from a C1 level composition). Although these two features were not widely used, the frequencies of them were generally high for those texts that did contain them. Com plement clauses, as indicated by Staples et al. (2016), allows for a relatively more elaborated style of writing, focusing on describing relationships and comparisons rather than presenting a great deal of abstract information. The surge of complement clauses was not noticed until at B2 level, and specifically in argumentations.

Our study found that more proficient learners use more NP modifiers and use modifiers at higher stages, consistent with Biber et al.’s (2011) model. Specifically, Biber et al.’s (1999) data identified four features that are distinctive of academic writings in research articles: noun pre-modifiers, post-modifying PPs, pre-modifying adjectives, and post-modifying non-finite clauses, and all four features showed significant growth in our study. We found that Chinese EFL learners reached the highest point of NP use at B2/C1 levels. The finding was in accordance with Sarte and Gnevsheva’s (2022) observation that B2 often displayed the highest noun phrase count.

In general, our results are largely consistent with Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental scale. Meanwhile, we found some distinctive characteristics in the use of attributive adjectives and -ing participles as post-modifiers in our study. It is still worth mentioning that the constant growth of attributive adjectives could also be caused by the effect of topics.

# 5.2. Development of NP complexity across genres

Judged from the overall statistical analyses (Table 5), we can see that genre effect on noun phrase complexity is contingent upon learners’ proficiency levels, and it exhibits more significant effect among higher-level learners. Taking a closer look at the trajectories of the four features (complement clauses controlled by nouns, to-infinitive clauses, premodifying nouns and -ing participles as postmodifiers) in Fig. 1, some nuanced differences between the two genres are observed. The former two features show constant higher frequencies in argumentative writings than in narrative writings. The latter two features show higher frequencies in narrations at elementary levels, but are more frequently used in argumentations at the advanced level.

For complement clauses controlled by nouns and to-infinitive clauses, though their trajectories did not show linear patterns, the frequency of use in argumentative writings was steadily higher than that in narrations, where little growth was observed. For those features, the intrinsic characteristics of genres played a significant role. That is, the higher demand for information density in argu mentative writings led to the use of more complex noun phrases compared to narrative writings, as frequently discussed in previous studies, (e.g., Beers & Nagy, 2009; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2015).

The frequencies of the other two NP modifiers (premodifying nouns and -ing participles as post-modifiers) in argumentative writings do not always surpass those of narrative writings at all CEFR levels. This is contrary to expectations that argumentative writings tend to elicit more intricate syntactic structures. The probable reason might lie in learner-related factors, that is, learners’ amount of exposure to genres may be different. Since what learners are exposed to is usually the genre of narratives at the beginning of language learning (Kang, 2005; Ravid, 2005), students of lower proficiency in our research are regarded to have received more exposure to narrative writings than argumentative writings.

To detect whether students’ writing proficiency was related to the experience of learning, we conducted two pairs of Spearman rank order correlation analyses to examine the relationship between CEFR levels and educational levels, and found a strong correlation between CEFR levels and educational levels in both argumentative writings $\mathbf { \bar { \it { r h o } } } = . 9 0 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ) and narrative writings $( r h o = . 9 1 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ). Therefore, it is indicated that higher writing proficiency usually goes with a higher educational level in our dataset. In the same vein, participants at elementary level in our study received more instructions on how to write narrative essays instead of argumentative essays. It is explainable that nouns as pre-modifiers and -ing participles as post-modifiers were more frequently used among learners at B2 level and below, who were mostly high school students in our study with more exposure to narrative writings. Therefore, students’ familiarity with genres becomes a crucial factor to consider.

Based on this observation, we further investigated genre effect on NP complexity among learners at different proficiency levels. After students got familiar with both genres, they used more complex noun phrases in argumentations. As illustrated in Fig. 1, C1 level learners used more premodifying nouns and -ing participles as post-modifiers in argumentative writings than in narrative writings. Our results concur with Bi’s (2020) findings, which revealed a higher number of complex nominals per clause in argumentative writings from intermediate level learners to proficient learners.

The differing development speeds of attributive adjectives, with a faster pace in argumentative writings and a slower pace in narrative writings, are also explainable. This difference may be due to lower-level learners’ relatively frequent practice with narrative writings, and higher-level learners’ effective response to higher requirement of complex noun phrases in argumentative writings.

To summarize this section, NP complexity is getting increasingly diverse across narrations and argumentations with learners’ proficiency growing. Such phenomenon is determined by the information packaging demand innate in each genre, and influenced by learners’ familiarity with genres. Among lower proficiency learners, the influence of genre familiarity on NP complexity is pronounced, whereas for learners at higher proficiency levels, task-related features of genres play a more prominent role. In the meantime, it is noteworthy that the plateau and delayed development feature may be attributed, in part, to the inherent nature of topics, as discussions involving familiar relationships may not elicit as many complexity features. Topics with varying cognitive demands influence the use of complexity features, particularly on higher-level developmental stages (Atak & Saricaoglu, 2021).

# 6. Conclusions and implications

This study examined the noun phrase complexity in L2 English writings across five proficiency levels (A1 to C1) and in two genres (argumentative, narrative). The results revealed significant differences in the frequency of eight noun phrase complexity features across five proficiency levels. Meanwhile, the increase in frequency did not exhibit a steady growth pattern from the lowest level (A1) to the highest level (C1). Instead, surges were observed at certain proficiency levels, and the timing of frequency increase can represent the sequence of noun phrase complexity acquisition or stages of noun modifiers to a certain extent. Our findings support Biber et al.’s (2011) developmental index, which posits that higher proficiency learners employ more noun modifiers. In addition, our study found that the frequency of noun modifiers in narrative essays began to increase at A2 or B1, while for argumentative essays, growth started at B1 and ended at B2, with a one-level (on CEFR) difference. The earlier use of the same noun phrase complexity features in narrative writings might attribute to the fact that students are more familiar with narrative writings and better equipped with writing skills for narratives. However, as students practice more argumentative writing, noun phrase features in students’ writings were affected to a larger extent by the requirements of the genre. Proficient learners demonstrated higher noun phrase complexity in their argumentative writings, reflecting a greater demand for information density in this genre. The study also found that attributive adjectives could robustly reveal Chinese EFL learners’ writing development, and the growth of -ing participles as post-modifiers could be seen as a unique feature for Chinese EFL learners’ writings.

Our study has some implications for writing instruction. Teachers need to consider the growth pattern of noun phrase complexity in their students’ writings and encourage the use of complex noun phrases through genre-based writing tasks. When practicing the use of noun modifiers, teachers may select narrative writing tasks for lower and intermediate level learners, and argumentations for higher level learners, so as to more effectively elicit a broader variety of noun modifiers. In terms of the study’s implications for writing assessment, our results indicate that Biber et al.’s (2011) index offers a practical reference for the design of rating scales. Since the development of noun phrase complexity could result from both learner- and task-related factors, test developers are encouraged to take task features and learners’ genre exposure into consideration. For lower-level learners, genres with higher information density, such as argumentations, may not be appropriate. By contrast, lower-level learners are more likely to demonstrate their true linguistic repertoire in narrations.

However, our study has several limitations. First, the study only used compositions written by EFL learners whose L1 is Chinese, and this may have influenced the use of noun modifiers. As observed by Khushik and Huhta (2020), learners at the same proficiency levels may exhibit variations in language complexity due to their different L1 backgrounds. Second, a more detailed investigation of NP modifier use between adjacent CEFR levels is needed, given the abrupt changes in certain adjacent groups. Last, more types of genres should be included, such as descriptions and applications, which are also common genres taught in EFL classrooms. All these limitations will be our motivations to conduct further research.

I take a deep breath and seal like flying. The fresh air makes me full of energy. Suddenly I know what is the most valuable things in the world of sunshine, blue sky and fresh air.

I prefer country lives because I can lay on my back to watch the sunset. There are not only simple things, but also simple emotions. The happy things are written all over children’s faces, when kids pick up the hens’ eggs. They don’t need to be worried about the stress of life, just simple things. Simple things are the best sometimes.

As time passed by, our technology is improved, our cities are stronger, and the pollution is around the country. What’s more, simple lives have gone. What we think is how to make more money and get fame. What a pity! We shouldn’t take the love from the nature for granted.

Always remember, simple things make life more beautiful!

# Sample 4.

Recently, a heated debate about whether everyone should master an instrument or not has drawn oceans of attention. As for my perspectives, I think it rather positively. Among countless reasons, the following counterparts are the most convincing.

Initially, learning an instrument is beneficial to the development of the capability an individual has on aesthetics. During the process, they get the chance to cultivate their thoughts and become more wise on daily trivials, which leads to better operations on the beautiful objects that they didn’t notice before.

Simultaneously, it gains access to the expansion of social circle. Through learning an instrument, an individual is able to make friends with people who major the same field, thereby proudly better education and communication with others, which leads to the enhancement of social skills.

In summary, not only does learning an instrument improve oneself, but it helps to lift one’s social class as well. It’s extraordinarily beneficial to master an instrument.

# Sample 5.

Evolution, a linear unstoppable curse cast on all creatures, has repealed some of the most beautiful abilities off human beings. With the arising of intelligence, humans have forgetten the ability of trusting images and sensations, which has been replaced by sacred, undoubtable language. Language dissolves what used to be in charge of human brains, which cannot be described or defined by incompetent language. For instance, how can you depict the feeling that morning white sunlight touches your faces? Maybe ‘warm’, or ‘gentle’, or ‘slightly- stroking’, but your interior monologue repeats. ‘I don’t know what words can be used to tell this feeling, and all I can do is to remember it by some unknown micro neurological processes taking places in my brain.’ Then everytime you want to recollect that feeling, you won’t use any language but the unknown process to let your face feel it again.

Therefore, human needs to learn to play a musical instrument, which is an instinctual language predates and surpasses our contemporary linguistic constructs. People can play a piece of grim and bleak violinto echo the feelings of braking up with lovers or biding farewell to parents, or an incagorous and inspiring trunpet song to resonate the sensation brought by their striving to home a successful career. The mastering in a musical instrument helps the better understanding of the inner world, not inform of language, but

Comments:

1. Range/Flexibility of language: The vocabulary is basic, and there is limited variation in language use. Sentences are short and lack complexity.

2. Coherence, cohesion, and organization: The essay lacks a clear structure, and ideas are presented in a somewhat random order. Transitions between sentences are minimal, impacting coherence.

3. Accuracy:

There are several grammatical errors, such as “balck hear” instead of “black hair,” “somall noce” instead of “small nose,” and “compeleter” instead of “computer.” The use of pronouns is inconsistent (e.g., “he boss call he”).

4. Description:

Basic descriptions are provided, such as the appearance of the father with short black hair and a small nose There is potential for more detailed and vivid descriptions to enhance the reader’s experience.

5. The extent that targeted reader will be informed: The reader gets a glimpse into the writer’s relationship with the writer’s father and a brief mention of a birthday party celebration. The lack of details and organization maks it challenging for the reader to fully understand the writer’s feelings.

Overall Commentary:

“Mother”, a meaningful world. Because “Mom” is the person who brings you to the world and nurtures you day by day.

As a child, I got a lot of love from my mom. Everytime I made a mistake in accident and my father shouted at me, my mom would stood by my side and begged my father not to be so angry with me.

I would always remember one day when I came back from school, hadn’t stepped into my room, I hitted a vase near the door, and it broke. Hearing the big sound mom walked towards me without any words, swept all the glass away. I just stood and couldn’t do anything. Then, I began to worry about the attitude my father treated me. When my father came home, and didn’t see the vase near the room, my mother stood up immediately and said “That’s all my fault, I broke the vase in accident while cleaning the room.” I looked at my mom with the mouth open, hadn’t thought about she would say that. She just didn’t want me to be punished.

Mom’s love is always grateful, like a light, light me throughout my life!

A good teacher is just like a friend, a friend with whom we can share our feelings, also a friend with whom we can give each other a favor at any time.

My favorate teacher is Mr Dong. He is a teacher who teaches me Radio Direction Finding, (a P.E. course). I consider him as my favorate teacher for the reason that we are also cross-generational friends.

During each class, he will organise some interesting games or activities for us. He will also participate in the games. Enjoying the pleasure together, he gradually becomes everyone’s friend. However, it was not until the day when I happened to arrange an interview for him that we got extremely familiar with each other.

At that time, I did the interview for a single purpose of getting more knowledge about the career which is a P.E. teacher. But during the interview, he also shared a lot about his own experience, his own experience about personal life and his responsibility to enhance students’ physical skills. Thus began to share more about our twists and turns in life.

It’s quite fortunate to have a teacher as a friend. We belong to different fields thus we can help each other complimentarily. He helped me a lot efficient training ways of physical skills while sometimes I will do some programming work for him.

# Sample 10.

“Seize the moment.”

These words echoed in my mind again. I looked at the audience, feeling their eyes fixing on me. I took a deep breath and began my performance on the stage.

Memories crowded into my mind like flashback. When I was a little girl, I always couldn’t make a decision quickly. So in the end, I lost my sweets, my drinks, and my opportunity. And my father also noticed this and he said to me, “You should seize the moment. Or you’ll fail to do anything. You know, time waits for no man.” I thought he was right. But I just couldn’t make up my mind.

On one holiday he took me to learn swimming. I was a bit afraid of water and held my dad’s arms tightly. “Don’t be a coward.” He said to me and then he left me in the water alone. I yelled and struggled. “Think about the gestures and key points I just told you. Try to swim by yourself.” I still yelled. “If you couldn’t take the first step, if you couldn’t make up your mind, no one can help you.” “Seize the moment.” I told me to save myself and to be more courageous. Then I tried to swim.

I looked at the audience. They were clapping. “Thank you.” I bowed to them. And in the bottom of my heart, my father’s words became more vivid. “Thank you, Dad.” I said to myself. I want to sing in front of others, but for my father’s encouragement I was till just a dreamer. Seize the moment. I walked down and I knew, I would begin my new journey soon.
