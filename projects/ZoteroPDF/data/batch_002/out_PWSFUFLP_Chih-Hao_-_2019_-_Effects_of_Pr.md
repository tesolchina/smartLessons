Private tutoring has expanded as a global phenomenon and is receiving increasing research attention, but evaluation studies on private tutoring are lacking. By performing a control-group pretest-posttest experiment, this study examined the effectiveness of English private tutoring (EPT) on the academic performance of Taiwanese secondary school learners. One group of students $( \Nu = 1 0 0 )$ participated in EPT for three months and was compared to a non-tutored control group $( \mathbf { N } = 1 0 0 )$ ). Using national college entrance exam data gathered in 2017 and 2018 and t-tests and difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, the present study found that differences in the effect of EPT on students’ academic performance between the tutored and non-tutored groups decreased in magnitude after considering the students’ individual characteristics, family socioeconomic status, school type, and self-study practices. Among these variables, the time students spent on self-study activities had a more significant positive effect than did private tutoring. The findings from this study show that as an alternative to investing in EPT, investing time and effort in self-study activities can lead to an increase in students’ academic performance. These data from Taiwan contribute to the international analysis on private tutoring and add an important component to the broader conceptual literature.

# 1. Introduction

The industry of private tutoring, also known as “shadow education,” has spread across the globe and gained considerable attention from both researchers and policymakers. According to Bray (1999), the shadow metaphor is used because private tutoring duplicates or shadows mainstream education. As the size and scale of mainstream schooling change, so do the size and scale of shadow schooling. Moreover, as public attention toward mainstream education increases or decreases, so does public attention toward shadow education (Bray, 1999).

In many English learning contexts, English private tutoring (EPT), which is offered by profit-oriented language institutes or private tutors with the aim of increasing students’ achievement in mainstream education and on high-stakes examinations, has become a major phenomenon and one of students’ most important activities outside of school (Bray, 2011). However, the amount of research on the effectiveness of EPT has not matched the scale of its popularity. Little research exists because of the variety of tutoring forms, including those involving “a paid private instructor, a volunteer, a school aide, a parent, a guardian, another student, or a computer or other teaching machine” (Medway, 1995, p. 271), which limits researchers’ abilities to make precise statements regarding EPT.

To address this, the present study investigates the effectiveness of EPT in improving the academic performance of Taiwanese secondary school students in a control-group pretest-posttest experiment. This paper first reviews relevant studies on the effectiveness of private tutoring in a global context to interpret its expansion. Next, the paper concentrates on the Taiwanese setting to contextualize the discussion in sociocultural conditions. The paper then explains the research method used in the study to collect participants’ data and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of EPT for academic results. Finally, the paper discusses the results and their implications for the development of education policies in Taiwan and in a broader context.

# 2. The Effectiveness of Private Tutoring in Global Contexts

The privatization of education in East Asia is a significant phenomenon that has resulted in the emergence of cram schools. As Liu (2012) stated, “cram schools are also known as Buxiban in Taiwan, Juku in Japan, Hagwon in Korea, and private tuition or shadow education system in Western countries” (p. 46). The context in Korea is particularly noteworthy: in 2016, $8 0 \%$ of elementary school students, $6 3 . 8 \%$ of middle school students, and $5 2 . 4 \%$ of high school students received private supplementary education (Korea Statistical Information Service, 2017). According to a 2007 survey conducted by

Japan’s Ministry of Education (MOE), $1 5 . 9 \%$ of grade 1 students and $6 5 . 2 \%$ of grade 9 students received tutoring at home, in Juku, or with outside tutors (Bray, 2009). Data obtained from the Taiwanese MOE are particularly notable: in the 2014-2015 school year, $7 6 . 7 \%$ of elementary school students and $3 4 . 9 \%$ of senior high school students received private tutoring (MOE, Taiwan, 2015a).

Despite the fact that private tutoring is expanding, this widespread phenomenon “remains very firmly in the shadows” (Ireson, 2004, p. 110). Moreover, current studies on private tutoring have been directed mainly at its nature, scope, scale, and motivation and have paid less attention to its impact on achievement and on possible influencing mechanisms. Only a small body of research has been carried out on its impacts and mechanisms and is important to review.

In Mauritius, a study by Kulpoo (1998) was conducted in 1995 to assess the impact of input variables on the reading literacy of grade 6 pupils. Kulpoo distinguished between nonmalleable factors, such as pupils’ socioeconomic characteristics and location, and malleable factors, which are amenable to change through interventions by parents, teachers and education officials. Receiving private tutoring was placed in the malleable category along with other components such as school resources and family interest in homework and attendance. Attendance at tutoring sessions outside school hours was shown to be the strongest malleable determinant of pupils’ reading literacy, although it was not stronger than the nonmalleable factor of English being spoken in the home.

Positive results can also be found in Greece. Polydorides (1986) investigated the correlations between private tutoring and academic achievement at the senior high school level. A small positive correlation was found between tutoring and students’ GPAs, but the correlation with national examination scores was much weaker, indicating that private tutoring did not consistently influence academic achievement. In Germany, Mischo and Haag (2002) compared the performance of secondary school students who had received private tutoring over a period of 9 months with those who had not. The results showed that private tutoring led to large improvements in school performance and motivation to study. Similar findings can be found in Buchmann’s (2002) study on Kenya’s highly competitive educational system, which indicated that private tutoring resulted in fewer instances of grade repetition and contributed to stronger academic gains.

More recent literature has similarly identified positive relationships between tutoring and academic achievement. In Taiwan, a survey of 13,798 grade 7 students by Liu (2012) revealed that receiving private tutoring had positive effects on student analytical ability and mathematical performance, but the positive effects decreased as the number of tutoring hours increased. Also, in Taiwan, Chung (2013) surveyed 365 senior high school students as to their motivation towards English learning and their receipt of private tutoring. The results showed that students enrolled in private tutoring tend to be motivated, with 342 of 365 students reporting that undertaking private tutoring was beneficial for obtaining high examination scores. In South Korea, Byun (2014) used longitudinal data collected by Korean Educational Research Institute from a nationally representative sample of appropriately 7,000 Korean seventh graders to examine the casual relationships between different forms of shadow education and academic achievement in mathematics. He found that cram schooling, which focuses primarily on test preparation, made a greater contribution to academic gains than did other forms of tutoring.

However, other studies have not found any significant correlations between academic performance and private tutoring. In Egypt, the MOE conducted a survey on 18,000 students in the primary and preparatory stages of education from 1990-1991. The study showed no significant impact on students’ achievement based on gender, private tutoring, or in-school tutoring groups (Fergany, 1994). Fergany (1994) conducted a follow-up research study at the primary level, covering 4,729 households with 7,309 individuals in three different parts of the country. The results again showed no correlation between private tutoring and academic achievement. In Korea, Lee et al. (2004) investigated the effects of preclass tutoring, that is, “institutions such as cram schools teaching school curricula at least one month ahead of the school schedule on student achievement (p.25)”. Their statistical analysis found that “there exists no evidence that pre-class tutoring, either shortterm or long-term, increases school grade points” (p. 40), and the authors concluded that learning attitude was the most important determinant of school performance, not preclass tutoring. In Singapore, a study by Cheo and Quah (2005) analyzed the learning achievements of 429 grade 8 “Express” students in three secondary schools. The results suggested that “having a private tutor may be counter-productive in the Singapore setting” (p. 210), and time spent on private tutoring instead of self-study may lead to a decline in overall academic performance. The authors also concluded that the conventional wisdom of “the more the better” (pp. 280-281) created a mismatch in reality in terms of tutoring and that diminishing returns set in far quicker when “overinvestment in the child” (p.281) took place. In the UK, Ireson and Rushforth (2005) surveyed a sample of secondary school pupils and found that female pupils benefited from private tutoring much less than male students. One possible reason for this result is that female pupils already had better grades than male pupils before receiving private tutoring.

In China, Zhang (2013) examined the effect of private tutoring on national college entrance exam performance in 6,043 grade 12 students. Her analysis revealed that the effects on Mathematics, Chinese and English were mixed, with the average effect being non-significant. The author speculated that although the main functions of private tutoring are to help students with time management and provide them with exercises to familiarize themselves with entrance examination, non-tutored participants prepare in similar ways. Zhang and Liu (2016) conducted follow-up research on the effects of private tutoring on performance in Mathematics, Chinese and English in the national college entrance exam, with a focus on the class size of private tutoring. The results showed that regardless of the class size of private tutoring, private tutoring had no significant impact on student academic performance. In Hong Kong, Yung (2019) explored the L2 (second language) selves level of 18 senior secondary students receiving EPT based on Dörnyei’s (2009) L2 motivational self system. The findings indicated that “the learners possessed insecure actual L2 selves, revealing a discrepancy with their future L2 selves consisting of dominant ought-to L2 sleeves and suppressed ideal L2 selves” (p.120).

In summary, the effectiveness of private tutoring may depend on the following: (a) the content and techniques of the tutoring, (b) the motivation of students, (c) the duration of time invested in tutoring, and (d) the types of pupils receiving tutoring. Despite the potential importance of these factors, the volume and coverage of evaluation studies in private tutoring is relatively limited. Currently, such studies are primarily concerned with assessment either during or after tutoring. They predominately survey participants about their academic achievement or their self-reflection about tutoring, and most of the results are related to motivational improvement and engagement in learning. As a control-group pretest-posttest experimental design is lacking in these studies, their results should be treated with caution. According to Bray (2009), it is still controversial whether private tutoring truly improves students’ academic achievement or whether highachieving and motivated students are inclined to seek additional private tutoring to aid in high-stakes examinations. Therefore, the study described in this paper was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of private tutoring in a control-group pretest-posttest experiment.

# 3. Study Context

Widespread private tutoring industry in Taiwan has both cultural and institutional dimensions. Culturally, Taiwan, a predominantly Chinese ethnicity, is deeply rooted in Confucianism, which “emphasizes the value of meritocracy and the use of competitive examinations to determine talent” (Kuan, 2011, p. 344). Although the Taiwanese government has launched several educational reforms in the past decades in an attempt to relieve the burden of the examination culture on students, private tutoring has continued to expand, and the competition for admission to prestigious schools remains high (Jheng, 2015). Due to the competitive examinations and the high scores needed for admission to top-ranked high schools and universities, parents send their children to private tutoring institutions to pursue higher scores on exams. Institutionally, students are positioned hierarchically in senior high schools and institutions of higher education in hopes of obtaining future opportunities in the labor market and greater social mobility (Tsai, 1998). This cultural and institutional context has led to stiff academic competition, and the subject of English is particularly competitive.

Since the early 21 st century, policymakers in Taiwan have proactively promoted multilingualism to respond to the political and economic pressures of internationalization. The English language policy has shifted to focus on “proficiency in international English” (Chen, 2010, p. 90) and communicative competence (Chang, 2008). Unlike other foreign languages in Taiwan, “English enjoys a unique status and prestige” (Oladejo, 2006, p. 149). More significantly, English has been part of the elementary school curriculum since 2001 and is the only compulsory foreign language subject from elementary school to university. The Taiwanese government has also embarked upon a number of measures to create a bilingual environment “in public institutions and in the community at large” and to “make English the second official language of the country” (Oladejo, 2006, p.149). “The Challenge 2008: National Development Plan,” for instance, is targeted at “developing a new generation of creative, lively youths capable of international dialogue and adept at using information and English skills to their advantage” (MOE Taiwan, 2015b, p.1). Basic English communication classes have been provided to help Taiwanese people engage in English and further develop their English-speaking skills not only within the purview of the government but also in their work domains. Additionally, English competence has become a prerequisite for promotion for government employees (Chang, 2006).

As a result, most Taiwanese parents enroll their children in English classes to expose them to English in advance of the timeline suggested by government policy with the idea that earlier is better (Chang, 2008). This phenomenon is believed to have led to the increase in private tutoring. Liu (2012) surveyed seventh-grade Taiwanese students (i.e., students in the first year of secondary school) based on the 2001 Taiwan Education Panel Survey and found that $7 2 . 9 \%$ were attending private tutoring institutions for an average of 6.24 hours per week, and English was the most popular subject in private tutoring. According to online governmental statistics, the number of wen-li (a Chinese term meaning “literature and science”) private tutoring institutions, which prepare students for entrance examinations in major academic subjects (mainly English and math), rose from 3,299 in 2004 to 10,943 in 2018 (The Education Bureau of the Kaohsiung City Government in Taiwan, 2018). However, the number of seventh-grade students enrolled decreased greatly from 0.31 million in 2004 to 0.2 million in 2018 (MOE Taiwan, 2018).

The rapid growth of private tutoring institutions reflects not only parents’ willingness to invest in private tutoring but also students’ devotion of extra time and effort to learning outside of their regular classes with the hope of obtaining greater returns in the future via academic competitions.

The expansion of shadow education in Taiwan has been attributed to institutional characteristics that are rooted in the existing Taiwanese education system. (Stevenson and Baker 1992). The prevalence of private tutoring may also reinforce individual students’ and parents’ beliefs in the importance of attending private tutorial schools to attain better examination results. It is thus important to determine whether private tutoring has a significant positive effect on academic performance. If it does, the issue of private tutoring will be a concern not only for those who are engaged in private tutoring but also those who lack the opportunity or resources to attend private tutoring, as it may affect students’ educational choices through the stratification process. Therefore, the main research question in this study is as follows: Does private tutoring have an effect on students’ academic performance in English, a subject that most senior high school students take and that is highly valued in Taiwan, and if so, how large is its effect?

# 4. Analytical Framework

Reliably identifying the effect of private tutoring on students’ English performance is challenging because important determinants of English performance, such as cognitive and motivational factors and ecological variables (e.g., parental support), must be taken into account. Social and individual factors that influence students’ willingness to undertake EPT need to be considered to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of EPT on students’ English performance.

With regard to cognitive and motivational factors, private tutoring may have a positive effect on academic achievement because it increases actual learning time and instructional resources (Kuan, 2011). Carroll’s model of school learning (Carroll, 1963) specifies that the time factor plays an important role in learning and “time on task”. In this model, Carroll posited that whether learning is effective in enhancing student achievement depends on the actual time needed for learning and the time actually spent on learning. That is, the amount of time that students engage in learning activities and the length of time during which learning actually occurs are important factors affecting students’ performance. Therefore, this model can be applied to evaluating the effects of private tutoring, which depend on students’ initiative, effort, and ability and the time they devote to learning.

As parents invest resources in their children’s learning by using private tutoring for either remedial or advancement purposes, ecological variables are likely to be factors that influence the effects of private tutoring (Bray and Kobakhidze, 2015). Bronfenbrenner’s (1994) ecological theory allows reconstruction of the different ecological systems relevant to private tutoring and the relationships among these systems. Individual differences are an important component of Bronfenbrenner’s (1994) theory. The microsystem of private tutoring comprises the tutor and the learner. Within this microsystem, cooperative interactions occur between tutor and learner that affect future interactions and the cognitive structures of the learner. Another microsystem, the school learning context of the learner, interacts with the private tutoring microsystem. The relationship between private tutoring and schooling, referred to as the mesosystem comprising these microsystems, may affect learning in either school or private tutoring; it may do so through via as shared ideas, content, learning goals, beliefs about teaching and learning, strategies or motivation between tutors and teachers. A third microsystem is the learners’ family “as an immediate environment in which learners develop, both socially and cognitively” (Bronfenbrenner, 1994, p.38); this microsystem involves the parents’ educational goals, beliefs, supporting strategies, and socioeconomic and intellectual backgrounds. These ecological variables may lead to parental investment of both economic and social capital in private tutoring because of their high expectations regarding the learning outcomes of their children. Hence, family socioeconomic background and parental involvement may be differentiated in the learning process. The interaction (mesosystem) of private tutoring (microsystem) and family (microsystem) is potentially important in contributing to differences between microsystems and the individual.

Receiving private tutoring to maintain competitive advantage at school or to catch up with peers involves not only the student’s initiative but parents’ expectations. Both students and parents have high expectations that private tutoring works. At the individual level, willingness to participate in private tutoring and expectations regarding the outcomes of attending private tutoring vary from person to person. Conceivably, individual and family differences may have an impact on the effects of private tutoring. Students who are motivated to enhance their learning or have high expectations for private tutoring outcomes would benefit even more than those who are less motivated and more reluctant to learn. It is also conceivable that high achievers with higher socioeconomic family backgrounds and access to better schools would benefit more than low achievers with lower socioeconomic backgrounds (Bray, 2009). In short, the learning effects between students with and without private tutoring can be predicted. Moreover, comparing the effects of private tutoring between tutored students and nontutored students is complicated because these two groups may be quite different at the individual and social levels, and the effects of undertaking private tutoring on students’ academic performance may differ.

Previous research regarding private tutoring in the Taiwanese context (Liu, 2006; Kuan, 2011; Liu, 2012) has indicated that both individual and social factors influence participation in private tutoring. These studies, using either Taiwan Education Panel Survey data or national survey data, revealed that parental education and occupational status affect students’ academic performance. There are also other significant variables that have relative effects on students’ achievement, such as gender, school type, family income, family status, sibling size, parental and self-educational expectations, and residential status.

However, the effects of private tutoring observed in previous studies are likely biased. First, these studies failed to consider important variables such as students’ self-study time spent doing homework and previewing and reviewing the subject. These omitted variables may contribute to the positive effects of private tutoring on students’ academic performance. Furthermore, most of the studies did not fully explore possible heterogeneous variables such as cognitive and motivational factors and ecological variables in a control-group pretestposttest experimental design. This study argues that methods such as ttests, which compare the mean scores between a tutored group and a non-tutored group, and difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, which takes heterogeneous variables into account to estimate the effects of private tutoring on students’ performance, are beneficial.

# 5. Data and Measures

This research used two measures of English achievement: the mock General Scholastic Ability English Test (GSAET) in November 2017 and the GSAET in January 2018. The GSAET scores are available in only two forms: (a) total scores, ranging from 1 to 15, and (b) handwritten scores, including translation and writing marks. This grading system converts raw English test scores into number scores. The aim of the pretest was to test participants’ English ability before receiving EPT. The present study focused on estimating the effects of EPT on secondary students’ academic performance.

To evaluate the likely effectiveness of EPT, a t-test was performed to compare the results of the pretest and posttest between the treatment and control groups. This analysis determined whether EPT made a significant difference in students’ achievements. To test the significance of the differences, the pretest scores (i.e., prior to EPT) should not differ significantly between the control and treatment groups. None of the outcomes of the t-tests was significant in the pretest. T-tests were also run to examine the gains or losses from pretest to posttest considering differences between the treatment and control groups. Next, DID analysis was used to investigate which factors may influence the effects of private tutoring on the academic performance of the control group and treatment group.

In addition to assessing the mean score changes from pretest to posttest by using t-tests, a simple regression model was employed in the empirical investigation to examine whether EPT enhances academic performance. The statistical model is shown as in Eq. (1):

$$
\mathrm { Y i } = \mathrm { \ B } 0 \ + \mathrm { \beta } 1 \mathrm { X i } + \mathrm { u i }
$$

where $\mathit { Y i }$ indicates the scores for the students; Xi refers to EPT; $_ { \beta 0 }$ and $\beta \boldsymbol { 1 }$ are parameters of the regression line; and ui refers to the error term.

Next, DID was employed to estimate the effect of EPT by comparing

the variables between the control group and the treatment group. The function form is shown as in Eq. (2):

$$
\mathrm { Y i = \ B 0 \ + \beta 1 X i \ + \beta 2 p o s t i + \beta 3 \ ( X ^ { * } p o s t ) i + u i }
$$

where $\beta \boldsymbol { 1 } X i$ is the main effect of treatment group; posti refers to the posttreatment time dummy; $^ { \beta 3 , }$ , the average treatment effect, multiplies the interaction term $( X ^ { \ast } p o s t )$ , which is the same as a dummy variable equal to one for those observations in the treatment group in the postperiod.

Brief descriptions of the definitions and measures of the variables used in this study are listed in Table 4.

# 6. Participants

The study participants included 200 Taiwanese third-grade senior high school students (17-18 years old) who were from 13 different senior high schools attending 12 private tutoring institutions. All 12 private tutoring institutions are legally registered in Taiwan. Students in this study were engaged 90 minutes a day, two days a week, preparing for the English exam portion of the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT) in 2018. One hundred students receiving EPT (i.e., the treatment group) were recruited to participate in this study. To ensure there were no significant differences in the t-tests for the pretest scores, the 100 students from the treatment group were encouraged to seek counterparts (i.e., 100 students not receiving EPT) in their senior high schools whose English scores on the national mock exam were similar to theirs to be part of the control group.

# 7. Survey Questionnaire

In the present study, survey questionnaires were used to collect participants’ demographic details, their family’s socioeconomic characteristics, their marks on the mock GSAET in November 2017, their scores on the GSAET in January 2018, their school type, and the time they spent in self-study doing English homework and previewing and reviewing English learning materials other than EPT materials.

The survey of non-EPT participants showed that they did not attend any English language tutorial courses in the past year. They had not engaged in self-study activities and had not used materials from tutorial classes since at least November 2016. As for the EPT participants, they were asked to report the self-study time invested in homework and in previewing and reviewing English related materials other than those related to private tutoring. Thus, the time EPT participants invested in independent study did not include the time they

invested with their private tutoring materials. The EPT group invested more self-study time than the non-EPT group.

# 8. General Scholastic Ability Test Pretest (English Mock Exam) and Posttest (English Exam)

The GSAET is a nationwide test for college admission in Taiwan. In the present study, data from the mock GSAET in November 2017 were used as the pretest, and data from the GSAET in January 2018 were used as the posttest. The mock GSAET and the GSAET are national tests designed in Taiwan. The test is divided into two major parts, and the content of the first part (i.e., multiple choice questions) focuses on vocabulary items (15 points), grammar items in short and long readings (25 points) and reading comprehension questions (32 points). The content of the second part (i.e., handwritten questions) includes Chinese-to-English translation (8 points) and English writing (20 points).

# 9. The Effects of English Private Tutoring on Students’ Academic Performance

As shown in Table 1, the mock GSAET scores were not significantly different in terms of the means, standard deviations and t-tests. This result was necessary in order for the posttest data to exhibit any significance.

The difficulty levels of the mock GSAET and the GSAET were designed to be similar, thereby increasing the reliability of the tests. It was therefore interesting to investigate whether the EPT undertaken by third-grade students in senior high school would have a positive effect on their GSAET scores. The information in brackets in Table 1 are the mean scores and standard deviations for the posttest for the students in both the treatment and control groups. The treatment group showed significant improvement from the pretest $( \mathbf { M } = 1 0 . 7 9 )$ ) to the posttest $( \mathbf { M } = 1 1 . 9 3 )$ , while the control group showed only a slight improvement, from 10.72 on the pretest to 10.90 on the posttest. The t-tests assessing the relationship between the English proficiency scores showed a significant difference between the treatment group and the control group on the posttest $( \mathbf { p } ~ < ~ 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { t } = 3 . 4 5$ ).

Table 2 displays the t-test analysis of the pretest and posttest scores for the tutored and non-tutored groups. The t-test showed that $\mathrm { t } = - 3 . 5 5$ and $\mathbf { p } \ < \ 0 . 0 0 1$ , indicating that there was a significant difference before and after tutoring for the tutored group.

The brackets in Table 2 show the t-test results for the pretest and posttest scores of the non-tutored group. The results indicate that ${ \mathrm { ~ \bf ~ t ~ } } =$ -0.53 and ${ \tt p } = 0 . 5 9$ $( \mathtt { p } > 0 . 0 5 )$ ); thus, no significant difference was found between the pretest and posttest scores for the control group.

As seen in Fig. 1, compared with the pretest, some students in both the tutored and non-tutored groups scored worse on the posttest, while some scored better. However, a majority of the students in the tutored group improved their scores $( 6 2 \% )$ . Only $^ { 1 3 \% }$ of the tutored students received worse scores, and $2 5 \%$ received the same scores on both tests. In the non-tutored group, $2 9 \%$ of the students improved their scores, while $7 1 \%$ either received worse scores or maintained the same scores. Thus, the data confirm that students in the tutored group showed more improvement overall than those in the non-tutored group.

To determine whether students in the tutored group made greater gains in their GSAET scores than the non-tutored group, a t-test was used to analyze the change in scores between the tutored group and non-tutored group. The results of this analysis are in Table 3 and reveal significant gains from the pretest to the posttest for the tutored group $( \mathbf { p } \gets 0 . 0 0 1 )$ .

# 10. Factors Influencing Students’ Academic Performance in the Tutored Group and Non-tutored Group

# 10.1. Descriptive statistics

Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics for the tutored and nontutored students $( N = 2 0 0 )$ ). According to Table 5, in the tutored group, 47 students were male, and 53 were female. Among them, 87 lived in municipalities, 11 lived in cities, and 2 lived in towns. In the non-tutored group, 42 students were male, and 58 were female. Eighty of these students lived in municipalities, 14 lived in cities, and 6 lived in towns.

Monthly family income was, on average, NT135,000 in the tutored group and NT79,900 in the non-tutored group. Regarding parental education, in the tutored group, 95 of the parents of the students were university graduates, while only 5 had completed high school or below. In the non-tutored group, 83 parents were university graduates, and 17 had completed high school or below. The fathers of the students in the tutored group were all employed, and only one student’s father in the non-tutored group was unemployed. Regarding family status, 95 students in the tutored group and 91 students in the non-tutored group lived with their parents; 5 students in the tutored group and 7 in the non-tutored group were from single-parent families; and 2 students in the non-tutored group did not live with their parents.

In terms of educational expectations, most of the students and parents in the tutored group (188) and non-tutored group (183) expected themselves or their children to complete university education. This result indicates that both the students and their parents had high educational expectations.

Unlike students’ individual characteristics such as gender, participation in private tutoring and English academic performance, family’s socioeconomic status, and school type, self study variables have rarely been used in previous empirical studies on private tutoring in Taiwan or other countries. Self-study variables refer to the amount of time that students spend per week doing English homework and previewing and reviewing English learning materials independently. On average, mean self-study time spent doing homework and previewing and reviewing English-related materials was 3.35, 2.66, and 3.26 hours, respectively, in the tutored group and 2.24, 1.79, and 1.83 hours, respectively, in the

# 10.2. Does English Private Tutoring Enhance Students’ Academic Performance?

Table 6 represents the results of the DID regression analysis conducted to predict students’ academic performance with and without EPT and other background variables. Model 1 controlled for students’ prior achievement by including the pretest and family background variables but not the tutoring variables. In this way, we controlled for the situation in which students participated in EPT in response to their academic performance. Controlling the pretest may reveal the effect of EPT on students’ academic achievement. Model 2 shows the relationships between students’ academic performance with and without EPT. According to the estimations, private tutoring matters. Attending private tutoring enhanced students’ academic performance: students who participated in EPT had a better chance of obtaining higher scores than their counterparts who did not participate in EPT. Model 3 included only the family background variables in the analysis, and Model 4 added the variables related to EPT. Importantly, the effect of EPT remained highly significant in Model 4, and the $p$ value changed from 0.018 in Model 2 to 0.002 in Model 4. These results highlight the robust effect of EPT and the family background variables on students’ academic achievement.

Models 5-7 were hierarchically nested. Model 5 included only variables related to students’ academic performance and the self-study variables. Model 6 additionally controlled for students’ participation in private tutoring by including the tutored group and non-tutored group. The last model, Model 7, included the indicators of family’s socioeconomic status and school type.

As expected from Models 1-4, students from affluent families exhibited higher achievement than those from lower-income families. Parental education and employment status had positive effects on students’ academic performance; that is, the higher education parents had, the greater the gain in students’ scores. Regarding father’s employment status, students with employed fathers had better scores than those with unemployed fathers. School type also had effects on students’ performance: students from private schools had higher scores than those from public schools. Additionally, female students had a tendency to achieve higher scores on the GSAET than their male counterparts, although this result was not statistically significant. Students without siblings did not have higher scores than students with siblings. Family status, parental educational expectations, and self-educational expectations were not found to be significantly associated with scores on the GSAET. Students living in municipalities were more likely to have better results than those living in cities or towns. This finding suggests that EPT has a positive effect on students’ academic performance, as exemplified in Models 1 to 4.

However, the findings above may overestimate the effects of EPT, as self-study variables were not taken into account. The results of Model 5 show that self-study characteristics have relatively strong effects on students’ academic performance. Model 6 shows that the addition of the private tutoring variable did not reduce the impact of the self-study variables; the effect of these variables seemed to be quite significant. This result points to the possibility of obtaining biased estimations of the effects of private tutoring on students’ academic performance if possible unobservable variables are not taken into account. If self-study variables are considered, the possibility of obtaining biased estimation on effects of private tutoring can be limited. Specifically, the results of Model 7 indicate that female students who devote time to self-study activities tend to have better academic results than female students who do not devote time to these activities. These self-study factors, which have a positive effect on students’ academic performance, need to be considered in the estimation of the effects of private tutoring on students’ academic performance. If they are not, only a partial and biased picture of the effects of private tutoring on academic achievement will be obtained.

# 11. Discussion and Conclusion

This paper investigated the effectiveness of EPT for improving academic performance among Taiwanese learners while taking into account the students’ individual characteristics, family socioeconomic status, school type and amount of time invested in self-study activities. The findings are summarized below. First, EPT had a clear, positive effect on students’ GSAET performance. The subjects who participated in EPT exhibited a significant improvement in their GSAET scores, receiving higher scores overall than those who did not participate in EPT. The results of the t-tests show that students in the tutored group exhibited significant score gains between the pretest and posttest. Second, students from high-income families had better scores than those from low-income families. Students’ scores were influenced by family income, parental education and father’s employment status. Third, private school students made more significant academic gains than public school students. These findings may indicate that well-educated parents are more willing to invest in their children’s education to improve their children’s academic performance, and these findings echo certain aspects of previous studies (Liu, 2006; Liu, 2012). It should be emphasized, however, that the effect strength of private tutoring became minimal when the self-study variables were added to the research model. The results show that time spent on self-study activities had a significant and positive effect on students’ academic performance. Furthermore, this finding implies that the process of how private tutoring affects students’ academic performance may be complicated, and self-study factors may serve as a mechanism to reduce the time spent in private tutoring. These results shed new light on the role of self-study activities, which can reduce the inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged students in terms of academic achievement and the time spent on and family resources invested in private tutoring.

This study provides insights for policymakers, parents and educators not only in Asian contexts with deep-rooted, high-stakes examinations but also in Western settings, which are gradually becoming more examination-oriented. As Asian schools have placed greater emphasis on quantifiable, measurable, and standardized examinations in language education, students have begun to learn for the examinations, leading to the expansion of EPT. If national policy aims to reduce inequality in educational opportunities, then English language education may need to be addressed to reduce the learning gap between mainstream education and EPT. To improve academic achievement, students should spend more time on self-study activities instead of relying on investments in private institutions because increasing self-study time is one mechanism for enhancing academic performance. Panel survey data collected by the Taiwan Youth Project on participation in private tutoring among grade 12 students showed that over $7 0 \%$ of students participated in EPT (Chang, 2012). This may indicate that English curriculum designers have been unsuccessful in their goal to some extent. It is necessary to re-examine and adjust the mainstream system in order to develop effective mechanisms for English language learning, English teaching skills, and the design of English examinations that focus mainly on reading and writing.

This paper focused on the quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of EPT in enhancing academic performance. Future quantitative research could explore topics such as school characteristics (school of high or low socioeconomic status) and how they are related to the intensity, quantity, and quality of EPT. It would be beneficial to increase the sample size to include a wider range of schools and tutoring institutions. In addition, interviews with teachers, students and tutors would be valuable for assessing the effects of EPT

Given the popularity of EPT, it is highly unlikely that students or parents will be dissuaded from the idea of attending private tutoring in Taiwan. EPT is still a “relatively underresearched area” (Hamid et al., 2009, p. 303), and although the current study contributes some useful insights into this educational system, the effect of private tutoring should be further investigated in an international context. The expansion of shadow education in much of the world has raised concerns among policymakers and educators regarding how to regulate private tutoring activities, as they may negatively influence the equity and quality of mainstream education (Bray, 2009; Bray, 2011). While this research is limited to the case of Taiwan, further work can extend its scope to neighboring societies such as China, Japan, and South Korea with similar cultural dimensions influenced by Confucianism and similar institutional characteristics with regard to education. Future researchers can investigate, using appropriate methods, whether selfstudy has a more significant and positive effect on English performance than private tutoring in other settings.
