# Abstract

The art of writing a successful conference proposal is an important task for many TESOL professionals. If the proposal is not accepted, they will not be able to present their paper, and thus may not be able to get funds to attend the conference. Despite its importance, there is little research regarding this genre. In the present study we describe the genre characteristics of the one-page “summary” in the TESOL conference proposal, using a corpus of proposals submitted to the 1996 TESOL Conference. We identified rhetorical moves in each proposal (territory, gap, goal, means, reporting previous research, outcomes, benefits, competence claim, importance claim) and compared the use of these moves in proposals of three different subgenres (Research, Pedagogical and Administrative). Although we found certain combinations of moves in all three subgenres, we also found that variation in the sequencing of these moves depended not only on the specific audience but also on writers’ individual style. These discoveries will help writers of proposals for future conferences attend to aspects of form, content and audience.

# 1. Introduction

For many TESOL professionals, writing conference proposals is an indispensable gateway to their profession. Because academicians often need to have their work accepted by a conference in order to obtain funding to attend it, and because their acceptance provides them with a public platform from which to introduce their work to their peers, writing successful conference proposals is of the utmost importance. Yet, submitters of conference proposals are given little guidance in how to write effective submissions. And since proposals are not published in conference program books, which typically have only a title and a 50-word synopsis included, there are no examples to which writers can refer.

Conference proposals have been the target of six recent studies in rhetoric and linguistics Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995) pioneering study of the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) conference proposals from 1989, 1990, and 1992 showed that successful proposals included both predictable form and content. In addition, successful proposals were considered timely and interesting to the CCCC’s discourse community. In terms of form, Berkenkotter and Huckin assert that a typical CCCC abstract has a text schema of problem—method—findings—conclusion. In addition to having such a preferred text form, any abstract must be “interesting” to the insider audience.

Faber (1996) used the same data set as Berkenkotter and Huckin. He identified “formal and generic features” of the abstracts using a model developed for the articulation of the “unsolicited proposal” genre. This model included introduction—problem—objectives—product— method—citations. Although high-rated abstracts used these features more consistently than the low-rated ones, as many as twenty percent of the high-rated abstracts deviated from this model. A distinguishing feature between the high-rated and low-rated abstracts was the references to “insider status” and to academic and institutional affiliations and prestigious funding sources in the high-rated abstracts. Central to both Berkenkotter and Huckin’s and Faber’s conclusions was the inability of a generic text model to explain the quality of an abstract.

Kaplan et al. (1994) provided a linguistic analysis of 294 American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL) abstracts. Their research included features such as thematic structure, clause structure, propositional organization, and lexical cohesion. They also included Swales’ (1990) moves analysis of article introductions with its four moves: establishing the field, summarizing previous research, preparing for present research, and introducing the present research. Kaplan et al.’s research provides interesting, quantifiable findings about characteristics of AAAL abstracts.

Ra¨isa¨nen (1999) analyzed the rhetorical features of abstracts submitted to three automotive crash safety conferences over a period of 30 years. Her core corpus was from a joint conference of The American Association of Automotive Medicine (AAAM) and the International Research Council on the Biomechanics of Impact (IRCOBI) held in 1994, with the addition of abstracts submitted to the IRCOBI conference in 1996. She identified two obligatory moves (statement of purpose and methods) as well as three optional moves (territory, results, and conclusion/ implications) (1999, p.145).

Andersson and Gunnarsson (1995) examined 40 abstracts from the 1993 AILA conference and found a “correspondence between the number of scholarly references and the rhetorical structures of the abstracts” (p. 145). They concluded that the rhetorical structure of these abstracts depended on the content, and suggested that such differences in the structure of accepted conference abstracts requires further investigation.

The only study that we know of that investigated TESOL proposals was a dissertation by Stein (1997), in which he examined several hundred proposals submitted to the 1996 TESOL conference. Stein limited his analysis to proposals submitted to two Special Interest Groups (SIGs)—ESL in Higher Education and Research. In his analysis of accepted and rejected proposals, he used the following four moves: introduction–methods–results–discussion. Stein found that there was no significant difference in the frequency of these moves between accepted and rejected proposals in either SIG. He also found that the Introduction move was the most frequent and the Results move was the least frequent in both sets of proposals. Another interesting finding was that for both SIGs, “a consistent pattern emerged of moves proving to be more optional than obligatory in nature” (p. 170).

In the present study, we identified a set of semantic/functional components or moves in a corpus of one-page summaries of TESOL Conference proposals. The purpose of the study was to come up with a set of rhetorical/functional moves used in the proposals. We were interested in finding out whether the inclusion of certain moves was related to success in getting a proposal accepted. We were also interested in the variation exhibited in the proposals due to the intended audience.

Before the description of the study, a section on proposals as a persuasive genre will introduce the theoretical framework of the study.

# 2. Theoretical framework and method of analysis

Conference proposals are a genre of persuasive writing. Because of their communicative purpose to “sell an idea,” conference abstracts have a great deal in common with three promotional genres studied by linguists in the last few years, namely sales letters and job applications (Bhatia, 1993; Connor et al., 1995) and grant proposals (Connor, 2000; Connor and Mauranen, 1999). In all of these promotional genres, the purpose is to “sell” a product: a service or product in sales letters, a person’s abilities in letters of applications, and ideas in conference abstracts and grant proposals. Grant proposals and conference abstracts, as is the case with sales letters and applications, need to capture the attention of the reader; they need to describe the idea, adjust it to the needs of the readers, and establish the writer’s competence.

Genre analysis that identifies prototypical moves or functional components has a great deal to offer for the study of conference proposals. In research which examined grant proposals for European Union (EU) research funds, Connor et al. (1995) and Connor and Mauranen (1999) developed a linguistic/rhetorical system of genre-specific moves to describe and evaluate grant proposals. The moves were further validated through a case study approach with US scientists and humanists writing grant proposals to grant agencies in the US (Connor, 2000).

Grant and conference proposals are clearly related persuasive genres. Both have the communicative purpose of convincing members of an academic discourse community to approve a request to further knowledge in the field. Both propose a product which can be in a variety of stages of completion. The data from the EU grant proposal project and the conference proposals of the present study show a striking similarity in the semantic functional units between the one-page summary required at the beginning of most grant proposals and the one-page academic conference proposal.

We used the rhetorical moves developed by Swales (1981, 1990) and applied to grant proposals by Connor (2000), Connor et al. (1995), and Connor and Mauranen (1999), but we made some changes because of differences between conference proposals and grant proposals. We added one move (“MEANS 2”), which includes the methods and procedures to carry out the presentation and substituted the term “OUTCOMES” for “ACHIEVEMENTS” for explicitness. We realize that this distinction is basically a semantic one. The term “OUTCOMES” more aptly describes the way results are mentioned and explicitly described by conference proposal writers. Whereas grant proposal writers tend to take credit for the results ensuing from their funded research, conference proposal writers tend not to take as much responsibility for their results.

See Fig. 1 for a list of the moves.

# 2.1. The study

In our study we analyzed a corpus of proposals submitted to the 1996 TESOL Conference. Persons submitting a proposal to TESOL must designate one of 18 SIGs (Special Interest

TERRITORY establishes the situation in which the activity in the proposal is placed or physically located.

Reporting Previous Research (RPR) refers to text that reports on or refers to earlier research in the field, either by the proposing researcher or by others.

GAP indicates that there is a lack of knowledge or a problem in the territory. This move serves to explain the motivation of the study..

GOAL is the statement of aim, or general objective of the proposed activity.

MEANS 1 indicates the methods, procedures, plans of action, and tasks that the proposal specifies as leading to the GOAL .

MEANS 2 includes the methods and procedures to carry out the actual presentation.

OUTCOMES describes the anticipated results, findings, or achievements of the study or other proposed activity.

BENEFITS explains the intended or projected outcomes which could be considered useful to the "real world' outside the study itself, or even outside of the research field.

IMPORTANCE CLAIM presents the proposal, its objectives, anticipated outcomes, or the territory as particularly important or topical, much needed or urgent with respect to either the "real' or research worlds..

COMPETENCE CLAIM contains statements to the effect that the proposer is well qualified, experienced, and generally capable of carrying out the tasks set out.

Groups) to review the proposal, must designate an overall topic (assessment, discourse analysis, etc.) and must choose from the following formats: paper, demonstration, workshop, or colloquium. Each SIG chooses its own proposal reviewers and in some SIGs, since there are no organizational guidelines, each reviewer determines the criteria used for acceptance and rejection. (Guidelines for submission disseminated by TESOL appear in Appendix.)

The proposals from the 1996 Convention were made available to us by the conference organizers. All of the proposals were identified by a number indicating the order in which they were received by TESOL and the SIG to which the proposal had been submitted. No information was available as to whether the proposal had been accepted or rejected. We referred to the conference program book to try to identify those proposals that had been accepted and those that had been rejected. A proposal may have been accepted by the conference but later withdrawn by the presenter(s) and thus may not have appeared in the conference book even though it had been accepted. However, as we did not have access to such information from the conference organizers, we simply identified all of the proposals described in the conference program as “accepted” and assumed that those proposals not listed were in the “rejected” category.

In the first stage, we tried out the moves analysis on two groups of proposals—accepted and rejected— submitted for Paper presentations. (It was decided that proposals submitted for demonstration, workshop, or colloquium would add too many additional variables in the analysis.) In the second stage, instead of dividing the proposals into accepted and rejected, we labeled proposals for their more specific communicative purpose as research, pedagogical and administrative.

In the first stage, we took all of the proposals $N { = } 1 9 1 1$ ) that had been sent to the conference and sorted them by SIG and by type (Paper). Then from the resultant corpus of proposals from nine of the larger SIGs, we chose at random ten accepted $N { = } 9 0$ ) and ten rejected proposals for Paper presentations $( N { = } 9 0$ ), and ten accepted and ten rejected proposals from a combined group of eight smaller SIGs (to which fewer proposals had been sent) to make a total of two hundred proposals.

Once we had selected the proposals for further study, a Research Assistant trained in the moves analysis began to identify the rhetorical moves of each proposal. Both authors checked this initial identification, and we discussed our working definitions of the moves until we reached agreement on all of the moves. For the definitions of the rhetorical moves in the proposals, Swales’ (1981, 1990) notion of move was adapted with minor modifications. Essentially, a move in a text is a functional unit, used for some identifiable rhetorical purpose. Moves can vary in size, but contain at least one proposition.

After all the proposals had been analyzed, there was further discussion about the identification of certain ambiguous moves and every proposal was rechecked by one of the authors. Such checking continued until there was agreement on all of the moves in the 200 proposals. For a list of the moves, see Fig. 1.

# 2.1.1. Stage 1: successful and rejected proposals

After identifying the moves in each proposal, we examined the frequency of moves in the two groups, and also did word counts of the accepted and rejected proposals. There was no difference in the frequency of moves in the accepted and rejected proposals. The only significant finding was with regard to word counts. A $t -$ test on rejected and accepted proposals confirmed that the accepted proposals were significantly longer than the rejected ones $( t = - 7 . 9 0 1$ , $d f { = } 9$ , $p =$ 0.000). See Table 1 for the word counts by SIG.

There may be several reasons for the lack of differences in the use of moves in accepted and rejected proposals. First, the form and content of proposals may not be as important in the raters’ estimation as other factors such as interest in the topic or the conference chair’s desire to include a representative set of papers. In addition, there may not be a consistent rate of rejection across all SIGs. TESOL’96 represented a wide range of epistemological orientations because TESOL is the professional organization not only of applied linguists and researchers but also of teachers and administrators in and out of academia. As such, its presentations include a variety of different types of foci and styles. All of these factors may have contributed to the findings.

# 2.1.2. Stage 2: moves across three different proposal subgenres

The first stage of the study investigated moves in a corpus of 200 proposals selected from the larger corpus of 1911 proposals submitted to TESOL. The second stage of the study involved a group of 300 proposals. In this stage we focused on accepted proposals and divided all of them into three subgenres. We applied the moves to proposals that we identified as: (1) Research $N =$ 100), (2) Pedagogical $( N { = } 1 0 0$ ), and (3) Administrative $( N { = } 1 0 0 )$ ). These categories apply across all SIGs. Instead of categorizing the proposals by SIG, we decided to use these categories as a distinguishing factor in a further attempt to understand the structure of the conference proposal genre. We consider these three as separate subgenres of the TESOL proposal genre. What we hypothesized was that different types of proposals would call for a different emphasis on the frequency and sequencing of the moves. Thus, our aim was not to evaluate proposals based on a prescriptive model of the moves but rather to discover how they were used in a variety of proposal types.

Proposals which described an empirical study (regardless of the interest section to which they were sent) were categorized as belonging to “Research.” For example, one proposal sent to English as a Foreign Language described a study conducted in China investigating the motivation and learning strategies of 741 senior high school students. Another proposal, sent to the International Teaching Assistants (ITA) SIG described a study investigating the contributions of prosodic and discourse features of ITAs who spoke an institutionalized variety of English. Both of these proposals, although not sent to the Research SIG, were categorized as “Research” because they described an empirical study, and included information about the methods, subjects, and results of the study.

Proposals that introduced classroom activities or certain approaches to teaching were called “Pedagogic.” For example, a proposal sent to ESL in Higher Education that focused on the benefits of using talk-throughs and reading journals in reading classrooms, and a proposal sent to ESL in Secondary Schools that focused on the ways that ESL teachers and science teachers could network in their advocacy for ESL learners were both considered to be Pedagogical in nature.

Administrative proposals, on the other hand, were concerned with issues facing teacher trainers or administrators. For example, proposals sent to Program Administration or Teacher Education offering a model for EFL teacher training groups, and a proposal sent to English for Specific Purposes describing the role of a workplace education training institute all fit our definition of the “Administrative” type. We did not have difficulty dividing the sample proposals into these three categories: research, pedagogic, and administrative. After separating the proposals into these three categories, we chose 100 proposals at random from each of these three subgenres. Table 2 shows the distribution of the sample proposals by SIG and category. The SIGs contributing the largest number of proposals across all three types were ESL in Higher Education and Teacher Education. This is not surprising since these SIGs are among the largest and receive a larger number of proposals. As would be expected, the largest group in the Research category came from the Research SIG, but we also had proposals in this category that came from thirteen other SIGs.

# 3. Results: the moves and frequencies

We will discuss the results in two steps. First we describe each move, include examples of moves, and indicate frequency counts of the moves across the three subgenres. See Table 3 for frequencies. In some cases, we include more examples of certain moves to clearly demonstrate

Table 2 SIG distribution by three categories

the textual devices or lexical markers most frequently associated with those moves. Second, we include examples of complete proposals from each of the three subgenres to illustrate not only choice of move but also sequencing of move in the three categories of proposals.

# 3.1. TERRITORY

TERRITORY establishes the situation in which the activity in the proposal is placed or physically located and usually appeared as the initial move of a proposal. This move appeared in more than half of the proposals $62 \%$ of the Administrative proposals, $67 \%$ of the Pedagogical proposals and $57 \%$ of Research proposals). There are two types of territory: (1) that of the “real world” in which a particular event is described:

Example 1: In 1991, our organization was invited by Russian education authorities to open an English language International School for Russian students in YuzhnoSakhalinsk, Russia.

Table 3 Frequency of moves by proposal type   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Administrative (N= 100)</td><td>Pedagogical (N= 100)</td><td>Research (N= 100)</td></tr><tr><td>Territory</td><td>61</td><td>67</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>RPR</td><td>15</td><td>22</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Gap 58</td><td>62</td><td>55</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Goal</td><td>89</td><td>80</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Means 1</td><td>46</td><td>78</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Means 2</td><td>73</td><td>78</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Outcomes</td><td>42</td><td>44</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits</td><td>39</td><td>44</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Importance claim</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Competence claim</td><td>4</td><td>20</td><td>2</td></tr></table></body></html>

and (2) that of the field of research in which the proposal itself takes place:

Example 2: A number of studies in writing assessment reveal that the design of writing prompts may have an effect on students’ writing performance, especially in exam situations.

In $40 \%$ of the proposals that did not include a separate TERRITORY move, the territory was embedded within another move such as GAP or GOAL.

# 3.2. Reporting previous research (RPR)

In many of the proposals, the TERRITORY move was the initial move and it was often followed by the reporting previous research (RPR) move. This move refers to text that reports on or refers to earlier research in the field, either by the proposing researcher or by others. Such citations can be expressed either by parenthetical references

Example 3: Studies (e.g. Choie 1988, Connor 1987, Edelsky 1982, Friedlander 1990, Hinds 1985, etc.) claim that argumentative pattern is different cross-culturally and learners’ L1 has an impact on their writing in L2.

or by mentioning the reference in thematic position:

Example 4: Since Kaplan’s (1972) pioneering and widely-cited work, research has been conducted on the relationship between culture and discourse patterns, specifically in writing.

The RPR move appeared more frequently $( 2 6 \% )$ in Research proposals than in Pedagogic $( 2 2 \% )$ or Administrative proposals (only $1 5 \%$ ).

# 3.3. GAP

GAP indicates that there is a lack of knowledge or a problem in the territory, whether in the “real world” (ESL/EFL teaching or administration) or in the research field. This move serves to explain the motivation of the study. It appeared in more than $50 \%$ of proposals in each of the three types of proposals. In many proposals the GAP was introduced lexically, most often by “however” as in Example 5. Sometimes this move was signaled by the word “gap” as in Example 6, or by “although” (Example 7):

Example 5: Unfortunately, however experience has shown that this approach does not always result in success for either perception or pronunciation. The present study suggests that the reason is because perception and production are linked more indirectly than what is commonly thought.

Example 6: The gap between college ESL classes and “regular” academic courses can be a chasm for ESL students.

Example 7: Although there has been increased interest in and research on the effects of topic on ESL writing, little is known about the types of prompts used in writing assessments in US colleges and universities. Many schools place students into ESL and mainstream writing classes on the basis of a sole writing sample.

In addition to the initial signal in Example 7, the phrase “little is known” further reinforces the notion that something is missing.

# 3.4. GOAL

GOAL is the statement of aim, or general objective of the proposed activity. This move appeared in more proposals than any other move; it appeared in $78 \%$ of Research proposals, $80 \%$ of Pedagogic proposals, and $89 \%$ of Administrative proposals. The GOAL explains what it is the proposers want to get done and is often signaled by a reference to the “purpose” or “objective” of the study, as in Examples 8 and 9.

Example 8: The purpose of this paper is to share pedagogical materials and activities which can help ITAs master the stress and intonation of a variety of classroom question types, in order to enhance their linguistic effectiveness, their own selfconfidence, and their students’ learning.

Example 9: The objective of this paper is to present a model for EFL Teacher Development that focuses on the three essential components of the EFL teaching sphere: pedagogy, language and humanism.

The GOAL move is sometimes constructed as a list of questions, either in paragraph form, as in Example 10 or bulleted, as in Example 11.

Example 10: This study addresses the following questions: (1) What are the perceived challenges of the 21st century? (2) What are the anticipated roles of the EFL teacher? (3) What type of training should an EFL teacher have? and (4) What are the expected proficiencies of these teachers?

Example 11: Research questions to be addressed are:

† Do portfolios provide better information than impromptus? † Do the two methods identify the same students as being weak (or good) writers? † How well do each of the tests “fit” their stated purposes and outcomes?

# 3.5. MEANS 1

MEANS 1 indicates the methods, procedures, plans of action, and tasks that the proposal specifies as leading to the GOAL, as in Example 12.

Example 12: In this study, 1650 students were given questionnaires to measure their metacognitive and cognitive strategy use and were then administered the Cambridge First Certificate of English in which they were asked to demonstrate their ability in five different areas.

Although MEANS 1 appeared in $89 \%$ of the Research proposals and $78 \%$ of the Pedagogic proposals, it only appeared in $46 \%$ of the Administrative proposals.

# 3.6. MEANS 2

MEANS 2 includes the methods and procedures to carry out the actual presentation. It appeared in $78 \%$ of Pedagogic proposals, $73 \%$ of Administrative proposals, and $66 \%$ o f Research proposals and often appeared in final position. In this move some proposals explicitly outlined the topics to be discussed in the presentation, as in Example 13.

Example 13: In the first part of the paper, I will discuss the theoretical constructs underlying the models examined, commenting briefly on both measurement and structural models. I will then discuss the results of a validation study in which SEM was used to investigate the causal links between learner strategies and language ability.

In other proposals the MEANS 2 move referred to the stages of the presentation in very general language, indicating the possibility that the research was not done yet, and that the results were not yet known, as in Example 14.

Example 14: The presenters evaluate the results of the experience with an eye to dynamics, real professional growth, and everyday practicalities.

The MEANS 2 move often included either a reference to handouts or to audience participation, or to both, as in Example 15.

Example 15: Handouts will be available and participants will be invited to pose questions and make comments throughout the session.

# 3.7. OUTCOMES

OUTCOMES is a move that describes the anticipated results, findings, or achievements of the study or other proposed activity. It appeared in less than half of the Administrative and Pedagogic proposals, and $55 \%$ of the Research proposals. This move often began either with a description of the results (Example 16) or with their pedagogical implications (Example 17).

Example 16: The results suggest that students receiving feedback in two languages make more improvement in writing because focus on grammar and content is differentiated, comprehension is improved, and motivation to revise is increased.

Example 17: The pedagogical implications of this study suggest that teachers should broaden their views of reading instruction and, furthermore, should provide a rich learning environment for students to make personal and meaningful connections through the inquiry process.

# 3.8. BENEFITS

BENEFITS explains the intended or projected outcomes which could be considered useful to the “real world” outside the study itself, or even outside of the research field. The BENEFITS move in some proposals (Example 18), specifically indicated who would be interested in the findings.

Example 18: Although the conclusions will be of interest to the Malaysian government, the ELT world in general should benefit from the information gained from the Malaysian experience especially in the area of intensive English language programmes. It should also be of interest to other countries where a similar move in ESL training might be adopted for its students intending to study in English speaking countries.

In other proposals this move indicated either how students in general would benefit (as in Example 19), how teachers or administrators would benefit (Example 20), or how both students and teachers would benefit (Example 21).

Example 19: Through the use of such materials, students will gain authority for their own learning and begin to take a “questioning stance” about what they read and write.

Example 20: The results of the survey are helping the Pasadena City College ESL staff to develop a more equitable and consistent grading system.

Example 21: By understanding the various forms in which these three quantifiers appear across disciplines, English teachers can provide students with authentic examples from real-world uses, and teach the students to use these quantifiers more appropriately in specific disciplines.

The BENEFITS move appeared in fewer than half of the proposals in each of the three subgenres.

# 3.9. IMPORTANCE CLAIM

IMPORTANCE CLAIM presents the proposal, its objectives, anticipated outcomes, or the territory as particularly important or topical, much needed or urgent with respect to either the “real” or research worlds. Although this move rarely appeared in Administrative or Research proposals, $2 \%$ and $9 \%$ , respectively), it occurred in $30 \%$ of the Pedagogical proposals. One obvious lexical signal for this move is the inclusion of the word “importance,” as in Example 22:

Example 22: In the period of business booming in Central and Eastern Europe, these examinations are of special importance.

Some IMPORTANCE CLAIMs offer a list of “unique” features as in Example 23:

Example 23: This study was unique for it is

1. one of the few SILL studies on beginning EFL learners;   
2. an exploratory attempt to operationalize FL motivation constructs under a broader theoretical conception; and   
3. strategy-use/motivation correlation analysis was based not on information from a single item but whole scale measures.

# 3.10. COMPETENCE CLAIM

COMPETENCE CLAIM contains statements to the effect that the proposer is well qualified, experienced, and generally capable of carrying out the tasks set out. This move appeared very infrequently in Administrative and Research proposals $4 \%$ and $2 \%$ , respectively), but it appeared in $20 \%$ of the Pedagogical proposals. COMPETENCE CLAIMs either stressed the number of years of experience the presenter had (Example 24), or the type of experience (Example 25). Some COMPETENCE CLAIMs combined a reference to the number of years of experience with mention of overseas experience, as in Example 26.

Example 24: First, as a nonnative speaker of English and an ESL/EFL teacher of some thirty years’ experience.

Example 25: The presenter is a veteran ESL teacher, published author and national ESL workshop leader, specializing in using children’s literature with ESL students.

Example 26: I will present concrete examples which I gathered while teaching for two years in rural Japan and during my four years in Finland. They are the preliminary results of a doctoral dissertation titled “Intercultural teaching and learning: a comparative study of Finnish and Japanese foreign language education” for the department of Applied Linguistics at the University of Jyvaskyla, Finland.

# 3.11. Sequencing of moves

We close by including examples of complete proposals from each of the three subgenres to show the variety of possibilities. The proposal in Example 27 was submitted to the ESL in Higher Education SIG and is representative of the Pedagogical subgenre because it describes two teaching methodologies that were used in ESL courses with Hmong students.

Example 27: Hmong students: What talk-throughs and reading journals revealed

MEANS 1: Talk Throughs and Reading Journals were utilized in university reading and study strategies courses as forms of authentic assessment. OUTCOMES: In these classes, it was revealed that Hmong students processed information from text and lecture in unique ways. MEANS 1: This paper will (1) briefly demonstrate how talk-throughs and reading journals can be effective assessment tools, (2) share the results of these assessments for Hmong students, and (3) provide suggested study and reading strategies to assist the academic needs of these students. MEANS 2: Handouts will detail how to conduct assessments and provide a list of recommended learning strategies for college Hmong students. A bibliography will also be available. Time will be provided for questions and audience sharing of their own experiences with authentic assessment.

This proposal, like others in this subgenre did not have a TERRITORY move. Because of the word limitation on the TESOL proposal (a maximum length of one page), many writers started with GAP or GOAL, or in this case, MEANS 1, not supplying an explicit TERRITORY move. In such cases, the territory is disclosed by the title of the proposal, as well as by the initial move. Thus it is implied inside another move rather than having the explicit shape of a separate move. In so doing the writer has made a decision to “cut to the chase,” and spend more time on the “heart” of the proposal, which, in the case of Example 27 is a combination of MEANS 1 and MEANS 2.

Example 28 is a proposal submitted to the Teacher Education SIG and is an example of the Administrative subgenre since it offers advice for the development of teacher training workshops overseas.

Example 28: Planning and presenting EFL teacher training workshops

TERRITORY: Those working in the TESOL profession often have the opportunity to work verseas and may be asked to help with teacher training GAP: whether they have experience in this area of not. They are frequently seen as experts and are looked to for answers to problems presented in English teaching situations throughout the world. GOAL: This paper will describe how to prepare for teacher training workshops overseas. COMPETENCE CLAIM: Based on experiences in the South Pacific, MEANS 2: the presenter will discuss how to gather and select materials, identify the needs and wishes of the audience, and present workshops effectively. The content of specific workshops will be shared as well as the methods used to conduct them. Ideas for providing local teachers with the means to continue their training after the “expert” leaves will also be discussed. Participants will receive a bibliography of useful materials.

Example 28 begins with the TERRITORY–GAP–GOAL combination that was very prevalent in proposals of all three subgenres. The one move in this proposal that was not typical is the COMPETENCE CLAIM, which in this case stresses the author’s international experience. This move appeared most frequently in Pedagogical proposals, and almost never in Research proposals. The MEANS 2 move flows out of the COMPETENCE CLAIM and provides a description of the way in which the presentation will be structured.

Example 29 is a proposal submitted to the International Teaching Assistant SIG and is representative of the Research subgenre since it describes an empirical study.

Example 29: Intelligibility of Indian ITAs: Two institutionalized varieties in contact

TERRITORY: Research has found that both prosodic and discourse factors contribute to perceptions of the intelligibility of ITAs RPR: Anderson-Hsieh & Koehler,1988; Anderson-Hsieh, Johnson, & Koehler, 1992; Tyler, Jefferies & Davies, 1988; Tyler, 1992; Williams, 1992.   
TERRITORY: These studies have generally focused either on groups of ITAs from diverse backgrounds or specifically on ITAs who are native speakers of Chinese or Korean. GAP: However, problems of ITAs who are speakers of different institutionalized varieties of English require further examination. GOAL: The present study investigates the contributions of prosodic and discourse features to American listeners’ ratings of speakers of one institutionalized variety, Indian English. It further examines the nature of the changes that Indian ITAs make in accommodating their variety of English to the American social context.

MEANS 1: Ten speakers of Indian English gave five minute planned presentations in their areas of specialization. American listeners rated the comprehensibility of half of the subjects favorably and the other half less favorably. The five subjects who received lower ratings took the exam again six months later. Statistics on the respective contributions of language and discourse features were collected and the changers in the presentations of those who took the test twice were analyzed.

OUTCOMES: The results of the study showed that both prosodic factors and discourse features had an effect on comprehensibility ratings. Furthermore, Indian English speakers were more likely to successfully adapt the discoursal features of their presentations than to alter their prosody.

MEANS 2: Implications for training of Indian ITAs will be discussed.

In most of the examples above, we showed moves that had discrete boundaries. However, the moves did not always appear in such an easily identifiable form. Sometimes they were combined with other moves and involved one move embedded within another as in this proposal, which begins with a blended TERRITORY move that includes an RPR within it. This blended TERRITORY move is followed by a GAP move, signaled by the word, “however,” followed by a GOAL move which poses a solution to the problem indicated in the gap statement. Here again, as in the proposal in Example 28, the sequence TERRITORY–GAP–GOAL is used to introduce the proposal. This sequence of moves is followed by MEANS 1, the longest move of this proposal. It is in the MEANS 1 move, that the subjects, methods and procedures of the empirical study are described. This is followed by an OUTCOMES move that includes the results of the study. The GOAL–MEANS 1–OUTCOMES sequence of moves is typical of proposals in the Research subgenre, but was rarely used in the Administrative and Pedagogical proposals. This sequence is followed by a brief MEANS 2 move that concludes the proposal.

Examples 27 (the Pedagogical proposal), 28 (the Administrative proposal) and 29 (the Research proposal) above, illustrate some of the similarities and differences we found in these subgenres. The Administrative and Research proposals began with the TERRITORY–GAP– GOAL sequence but the Pedagogical proposal did not use any of these moves. The Research proposal included an RPR within the TERRITORY but the other two proposals did not include an RPR. The Research and Pedagogical proposals both included an OUTCOMES move, whereas the Administrative proposal did not. Although all three proposals included a MEANS 2 move in final position, it was used differently in the three subgenres. The MEANS 2 move served as the heart of the Pedagogical proposal, comprising $69 \%$ of the entire proposal. In the Administrative proposal the MEANS 2 move comprised $48 \%$ of the proposal, whereas this move occupied less than $4 \%$ of the Research proposal. In this proposal the largest move (almost $30 \%$ of the proposal) was the MEANS 1, in which the proposers explained what they had done in their empirical study. For the other two subgenres, without an empirical study to describe, this move had little relevance.

# 4. Discussion

The great variety of the data illustrates clearly the richness and diversity of the TESOL field in general. Because of this variety, we found that it was not possible to identify any move as being obligatory. For example, TERRITORY was found in more than half of all the proposals as a separate move, and in more than forty percent of the proposals as an embedded move within GAP, GOAL or MEANS. It was possible, however, to create a successful proposal without including an explicit TERRITORY move, as shown in Example 27 above. Such a finding makes it difficult, if not impossible to identify TERRITORY as an obligatory or even essential move. Since the GOAL move appeared in more than eighty percent of the proposals this move would be the most likely candidate for the designation as “obligatory move.” On the other hand, IMPORTANCE CLAIM—although versatile as far as its position in the proposal—was not frequent in any of the proposal types. Similarly, the COMPETENCE CLAIM move was rarely used by TESOL proposal writers.

Equally significant as the frequency of the moves was the pattern of their use in the proposals. For example, we found that across the proposal types, TERRITORY–GAP– GOAL often appeared in that order and was the most frequently-occurring sequence of moves (see Examples 27 and 29). OUTCOMES and BENEFITS often co-occurred. Other combinations of moves that appeared throughout the corpus included TERRITORY and RPR (see Example 29), and MEANS 1 and MEANS 2 (see Example 27). As we have shown in the examples above, successful proposals submitted to TESOL’96 included rhetorical moves in a variety of ways. These proposals did not all have the same moves and even when the same moves were used, they were not necessarily used in the same order. Whereas the initial move was often TERRITORY, and the final move in most proposals was MEANS 2, in between these moves it is clear that proposal writers had many options. The infinite number of permutations we found is a reflection of the inherent variation in proposals.

# 5. Conclusion

In this study we analyzed a corpus of presentation proposals submitted to the 1996 TESOL Conference. The purpose of our study was to identify features that contribute to a successful proposal using a genre-analytic system of “moves” adopted for this study from previous research on grant proposals. We found that in our sample of the TESOL proposals analyzed in the first phase of the study, length was a distinguishing feature between successful and rejected proposals, not the inclusion of all the moves in the system we had developed to describe a wellwritten proposal. In the second phase of the study, we found that there were differences in the use of the moves depending on the specific purpose of the proposal, which we classified into the three separate categories of research, administrative, and pedagogical.

Recent genre theory informs us that genres are not “simply iron-clad molds into which language or text is poured, so to speak, even at a single point in historical time” (Atkinson, 1999, p. 9). Certain genres are more formalized, such as the experimental research article or the research grant proposal, and do not allow as much creativity among writers, while other genres, like the personal letter, are less conventionalized. We believe that the conference proposal belongs in the latter category, based on the findings of the present research. Yet, we would argue that our study shows that there are certain identifiable boundaries and useful combinations of moves for an acceptable TESOL proposal.

As to future research, we recommend further studies of textual genre analysis like the one presented here combined with analyses that consider variation in TESOL proposals due to variables such as specific audience (i.e. interest section), and writer’s background (e.g. country of origin, first language, and experience in TESOL). Furthermore, in order to better define the genre of the TESOL conference proposal, it would be helpful to examine how it has changed over time, as Ra¨isa¨nen (1999) did with proposals submitted to conferences of automotive crashsafety engineering over a 30-year period. Ra¨isa¨nen’s (1999) findings are consistent with recent genre theory that argues that genres are dynamic and that genre expectations change over time and often depend on the specific context and situation. They develop and change over time, in relation to changes in sociocultural settings, as Atkinson (1999) has shown in the case of a scientific journal, The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Recent research on genre analysis also shows that genres do not exist in isolation but are part of a structured system of interacting genres each performing complementary social action. This view has been advanced by scholars such as Bazerman (1994, 1999), Atkinson (1999), and Smart (1993). As novice writers become more informed about these literate actions, they learn how texts interact and how they shape meanings in relation to complex social systems. For example, professional organizations such as TESOL provide guidelines for the submission of conference proposals, which are read and interpreted by people submitting proposals. More needs to be known about this process.
