Private tutoring in English (PT-E), a special and important subclass of private tutoring (PT), is a common phenomenon in ESL/EFL education in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, it has received little attention in TESOL, applied linguistics, or language education research. This article investigates the nature and practice of PT-E in a disadvantaged rural area of Bangladesh, a context where the circumstances of ESL/EFL education give it a particularly acute role. The study relates PT-E to scholastic achievement in English, investigates student attitudes and motivations in PT-E, and establishes a core profi le of PT-E in relation to the school system, parent and student expectations, attitudes and motivations, and outcomes. The study follows a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data analysis demonstrates some positive links between PT-E and English achievement, which is elaborated through a broader qualitative analysis, showing that the students had clear and structured views about PT-E, which they saw as imperative for successful learning achievement. A set of social, psychological, and institutional factors are identifi ed which contribute to the popularity of PT-E in a less affl uent society like rural Bangladesh. There are also implications for educational policy and planning, if English language education in the mainstream school system is to hold its own in the face of competition from PT-E in terms of quality and image.

s English continues to spread across the globe, governments in A“low profi ciency” English countries (Graddol, 2006, p. 110) are reappraising its importance and responding to the changing global order of English by updating their language and language-in-education policies (Tsui & Tollefson, 2007). It often happens that such responses result in English gaining more space in the national curriculum: English may be made a compulsory subject, where before it was only an elective; or it may be introduced in earlier grades, following the principle of “the earlier, the better” (Medgyes, 2005, p. 276). The limited space in the curriculum (Kaplan, 2000) is thus forced to make room for more English, and more resources are reallocated to promote its teaching and learning, at the potential expense of other components of the curriculum.

It is not yet known whether extending the space for English in the curriculum and increasing budgetary allocations for English teaching actually deliver the desired effects. Parents in many countries have preempted this question by investing in private tutoring in English (PT-E) for their children. Whether this private investment in children’s English learning pays off, and whatever the attitudes and perceptions of those who participate in PT-E, the scale of its popularity worldwide suggests that it is either successful or considered to be so (Greaney & Kellaghan, 1995, p. 12).

# PRIVATE TUTORING IN THE LITERATURE

PT-E is a special and important subclass of private tutoring (PT). PT, or after-hour supplementary schooling, is a macro-phenomenon of modern education. Recently, it has grown dramatically in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America (Baker, Akiba, LeTendre, & Wiseman, 2001; Bray, 2003, 2006; Ireson, 2004). This “shadow education” (Bray, 2003, p. 21) sits at the interface between education and commerce and has become a multibillion-dollar industry (Aurini, 2004; Davies, 2004; Mischo & Haag, 2002; Stevenson & Baker, 1992). Family investment in private tutoring in wealthier East Asian countries like Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan amounts to billions of dollars annually (Bray, 1999; Lee, 2005; Stevenson & Baker, 1992). Research suggests that in the Anglophone and European countries PT tends to be principally remedial and supplementary in nature (Mischo & Haag, 2002; Davies, 2004). In parts of East Asia, however, it has established a position as an essential part of education, culture, and society (Foondun, 2002; Kwok, 2004). This trend is evidenced by the strong presence of juku, or private after-hour classes, in Japan (Harnisch, 1994; Roesgaard, 2006; Rohlen, 1980). Private tutoring is also embedded in South Korean society, where it is known as hagwuan, or cram schools; $\mathrm { U S } \$ 12.4$ billion was spent on this form of education in 2003, equivalent to $5 6 \%$ of the country’s national education budget (Lee, 2005). Private tutoring is an integral part of education in Hong Kong, which also consumes substantial family resources (Bray & Kwok, 2003). Research shows that a complex set of factors—including the value of education in the Confucian tradition, the parental role in educating children, the system of high-stakes examinations for admission to higher education, the role of education in the job market, economic prosperity, and the high priority given to these factors in the overwhelming majority of middle class families—account for the popularity of PT in East Asia. Not all these factors hold equally in less affl uent societies; nevertheless, PT is popular and well-subscribed in these societies as well (Bray, 2006; Buchmann, 2002; Greaney & Kellaghan, 1995; Tansel & Bircan, 2006).

Despite some progress in research on PT, this phenomenon still “remains very fi rmly in the shadows” (Ireson, 2004, p. 110). Moreover, the existing research on PT mostly addresses issues related to its nature, scope, scale, and motivation. Only a few studies have been directed at its evaluation or effectiveness, and they have reported only inconclusive fi ndings (Bray, 2006). Furthermore, the small body of PT research has largely concentrated on relatively affl uent societies. We know much less about the nature, practice, impact on achievement, and socioeducational implications of PT in less affl uent societies. This article responds to this need in investigating the nature and practice of PT, and specifi cally PT-E, in a region, a country, and a context at the opposite end of the affl uent scale: a disadvantaged rural area in Bangladesh.

Research that exclusively focuses on PT-E, which is of substantial interest to TESOL, applied linguistics, and language education, is apparently restricted to only two studies. The fi rst, by Mischo and Haag (2002), evaluates the effectiveness of PT in Germany in a pre– and post–controlgroup design. The study involved 122 students in a PT group and the same number in a control group. Both groups’ school marks in English, French, Latin, and mathematics in the pretest and the posttest were recorded and compared. T-tests showed that the posttest scores of the PT group in all four subject areas were signifi cantly higher than the pretest scores $\mathit { \Omega } ^ { \prime } p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ), though whether this should be attributed to their participation in PT is not certain.

The other study on PT-E is Khuwaileh and Al-Shoumali (2001), which explores the reasons and conditions which contribute to the success of PT-E in Jordan. Fifty students from two Jordanian universities participated in a questionnaire survey. These students and a sample of 10 parents were subsequently interviewed. The study records positive attitudes on the part of parents and students toward PT-E. It also shows that the prevalence of PT-E was mainly due to such factors as the poor teaching of English at the school level, the students’ desire for good grades in their tertiary courses, the importance of English, family affordability, and family social class and prestige.

This paucity of research on PT-E does not match the scale of its popularity. English is one of the key subjects in juku, which is an integral part of the high-stakes tests in Japan (Locastro, 1990). In Hong Kong, “English typically has the greatest demand [in private tutoring] because it is important not only as a subject but also as a medium of instruction for other subjects” (Bray & Kwok, 2003, p. 614). English is also one of the most commonly taught PT subjects in Korea (Lee, Kim, & Yoon, 2004). In short, English constitutes an essential component of the national curriculum in many countries, and thus it has a major position in the PT market. Poor EFL results in these countries (Baldauf et al., 2008) provide an additional motivation for PT-E.

In the current study we focus on PT-E as a substantial area of English language teaching and learning. We describe the phenomenon of PT-E in Bangladesh; relate PT-E to scholastic achievement in English; investigate student attitudes and motivations in PT-E; and start to build an overall profi le of PT-E in relation to the school system, parent and student expectations, attitudes and motivations, and outcomes. These objectives are important for TESOL and language education researchers and practitioners worldwide, because they draw attention to the question of how TESOL pedagogy is implemented, accommodated, and supplemented by PT-E in less affl uent societies.

# BANGLADESH

Bangladesh is a medium-sized country in South Asia with a substantial population of 140 million. The annual per capita income is $\mathrm { U S } \$ 411$ ; the literacy rate of the population aged 7 and over is $4 5 . 3 \%$ (Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics [BANBEIS], 2004). Bangla (Bengali) is spoken by $9 8 \%$ of the population in Bangladesh. English was introduced during British rule and still enjoys a position of dominance and prestige (Banu & Sussex, 2001; Kachru, 2005). English is taught as a compulsory subject from the 1st to the $1 2 \mathrm { t h }$ grade and also at the tertiary level.

# PRIVATE TUTORING IN BANGLADESH

PT is a common phenomenon in Bangladeshi education. It is widely spread in urban as well as rural areas, and shows some complex characteristics which are to some extent different from its implementation in East Asia, Europe, or North America.

Private tutoring in Bangladesh is delivered by mainstream teachers, teachers from other institutions, or even nonteachers. Lessons occur oneto-one, in small groups (5–10 students), or in large groups (20 students or more). The venue of the teaching can be the tutor’s place of residence (one-to-one or small groups), the tutee’s place of residence (usually oneto-one), or special teaching centres (large groups) known as coaching centres. These coaching centres are comparable to Japanese juku, or private after-school classes. Finally, in our study the focus of PT is on schoolbased examinations or school-leaving national examinations rather than college or university entrance examinations, although PT is equally prominent for these latter goals in higher education in Bangladesh.

PT is widely implemented at all stages of pretertiary education in Bangladesh. Education Watch 2006 (Campaign for Popular Education [CAMPE], 2007) reported that PT participation rate at the primary level averaged $3 7 \%$ . However, at $8 6 . 5 \%$ it was predictably much higher at the secondary level. The PT participation rate at the secondary level in our study is somewhat lower $( 7 5 \% )$ , consistent with the location of the study in a rural disadvantaged area. One crucial factor for the popularity of PT in Bangladesh is inadequate public investment in education. Education Watch 2006 shows that the public investment per student per month is $\mathrm { U S } \$ 2.05$ at the primary level and $\mathrm { U S } \$ 4.50$ at the secondary level. This investment accounts for $4 1 \%$ and $2 9 \%$ of the total education expenditure at the two levels, respectively. The low investment accounts for poor infrastructure and logistics, which in turn, contribute to the poor quality of teaching and learning (Hamid & Baldauf, 2008).

Poor teacher salaries are another reason why school teachers offer private after-hour lessons to their own students for extra income. Although ethical issues are involved here (Nuland, Khandelwal, Biswal, Dewan, & Bajracharya, 2006), PT is a common practice all over Bangladesh. Mainly teachers of English, mathematics, and sciences have the opportunity to earn this extra income through PT. There are tensions between these teachers and those whose subjects are not in demand for PT (e.g., Bangla and the social sciences).

The cost of PT is hard to calculate, because it depends on the frequency of lessons taken, the duration of the lessons, the subjects taught, teacher quality and reputation, the mode of lessons (one-to-one/groups), and the geographic location (urban/rural) of teachers and students. Education Watch 2006 (CAMPE, 2007) shows that the annual average cost for PT per student was $\mathrm { U S } \$ 49$ at the secondary level. Importantly, the PT cost constitutes a signifi cant proportion ( $4 2 \%$ for government schools; $2 9 \%$ for nongovernment schools) of the total education cost borne by families, which is substantially higher than the cost of any other items ( Table 1 ). On average, the proportion $( 3 5 . 5 \% )$ ) is higher than the total contribution of public expenditure per student at the secondary level, which is $2 9 \%$ .

The wide popularity of PT in Bangladesh prompts questions about its quality and societal perceptions. Although there have been no objective studies exploring these issues, such perceptions appear to be complex and mixed. Negative evaluations of PT prevail in the literature, but it is widely believed that PT participation infl uences student performance in school and school-leaving examinations. For example, Deabnath (2007) analyzes the results of the Secondary School Certifi cate (SSC) 1 examination in 2007, and observes:

This year’s Secondary School Certifi cate (SSC) exam results warn of the country’s secondary school education system becoming dependent on private tuition as they show students of the urban areas who can afford private tutors fared well while students in the rural areas suffered dearly. (n. p.)

However, PT, particularly in its institutional form (i.e., coaching centres), is questioned on the grounds of poor quality of teaching and its business orientation (Chakroborty, 2002). One-to-one or small-group PT, on the other hand, has the potential to offer quality remedial lessons because the teaching conditions in this case differ clearly from those of formal schooling. In formal Bangladeshi schools, class sizes are commonly larger than 50, which compromises individualized instruction and even interactions with and feedback from the teacher. Resources are poor in terms of books, study aids, and other support, whereas the conditions of individual or even group PT are qualitatively and quantitatively distinctly more favourable.

# The Current Study

The current study is based on PT-E data from Hamid (2009), a widerranging investigation of English language teaching and learning in a rural context in Bangladesh, specifi cally the relationships between secondary school students’ family economic, cultural, social capital, and their scholastic achievement in English. The main study was conducted in a disadvantaged area—a medium-sized subdistrict in Bangladesh. Located about 500 kilometres from the capital city of Dhaka, Nadiranga (a pseudonym adopted for ethical reasons and anonymity) is a rural agriculture-based subdistrict with a small town at its centre. The total land area of the subdistrict is 224.97 square kilometers, and its population is 114,350 (56,506 males, 57,844 females; BBS, 2005). It is one of the poorest subdistricts in Bangladesh (Rahman, Asaduzzaman, & Rahman, 2005). The literacy rate of the population aged 7 and over is $3 3 . 4 7 \%$ (cf. the national rate of $4 5 . 3 \%$ ). There are 12 secondary schools in the subdistrict, from which around 700 tenth graders participate in the Secondary School Certifi cate examination every year. English constitutes 2 of the 11 papers which all examinees must sit in this national examination. Although English is emphasized in the curriculum, its teaching and learning in rural areas like Nadiranga are supported by only very limited resources. English is not required in everyday communication. Students do not have access to self-study resources such as print or electronic materials other than the set textbooks. Computers and the Internet, which could potentially introduce learners to virtual communities, are yet to be available in schools or homes in Nadiranga.

# THE MAIN STUDY: PARTICIPANTS AND INSTRUMENTS

The sample for the quantitative phase of the parent study consisted of 228 tenth-grade students (15–16 year olds) who were selected from eight schools in Nadiranga. Fourteen of these 228 students were later selected for one-to-one interviews in its qualitative phase. There were three instruments used for collecting numerical data: (1) a student survey questionnaire, (2) an English profi ciency test which had been designed by an English Teaching Task Force (BEERI, 1976) commissioned by the Ministry of Education of the Bangladesh Government, and (3) school records of students’ grades in English in the school test 2 as well as the SSC examination in 2007.

# Survey Questionnaire

The questionnaire (see Hamid, 2009) collected data on students’ family economic, cultural and social capital, and attitudinal and motivational characteristics and dispositions (habitus). It was administered, together with the English test, to students in the schools in October– November 2006. Appointments were made with the head teachers of the schools. On the appointed days the fi rst author met the 10th-grade students in their class, briefed them about the study, and requested their participation. They were then given the profi ciency test, followed by the questionnaire.

# English Profi ciency Test

This 60-point test is a national test designed in Bangladesh, and has been widely tested there in different schools for reliability and validity (Zaman, 1999). Divided into three parts, the test content focuses on grammar items in scripted dialogues (30 points), vocabulary items (20 points), and reading comprehension questions (10 points).

# Student Interview

After the profi ciency test and the questionnaire survey, 14 students were interviewed at their homes in December 2006. The interviewees were selected on the basis of their performance in the English profi ciency test and in the English papers of the school test. Our aim was to interview both the best performing and the lowest performing students in both tests in order to determine whether the two types of students differed in terms of their habitus (i.e., a set of attitudes, motivations, values, career goals and expectations, and academic self-concepts) and family background factors (e.g., parental education, occupation, income, and parental involvement in their education). The interviews were semistructured, and most of the questions focused on aspects of family social and cultural capital and the students’ attitudes, motivations, English-learning experiences, future education plans, and career goals, and their perceptions of the infl uence of their family situations on their academic performance (for interview questions, see Hamid, 2009), with participation in PT-E a prominent topic. The interviews were conducted by the fi rst author, and took place in the homes of the students, lasting between 40 and $6 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } .$ utes. All interviews were audio-tape recorded with the students’ and their parents’ permission. The interviewer also took notes in case there were technical problems in retrieving the recorded interviews. All interviews were conducted in Bangla, the L1 of the interviewer and the interviewees.

# PT-E DATA FOR THE CURRENT STUDY

In the main study (Hamid, 2009), private tutoring was shown to be one source of cultural capital (Buchmann, 2002) that families exploit to enhance their children’s achievements in English. Over $7 5 \%$ of the $1 0 \mathrm { t h }$ graders who participated in the study took private lessons in English outside mainstream schooling. This high rate of participation in PT-E, particularly in a disadvantaged area, obliges us to investigate the relationship of PT-E to academic achievement in English and to ask why so many students are attracted to it. In addition, PT-E emerged as a dominant issue in interviews with students selected from the survey sample. The students had clear and patterned views about PT-E, issues which are, so far, unresearched in the literature. We therefore isolated all PT-E data–both quantitative and qualitative—from the main study in order to carry out a separate, in-depth analysis in this article. This analysis has a dual focus: on the possible links between private tutoring and academic achievement, and student perceptions of PT-E, which is designed to reveal whether PT-E does indeed deliver clear benefi ts, and to probe what other factors might explain the large-scale participation in PT-E.

# Methodology and Data Analysis

The dual focus of the paper involves a mixed-methods approach (Bryman, 2006; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Greene, 2008; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2003). This methodology calls for the collection, analysis, and mixture of both quantitative and qualitative data at different stages of the research process. This research design is based on the “premise that the use of quantitative and qualitative approaches in combination provides a better understanding of research problems than either approach alone” (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007, p. 5). The growing fi eld of mixed methodology suggests various rationales, objectives, and strategies for mixing quantitative and qualitative data in a single study (Greene, 2008; Greene,

Caracelli, & Graham, 1989; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007). The literature also includes a number of typologies for mixed-methods research design (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006).

Our approach to integrating quantitative and qualitative data in the present paper benefi ted from the set of mixed methods designs presented in Creswell and Plano Clark (2007). They discuss four types of mixed-methods designs—triangulation, embedded, explanatory, and exploratory. The design types include three dimensions: (a) time of mixing the qualitative and quantitative phases (concurrent or sequential), (b) weighting (equal or unequal weight of the phases), and (c) type of mixing (merging, embedding, and connecting). Our methodological integration was mainly based on their fourth design type (exploratory), with explanation and complementation as two objectives or principles for the mixing. Our design was guided by the belief that different aspects of a single phenomenon require different methods of inquiry, and the fi ndings complement each other to yield a broader and deeper understanding of the phenomena under investigation (Greene, 2008). Our data analysis and results are presented in two distinct phases—a quantitative phase, followed by a qualitative phase, and are “integrated during the interpretation of the fi ndings” (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004, p. 20). Thus, among the three models of mixing suggested by Creswell and Plano Clark (2007)—merging, connecting, and embedding—we follow the second method: we connect the two data sets, and the connection is sequential, because the two phases are chronologically ordered in the research process. In terms of the relative weight of the two phases, we depart from much customary practice in that our notation is quan QUAL: We place more weight on the second, qualitative phase. In our view, the qualitative phase, which investigates students’ attitudes, motivations, and perceptions of PT-E, yields more and richer information than the quantitative phase, which associates students’ participation in PT-E with English achievement data. The two phases of our study are “broadly complementary, providing different kinds of insights into the different aspects” (Brannen, 2005, p. 180) of the social phenomenon of PT-E.

# QUANTITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

The students’ participation in PT-E was assessed using a dichotomous yes or no response in the questionnaire. The participation rate for girls $( 8 0 \% )$ was higher than that for boys $( 7 1 \% )$ , although the difference was not statistically signifi cant on a $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test.

Table 2 presents percentage distributions of the students’ ( $n = 2 2 8$ ) parental occupation, education, and family income levels. The monthly income of almost half of the families $( 4 7 \% )$ was below Taka 2000, and only $2 3 \%$ of the families earned Taka 5,000 or more per month. The income levels of the families point to the poor socioeconomic conditions of the subdistrict. Nonetheless, over three-quarters of the students participated in PT-E.

As previously noted, the study includes two measures of English achievement: students’ scores in the 60-point English test, and their scores in English in the SSC examination, 2007. The latter data were collected from the schools. The SSC English scores were available only in the form of letter grades, which were converted into number grades following the grading system used in the SSC examination. This grading system was also used to convert the English test scores, which were raw scores, into number grades. As can be seen from Figure 1 , student representation in the upper grades (3 or above) was very modest in both sets of grades. Therefore, students obtaining these grades were regrouped into one grade (grade 3) for comparison purposes. The $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test assessing the relationship between the categories of profi ciency test grades and SSC grades shows a signifi cant statistical association between the two measures of English achievement $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 1 0 1 . 6 1$ , $\operatorname { d f } = 9$ , $\mathit { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ).

Figure 1 shows that the majority of the students either failed or obtained only lower grades ( $[ 1 = \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḋ \mathbf Ḍ Ḍ Ḍ ] Ḍ $ , $2 = \mathbf { C }$ ) in English. Although three students were able to obtain the highest grade $( 5 = \mathrm { A } +$ ) in the English test, none did so in the SSC examination. Furthermore, $3 7 \%$ of the students in the present sample failed in the SSC examination in 2007, which is higher than the national rate of failure for that year $( 3 0 \% )$ . Thus, these

data confi rm the lower educational standards and English achievement of students in rural schools (see Hamid & Baldauf, 2008).

Multivariate logistic regression, specifi cally ordered logistic regression, 3 was used to investigate factors that were independently associated with the SSC English grades and the English test grades. The results are presented in the form of odds ratios (OR) and their confi dence intervals (CI). OR values greater than 1 indicate a probability of higher grades in English; OR values less than 1 indicate a probability of lower grades in English. The specifi c predictor variables are PT-E, gender, and mother’s education.

We included gender as a potential predictor in order to investigate whether gender had any infl uence in the relationship between the students’ participation in PT-E and their academic achievement in English. We were interested in this variable because other studies have shown that in Bangladesh the female enrolment rate in secondary education is higher than that of males, although females were still behind

males in terms of achievement, particularly in rural areas (CAMPE, 2007;   
Raynor, 2005).

As displayed in Table 3 , multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that

students who took private lessons had double the chance of attaining higher grades than their counterparts who did not take private lessons ( $\mathbf { \mathrm { O R } } = 2 . 1 3$ ; $9 5 \%$ $\mathrm { C I } = 1 . 1 2 { - } 4 . { \overset { \cdot } { 0 } } 4 .$ );   
students whose mothers had secondary education or above were 3.8 times more likely to secure higher grades in English than those whose mothers did not have any formal education $9 \hat { 5 } \%$ $\mathrm { C I } = 1 . 7 9 \substack { - 8 . 2 6 }$ ); male students had a tendency to achieve higher grades in English in the SSC examination than their female counterparts $( \mathrm { O R } = 1 . 6 $ , $\hbar =$ 0.087), although this result was not statistically signifi cant;   
neither gender nor mother’s education was found to be signifi cantly associated with grades in English in the SSC examination;   
for student achievement in the English test, the other measure of the dependent variable, only PT-E (among gender, mother’s education, and private tutoring) was found to be signifi cantly associated. Students who had access to PT-E were 2.8 times more likely to secure higher grades in the English test than those who did not have such access $( 9 5 \% \ \mathrm { C I } = 1 . 7 2 – 5 . 0 3 )$ .

The regression analysis thus shows a positive association between PT-E participation and English achievement, after adjustments for mother’s education and gender. However, each model represented approximately

$1 0 \%$ of the total variability, which limits the validity of the fi ndings. We therefore analyzed the qualitative data, in order to explore possible linkages between factors operating in PT-E in a more fi ne-grained manner from the students’ subjective perspective.

# QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

The interpretive phase of the study aimed to construct, describe, and analyze the interviewees’ perceptions of PT-E. We drew on Potter’s (1996) template for qualitative data analysis, supplemented by the data management and analysis methods outlined in Huberman and Miles (1998), Miles and Huberman (1994), and interpretive or qualitative content analysis (Ahuvia, 2001; Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). In particular, we followed Hsieh and Shannon’s (2005) “conventional approach” (p. 1279) to qualitative content analysis. Instead of applying predetermined categories, this approach generates categories from the data and is thus described as inductive category development.

We fi rst present a summary of the interviewees’ participation in PT-E and the different measures of their English achievement in Table 4 . The table serves as a quick reference to individual interviewees, their family capital profi les, 4 the extent to which they took private lessons in English, and the different measures of their performance in English. The information about PT-E presented in a descriptive form both verifi es and extends the yes/no responses in the quantitative phase of the study. Eleven out of 14 interviewees participated in PT-E to varying degrees. This participation rate $( 7 8 \% )$ ) is close to that $( 7 5 \% )$ ) for the survey sample.

Table 4 shows that male and female students were from a range of family capital backgrounds, from high to low; both groups of students participated in PT-E to varying degrees, and were high as well as low achievers. In other words, none of these categories showed gendered patterns. Thus, although we had anticipated that gender might infl uence the students’ participation in PT-E and consequently their academic achievement, this was not actually the case. The student interview data also showed that gender was not an issue to this sample of $1 0 \mathrm { t h }$ graders.

The process of our data analysis was divided into three subprocesses, as described by Huberman and Miles (1998): data reduction, data display, and drawing conclusions. First, all 14 interviews were transcribed verbatim, following the transcription conventions suggested by Richards (2003). Student responses to questions about PT-E were then located and highlighted in the interview transcripts. The next steps were reading the data, making senses, summarizing, and entering them in English on a word processor. We broadly followed the tactics suggested by Huberman and Miles (1998) for generating meaning such as noting patterns and themes, clustering themes, counting, making contrasts and comparisons, subsuming particular categories into general categories, and factoring. These techniques generated a small number of key themes/strands in the interviewees’ perceptions of PT-E.

# Private Tutoring and Affordability

The analysis and interpretation of the interview data showed that participating in PT-E was common for students in the community. However, the quantity and quality of this participation were mediated by family affordability. Table 4 shows that the students from the high and above average levels of family capital took more private lessons in English than the students from the below average and low levels of family capital. The three students who did not take such lessons cited fi nancial reasons; as Sophia noted, “Most students take private lessons. Only a few don’t because they don’t have money.” Konka also emphasized fi nancial problems due to which she could not continue private lessons after 1 month:

R: Ok. Have you taken any private lessons in English this year?   
K: Yes, Sir.   
R: You did?   
K: Yes [nods]   
R: Ok. For how long?   
K: One month.   
R: One month! Why did you stop after one month?   
K: I had financial problems so I had to stop.   
R: I see. Do you think you were benefitted by one month’s lessons?   
K: Yes, Sir.   
R: So you see you took private lessons for a month and you are also taught English at school. Which one is better in your opinion?   
K: Sir, the private lessons are better.   
R: Alright. Did you take those lessons from your school teacher, or a different teacher?   
K: A different teacher.   
R: Ok, why are the private lessons better?   
K: Sir, we are only five or four girls at the private lessons. [The private tutor] explains lessons more and clearly. But at school we are a large number of boys and girls.

In addition, she mentioned the quality and effectiveness of PT-E in relation to school English teaching, which we discuss later as a separate theme. Moumi and Tuhin both took more lessons in English than the other students. They belonged to relatively affl uent families, unlike the other students. Poorer families also did their best to arrange private lessons for their children. For instance, Sophia’s mother was present during the interview with Sophia. The mother intruded in the interview on several occasions, and on one such occasion she said:

If I had some poultry, I could sell eggs and give her the money. She could then pay an English teacher and get some private lessons.

Even if the mother could manage some money by selling eggs, Sophia’s PT-E lessons would not be able to match Moumi and Tuhin’s in quantity.

# Imperative of Private Tutoring

The students’ responses show that they regarded PT-E as imperative. Tuhin stressed the need for PT-E: “Defi nitely, one can’t do well just depending on schools, without private lessons or coaching.” Likewise, Samira and Silan pointed out that if a student went only to school, he or she could never do well in the examination. Tuhin pointed this out unambiguously:

R: Are you satisfied with the lessons given by him [private tutor]?   
T: Yes, satisfied.   
R: Do you go to any coaching centre as well?   
T: Yes.   
R: Now […] do you think you could or would do well in your studies without the private lessons in English from your tutor and the coaching centre?   
T: You mean without private lessons or coaching, just depending on school [English]? Certainly not.

The imperative for PT-E was described by the students in several ways. The students who did well in the English profi ciency test as well as the school test ( e.g., Moumi, Tuhin, and Samira) said that they could not have done well if they had not taken private lessons in English. This evaluation was also refl ected by the other students who did not do as well in these tests. When asked to explain their relatively less satisfactory performance, they explicitly attributed it to their inability to take private lessons. Afrin, Mitun, Neeman, and Shathi observed that compared with other students they did not do well because they could not take private lessons or attend coaching classes. Rajib, who never participated in PT-E but did relatively well in English, also claimed that PT-E was essential for students:

R: Is there anything that you consider very important for your studies but you haven’t got from your family? Is there any such thing? Your family has not given you but it is essential for your studies?

Rajib: For instance, private lessons, which is .   
R: [right]   
Rajib: Essential, but my family has been unable to arrange for me.

However, Rajib’s case does not challenge the value of PT-E. Rajib was a high-achieving student who had higher expectations in the SSC examination. He made it clear during the interview that he was confi dent of obtaining higher grades in all subjects except English. He pointed out that he could manage other subjects on his own, even if they were not taught adequately, in his view, at school. But he could not manage English on his own and so he needed PT-E. His performance in the SSC examination refl ects an accurate self-assessment of his self-concept and academic expectations. Although his GPA 5 of 5.00 in the SSC examination was the same as Moumi’s, his grade in English was B (see Table 4 ). He was thus far behind Moumi, Tuhin, and Silan, who took PT-E and obtained A or A− in English.

The interviewees reinforced the imperative for PT-E when they were placed in hypothetical situations during the interview. When asked what she thought could happen to her studies if their family situations were not as favourable as they were now, Moumi explained:

Probably I couldn’t [do well] because I wouldn’t learn much at school. And if I were born in a farmer’s family, my parents could not arrange private tutoring or coaching for me which I have access to now. (emphasis added)

The hypothetical situation for the interviewees from low-income families was reversed: If money were not a concern, what measures would you take to improve your studies in English? Interestingly, the measure that was common to the majority of the students’ responses was PT-E:

For example, [I could] take private lessons and I could go to coaching centres. Then, I could buy the things that I need for my studies. I could thus sustain my interest in my studies because I didn’t have to worry about money. (Shathi)

# Schools and Schooling in English

The poor quality of English teaching at schools, as repeatedly emphasized by the students, was behind the imperative need for PT-E, as represented by the interviewees:

Private tutoring is needed because of the failure of school in English teaching. If English was taught properly at school, there would not be any need to take private lessons. (Monir)

Critiquing school English teaching was a recurrent theme in the data, where the students consistently expressed dissatisfaction and complaints. Their critiques also pointed out the causes of poor English teaching. These causes were both administrative and pedagogical. A common complaint was that classes were not held regularly. However, it was not clear whether lessons were unavailable due to teacher absenteeism or student absenteeism. More serious causes of school failure in English teaching, as the students explained, were teacher incompetence and lack of experience, sincerity, and commitment.

The interviewees reacted to the poor quality of school English in various ways. To some extent, their responses were infl uenced by their family socioeconomic conditions. Moumi, Samira, and Tuhin were more critical of school teaching than the other interviewees, and it is likely that their more favourable family situations lent force and confi dence to their critique. To them school was “a waste of time,” because in their view, they could use their time more effi ciently if they stayed at home and took private lessons from tutors. Their ability to take private lessons all year round freed them from the need to attend lessons at school; they admitted that they attended school infrequently. However, it was not clear how they could stay away from school for an extended period because students of their age are obliged to attend school regularly.

The other students, whose families were disadvantaged or less affl uent, were also critical of school English, but less so than Moumi, Samira, and Tuhin. Self-withdrawal from school, for them, was out of the question. Schools did not fulfi ll their academic needs in English, but they could not stop attending school, which they saw as an unhappy necessity:

Now, what else we can do. So, whatever is taught at school, we have to [be happy with that]. If we had the fi nancial capability, we could take lessons from other teachers. (Rajib)

It is signifi cant that the students identifi ed poor quality of teaching as a suffi cient reason for not attending school. In their view, the role of the school is to teach the curriculum and prepare them for the school-leaving examinations. This is a very functionalist, pragmatic approach. Their perceptions suggest little role for the school in socialization in a sense common in contemporary educational thinking—in introducing students to the values and practices of the literate world.

# Expectations of Private Tutoring in English

The students, then, expected that PT-E would help them to learn the language as well as to obtain higher grades in English in the SSC examination. They stressed that English was required for their future edu cation and careers, and showed strong motivation for learning the language. However, it was mainly the expectation of good grades—the highest for the more capable and ambitious students and average for the struggling ones—that drove them to PT-E. This explanation is confi rmed by several factors. First, it is a commonplace in Bangladeshi society that students are as good as their grades; it is also their grades which are valued above all in higher education and the job market. Second, PT-E, which is examination-oriented, tends to teach within the curriculum of the school-leaving tests. This social expectation of good grades provided the students with a framework where they viewed the schools as syllabus-teaching, examination-preparing institutions. This framework also helps to explain the students’ comparative evaluation of mainstream schooling in English and PT-E, which we illustrate in the next section.

# Effectiveness of Private Tutoring

Did PT-E-participation fulfi ll students’ expectations of good grades in English? As previously noted, the interviewees gave high priority to PT-E, which they found interesting and helpful for learning English as well as for examinations. PT-E lessons were both individualized and examinationfocused, which assessed their progress toward examination preparation every week. However, their strong support for PT-E, and its effectiveness as understood from their perceptions, were not fully corroborated in their test performance. Although there were positive links between PT-E participation and measures of English achievement, these links were not very strong (see Table 3 ). Moreover, despite their participation in PT-E to varying degrees, there were consistent gaps between the grades that they had expected and the grades that they actually obtained in the high-stakes examination ( Table 4 ). For instance, although six students had expected $\mathrm { A } +$ , none of them obtained this grade in the SSC examination. There can be several explanations for this gap. First, it points to the fact that although higher grades are highly valued in society and are thus socially desirable, rural schools (and PT-E in rural areas) simply do not have the required standards or resources to prepare students adequately for their expected grades in the national school-leaving examinations. Second, the business orientation of PT-E, particularly in its institutional form, might have led students to expect higher grades than their real potential suggested.

# Private Tutoring Versus Mainstream Schooling

It is this perceived or experiential evaluation of PT-E on the one hand, and their narrow view of schooling on the other, that provides key insights into the interviewees’ comparative evaluation of mainstream schooling and PT-E. This comparison is a recurrent theme in the data. Like Konka, Silan also illustrates this theme:

R: So how do you like the lessons there [at the coaching centre you go to]?   
S: I really like them there. Better than at school.   
R: Ok, but why do you like it more than school teaching?   
S: I like it there because the Director [of the coaching centre] has appointed reasonably good teachers. They are good teachers. Teaching is done by highly educated teachers.   
R: Highly educated means—   
S: They are actually college teachers.   
R: That means, you are saying that college teachers are more efficient than your school teachers?   
S: Yes, I think so.

The students noted that PT-E was more effective than school English, and given their perceived low evaluation of the latter, in an either/or choice they would prefer PT-E to mainstream schooling. This preference was turned into action, as exemplifi ed by Moumi, Samira, and Tuhin, who relied more on private tutoring than on school-delivered instruction. Their example, however desirable in terms of examination results, could not be followed by other students because they could not afford PT-E throughout the year, and thus they had to keep attending school, willingly or unwillingly.

# DISCUSSION

The quantitative analysis shows that there was a positive association between the students’ participation in PT-E and their academic achievement in English, as measured by their scores on the profi ciency test and their grades in the SSC examination. However, each regression model explained a smaller proportion of variability, which limits the validity of the fi ndings concerning the links between PT-E and academic achievement. The qualitative phase of the study, on the other hand, shows unambiguous and consistent patterns in students’ perceptions of PT-E. What is particularly important to note from our interview data is that PT-E has become a common—even a default—socioeducational phenomenon, which was desired by secondary students irrespective of gender, family socioeconomic conditions, and parental characteristics. Our data thus corroborate the positive attitudes of students toward PT-E in Khuwaileh and Al-Shoumali (2001) in Jordan. In both studies, grades are strong motivators for student participation in PT-E.

The participants in the current study saw PT-E as not only imperative, family circumstances allowing, but also preferable to school English teaching. This was particularly the case with students from more affl uent families who could afford PT-E all year round. Thus PT-E in the present context can be argued to overshadow the formal system in quality and in terms of the returns for investment of resources and energy, at least in the perceptions of these students. Interestingly, not a single interviewee was critical of PT-E. Even those students who did not participate in PT-E were positive about its effectiveness.

Integrating the fi ndings from the two phases of the study suggests some useful insights. First, it is the students’ perception of the effectiveness of PT-E—which may or may not be related to its actual effectiveness—that most of all motivates them to undertake PT-E. By default, they place their faith in PT-E because they consider that school English teaching is inadequate. Our data also suggest that there is a social chain effect which reinforces the popularity of PT-E. The interviewees frequently referred to other students in their cohort who had been taking PT-E; other students’ participation in PT-E exerted social/peer pressure on them to believe that PT-E was necessary for enhanced learning and achievement; if it were not, then their classmates would not participate in it. Finally, it is the social expectation of good grades, as previously argued, which coloured their perceptions of PT-E and schooling. Based on these perceptions, we can conclude that the students gave an enhanced assessment of the value or effectiveness of PT-E on the one hand, and gave a lower assessment of the role of school in learning English and passing examinations on the other.

The popularity of PT-E in the present context, then, can be attributed to these socioeducational and psychological issues, in which the actual effectiveness of PT-E remains relatively less prominent. Even though our interviewees emphasized that PT-E was superior to mainstream schooling in English, their evaluation was subjective, attitudinal, or experiential, or derived from second-hand reports. In some cases, this refl ected the real effect of PT-E on learning or achievement; in others it clearly did not.

Khuwaileh and Al-Shoumali (2001) found that among other reasons, the Jordanian university students took private lessons in English to display their social class and prestige. Our students’ perceptions of private tutoring did not suggest such social prestige issues. One explanation is that most students belonged to low-income families in a disadvantaged locality. A more plausible explanation, however, is that PT-E is viewed as a need rather than a luxury in the Bangladeshi context: as a necessary condition for academic success. Students from affl uent families participated more in PT-E than other students. However, their higher rate of participation was motivated by expectations of higher returns which suited their class interests, and contributed to parental satisfaction that they were doing their best for their children’s education (see Lynch & Moran, 2006). That PT-E is a necessity and not luxury is also attested by the fact that our participants did not raise questions relating to English teachers’ professional ethics in relation to the teachers’ participation in delivering PT-E lessons. The students accepted the reality that PT-E was indispensable for students as well as for teachers: for students because schools could not guarantee good grades in English, and for teachers because they needed the extra income.

# Implications and Further Research

As an investigation into the relatively underresearched area of PT-E, the current study measured student participation in PT-E in terms of binary yes/ no responses in the quantitative phase. Our results will make it possible for subsequent research to conduct quantitative research with more focused and discriminating categories of analysis, for instance to investigate the dimensions of type, quantity, intensity, and quality in PT-E. Our strategy to access more detailed information about PT-E emerged in the qualitative and interpretative phase, which yielded clear patterns in the students’ perceptions of PT-E. Overall, the insights generated by the two phases of the study imply that the policy and practice of mainstream English teaching and research on PT-E in Bangladesh are in need of substantial review. PT-E is widespread; it is highly regarded by the students. It is desired by educational consumers, and is seen as a default, family circumstances permitting, for secondary students. The mainstream school system, on the other hand, is regarded as second best. PT-E, by the mere fact of its existence, prestige, and success, is therefore exerting pressure on the school system, which will need to fi nd a way of responding to its out-of-hours partner, and of establishing a viable role and profi le in the context of overall English language education.

If the national policy is committed to equality of opportunity, then the balance between the school system and PT-E will need to be redressed. That would require a substantial increase in investment in public education (Hamid & Baldauf, 2008), in order to provide an incentive for parents to place their resources for enhanced learning in the public, rather than the private, sphere, the better to enhance teaching, learning, facilities, and infrastructure. The mainstream system would need to develop mechanisms for remedial teaching. English teaching skills, as well as the status and morale of teachers in the school system, need to be reinforced if it is to reassert its position vis-à-vis the PT-E system.

It is highly unlikely that the popularity of PT-E will decline dramatically in the near future. The middle class will continue to invest in their children’s education to help them secure a competitive advantage in education and in the job market. Education experts and social policy makers need to think seriously about ways of supporting students from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, so that they are less disadvantaged in the competition with their peers from more affl uent families.

At the same time, there is a need to inform and educate students and parents about the realistic expectations of PT-E. Insights from the current study highlight this gap between expectation and reality. As Table 4 suggests, despite their participation in PT-E, none of the students were able to obtain the grades in English in the SSC examination that their school examination would have led them to expect. Neither the school system nor the PT-E system, either individually or in combination, was able to deliver this result.

The current study has shown how, in less affl uent societies, the popularity of PT and PT-E can be attributed to a set of social, psychological, and institutional factors, among which the effectiveness or outcome of private tutoring is only one of several operational considerations. It will now be possible for more extensive investigations, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to verify these parameters of private tutoring on the one hand, including its learning outcomes, and its standing in the students’ and parents’ perceptions on the other.

Exploring the nature of PT-E and the factors contributing to its popularity in a disadvantaged context in Bangladesh is important for TESOL on pedagogical as well as contextual grounds. Pedagogically, the learning of English in Bangladesh is shown to have a complex relationship with PT-E because of the demonstrably unsuccessful performance of the school system on the one hand, and the virtual absence of appropriate self-study resources on the other. Contextually, it shows how English in a country with limited and not very satisfactory teaching performance outside the larger cities (e.g., Dhaka) places strains on curricula, family resources, parents, and school learners. Less affl uent areas, where the imperative of English not only encourages the practice of PT-E but also creates tensions between the formal system and the informal system, and makes parents and students fi nd balances between them in the context of resource constraints, are highly relevant to an international perspective on TESOL.
