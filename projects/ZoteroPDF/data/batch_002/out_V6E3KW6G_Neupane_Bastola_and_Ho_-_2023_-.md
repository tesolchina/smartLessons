A Doctor of Philosophy degree is expected to provide a transformative experience to students and expand the frontier of disciplinary knowledge to benefit the wider public. The achievement of these goals depends on students' engagement with disciplinary practices and conversations and is reflected in their PhD dissertations. This paper reports on a study that examined students' engagement with previous scholarship through the analysis of the rhetorical structure of 60 literature review (LR) chapters of PhD dissertations across disciplines at a comprehensive university in Nepal. The study employed a revised Creating a Research Space (CARS) model as an analytical framework. The LR chapters predominantly displayed a simple structure containing a single move (i.e., establishing a territory), with Move 2 (i.e., establishing a niche) and Move 3 (i. e., occupying the niche) being far less frequent than Move 1. Notably, in a sizable number of LR chapters, existing literature was presented as received knowledge rather than utilized to establish research gaps and advance the research agenda. Although there were no disciplinary variations in Move 1 and Move 2 strategies, significant differences were observed in Move 3 strategies (i.e., announcing research aims/focus and announcing research design/process). The implications of the findings for doctoral supervision and writing are provided.

# 1. Introduction

A Doctor of Philosophy degre "sits at the peak of most countries academic qualification framework" (Jackson, 2013, p. 357) and is considered to be crucial for generating knowledge and producing the next generation of researchers (Dowling et al., 2012). Although there might be some cultural and contextual variations, PhD degree sek to enable graduates to acquire scholarship and research skills; develop their criticl aility to examine, generate and apply knowledge; and help them contribute to the body of disciplinary knowledge, understanding, and debate (Brennan, 2019; Hart, 1998; Holbrook et al., 2007; Kucan, 2011; Lovitts, 2007; Paltridge & Starfield, 2020; isker, 2015). However, the degre to which a doctoral student succd in achieving theseojectives "depends on the student's actual aces to a variet of disciplinary practices and conversations' (Pare, 2017, p. 440) and their PhD disertations are supposed to reflect the extent to which such capabilities have been developed (Anderson & Okuda, 2021; Lovitts 2007). In this regard a literature review is a vital component of a PhD dissertation in many disciplines. It serves the purpose of setting the broad context for the study, idntifing gaps in the xisting literare, provii justifications for the study, deining the proposed reearh contribution, and contextualizing findings (Boote & Beile, 2005; Grant, 2008). In this sense, a literature rview informs l disration components from the introduction to the conclusion (Hart, 1998).

A good literature review is considered not only \*integral to the success of academic research" (Hart, 1998, p. 13) but also "a precondition to doing substantive, thorough, sophisticated research (Boote & Beile, 2005, p. 3). In many disciplines, doctoral stu. dents are required to undertake a thorough critical analysis of literature and identify a gap in the evidence, justify research methods used to address them, provide a new way of looking at phenomena, suggest best practices, and expand the frontier of knowledge (Barret e l., 2021; jorn et al., 202; Boote & Beile, 2005; Gil-Salom & Soler-Monreal, 2014; Hart, 2018, 2018; Hodgson, 2020; Kho0 et a. 2011; Kwan et a., 2012). I is worth noting that critical reading isprerequisit to making any original contribution to knowledge because understanding and generating knowledge go side by side (Hart, 2018). Therefore, a literature review is not about how much students write but about how well they demonstrate a thorough understanding of the field and the capability to criticll use existing knowledge relevant to the research problem (Ali & Yusof, 2012).

A high level of conceptual thinking, critical evaluation, and synthesis of state-of-the-art literature and continuous revision (Boote & Beile, 2005; Hart, 1998; Paltridge & Starfield, 2020) are believed to create a breakthrough in doctoral students' imagination, develop their ability to wite confidenly and authoritatively, and demonstrate their concetual threshold crosings, that is, the \*conributin to understanding, meaning, and knowledge" (Wisker, 2015, p. 64). In contrast, a literature review that merely summarises previous literature might be a hollow exercise that rarely helps doctoral students understand the research topic and design substantie research. Given its significance, PhD examiners \*tend to use the literature review as alitmus test for the quality of a thesis s  whole (Golding et a. 2014, p. 570) and eek the demonstration of rationale and depth of understanding, flow and cohesion in writing, the recognition and acknowledgment of pertinent ideas, and alignment between various disertation components (Holbrook et al. 2004, 2015).

Critically evaluating others' work, however, \*can be a taxing task for inexperienced writers" (wan et al., 2012, p. 199), partic. ularly for English as an Additional Language (EAL) learners (Pare, 2011). Although promoting doctoral students' abilities in writing analytical and critical literature reviews has remained a challnging ssue (Ridley, 2012; Swales & Lindemann, 2002), this area has engendered imited research attntion. Very few studies so far have examined LR chapters in PhD dissertations with a focus on students' engagement with existing literature (se the exceptions of Kwan, 2006; Gil-Salom & Soler-Monreal, 2014; Soler-Monreal, 2015, and You & Li, 2021). It is, therefore, necessary to conduct more research on the part-genre to advance our understanding of its rhetorical patterns and communicatio functions. The study presented in this paper aims to expand the current literature by examining the rhetorical organization of the part-genre.

# 2. Employing move structure to engage with previous scholarship

Reviewing the literature involves selecting sources, reading them criticall, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing sources into writing (Badenhorst, 2018). For doctoral students, however, a literature review is rhetorically a highly demanding and challenging part-genre (Ridley, 2012; Swales & Lindemann, 2002) for various reasons. These include students limited understanding of its purposes and functions; inadequate rhetorical and genre knowledge; dificulty in selecting approriate references; chllenges in managing time for a large amount of reading required; and insufficient kills to analyse, synthesize and evaluate information from various sources (Bitchener & Banda, 2007; Casanave & Hubbard, 1992; Kwan, 2008; Shahsavar & Kourepaz, 2020). Therefore, doctoral students as novice researchers tend to present literature reviews as annotated bibliographies without establishing a connection between reviewed literature and their own research (Swales & Lindemann, 2002; You & Li, 2021). Previous research ., Boote & Beile, 2005) exploring itrature review sections of 12 education PhD disertations at three US universities revealed that the literature reviews, in general, were of low quality, the worst being "mere disjonted summaries of a haphazard collection of literature" (p. 9). Since such inadequate literature reviews rarely help students to establish the niche in existing research, justify the research worthinessof the topic, and ask questions of significance (Feak & Swales, 2009; Hart, 2018), they put the magnitude, relevance, and contribution of doctoral research in question (Shehzad, 2008).

As a part-genre or sub-genre of broader ignificance in a PhD disertation (Ridley, 2012; Swales & Lindemann, 2002), the LR has a schema of prior shared knowledge and conventions for achieving its purpose effctively and efficiently (Hyland, 2009) by presenting the reviewed literature logically (Palridge & Starfield, 2020; Swales & Feak, 2012). Although the LR can be integrated into the introduction or other sections of a PhD dissertation, presenting i in a separate chapter is a common practice because of the widespread use of the traditional form of disertation (contaning n introduction, the iteature review, methods, reults, and discussion chapters) (Anderson et al., 2020; Anderson & Okuda, 2021; Paltridge & Starfield, 2020).

At a broader level of organization, LR chapters can have three constituent sections: introduction serving the purpose of an advance organizer), body (the major section describing various research strands), and summary or conclusion (presenting a concise reiteration of key arguments) (Ridley, 2012). The body can be divided into various thematic units which can have their own move structure (Kwan, 2006; Soler-Monreal, 2015; Xie, 2017; You & Li, 2021). A move, in this context, is "a segment of text that is shaped and constrained by a particular communicative function (Holmes, 1997, p. 325) and contributes to the overall purpose of justifying the current research.

Pioneering work in move analysis is Swales' (1990) CARS model consisting of moves (obligatory component) and steps (optional components used to realize a move) developed from the analysis of research article introductions (see Table 1).

The CARS model has been used to scrutinize the move structure of the introduction section of PhD dissertations (Bunton, 2002) Previous studies have also used the CARS model to examine LRs in research articles (e.g., Kwan et al., 2012; Shehzad, 2008; Stoller & Robinson, 2013) and master'stheses (Xie, 2017). Although the rhetorical organisation of istinct LR chapters of PhD disertations is said to follow the CARS model (Soler-Monreal, 2015), some structural variations betwen the communicative functions of LR in research articles and LR chapter(s) in PhD disertations have been reported because an LR chapter is usually divided into several thematc unts that tablish one part of th teritory and establish a nich i that territory (Kwan, 2006). Inthis regard, Kwans (2006) revised CARS model of thematic units in LR chapters (see Table 2) identified athree-move structure and indicated that while Move 1 and Move 2 were predominant and used recursively, Move 3 was less frequent and optional.

Our extensive search could only locate three tudies (Gi-Salom & Soler-Monreal, 2014; Soler-Monreal, 2015; You & Li, 2021) that employed the revised CARS model to examine the communicative functions of LR chapters in PhD disertations in terms of various moves. Two of these studies (i.e., Gil-Salom & Soler-Monreal, 2014; Soler-Monreal, 2015) comparing LR chapters of 30 computer science PhD disertations (10 English L1, 10 EnglishL2, and 10 Spanish 1 found thatall three moves were obligatory in LR chapters (i.e., found in more than $8 0 \%$ of the LR chapters) written in English. Move 3 was mainly used to promote the current research, with strategies 3A (nature of work done, research aims, focuses, research questions or hypotheses, justification), 3B (theoret ical/methodological frameworks), and 3C (research design/processes) being prevalent i English LR texts. Similarly, in a recent study, You and Li (2021) demonstrated that TES0L doctoral students employed three move structures in LR chapters. However, unlike those in computer science disertations in Soler-Monreal's (2015) study, LR chapters in TE0L disertations had the predominance f Move 1 (1A-surveying non-research phenomena, 1C-surveying research phenomena, and 1B-claiming centrality) and Move 2 (2C-asserting confirmative claims, 2E-abstracting and synthesizing knowledge claims, 2B-gap indicating, 2A-counter claiming, and 2D-asserting relevancy of the surveyed claims), with the strategies in parentheses being in decreasing order of prominence. All three studies employing Kwan's (2006) model, demonstrated that doctoral students had learned rhetorical norms and conventions of iterature reviews and employed various moves to achieve various communicative functions. However, the smallbody of research is concen. trated on limited contexts (i.e., the UK, Greater China, and Spain) and disciplines (i.e., applied ingustics, TEsOL, and Computer Science. Furthermore, although the number of students pursuing a PhD is increasing rapidly in Nepal (University Grants Commission, 2016; 2021) as in other countries (Hakansson Lindqvist, 2018), with the proportional rise in English medium disertations, the Nepalese context has remained virtually unexplored.

Against this backdrop, to explore whether and how Nepalese doctoral students engage with past scholarship, this study examined the rhetorical structure and the communicative functions of LR chapters of PhD dissertations in two broad disciplinary areas (i., sciences and social sciences). The findings of the study willbe of crucial importance to our understanding of students' uptake of disciplinary norms and conventions. In addition, the study findings wil inform supervision and academic writing practices in Nepal and similar EAL contexts, primarily to promote doctoral students critical engagement with literature, academic literacy, and disciplinary socialization. The findings will help provide wellinformed and much-needed writing upport to doctoral students in helping them learn generic norms and conventions for effective communication.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Context of the study

The study was conducted at a public university, the major provider of doctoral education in Nepal. According to the library record the first PhD award was conferred in 1961 in Economics. As of January 2022, the universty had produced 728 PhD graduates in various disiplines (i., edction, hmnties and socil sciences, managment, law, ciece and tchlogy, and eginering), with a steady increase of PhD graduates in recent years. One-on-one supervision is common at the university, although some departments also provide a co-supervisor. A PhD disertation is usually written in English, foreign language in Nepal. However, there is no provision for assesing candidates' English language proficiency, and academic writing support is rarely available. Although some disciplines (e. g, English education and English studies) have academic writing courses to familiarize students with the norms and conventions of academic writing, they are of limited use in helping students solve problems that arise during the thesis writing process. Moreover, the universt's acces to various resources (i.e., financial, lab, and reading resources) is somewhat limited (Neupane Bastola & Hu 2021a). Although higher education policy in Nepal aims to produce capable, competitive, and research-oriented human resources (Ministery of Education, Science, and Technology, 2016), Nepalese higher education is yet to substantively pursue research (Bista et al., 2020) and scholars (e.g., Pokhrel, 2019) have highlighted the need to enhance the quality of doctoral education in Nepal.

# 3.2. The corpus

The data for the study came from 60 LR chapters of PhD dissertations completed between 2003 and 2020. The disertations were written in English and followed a traditional simple format (i.e., containing an introduction, the literature review, methodology, results, and discussion). The format was chosen because it was common across dsciplines. Since the university has recently strted the digitization of PhD dissertations, only 30 dissertations were available for downloading during the data colection period. Upon exploring the library catalogue system, we found that 116 of $7 2 8 ~ \mathrm { P h D }$ dissertations were available on CDs. Among these 116 dissertations, 18 were written in Nepali, and 98 were wrtten in English. We informed the library authority of the research purpose and obtained soft copies of 98 dissertations. Among them, only the dissertations that followed th traditional format and were written in English were included in the present study. The sample consisted of 60 LR chapters of PhD dissertations that belonged to: (a) science disciplines (botany, chemistry, microbiology, physics,statisics, and zoology) and (b) the social sciences (anthropology, economics, geography, population studies, sociology, management, rural development, and home science). The corpus of LR chapters contained 306,989 words in total.

# 3.3. Coding

The coding was conducted in two stages. First, the structure of LR chapters was examined in terms of three analytical units. introduction, body, and conclusion. Second, the body of LR chapters was divided into thematic units and coded for various moves and strategies employing a functional semantic aproach, that is, cognitive judgment, to identify the purpose and boundary of a text (Kwan, 2006). Kwan's (2006) revised CARS model (see Table 2) was used as the analytical framework for coding because the model was based on the analysis of LR chapters of PhD dissertations. We categorized moves into obligatory and optional components of thematic units. Based on Kwan (2006), a move that appeared in all thematic units was considered a compulsory component of a thematic unit. In the same way, if a move appeared at least once in al LR chapters, it was considered an obligatory component f an LR chapter. Ten percent of the data was first coded by the irs author and a PhD student. The intercoder reliability (Cohen's Kappa) was $8 5 . 1 6 \%$ suggesting a strong level of agreement between the two coders (McHugh, 2012). A few cases of disagreement were recorded and were then resolved through discusson. The first author then coded the entire datset through constant comparion analysis (Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2011). NVivo Plus $2 0 2 0 ^ { 2 }$ (a qualitative data analysis software) was used for coding the data. The coding matrix was transferred from Vivo through Excel to SPss for statistical analysis. While decriptie stistic i., frequency and perentage) were employed to examine the distribution of various moves and their tategies in LR chapters, independent sample t-tests were used to scrutinize variations in three move strategies across two broad disciplinary areas (i.e., sciences and social sciences).

# 4. Findings

# 4.1. Overall structure of LR chapters

The analysis of the overallstucture of LR chapters showed that the three-part structure containing an introduction, body (i.e, thematic units), and conclusion was not common inthe LR chapters in the current orpus. More than half of the chapters (32 out of 60) contained only the body. Only 28 $( 4 8 . 2 7 \% )$ and 7 $( 1 1 . 8 6 \% )$ of LR chapters contained introductory and concluding sections, respectively. Only five introductory sections had introduction' as their subheading, in six LR chapters inroductory information was presented under thematic headings like background' or general overview, and the rest presented such information immediately below the chapter heading. The concluding sections presented a brief overview of the chapter and/or research gaps and/or conceptual framework and were variably entitled as 'conclusion' (2), 'concluding remarks' (3), or chapter summary' (2).

4.2. Move structure of thematic units and communicative functions of LR chapters

To figure out the CARS move structure, first, the thematic units in the LR chapters were identified $( n = 1 1 4 8 )$ , and each of these units was examined in terms of moves, the strategies employed to realize the moves, and respective communicative functions. Fig. 1 presents the frequency of moves in thematic units and LR chapters.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, Move 1 was most frequent as it occurred in 1095 (i.e.,. $9 5 . 3 8 \%$ thematic units and all the LR chapters. In comparison, Move 2 and Move 3 were far less frequent, present only in 37 (i.e., $6 1 . 6 7 \%$ and 29 (i.e., $4 8 . 3 3 \%$ of the 60 LR chapters, respectively. The analysis shows that although none of the moves was obligatory in thematic units, Move 1 was a compulsory component of an LR chapter because all the LR chapters contained Move 1.

Table 3 shows that the overwhelming majorit of the thematic units and more than one-quarter of the LR chapters had the single move configuration containing Move 1 only. The number of multi-move configurations was far lower (ranging from $0 . 2 6 \%$ to $4 . 3 6 \%$ in thematic units than in LR chapters (ranging from $1 0 \% - 3 8 . 3 3 \% )$ , indicating that it was more common to establish and occupy the niche, if any, in general rather than doing so with each thematic unit.

# 4.2.1. Move 1: establishing one part of the thematic territory

All thre srategies in Kwan's (2006) framework were employed to establish a thematic territory (i.e., Move 1), as shown in Table 4. The higher frequency of strategy than the frequency of thematic units and LR chapters indicates that some thematic units and LR chapters contained recurring use of the strategy.

Table 4 shows that 1A was the most frequent Move 1 strategy. This strategy was used to present non-research phenomena o1 knowledge lams in the form of concepts, definitions/meanings/characteristics, beliefs, use, theories/models/principles, and plans/ policies (Examples 1-6).

In some cases, factual knowledge claims were made without providing supporting references, which may undermine the credibility of such statements and/or raise the suspicion of plagiarism. The next notable feature of strategy 1A was presenting several theories without describing how they would inform or be applied in the current research.

Strategy 1C, the second most frequent Move 1 strategy, presented the review of related empirical studies. The text was coded under this strategy if the review contained information about at least one of the features related to research focus, findings, research pro cesses, or participants (Examples 7-8).

In phytochemical analysis, Gao et al. (2004) reported a new diterpenoid alkaloid (navirine) along with five previously known alkaloids (isradipine, hordenine, atisine, hetisinone, and delfissinol). (B-LR-3)

In contrast, in several LR chapters, the surveys of non-research and research phenomena were presented separately under sections usually named as theoretical review and empirical review The empirical review section, in some cases, appeared to be isolated, with each study described in a separate paragraph, with rare efforts to link similar studies and evaluate the reviewed literature (Example, 10). Six LR chapters frequently used tables to present definitions or characteristics of constructs and findings of empirical studies.

Sharma (1981) did a study on the adoption of modern farming techniques and adoption characteristics ..

Strategy 1B (i.e., Claiming the centrality of the themes reviewed) was least frequent - it appeared only in 48 (i.e., $4 . 1 8 \%$ of the 1148 thematic units. There were instances of both thesis intenal claims relating to the importance of or need to present certain in. formation or review of a particular study (Example, 11) and thesis extenal claims showing that the general research are is important, interesting, or relevant in some way (Example, 12):

11. This study focuses on... the National Migration Policy .. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the meaning of efective policy implementation'. (Mgt-LR-1)

12. There has been a growing interest over the past 20 years in exploring the caregiving experience. (RD-LR-1)

# 4.2.2. Move 2: establishing a niche

Move 2 was found only in 83 (i.e., $1 2 . 7 2 \%$ of the 1148 thematic units and in 37 $( 6 1 . 6 7 \%$ of the 60 LR chapters. Table 5 presents the frequency of the Move 2 strategies in the thematic units and LR chapters.

Table 5 shows that no Move 2strategies were used frequently in the current corpus. For example, gap-indicating, the most frequent among Move 2 strategies, was found only in 43 (i.e., $3 . 7 5 \%$ of the 1148 thematic units and in half of the 60 LR chapters. The strategy was used recursively only in 14 LR chapters. Gaps were identified in terms of context, subject area, or methodology (Examples, 13-15).

13. With this fact, western conceptualization of career suces cannot be used directly to Nepalese contex. Thus, i is necessary to explore how the career success is being conceptualized in Nepalese organization. (Mgt-LR-6)

15. Although Centella Asiatica is a common and widely used medicinal plant in Nepal, there has not been any genetic study on this plant as of yet. (B-LR-1)

Strategies 2A (Counter claiming), 2C (Making confirmative claims), and 2D (Relevancy claiming) were used only in $_ { 1 - 3 \% }$ of the 1148 thematic units and in les than a quarter of the 60 LR chapters. In most LR chapters, they were used once only. Counterclaims were made about the credibility of previous studies (Example, 16), contradictory findings (Example, 17), methodological limitations (Example 18), or inappropriate theoretical frameworks (Example, 19).

16 Naviculare has been reported as rare and C. orchioides as endangered, but these asignments were based on experts opinions rather than empirical data. (B-LR-3)

Limited use of Move 2 strategies demonstrates that evaluating the existing body of knowledge was not very common in the current corpus.

# 4.2.3. Move 3: occupying the niche

Move 3 was found only in 22 (i.e., $8 . 8 \%$ ) of the 1148 thematic units and 29 (i.e., $4 9 . 1 5 \%$ of the 60 LR chapters. Table 6 presents Move 3 strategies in thematic units and LR chapters.

As can be seen in Table 6, no Move 3 strategies were frequent in the current corpus because they were used only in $0 . 0 9 \% - 2 \%$ of the thematic units and $3 . 3 3 \% - 2 5 \%$ LR chapters. Examples 24, 25, 26, and 27 illustrate strategies 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D, respectively.

# 4.2.4. Disciplinary variations in three move strategies

Independent sample t-tests were used to identify the disciplinary variations in three move strategies in the two broad disciplinary areas (i.e., sciences and social sciences) (see Table 7).

As shown in Table 7, an independent samples t-test located no significant disciplinary difference between the sciences and social sciences in the use of Move 1 and Move 2 strategies. However, significant differences were observed in strategy 3A (i.e., announcing research aims, focus, questions, or hypotheses) and 3C (i.e., announcing research design and process. Whilestrategy 3A was more common in the social sciences, strategy 3C was more prominent in science, with the magnitude of the diffrence approaching the medium level in both 3A (Cohen's ${ \mathsf { d } } = 0 . 4 4$ ) and 3C (Cohen's ${ \tt d } = 0 . 4 3$ ) (Diener, 2010).

# 5. Discussion

The analysis of the LR chapters showed that the Introduction-Body-Conclusion structure was employed only in 23 $( 3 8 . 3 3 \% )$ LR chapters, in contrast to the finding of previous studies (Kwan, 2006; Ridey, 2012). The absence of an introductory section in more than half and concluding section in $8 9 \%$ of the chapters indicated that informing readers about the thematic organization of the chapter and presenting abrief recapitulation of the themes as aform of conclusion was not a widespread practice in the current corpus. Only Move 1 (i.e. establishing one part of the teritory of one's own research) was found to be predominant in thematic units and obligatory in LR chapters, contrary to the findings reported in previous studies, which either found Move 1 and Move 2 (Kwan, 2006; Xie, 2017; You & Li, 2021) or allthre moves (Soler-Monreal, 2015) to be predominant. Notably, more than a quarter of the LR chapters did not contain even a single instance of Move 2 and Move 3, indicating doctoral students' inadequate engagement with prior scholarship. In contrast to the findings of Gil-Salom and Soler-Monreal (2014) Soler-Monreal (2015), and You and Li (2021), ur study demonstrated doctoral students' inadequate understanding of rhetorical norms and conventions of literature reviews to fulfil the intended communicative functions.

No significant dfferences were oserved in the use of Move 1 and Move 2 strategies across isciplines. However, LR chapters in the social sciences typicall comprised two sections: a theoretical review and an empirical review, with the theoretical review section containing a considerably larger amount of information on non-research-related phenomena (i.e., historical, contextual, and theoretical knowledge claims) than LR chapters in science disertations. This disparity might have resulted from the nature of research phenomena in the two broad disciplinary areas. The social sciences often deal with complex and elusive phenomena and perspectives that readers might not be familiar with. Therefore, there is stronger tendency for it reearchers to review in their LRs non-researchrelated phenomena as a background lens to help readers to understand the nature of the phenomena and perspectives under study. This is in contrast to the science, where therie,concepts, and specific reearch procedures are often mphasized to examine relationships among phenomena (Becher, 1994; Bernstein, 199; Hu, 2018; Maton, 2014). As a result rsearchers in this feld are more inclined to examine knowledge claims and research-related phenomena (particularly definitions, propositions, and research acts) in their LR.

The more frequent use of strategy 3A in social sciences than in sciences suggests that determining the research focus is profoundly important for expressing participants views and negotiated meanings influenced by personal, social, and historical perspectives (Becher, 1994; Creswell & Creswell, 2018). Notably the prominence of strategy 3C in science dissertations can be aributed to the influence of positivist paradigms in science research which requires the use of objective, reliable, and valid scientific methods for developing factual and universal statements (Becher, 1994; Creswell & Creswell, 2018).

The rare use of Move 2 in some chapters and its absence in others might indicate that the presentation of prior knowledge alone is considered an acceptable form of alitrature review in PhD dissertations written in the Nepalese context. However, the percentage of LR chapters containing thre moves was far higher than that of thematic units, indicating that it was more common to establish and occupy the niche in general rather than doing so with each thematic unit. I is worth noting that the LR chapters that did not contain Move 2 and Move 3 were solely decriptive and tended to include a significant amount of information (for example, the description of several theories) that did not appear to be directl relevant to the study. The students who engaged only in the descriptive presentation of literature might have missed the opportunity to ehance their skills in forming persuasive arguments and cross a conceptual threshold in developing understanding, constructing meaning, and establishing a solid knowledge base (Wisker, 2015).

The limited uptake of rhetorical norms and conventions of writing LRs can be attributed to factors related to PhD students, their supervisors, the institution awarding PhDs, and the research context. irst thestudents might have an inadequate understanding of the purposes and functions f a literature review, limited rhetorical and genre knowledge, and insufficient academic literacy to review literature analyticaly and critically for forwarding credible arguments (Bitchener & Banda, 2007; Casanave & Hubbard, 1992; Shahsavar & Kourepaz, 2020). Doctoral students' limited understanding, knowledge, and capabilities can be attributed to three factors. First as novice reachrs, the might nt ave writen full L for ns importnt ash disetation and, threfore have limited research training (Sharma, 2018). Second, their linguistic competence to write a disertation in English might have been limited because of no provision to gauge their English language proficiency and provide academic writing support when needed. Third, the students might not have en able to invest sufficient time to engage in the inellectually demanding tas of criticall reviewing existing litrature (Casanave, 2019) because most of the doctoral students in the univerity concerned tend to be self-financed and engage in a full-time or part-time job during their candidature.

Second, the limited application of disciplinary norms and conventions in LR chapters can also be associated with supervisors (Hart 1998). Supervisors may lack embodied expertise and confidence to deal with writing issues and help students develop good research writing skill (Casanave, 2019; Guerin et al., 2017; Pare, 2011) for two main reasons. First, in the absence of any provision for supervisor development programs (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a), supervisors are expected to either draw on their experience of being supervised or develop skils based on trial-and-error experiences of supervision (Casanave, 2019). Second, in some cases, professors rarely active in research and publication are reported to have been appointed as PhD supervisors (Pokhrel, 2019; Sharma, 2018). In this regard, a brief exploration of supervisors' profiles indicated that doctoral students working with research-active supervisors appeared to have produced better-quality literature reviews than those working with non-research-active supervisors.

Third, the institutional support to promote doctoral student' disciplinary socialization might have been limited (Pare, 2017) because of insufficient provision of resources (i.e., reading materials, lab facilities, and research funds) (Neupane Bastola, 2021; Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021b), ittle encouragement for faculties to remain active in research and publication (Sharma, 2018) les rigorous qualit control mechanisms than what would be expected (Bote & Beile, 2005), and rare support for academic writing. The suboptimal institutional research culture might have contributed to the ritualization of research (Gautam et al., 2020) and priority given to the exchange value (i.e. getting a PhD degre) rather than the use value developing research cholarship and contributing to the body of knowledge) of doctoral education (Engestrom, 2000). Multipl factors can explain the unconducive research culture It should be pointed out that higher education in Nepal has just a brief six-decade-long history (the first universty was established in 1959). During this period although democratization, liberalization, and the emphasis on social justice and equity have contributed to significant gains in people's access to higher education, similar progressi yet to be made in quality higher education (ista et al., 2020). Higher education institutions have not been able to establish themselves as a knowledge centre (Gautam et al., 2020, p. 15) because of a minimal research budget (Dhamala, 2019; Gupto, 2020; Pokhrel, 2019), the appointment of an individual with few research credentials as a Rector, a Dean, a member of the Research Council or a PhD supervisor (Mathema, 2019), the low weight given to research and publication in the selection and promotion of faculty members (Dhamala, 2019), and ineffective mechanisms to ensure research thics. Fourth, doctoral student citical engagement with literature might have been les prioitized in the Nepalese ontext because the research environment is les competitie than in other developed countrie (Kwan, 2006) or the readership in the context has limited awareness of the research territory (Burgess, 2002).

# 6. Conclusion and implications

The findings of the study showed that most of the LR chapters included in the current corpus did not have introductory and concluding sections to provide the readers with a thematic overview and recapitulation of the LR chapters. In addition, the pre dominance of single-move thematic units indicated doctoral students limited critical engagement with existing literature. Several implications can be drawn from the findings.

First and foremost it is unwise to assume that doctoral students would know the purposes and rhetorical patterning of a literature review (Bitchener & Banda, 2007). Given the predominance of descriptive and isolated LR chapters resembling annotated bibliographies, raising doctoral students awarenessof alitrature review as an argument development process and promoting thir critical engagement with literature is essential (Kwan, 2008). In this regard, it is worth noting that critcal and eficint reading is a prerequisite to critical and efficient writig because reading, writing, and research are constitutive of each other (Casanave & Hubbard, 1992; Kwan, 2008). Unfortunately, doctoral students' reading skill are usually taken for granted (Bjorn et al., 2022) and rarely promoted (Barret et al., 2021). Therefore, doctoral students ned to be encouraged to invest time and intllectual effrts in substantive, repetitive, persistent, and wide reading on ther topic hroughout the research proces to acquire a broad knowledge base and identify gaps in existing research (Badenhorst, 2018; Hart, 2018). Students need to be provided with models and encouraged to be active in their lening because complex skils like reading, writing, and researching require elf-regulation (Badenhorst, 2018; jorn et a., 2022; Kwan et al., 2012). They can be engaged in move analysis of representative samples of LR chapters (Kwan et l., 2012) or categorical redig by paying attentin t clams, evidne, rsoning, implications, and contxs (i.., CRI aproach) Barrt t al., 2021). They can also be involved in the three-stage process of representation (ie., understanding the purpose), decomposition (i., analysis of notable features), and approximation (i.e., composing and revising draft) of reviewing literature (Kucan, 2011). This process might help them appreciate the fundamental purposes of a literature review, notice the move structure, and engage with the existing literature (Carter et al., 2020).

Second, writing a doctoral dissertation is a collaborative process between students and their supervisor(s). In this regard, the capabilit of the supervisor (i.e., research knowledge and related skill) is a critical factor in doctoral students' success (Vilkinas, 2008). Although supervisors own experience of being supervised influences their supervision practices (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a), such an experience might not adequately inform their supervisory pedagogies (Guerin et al., 2015; Harwood & Petic, 2020) Therefore, supervisor development programs are essential to help supervisors better nurture their supervisees through various constructive comments (Guerin et al., 2015; Harwood & Petric, 2020) and help them publish their work (Brennan, 2019; Khosa e al., 2020). However, the one-size-fits-all approach to supervisor development might not work because of the chaotic and contradictory nature of supervision and the diversity among supervisors regarding their experiences, expertise, enthusiasm, and availability for training. Therefore, there should be a combination of both reflection (i.e., learner-led) and transmission (resource-led) based ap. proaches (Casanave, 2019; Halse, 2011; McCormack, 2009). The learner-led reflective approach draws on supervisors' prior knowedge and understanding and provides them with the opportunity to make their experience explicit to understand embodied facts, make sense of contradictions through lived and living experiences, bring changes in their thinking and share their supervision-based learning for the benefit of others (Halse, 2011; McCormack, 2009; Vilkinas, 2008). The resource-led approach is also vital to provide the supervisors with information (about policies, codes of practice, and statements of efective supervision), discuss roles and responsibilitie, and promote their skill of effective supervision (McCormack, 2009). Such supervisor development programs should help supervisors support students' academic literacy (Guerin et al., 2017).

Although the findings of the study provide relevant insights into Nepalese doctoral students' engagement with previous literature. it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the study in interpreting the findings. First, the study examined only English medium dissertations available on CDs in the universt library. Therefore, the sample might not have been representative, although the inclusion of dissertations from several departments across isciplines might have increased the generalizability of the findings. Second, coursework (for PhD candidates without an M. Phil.) and publication requirements were itroduced in 2017 (www.tufohss.edu.np). Therefore, comparing LR chapters produced by doctoral students who were and were not required to publish during thir candidature might demonstrate the impact of publication requirements on students' critical engagement with literature and their uptake of disciplinary norms and conventions. Third, the current dataset was limited to LR chapters in PhD disertations. Therefore, integrating textual analysis along with interviews with doctoral students would generate insights about the challenges related to their critical engagement with literature.
