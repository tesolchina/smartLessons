In my early research on feedback in L2 writing (Lee, 2007a, 2007b), I problematized the primarily summative orientation of teacher feedback, where great emphasis is put on summative scores or grades. In my more recent work on classroom writing assessment and feedback (Lee, 2017), I further underscored the importance for teachers to de-emphasize grades if they want students to reap maximum benefits from feedback. Although I did not use the term “ungrading,” my feedback philosophies are in line with its principles (see Blum, 2017; Carillo, 2023).

Ungrading, as a pedagogical approach, minimizes grades to support student learning. It shifts the focus from traditional grading to more qualitative and formative assessment methods, where feedback from different sources and students’ active involvement are emphasized. Thus, ungrading aligns with the principles of assessment as learning (AaL) that puts students at the centre of learning (Earl, 2003). When ungrading is practiced, students play an active role in feedback and assessment, participating in student-centered activities such as goal-setting, monitoring, and evaluation, which can foster learner agency and engagement, leading to better learning outcomes.

Feedback and ungrading are, therefore, interconnected concepts and should go hand in hand. They complement each other and work in synergy to improve student learning outcomes. In this response to Crusan, I will examine feedback in the context of ungrading, focusing on how feedback can be implemented to complement ungrading through promoting student-centred assessment, learner agency, and learner engagement. I conclude by addressing potential challenges.

# 1. Detailed, descriptive, dialogic feedback instead of grades

In the absence of quantitative scores, students receive detailed, descriptive feedback that is diagnostic in nature, informing them of the extent to which their writing has met the established assessment criteria, as well as their strengths and weaknesses in writing. Indeed, ungrading is effective only when feedback is detailed, descriptive, and dialogic.

# 2. Ongoing, timely feedback

In classrooms that practice ungrading, formative feedback in the form of descriptive and diagnostic feedback has to be provided in an ongoing and timely manner, so that students keep track of their learning goals and engage in continuous self-monitoring. So even

without receiving grades on a regular basis, students know what further goals they should set, based on the timely and diagnostic feedback they receive, to improve their writing.

# 3. Feedback from different sources

When ungrading is implemented, it is no longer the teachers who are in control. Instead, they share responsibility with students, utilizing feedback from sources other than themselves to promote student learning and writing, such as self- and peer feedback, and feedback enhanced by technology and generative artificial intelligence (GAI). Throughout the feedback process, regardless of the source, students are empowered to play an active role to take charge of their learning.

# 4. Student active involvement in the feedback process

Ungrading, supported by feedback, puts students at the center stage, involving them actively in every stage of the writing and feedback process (Lee, 2016). Before writing, teachers can make students play an active role by getting them to co-construct assessment rubrics. Students can also set personal learning goals, based on the success criteria established by the teacher and their own self-evaluation. During writing, students can monitor and evaluate their learning and writing with reference to their personal learning goals. They can conduct peer evaluation to help each other improve their writing. After writing, students can evaluate the extent to which their goals were achieved, reflect on major strengths and weaknesses in writing based on all the feedback received, and set new goals for further improvement. Throughout the writing and feedback process, students can keep reflective notes to document their learning and evaluate their progress in writing.

# 5. Promoting learner agency and engagement

Ungrading is implemented alongside student-centered assessment to promote learner agency and engagement. To this end, teachers can encourage students to request specific feedback based on the learning goals set. They can facilitate dialogic feedback by providing opportunities for students to interact with the teacher—for example, through annotating their texts with specific questions about their writing (e.g., Is my thesis statement too wordy?). Teachers can also organize writing conferences and encourage students to take the lead by asking questions based on the feedback received. This will change the traditional interaction pattern from “teacher initationstudent response-teacher feedback” to “student initiation-teacher response-student feedback/question.” When GAI is utilized for feedback generation, teachers can show students how to pose meaningful metacognitive questions to GAI (e.g., is my thesis statement appropriately worded? Is my story opening interesting?) and exercise their critical judgment of its response. Overall, the above mentioned strategies can foster learner agency and promote engagement in support of ungrading in the writing classroom.

# 6. Challenges and conclusion

Despite its potential benefits, ungrading may be considered revolutionary, especially by teachers working within exam-driven contexts dominated by traditional assessment approaches. Instead of overhauling traditional assessment practices, teachers may begin by reducing the frequency of grading. For instance, grading for each writing task can be postponed to the very last draft, with a strong focus on feedback for interim drafts, supported by student-centered assessment activities geared towards AaL, such as those suggested in the preceding section. Teachers can also consider using feedback forms with Likert scales (e.g., 1–4) to provide minimally quantitative information about students’ work, with a stronger emphasis on qualitative, descriptive feedback on different aspects of writing. These can be considered mid-way measures before ungrading is fully implemented.

To conclude, ungrading is underpinned by sound educational principles. I strongly encourage teachers to consider it, reflect on their current feedback practices, and explore ways to prioritize feedback over grades.
