# 1. A Chinese perspective on EAP and metadiscursive nouns

Teaching English for academic purposes (EAP) has gained significant prominence in China with the rise of globalization and the internationalization of higher education. A bibliometric analysis of EAP over the past 40 years (1980–2020) indicates that “EAP is achieving a global reach as authors affiliated with emerging centres of research, particularly China, begin to make a mark on these fields” (Hyland & Jiang, 2021, p. 1). The book Metadiscursive nouns: Interaction and persuasion in disciplinary writing by Feng (Kevin) Jiang, part of the China Perspectives Series, aims to provide insights into cutting-edge academic thinking in China and inspire scholars and readers globally. This book is primarily based on Jiang’s pioneering PhD work under the guidance of his supervisor, Professor Ken Hyland. Before his doctoral studies, Jiang taught business English in China and developed a strong interest in business discourse research, which led him to pursue EAP research. Inspired by Hyland’s research on social interaction in disciplinary writing, Jiang focuses on nouns. Despite the assertion that “academic writing is an extremely noun-heavy register” (p. x), previous studies have primarily focused on the ideational role of nouns in academic writing, with little attention to their potential interactional role in mediating writer-reader interaction. In this context, this recent publication is a valuable addition to existing research from a Chinese perspective. It explores how metadiscursive nouns, a sub-set of abstract nouns (such as fact, analysis, and belief), are used to negotiate writer-reader interaction in disciplinary writing, mapping them onto the theoretically well-grounded model of metadiscourse proposed by Hyland (2005).

# 2. Understanding metadiscourse

Academic writing has evolved from its traditional image as an objective, faceless, and impersonal form of discourse into a persuasive endeavour involving interaction between writers and readers (Hyland, 2005). Against this backdrop, metadiscourse, simply conceived as “discourse about discourse” (Hyland, 2005, p. 16), has become an important approach to exploring social interaction in academic writing (e.g., Adel, ¨ 2010; Hyland, 2005, 2017; Hyland & Jiang, 2017, 2019). According to Hyland (2005), metadiscourse includes interactive and interactional dimensions, which “are essentially the two sides of the same coin” (Thompson, 2001, p. 61). The interactive dimension concerns the writer’s awareness of organizing discourse into a cohesive chain of information and guiding readers through the text (e.g., but, finally, noted above, according to, and namely). In contrast, the interactional dimension focuses on the strategies writers use to engage with readers through the expression of stance and engagement (e.g., might, definitely, unfortunate, we, and consider). Notably, based on the examples listed above, most metadiscursive items have concentrated on verbs, adverbs, and adjectives, often sidelining the significant interactional role played by nouns. Addressing this gap, Jiang explores the under-investigated concept of metadiscursive nouns, termed a “neglected feature of metadiscourse” by Jiang and Hyland (2016), and elucidates their dual rhetorical functions. Metadiscursive nouns function similarly to metadiscourse, serving “to organize discourse, convey authorial stance and engage readers in texts” (p. 33).

# 3. Chapter breakdown

This book opens with a preface by Professor Ken Hyland, who praises its significance and contributions to the research fields of nouns, metadiscourse, and academic writing. Following this, eight well-organized chapters, adhering to a typical IMRD (IntroductionMethods-Results-Discussion) structure, are clearly presented.

Chapter 1 begins by introducing the research background from a social constructionist perspective, viewing academic writing as “a persuasive endeavour, saturated with the perspectives of the author” (p. 2). It then focuses on metadiscursive nouns before presenting the research aims and motivations. Finally, this chapter outlines the structure of the entire book, providing a panorama for readers to

follow this groundbreaking work.

Chapter 2 systematically reviews concepts related to metadiscursive nouns, including container nouns, general nouns, anaphoric nouns, labelling nouns, carrier nouns, shell nouns, and others. Rather than merely tracing the chronological development of these noun types, the author acknowledges the contributions of previous scholars while critiquing the limitations of their studies. Importantly, he outlines how his research addresses these gaps. The chapter also delves into applied research in academic discourse, particularly texts produced by L2 students. This background information familiarizes us with the origin, evolution, and limitations of previous studies on these nouns, establishing a robust foundation for the theorization and legitimization of metadiscursive nouns in subsequent chapters.

Following this critical review, Chapter 3 provides a definition of metadiscursive nouns that is both theoretically sound and analytically solid. It conceptualizes these nouns as “a sub-set of abstract nouns” characterized by their “unspecific semantic meaning” (p. 33), distinguishing them from typical abstract nouns whose meanings are constant across different contexts (e.g., society, democracy). Unlike these abstract nouns, metadiscursive nouns feature both a stable core meaning and a variable pragmatic meaning that changes depending on the context in which they are used. For instance, the metadiscursive noun results in the following example (bold) structures the text by anticipatorily pointing to the textual information that follows and guides the audience’s reading through the text: Analysis in terms of self-affine roughness was performed by studying the height-height correlation function and the power spectrum of the simulated surfaces. The results can be summarized as follows (see figure 24).… [Physics] (p. 34).

The chapter also elucidates metadiscourse nouns’ discoursal features, selection criteria, lexico-grammatical patterns, rhetorical functions, and expressive classifications. This conceptualization of metadiscursive nouns marks a departure point for the subsequent empirical analyses and explanations. Chapter 4 details the data collection and analytical procedures underpinning the research. A 1.7- million-word corpus comprising 160 research articles from both soft and hard domains (including electronic engineering, medicine, cell biology, physics, applied linguistics, marketing, sociology, and philosophy) is constructed. Diverging from previous methodologies, this study employs part-of-speech tagging and regular expression queries to achieve more comprehensive results and enhance search efficiency for metadiscursive nouns.

Following the preliminary preparation work, the ensuing three chapters (Chapters 5–7) delineate the results and discussion. Chapter 5 presents an overview of the frequency, distribution, and wordlist of metadiscursive nouns. Focusing on the two most frequent lexico-grammatical patterns, the determiner $+ N$ pattern (e.g., this study) and $N + p o s t$ -nominal clause patterns (i.e., the fact that…). Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 discuss the interactive function (anaphoric and cataphoric reference) and interactional function (stance and engagement) of metadiscursive nouns, respectively, with illustrative examples. The author’s explanation of the research findings also provides us with valuable insights, enabling us to design our tasks tailored to different disciplinary knowledge practices and the communicative goals of various sections of research articles. The closing chapter (Chapter 8) recapitulates the major findings, acknowledges the study’s limitations, and discusses its theoretical and pedagogical implications, culminating in final remarks.

# 4. Distinctive contributions and pedagogical value

This book explores the relatively uncharted interactional roles of metadiscursive nouns in disciplinary writing by employing rigorous research methodology and substantial authentic data. Beyond quantitative analysis, it provides qualitative explanations supported by a wealth of clear examples. What impresses us most is the author’s systematic, logical, and organised presentation of the content. This helps us understand how metadiscursive nouns represent social interaction in disciplinary practice and provides a clear framework that we, as EAP teachers, can use to guide our students in writing logically. Additionally, the author’s decision to include references at the end of each chapter, rather than at the end of the book, makes it very convenient for us to locate and check relevant information. As researchers and practitioners in the EAP/ESP fields, we are particularly attracted and inspired by the book’s theoretical contributions and pedagogical implications.

Theoretically, the book provides further evidence to challenge the conventional perception of academic texts as objective and impersonal. The author highlights the often-overlooked interactional potential of nouns, elucidating their multifaceted roles in conveying ideas, organising text, and managing interpersonal relationships, as categorized by the three metafunctions in Systemic Functional Linguistics—ideational, textual, and interpersonal functions, especially the latter two. Specifically, these nouns do more than merely convey scientific and objective knowledge in academic prose; they play a crucial role in structuring arguments, projecting the author’s stance, and engaging the audience to make the arguments plausible and persuasive. Additionally, the function-based categorization (i.e., entity, attribute, and relation) and the incorporation of new lexico-grammar patterns (i.e., There $b e \mathrm { ~ + ~ } N , N + o f$ $+ \ V .$ -ing) introduced in Chapter 3 address the previously identified shortcomings in the classification and retrieval of metadiscursive nouns, providing a robust analytical framework. This framework could extend its utility to various other noun-heavy registers, such as medical discourse, legal discourse, news discourse, as well as disaster and public health crisis discourse, suggesting avenues for future research and application. Furthermore, it makes an innovative theoretical contribution by broadening our understanding of metadiscourse, both in terms of linguistic realization and rhetorical strategies, integrating the interactive and interactional functions into metadiscursive nouns. This exploration enriches Hyland’s (2005) metadiscourse marker list and advances metadiscourse research by highlighting the dynamic roles of nouns traditionally seen as static, informational, and abstract.

Pedagogically, as EAP practitioners, we believe this book can help us enhance students’ communicative and rhetorical use of language and their ability to apply metadiscursive nouns for interactive and persuasive effects appropriately. Unlike some descriptive empirical studies that address instructional implications superficially, this research provides concrete and operable awareness-raising teaching tasks and activities revolving around analyzing “text fragments” and “longer texts” (Hyland, 1996, pp. 483–484). It encourages teachers to “create varied contexts” (p. 210) where students can write appropriately for particular readers. The approaches provided in Chapter 8 enable students to identify metadiscursive nouns, understand their lexicalization in specific contexts, and grasp

the stance writers aim to convey with them.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of the application of efficient corpus tools such as TagAnt and AntConC (Chapter 4) for part-of-speech tagging, concordance line location, and regular expression queries. These tools assist students in identifying frequent linguistic forms and lexico-grammar patterns in specific disciplinary contexts, thus promoting personalized learning in data-driven and computer-assisted ways. This approach aligns with the increasing emphasis on “real-world digital literacy practices” (Overstreet et al., 2023, p. 1) and the growing requirement for a range of digital literacies in higher education, including the adept use of technology in student writing (Benzie & Harper, 2019). Therefore, the book’s dual focus on fostering both academic and digital literacy among students is particularly commendable.

# 5. Recommendations for enhancement

While the merits of this book are notable, there are still opportunities for further refinement and exploration. Firstly, the author acknowledges that the contextual explanation of the rhetorical use of metadiscursive nouns in research articles across different disciplines relies on existing literature and his speculation. To enhance the reliability of these findings, collecting information from experts in specific disciplinary communities, combined with qualitative methods such as questionnaires and interviews, could provide more substantiated insights. Secondly, the book lists typical metadiscursive nouns only in Appendix 3 (p. 218). Providing a comprehensive list of these nouns as a reference for identifying potential items in academic texts would be greatly beneficial to researchers and learners. Given that this study is limited to eight disciplines, possibly due to the scope of a doctoral project, future research could extend to a broader range of disciplines, aiming to compile a more exhaustive list of metadiscursive nouns. Additionally, although not within the scope of this book, the impact of research paradigms on the application of metadiscursive nouns could offer valuable perspectives (Hu & Cao, 2015).

In summary, the limitations notwithstanding, this book offers a fresh perspective on interpersonal interaction in academic writing through detailed examples and contextual explanations. By theorizing and providing an evaluation-based classification of metadiscursive nouns, it makes a valuable contribution to the study of related nouns and metadiscourse in academic contexts. Moreover, given the rising global prominence of EAP research, especially from a Chinese perspective, this work is particularly significant. It not only enhances our understanding of metadiscursive nouns but also highlights the crucial role that Chinese scholarship plays in the broader landscape of academic writing. As China continues to influence the global discourse in EAP, Jiang’s book stands as a testament to the innovative contributions emerging from this region, bridging local insights with the international academic community. Overall, this book promises to be a thought-provoking resource for researchers and practitioners specialising in or interested in academic writing, corpus-based discourse analysis, and linguistics at large.
