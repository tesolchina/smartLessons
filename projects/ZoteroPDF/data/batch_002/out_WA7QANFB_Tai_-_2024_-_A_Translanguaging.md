A growing number of studies have explored the ways how teachers contingently respond to students’ unexpected responses or a lack of student responses in second language classrooms. From a sociocultural perspective, teacher contingency involves a departure from the lesson plan in local response to the unexpected or unforeseeable actions in the classroom interactions (van Lier, 2001). This study adopts translanguaging as an analytical perspective in order to examine how a teacher employs various resources to contingently respond to students’ initiatives and reformulate his utterances in order to prompt student participation. The data are based on a larger linguistic ethnographic project in a Hong Kong English-Medium-Instruction secondary history classroom. This paper reconceptualizes the notion of teacher contingency and argues that the process of how the teacher contingently responds to the unexpected outcomes that arise in real-time interactions is a process of translanguaging. Such a process requires the teacher in orchestrating the available linguistic and multimodal resources to construct pedagogical actions on the spot, instead of being planned in advance.

# Introduction

Second language (L2) classroom interaction research has been investigating how teachers contingently respond to students’ unexpected responses or a lack of student responses in L2 classrooms (e.g. Waring 2011; Fagan 2015; Tai and Brandt 2018). Teacher contingency is often referred to as teacher’s utterances that ‘are constructed on the spot, rather than planned in advance’ (van Lier 2001: 99). From a sociocultural perspective, teacher contingency involves a departure from the lesson plan in the local response to the unexpected or unforeseeable actions in the classroom interactions (van Lier, 2001). For example, L2 students can self-select to initiate a new sequence or have control of the topic selection over the teacher. Learner initiatives, which are linked to the concept of learner agency, have the potential to create learning opportunities and recently there has been an increase in conversation analytic studies in exploring the sequential patterns of learner initiatives (e.g. Waring 2011; Jacknick 2011; Sert 2017). Moreover, L2 students may not provide any response during the classroom interaction, despite being prompted by the teacher several times. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how teachers contingently respond to the local environment and conditions in their L2 classrooms for promoting learning and addressing students’ diverse needs.

In the context of English-Medium-Instruction (EMI) classrooms, teachers, and students adopt English-as-a-second-language as the medium-of-instruction to teach and learn academic subjects. It is recognized that the language of humanities subjects, such as history, involves different subject-specific technical terms, and the language involved is usually narrative in nature to express ‘concrete relationships of time, place, and action’ (Martin 1991: 307). Researchers have been exploring ways in which EMI teachers can balance content and L2 learning, especially when students are still developing their L2 academic literacy and their L2 English proficiency and simultaneously learning abstract academic-specific knowledge (Lo and Lin 2019). Lo (2014) study has shown that L2 learning opportunities can vary in different EMI content subjects. In contrast to mathematics and science lessons, the humanities lessons provide more opportunities for students to interact with the teachers in extended initiation-response-feedback sequences, which allow the teachers to provide more targeted input, make use of the feedback turn to push learners to produce more L2, and provide more corrective feedback to students’ L2 output. Although Lo’s findings have demonstrated that different content subject lessons can potentially lead to different teacher-learner interaction patterns, how EMI teachers can manage the unforeseeable actions in the classrooms contingently and how the teachers’ contingent actions facilitate students’ content learning have been underexplored in the field of applied linguistics.

Based on data collected from a 2-month linguistic ethnography in a Hong Kong (HK) EMI secondary history classroom, this paper aims to adopt translanguaging as an analytical perspective in order to reconceptualize the notion of teacher contingency and explicate how the EMI teacher contingently responds to the unexpected outcomes that arise in real-time classroom interactions through deploying translanguaging practices. Observations with fieldnotes, ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and classroom video recordings form the main database. Multimodal conversation analysis (MCA) is employed to conduct a fine-grained analysis of classroom interaction. The analyses of the classroom interactional data are triangulated with the video-stimulated-recall-interview data which are analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) in order to analyze the teacher’s reflections on his pedagogical and interactional strategies.

# EMI in Hong Kong

EMI is defined as the ‘use of English to teach academic subjects other than English itself in countries and jurisdictions where the L1 of the majority of the population is not English’ (Macaro 2018: 19). HK is a uniquely suitable context for this study because English, being the official language of the former colonial era and current international language, is economically valued in HK’s society, and there is a strong preference for EMI among parents and students because EMI schools are perceived to be more prestigious and allow students to acquire English more effectively (Choi 2003; Tollefson and Tsui, 2014).

The selection of medium-of-instruction in the educational system has been a highly controversial issue in HK, where the majority of the citizens speak Cantonese as their L1. Although the medium-of-instruction policies are broadly set for primary and university education, medium-of-instruction policy at the secondary level has gone through immense changes (Poon 2010). HK’s secondary schools have witnessed three key stages in the development with regard to medium-of-instruction policies, including (i) the laissez-faire policy prior to 1994; (ii) the compulsory Chinese Medium Instruction (CMI) policy during 1998–2010 which allowed 114 secondary schools to use EMI to teach content subjects while the remaining 307 schools were mandated to use CMI; and (iii) the fine-tuning medium-of-instruction policy since 2010. The policy is in part responding to the parental desire for their children to be educated in EMI settings. Under the fine-tuning policy, secondary schools are allowed to offer EMI classes, partial-English-medium classes (i.e. one or two subjects conducted in EMI), and/or CMI classes. CMI schools have the autonomy in selecting their medium-of-instruction for content subjects if they have met certain criteria (Education Bureau 2009). As a result, lots of secondary schools are teaching at least some subjects through EMI. A rough estimation based on the Secondary School Profile in 2019–2020, around $3 0 \%$ of the secondary schools deploy EMI throughout all the grades and approximately $40 \%$ deploy EMI for at least one academic subject.

# Teacher contingency in classroom interactions

The majority of studies in language education have investigated the role of teacher talk in teacherfronted interaction and how teachers can construct and facilitate language learning in the classrooms (e.g. Jacknick 2011; Waring 2011; Sert 2017; Tai and Brandt, 2018; Matsumoto 2018). Teachers do not only ensure the process of knowledge transfer effectively, but teachers also need to manage unexpected or unforeseeable contingencies that are emerged in real-time classroom interaction. As scholars have previously argued (van Lier 1988; Lee 2010; Tai and Brandt, 2018), classroom interactions often entail spontaneity and improvisation that cannot be planned in advance. That is, teachers need to acknowledge the reality of L2 teaching as responding to unscripted actions spontaneously, and therefore, carrying out classroom teaching typically involves simultaneous and improvised decisions (Baynham 2006). For example, a teacher may prepare a set of questions with a specific direction in mind. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to predict how the students will respond to the questions and how the answers will be produced, such as with hesitations, promptly, or explicitly. Students may not respond to the teacher’s questions at all, which often requires the teacher to repair or repeat the question. Heritage (1984: 242) explains this local exigency of real-time interactions as follows:

since every current action will itself form the immediate context for some next action in a sequence, it will inevitably contribute to the framework in terms of which the next action will be understood. In this sense, the context of a next action is repeatedly renewed with every current action. Moreover, each action will, by the same token, function to renew (i.e. maintain, alter or adjust) any more generally prevailing sense of context which is the object of the participants’ orientation and actions.

In other words, teachers need to manage the contingencies of classroom talk that influence and shape the interactional trajectory. Hence, it is challenging to predict the alternative actions that students will take in the next turn at talk (Schegloff 1996) because the interlocutor’s actions and uptake are locally determined and situationally constructed. van Lier (1996) first coins the notion ‘teacher contingency’ and he conceptualizes contingency as closely related to the structure of language. He argues that conversations are ‘locally assembled’ (p. 168) and dynamic rather than being planned in advance. Being contingent involves the speaker using language spontaneously to address ‘the new, the unexpected’. During this process, the speaker ‘simultaneously connects the new to what is known, and sets up expectations for what is to happen next’ (p. 172). In this sense, contingent language use requires speakers to draw on what they know in order to respond to the unscripted incidents in conversations so that the conversation can be maintained. Prior studies (e.g. Jacknick 2011; Fagan 2013) have demonstrated L2 teachers’ contingent verbal utterances in facilitating learning opportunities in teacher-student interactions. Research has shown that there are different varieties in teacher responses to uninvited student initiatives, ranging from attempting to handle it as quickly as possible to move on with the planned activity, to pursuing the initiative from the students as a learning opportunity to facilitate the learning process, and including it into the lesson plan, or changing the planned lesson entirely (Garton,

2012). Specific pedagogical practices in response to uninvited student initiatives have also been found to constrain students’ participation. He (2004) study demonstrates how a Chinese teacher bypasses a learner’s topic initiation to something recognized as beyond the pedagogical focus of the lesson. Jacknick (2011) study finds out that the teacher either shuts down or bypasses a student initiative if the student initiative is done in overlap with the teacher’s endeavour to begin a new activity. Other studies also document how teachers expand or close student-initiated sequences. Jacknick (2009: 110) identifies four types of closed teacher responses to studentinitiated participation: ‘no response’, ‘positive evaluation’, ‘explanation’, and ‘attempt to move on’. Four types of expandable teacher responses are also found: ‘acknowledgment’, ‘negative evaluation’, and ‘expansion sequence initiation’. Fagan (2013: 141) also finds out that the teacher manages to respond to the students’ questions, which cannot be straightforwardly answered or may not be in alignment with the teacher’s agenda, through ‘modelling exploration’ and ‘offering accounts’. The teacher also manages to respond to the students’ questions, which are nonproblematic student assertions, or they can be answered easily, by ‘doing answer’ and ‘doing acknowledging with or without minimal elaboration’.

However, in applied linguistics studies, a number of research studies have demonstrated that teachers’ contingent responses are much more than just verbal responses (e.g. Sert 2017; Tai and Brandt 2018). Sert (2017) has illuminated how the English-as-a-second-language teacher makes use of iconic gestures to facilitate her explanation of the word ‘each other’ in response to a student initiative. A recent study by Tai and Brandt (2018) examines how an ESOL teacher employed embodied enactments as pedagogical resources to contingently explain vocabulary to learners in an adult beginning-level ESOL classroom in the US. Embodied enactment refers to the participants’ employment of embodied resources, including the use of gesture/body movement and/or verbal resources, to represent an aspect of hypothetical events. This is exemplified in the analysis of the classroom talk which illustrates that the teacher offers a verbal and physical representation of an imagined outside-of-the-classroom context, which helps students in the class to understand how the specific vocabulary items could be employed in this specific context.

Based on the review of the literature, it is noticeable that L2 teachers’ mobilization of diverse linguistic and semiotic resources spontaneously illuminates teacher contingency in selecting resources that are meaningful for them to contingently respond to unexpected and unforeseeable actions in real-time classroom interaction (e.g. Tai and Brandt 2018). To the best of my knowledge, no research has been conducted on how teachers manage the evolving contingency of classroom interaction in EMI classrooms. More research is needed to study the interactional management of unexpected contingencies in a broader range of classroom types. Moreover, van Lier (1996) original conceptualization of teacher contingency only focuses on the verbal utterances that are uttered on the spot, which fails to acknowledge the diverse resources that teachers can draw on for responding to unscripted actions in contingent situations. In this paper, I aim to adopt translanguaging as an analytical perspective in order to reconceptualize the notion of teacher contingency as a process of translanguaging. In order to do so, I examine how an EMI history teacher orchestrates available linguistic and multimodal resources to contingently address the unexpected actions in the classroom and respond to uninvited student initiatives during the classroom interactions in order to maximize learning opportunities and promote student engagement.

# Translanguaging in EMI classrooms

The Welsh-inspired term translanguaging was originally coined to describe a pedagogical practice of switching between different input and output languages in bilingual classrooms (Williams 1994). Li (2018) further shapes the concept of translanguaging as a process of knowledge construction which involves going beyond different linguistic structures and systems (i.e. not only different languages and dialects, but also styles, registers, and other variations in language use) and different modalities (e.g. switching between speaking and writing, or coordinating gestures, body movements, facial expressions, and visual images). Li (2018) discusses that translanguaging goes beyond what has been termed code-switching since code-switching perceives each language as a separate linguistic system. In other words, translanguaging goes beyond the narrow focus on linguistic structures, and it emphasizes the meaning-making process which entails the speakers making use of their multilingual and multimodal repertoires both strategically and spontaneously in an integrated manner without focussing on ‘languages’ as distinct and separate codes.

The act of translanguaging is transformative in nature as it creates a translanguaging space for multilinguals by bringing together different sociocultural dimensions, including the speakers’ social identities, life histories, beliefs, and their knowledge of the wider institutional environment, as resources in the process of negotiation of meaning (Li 2011). Translanguaging space enables speakers to bring their funds of knowledge to the forefront, including their linguistic knowledge, cultural, and life experiences, to creatively express their ideas and facilitate learning. Some EMI scholars (e.g. Lo and Macaro 2012; Macaro 2018) argue that the objective of EMI is to create authentic communicative contexts for the use of English (i.e. the target L2) and leads to a higher English proficiency while concurrently achieving content learning. Hence, it is necessary for content teachers to limit their L1 use in order to create an English-speaking environment for students to acquire a complete knowledge of English (Pun and Macaro 2019). However, the theoretical perspective of translanguaging challenges this assumption. With its emphasis on meaning-making and knowledge construction, language is considered as inseparable from other cognitive and semiotic systems (Tai and Brandt 2018). Hence, translanguaging equalizes the status of languages spoken in the classroom, and it aims to capture how multilinguals strategically and creatively employ multiple multilingual and semiotic resources to mediate complex social and cognitive activities, such as teaching and learning.

There are a number of research studies that investigate the construction of translanguaging spaces in EMI classrooms. Tai and Li (2020) illustrate the ways the EMI mathematics teacher construct an integrated translanguaging space by bringing in the students’ everyday life space into the EMI institutional learning space in order to turn the classroom into a lived experience. This allows the teacher and students to bring their funds of knowledge to the forefront which makes the content knowledge more relatable and relevant to the students’ everyday life experiences. Alternatively, Tai and Li (2021a) illuminate the potential of playful talk in transforming the EMI classroom into a translanguaging space, which allows the teacher to bring in various linguistic and multimodal resources and different kinds of knowledge to perform a range of creative acts for facilitating content learning and promoting meaning communication. Furthermore, Tai and Li (2021b) argue that translanguaging creates a space for co-learning, and co-learning allows the teacher and students to learn from each other, which facilitates equity in knowledge construction and recognizes students’ various knowledge in the classroom. In a recent study by Tai and Li (2021c), I have shown how the EMI mathematics teacher’s use of the iPad extends his semiotic and spatial repertoire for constructing a technology-mediated space in the mathematics classroom for multilingual minority ethnic students. Tai (2022) aims to reconceptualize the notion of inclusive pedagogical practices and he argues that the process of enacting inclusive practices is a process of translanguaging which requires the EMI mathematics and science teacher to mobilize various available resources and draw on what students know collectively for promoting inclusion in the classrooms and transcending cultural boundaries from the students’ everyday culture to cultures of school science and mathematics.

The present study aims to contribute to the current literature on translanguaging and EMI teaching and learning by adopting translanguaging as an analytical perspective to reconceptualize the notion of teacher contingency as a process of translanguaging. This enables teachers to manage unexpected or unplanned events in the classroom interactions contingently through mobilizing different available resources.

# Data and method

The participating school is a prestigious EMI secondary school in HK and it offers provides education from secondary one to six based on the curriculum guides set by the HK Education Bureau. The school uses EMI to deliver most of the lessons, and the school examinations are conducted in English (except for Chinese, liberal studies, and Putonghua). Although the school’s mission statement explicitly states the aim to develop students to be multilinguals, the school language policy places heavy emphasis on the use of English on the school campus in order to create a rich English learning environment for all students. For instance, all morning assemblies and staff meetings are conducted in English. Moreover, English-for-all-day is held every Monday where everyone (all teaching staff and students) in school must use English for communication in order to prepare students to interact effectively with other individuals from other countries. The choice of this school as the site of this research is due to the fact that I was a former student of this school and I have good knowledge about the organisational structure of the school and the school curriculum.

The history teacher has taught for more than 21 years in the school and he serves as Head of History at the school. He was my mentor when I was a student, and he was keen to be a research participant in order to enrich his teaching repertoire. He is a native speaker of Cantonese and he can speak fluent English. He has a limited level of Mandarin/Putonghua and Japanese proficiency. He attended an EMI school for his own secondary and university education. He majored in History and minored in Chinese Language and Literature and Japanese Studies during his undergraduate studies. He often attended professional development programmes that were offered by the Education Bureau in order to enhance his knowledge of history pedagogy and special educational needs.

A semi-structured interview was carried out with the teacher in order to understand his perceptions of best practices and his attitudes towards using multiple languages in the EMI mathematics classrooms. During the 2-month ethnography, I observed a year 7 history class. The class had 30 students and according to the teacher, the students’ English proficiency was below average among their cohort in the internal English examination. Since the teacher taught all year 7 history classes, he noticed that their general academic performance was also below average. The year 7 students in this class were all 13-year-old. A total of eleven 30-min lessons were observed and video-recorded. Ethnographic interviews were conducted with the teacher and students during the 2-month observational period in order to gain detailed information about the observed lessons. A post-video-stimulated-recall interview was conducted with the teacher in order to make sense of his interpretations of his actual translanguaging practices.

This study integrates MCA and IPA to study the constructions of translanguaging practices in EMI history lessons. MCA ‘focuses on how social order is co-constructed by the members of a social group’ (Brouwer and Wagner 2004: 30) through fine-grained analysis of the social interaction. It takes an emic/participant-relevant approach (Markee and Kasper 2004) in order to explicate the detailed process of how social actions, such as teaching and learning, are co-organized and achieved through talk-in-interaction. The data are transcribed using Jefferson (2004) and Mondada (2018) transcription conventions. MCA allows researchers to analyze naturally occurring interaction and every minute detail ‘is considered relevant in uncovering participant orientations toward the interaction’ (Waring 2008: 580). Adopting the emic perspective in analyzing the classroom interaction requires the researchers to ground the research focus based on the recordings of the interactions without referring to the external factors unacknowledged by the participants in order to develop an emic understanding of the classroom interaction. In other words, the identifications of the translanguaging instances are derived from the examination of the corpus of EMI lessons and they are not in any sense defined a priori.

The framework of IPA is also employed to examine how the history teacher makes sense of his own pedagogical practices at specific moments in the interaction and how the classroom interactions are shaped by multiple sociocultural factors. IPA acknowledges the investigation of the meanings of the participants’ experiences as an interpretative enterprise on the part of both researcher and participants. A dual interpretation process called ‘double hermeneutic’ is involved and this requires researchers to take an emic approach in order to make sense of the participants trying to make sense of their world (Smith et al. 2013).

# Analysis

In the dataset, four instances are identified which demonstrate how the teacher contingently draws on available multilingual and multimodal resources to respond to unexpected outcomes that arise in the classroom interactions. Extracts 1, 2, and 3 are typical examples which illuminate this interactional phenomenon.

# Extract 1: Responding to a student-initiated question

During the previous lesson, the teacher (T) was introducing the Ancient Egypt’s most iconic treasure—the great golden face mask to the students. T explained the different features of the masks, including the nemes, vulture, and cobra, and explained the representations of these features. Student 2 self-initiated a question and he asked T whether there are any particular meanings of the false bread. Such information was not covered on the PowerPoint or the history textbook. T then prepared a PowerPoint slide and planned to address student 2’s question in the next lesson. In this extract, T attempts to provide an appropriate answer in order to respond to student 2’s response, which was 3 days after the lesson containing this extract. In line 9, T directs students’ attention to the PowerPoint slide which includes a figure of the mask of Tutankhamun and a short introduction of the mask (figure #1).

From lines 10–18, T makes use of the PowerPoint slide that he prepared in advance and he reminds the students to pay attention to the nemes which refers to the ‘golden mask’ (line 12). T further explains that the mask ‘symbolizes er the pharaoh as the god’ (line 18) and ‘his power’ (line 20). In line 22, T pre-empts student 2’s question to the class in order to invite students to attend to the feature of the golden mask that is not being introduced before. In line 24, T asks student 2 to confirm the nature of the question as he turns his body facing student 2 and utters a question tag ‘is it?’ in line 24. Concurrently, T picks up a binder clip from his desk, places the clip near his mic, and touches it several times (figure #3) in order to invite student 2 to evaluate the accuracy of T’s interpretation of S2’s question. Here, it is evidenced that T contingently utilizes the object (i.e. binder clip) which is available on his desk to visually represent the false bread of the mask. The meaning of this visual representation becomes clear to the students as T utters ‘er the false bread are here’ (line 26) and T displays additional content on the screen which includes the term ‘false beard’ and a short definition (‘symbolising wisdom’) during the 0.5-second pause (line 27, figure #4). These actions evince that the binder clip that is placed near T’s mic represents the Pharaoh’s false bread.

In line 28, T confirms with the students that the false bread represents wisdom, ‘I er checked er it means wisdom’. In lines 29–30, T again places the binder clip near his mic and touches the clip continuously (lines 30–32, figure #5). Despite repeating the fact that the bread represents wisdom, no student offers any response to T’s explanation. This is evidenced in the 0.5-second pause in line 33 and this motivates T to switch to Cantonese as he says, ‘er (0.3) pharaoh 嘅智慧 啦 (his wisdom)’ and simultaneously pointing at his temple (figure #6). Here, T employs both L1 Cantonese and hand gestures to illustrate the meaning of wisdom to the students. Such actions eventually lead to a student uptake as student 14 utters ‘okay wo’ to confirm his understanding of T’s explanation.

In this extract, it is revealed that T does not only make use of the visual image and the written texts on the PowerPoint slides that he previously prepared for explaining the symbolism of the false beard. T also contingently utilizes the binder clip to symbolically represent the false beard of the Pharoah’s golden mask and also employs L1 Cantonese and hand gestures (i.e. pointing at his own temple) to respond to student 2’s question. During the video-stimulated-recall-interview, the researcher is interested to understand why T deliberately chooses to pick up the binder clip as the available resource for facilitating his explanation:

After watching the video-clip, T comments that he is inspired by student 2’s question about the symbolism of the false beard, which motivates him to prepare a PowerPoint slide to talk about the different features of the golden mask. T acknowledges that these kinds of information are not included in the junior history curriculum. By offering supplementary knowledge to other students in class, T hopes to expand the students’ historical knowledge base (line 2). T further suggests that he contingently selects something random from the teacher’s desk without paying too much attention to it. It can be argued that T contingently employs the binder clip as an available resource and utilizes it to facilitate his explanation. As evidenced in the MCA analysis, T puts on the image of the golden face mask on the PowerPoint. At the same time, T spontaneously picks up the binder clip from the teacher’s desk and puts the clip near his mic in order to represent the Pharaoh’s false bread. This enables students to understand the meaning of the false beard.

Furthermore, T recognizes the need for EMI teachers to contingently select the most appropriate linguistic and semiotic resources in order to enable students to understand the teacher’s content explanation (line 4). This is also illustrated in the MCA analysis when T unwittingly employs L1 Cantonese and points at his temple simultaneously to explain the false beard as a symbol of Pharaoh’s wisdom.

# Extract 2: Contingently creating an imaginary scenario for explaining content knowledge

Prior to the extract, T was introducing the definition of the primary source to the students, and he presented the definition via PowerPoint. T then offered an additional explanation of the meaning of primary sources to ensure that all students could understand this concept. However, no students responded to T’s explanations and there were no signs of students’ uptake. In this extract, T contingently deals with no responses from students by constructing an imaginary scenario of a murder case. By doing so, T aims to invite students to think about what kind of primary sources the detective need to collect in order to solve the case.

In line 15, T verbally constructs an if-clause to invite the whole class to think about the evidence that they need to solve a murder case. Particularly, T complements the new referent ‘evidence’ with his use of iconic gestures as he places his left-hand upward and moves his left-hand slightly to his left-hand-side (figure #8) when uttering ‘find out the evidences’. This potentially allows students to imagine that T is holding ‘evidence’ in his hand. As no student responds to T’s question, T attempts to check students’ understanding of the meaning of ‘evidence’ in line 17. Although student 1 utters ‘yes’ to claim her knowledge, she does not explain the meaning of ‘evidence’. This motivates T to switch to Cantonese and utter ‘ (evidence)’ twice in order to emphasize the meaning of the word so that he can carry on with his elicitation of student responses in lines 24 and 26. Here, it is noticeable that T only switches to Cantonese when students display little comprehension of the word ‘evidence’. This minimal use of L1 as the last resort is widely criticized by scholars who advocate for extensive and systematic translanguaging to expand students’ linguistic repertoire (e.g. Garcia and Li 2014; Probyn 2015). In line 26, T switches back to English and rephrases the if-clause. Concurrently, he rises up his left-hand again by cupping his hand as if holding a round object (figure #9) and shaking his fist in order to construct the same imaginary context of a detective was solving a murder case. Due to the lack of student responses, T initiates another question by asking students: ‘what kind of sources you think it’s really useful’ (line 29) and rephrases the if-clause in line 31 with the hope that the students will respond to T.

Although student 8 offers a response ‘ingredient’ to T, such a response is not considered as preferred as signalled by T’s repeat of S8’s response in raising intonation (line 35) and his attempt to seek for other responses from the class in line 39. Despite T’s call for additional responses from the class, the students are unable to offer any appropriate answers, as shown in lines 41 and 43–44. This motivates T to initiate a designedly incomplete utterance (DIU) in order to encourage students to come up with a sensible answer. In line 46, T first raises his intonation and utters his DIU in a louder voice, ‘WHEN KILLING A PEOPLE THEY need a’. Simultaneously T’s gestural actions facilitate the creation of an imaginary context. T clenches his fist, raises his right-hand, and moves it downward repeatedly (figures #11 and #12) in line 46 which represents the action of killing a person with a knife. Here, it is noticeable that T’s uses of intonation, sound volume, and gestures enable him to create an embodied enactment of an imaginary murder scenario (Tai and Brandt 2018) for encouraging all students to think from the detective’s perspective. However, T’s DIU is not being filled by any student during the 0.2-second pause (line 47) which potentially implies that the students feel confused about T’s question. This requires T to repair his question: ‘maybe er they need what kind of things’ (line 48) to invite student participation and familiarize them with the detective’s ways of thinking. In line 50, student 12 eventually says ‘gun’ and T positively acknowledges student 12’s answer by first pointing at student 12 and then offering the correct answer to students: ‘the tools they used’ (line 57). It is noticed that T raises his clenched fist as he utters ‘for example’ (line 54). This gesture symbolizes the ‘tools’ and T deliberately raises it up so that all students can imagine T holding the tools for killing a person (line 54). At the same time, student 1 repeats her response ‘weapon’ which emphasizes the alternative answer to T’s question in lines 46 and 48. In line 57, T turns to the blackboard and writes down the answer (‘tools/weapons’) on the blackboard (line 59) so that all students can make a note of it. Note that T takes the chance to recognize student 1’s contribution in line 55 by writing down ‘weapon’ on the blackboard and repeating the word ‘weapon’ twice in line 61. By doing so, T acknowledges the value of students’ contributions to the whole-class discussion, an important feature for promoting inclusive practices in the classroom (Chan and Lo 2017).

In drawing students’ attention to the subject-specific knowledge, T explains that the tools and weapons are ‘used by the people at↑ that↑ time↑’ (line 63). The phrase ‘at↑ that↑ time↑’ is repeated twice and it is heavily emphasized with stress and raising intonation. Additionally, T points at his back and continuously shakes his index finger to indicate the past time frame. Here, T’s gesture which indicates past events is synchronized with the phrase ‘at that time’. As shown, T repeats doing the same gesture and saying the same phrase in line 65. The self-repeated gesture (Hauser, 2019) and the use of other paralinguistic features, like intonation and stress, enable students to grasp the fact that primary sources are sources that are previously used by people ‘at↑ that↑ time↑ of the events happened’ (line 65). In line 67, T concludes his explanation by linking it with the historical term ‘primary source’. It is noticeable that T points his index finger upwards and he slightly moves his finger forward as he utters ‘that’s’ with stress in order to emphasize the definition of the primary source to all students. Such an emphasis is also verbally repeated in line 69.

In this extract, T attempts to expand students’ content knowledge by contingently creating an imaginary context of a murder scene through the deployment of linguistic, paralinguistic, and multimodal resources. T initiates guided questions and DIUs and uses subject-specific language in whole-class interaction in order to develop students’ subject-specific ways of thinking and draw their attention to the ways of explaining ‘primary source’ in the study of history as a discipline. During the video-stimulated-recall-interview, T is asked to comment on his motivation in creating an imaginary context at this moment of the interaction:

T explains that the concepts of primary and secondary sources are abstract and difficult and there are lots of extensive debates about the distinction between primary and secondary sources at the university level. Hence, in order to deepen students’ understanding of these concepts, T believes that using a murder case as an example can help all students to find the concepts more relatable to their everyday life knowledge. By doing so, T is bringing outside knowledge (Tai and Li 2020) into the history classroom to engage student participation and deepen students’ content learning. In particular, T uses a simile to justify his belief that historians are similar to detectives who look for the truth, ‘即係好似啲historical 都好似 detective 咁樣去 find out the truth (historians are like detectives to find out the truth)’. This can explain why T in the classroom interaction attempts to initiate various DIUs and questions in the form of if-clause to encourage all students to think about primary and secondary sources from a detective’s perspective. In doing so, T is potentially developing students’ disciplinespecific ways of thinking like a detective during whole-class interaction.

Based on the MCA analysis, the researcher also notes how T utilizes various paralinguistic features, such as stress, intonation, and gestures when constructing a question: ‘WHEN KILLING A PEOPLE’. The researcher is interested to know more about teacher B’s perception of his own translanguaging practices. T emphasizes that he needs to look for an alternative approach to engage his students when students are not responding to his questions. It is possible that the students in the class generally have lower academic ability, and therefore there is a need for T to cater to all students’ needs through repairing his question in order to ensure that they can all be on the same page. T further explains that limited lesson time is a factor that prevents students from coming up with an appropriate answer to respond to his questions and DIUs. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all secondary schools must adjust the amount of lesson time for each subject. At this school, T only had 30 min to carry out his teaching. Thus, it is necessary for T to be strategic in deploying available resources to ensure that all students can understand the abstract historical concepts within a limited time.

# Extract 3: Contingently inviting the researcher into the classroom

I now present a case that deviates from the standard practice illustrated in Extracts 1–2. In this extract, T spontaneously uses the researcher, an observer in the class, as an example to consolidate students’ understanding of primary and secondary sources. Prior to the extract, T was explaining what secondary sources mean and the nature of different sources, such as written and non-written sources. He presented examples of secondary sources to the students through PowerPoint. On the PowerPoint, it listed out the following examples: history books, documentaries, research essays, and chronicles (see figure #13). T then defined the meaning of ‘documentaries’ to students. At the beginning of this extract, T attempts to explain what ‘research essays’ are.

After explaining what documentaries mean (line 1), T moves on and explains the meaning of ‘research essay’. T includes the researcher for doing the explanation and he first points at the researcher while inviting students to attend to what the researcher is doing: ‘just like (NAMEResearcher) ah doing’ (line 3). Since, the students in the class are aware that the researcher is here to collect video data for his research project, using the researcher as an example to explain ‘research essay’ is an easy way to convey the meaning clearly to the students. T initially aims to explain to students the things that the researcher needs to search (line 7). However, T abruptly terminates the formulation of the sentence and he points at the researcher (line 8) and utters ‘tell me’ with a strong emphasis in order to draw the students’ attention to the researcher again and projects that a question will be initiated by T (line 9).

In line 11, T extends all his fingers and points at the researcher (figure #14) while verbally stating that the researcher is ‘making um recording my lesson’. While T utters the word ‘recording’, a couple of students turn around and look at the video camera which demonstrates that some students show understanding of T’s question. T continues to point at the researcher (figure #15) and asks students to identify the source that the researcher is collecting (lines 13–17). Several students utter ‘primary’ (line 18) which is accepted by T as he utters ‘eh!’ and nods at the students (line 20). T initiates a follow-up question and T puts emphasis on the words ‘written’ and ‘non-written’ as he says: ‘it’s written↑ or non↑ written↑ sources’, in order to reinforce the necessity for classifying the nature of the primary source (line 20). As evidenced in lines 22, 24, and 26, students display their understanding and enunciate ‘non’, which is acknowledged by T in line 28. Particularly, T raises his fingers and cups his hand as if holding a round object when he utters ‘video is a non written’. Hence, the gesture figuratively represents that T is holding up the videos, which allows T to reinforce the object video as a non-written source.

In this extract, T utilizes English utterances and gestural motions to contingently include the researcher into the classroom interaction to engage students’ learning and assist them to understand the meaning of ‘research essay’ and the fact about video data as a primary nonwritten source. During the video-stimulated-recall-interview, the researcher is interested to understand the purpose of bringing him into the lesson:

Involving the author into the classroom interaction provides T with the opportunity to draw students’ attention and facilitate the explanation of the secondary source and different features of sources, including written or non-written sources. In the interview, T states that he spontaneously thought about using the author as an example to explain primary and secondary sources to the students. He believes that bringing the author into the interaction can ‘catch them back’ (line 4 in the interview), a smile that is employed to emphasize the importance of engaging students’ attention in class. Such a pedagogical strategy successfully draws students’ attention. This is evidenced in the MCA analysis since it reveals that a couple of students turn around and gaze at the video camera when T asks students to identify the feature of a video-recording (line 11).

Additionally, it can be argued that through bringing the researcher into the classroom interaction, T creates a translanguaging space for enabling T to engage students in learning the features of primary and secondary sources. T and the researcher believe that using the researcher’s data collection as an example is convenient in terms of helping students to grasp the ways of classifying the nature of different sources, such as written or non-written sources. T further adds that the existence of the video camera in the classroom allows him to convey a message to the students that video or oral data are a source for investigating a subject. As evidenced in the MCA analysis, students are able to accurately respond to T’s questions about video-recording as a primary or secondary source and video-recording as a written or non-written source. This displays their understanding of the kinds of sources that the researcher is collecting for his research project.

# Discussion and conclusion

This study has revealed how an EMI history teacher contingently draws on relevant multilingual and multimodal resources for responding to unexpected students’ initiatives or reacting to a lack of student engagement in classroom interactions. Extract 1 demonstrates how the EMI history teacher spontaneously responds to student 2’s question about the symbolism of the Pharaoh’s false beard. The teacher picks up a binder clip from the desk and positions it below his chin when he is verbally explaining the symbolism of the Pharaoh’s false beard. At that moment, the clip is momentarily represented as the Pharaoh’s false beard, which enables students to understand what the teacher is referring to. The teacher also employs other linguistic and semiotic resources, including L1 Cantonese and hand gestures, to facilitate his verbal explanation. Extract 2, on the other hand, demonstrates how the teacher contingently deals with no responses from students in the class through creating an imaginary context of a murder case to facilitate students’ understanding of the concept of primary source. Extract 2 reveals how the teacher constructs an imaginary murder scene by using various resources, including loud voice, intonation, Cantonese and English utterances, and gestural actions. Such a creation of an imaginary context allows students to understand the kind of items that can be considered as ‘primary sources’ in a murder scene. Extract 3 differs from Extracts 1 and 2 and it is a deviant case which shows how the teacher deploys English utterances and gestural motions, particularly pointing at the researcher, to contingently bring the researcher into the classroom interaction. This affords the teacher to use the researcher’s project as an example for eliciting students’ responses regarding the kind of data that the researcher is collecting.

This paper has demonstrated that the EMI teacher’s contingent responses are more than simply verbal utterances. Prior studies (e.g. Baynham 2006; Jacknick 2011; Waring 2011) only focus on the L2 teacher’s contingent verbal utterances, which fail to take into account the diverse linguistic, multimodal, and spatial resources that teachers employ in constructing their contingent actions. It is argued that teacher contingency does not only involve teacher constructing verbal utterances on the spot. Rather, it also entails teachers choosing the available multilingual and multimodal resources on the spot to construct pedagogical actions, with the aim of managing instructional efficacy and facilitating students’ learning opportunities. This is reflected in the video-stimulated-recall-interview data which demonstrate the teacher’s open attitude towards flexible use of language and multimodal resources in the EMI history classroom to contingently respond to students’ initiatives (Table 1), lack of engagement from students (Table 2), and facilitate his explanation of primary and secondary sources (Tables 2 and 3) for students to learn the historical knowledge. Therefore, teacher contingency should be viewed in a more social and complex way by seeing it in relation to other entanglements, including materials (e.g. objects), environment (e.g. classroom context), and topics (e.g. academic knowledge). I further argue that the process of how the teacher contingently deals with unscripted incidents that arise in classroom interactions is a process of translanguaging. In other words, when teachers are being contingent, they need to select the most appropriate resources that they think are meaningful for their needs at the moment of the interaction.

This study yields a number of pedagogical implications regarding being contingent in managing unscripted incidents that arise in real-time classroom interaction. Allwright (1980: 182) explains that teachers are placed in a difficult position since they need to decide how and when to respond to student uninvited responses, realizing that rejection ‘may suggest an unwillingness to allow real communication in the classroom, while to accept it means a disruption of the lesson plan’. Nevertheless, this study suggests that it is important for EMI teachers to pay close attention to student initiatives and incorporate them into the lesson agenda to promote learning opportunities through creating a translanguaging space for students to seek and contribute to the understanding of various issues. Moreover, teachers should also acknowledge the reality of EMI teaching as responding to some uninvited learner’s contribution or unexpected outcomes spontaneously and recognize learners as co-participants in constructing the classroom interaction. Thus, opportunities for constructing a translanguaging space (Li, 2011) in the classroom eventually depend on the EMI teacher’s ability to harness the available linguistic, semiotics, and spatial repertoires contingently in order to achieve his/her pedagogical goals at the moment of the interaction. Although this study has demonstrated the EMI history teacher’s ability in utilising translanguaging contingently to manage unexpected classroom events, there is a need for teachers to consider whether translanguaging in the classroom will be effective in various classroom environments as this will ‘depend on the socio-political and historical environment in which such practice is embedded and the local ecologies of schools and classrooms’ (Creese and Blackledge, 2010: 107). Recent research studies have revealed that translanguaging may not be perceived by classroom participants as a transformative pedagogical practice tool for honouring linguistic diversity in multilingual classrooms (see Charalambous et al., 2016; Allard, 2017). Thus, opportunities for constructing a translanguaging space (Li, 2011) in the classroom eventually depend on 1) the EMI teacher’s ability to harness the available linguistic, semiotics and spatial repertoires contingently in order to achieve his/her pedagogical goals at the moment of the interaction, as well as, 2) the teacher’s consideration of the classroom norms and the predominant discourses in the particular classroom contexts in order to avoid resulting in negative influences on students’ learning processes.

The findings of this study contribute to the current literature on translanguaging and EMI teaching and learning in several ways. In particular, the findings show that translanguaging expands the EMI teacher’s choice and agency for utilizing diverse linguistic and multimodal resources for constructing his contingent actions. The teacher’s translanguaging practices shape the classroom talk which creates a more dynamic and contingent classroom environment to facilitate students’ participation (Baynham 2006; Waring 2009). Methodologically, this study demonstrates how adopting a translanguaging perspective can allow researchers to focus on the way how and why the EMI teacher employs diverse multilingual, multimodal, multisemiotic, and multisensory sign-making resources for making learning accessible for all students in the classroom (Li, 2020). Adopting translanguaging as an analytical perspective in analyzing EMI classroom interaction data allows us to demonstrate that the process of the teacher being contingent is a process of translanguaging (Tai and Li 2021a; Tai 2022) and it offers the teacher the opportunity to mould the lesson to students’ needs as a way to promote learning opportunities in the classroom. The findings also draw attention to the importance of raising EMI teachers’ awareness of how they can use translanguaging as a pedagogical resource to respond to unexpected outcomes contingently within sequences of talk, and how their responses affect the subsequent students’ turns. The findings can potentially help EMI teachers to reflect on their own classroom interactional practices and motivates them to make adjustments to their current pedagogical practices in order to facilitate learning opportunities in their classrooms.
