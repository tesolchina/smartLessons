# ABSTRACT

Amidst the intensified discourse surrounding universities’ societal impact, social innovation and entrepreneurship (SIE) has emerged as a way to refocus universities’ engagement in sustainable development, particularly through their core mission of teaching and learning. Growing interest in SIE education over the decades has led to a proliferation of courses and programs offered in various disciplines by universities worldwide. Nevertheless, scholarly research unpacking the SIE educational processes remains scant and lacks multidisciplinary perspectives. Educators of SIE continue to face challenges in designing curricula and adopting appropriate teaching approaches. This study fills this gap by offering ample empirical evidence based on a documentary analysis of 53 syllabi from 43 distinctive courses accompanied by interviews with the academics responsible for the design of these courses across all eight publicly funded universities in Hong Kong. The analysis identifies multiple patterns within two major themes: the changing scope and positioning of SIE education and the varying orientations of SIE curricula. The findings provide valuable insights and identify areas for further exploration for the design of impactful SIE learning experiences for students. Furthermore, by situating the examination of SIE teaching and learning within the lens of curriculum theory, this study establishes a foundation for future research to undertake systematic and rigorous comparative analyses of curricula in diverse contexts.

# Introduction

As society’s attention has increasingly turned toward addressing social and environmental issues and achieving global sustainable development goals, social innovation and entrepreneurship (SIE) has gained growing recognition from the public and supported by business leaders and political administrations worldwide (Murray, Caulier-Grice, and Mulgan 2010). SIE considers the creation of new products, services, and models that have the potential to meet some of the most pressing social needs affecting societies at local, national, and global levels, such as poverty alleviation, and to promote the creation of new social relationships between key stakeholders. These relationships may both have positive effects on society and enhance society’s capacity to act (Mulgan 2012). SIE is also considered by many scholars to be an essential and strategic means for achieving sustainable development (e.g. Diepenmaat, Kemp, and Velter 2020).

In academia, the surge in publications on ‘social innovation’ and/or ‘social entrepreneurship’ across disciplines suggests increasing recognition of SIE as a field of study for mainstream scholarship and education (Phillips et al. 2015). University-based SIE education emerged at the confluence of the broader historical context of universities’ societal engagement and the growing pressures of the higher education market (Godonoga and Sporn 2023). While the economic impact of universities is undisputed and is often conceptualized through the ‘entrepreneurial university’ and helix innovation frameworks (Etzkowitz, Dzisah, and Clouser 2022), the social impact of universities remains unclear. Scholars have recently questioned the over-emphasis on the commercial sense of knowledge and technology transfer and advocated for more inclusive models of quadruple and quintuple helices to incorporate civil society and the environment (Morawska-Jancelewicz 2022). Within the framework of today’s complex societal challenges, there have been growing discussions about the need to integrate SIE into the core of university processes (Bayuo, Chaminade, and Göransson 2020). SIE education can be a pivotal mechanism for reorienting universities’ societal engagement toward sustainable development, particularly through the avenues of teaching and learning (Carl and Menter 2021).

Several reports have demonstrated the significant progress of SIE educational programs in higher education institutions in the last few decades. Nicholls (2011) identified three phases in patterns of development of SIE education in the US: pioneers, consolidators, and new arrivals. The first centers were founded at Harvard University and Stanford University in the 1990s. These pioneering universities began to explore the subject, focusing on practical analyses of case studies, practitionerfacing events, and policy development. About a decade later, the consolidators followed, institutionalizing the research and study of the concept in new university centers and programs, especially in business schools. Finally, the new arrivals mainstreamed SIE teaching and research into a range of traditional disciplines and established academic structures. Similar characteristics have also been observed globally. According to Kim and Leu (2011), the development of university-based SIE education started with courses offered by graduate schools of business, and later by schools of government and public policy in leading global universities. Soon, programs became more interdisciplinary and ‘embedded,’ serving both undergraduates and graduates across disciplines and moving outward from leading global universities to become institutionalized at universities worldwide. Thus, what was a niche concept decades ago has become mainstream and perceived as necessary in an increasingly competitive higher education market (Carl and Menter 2021; Godonoga and Sporn 2023).

However, in contrast to the proliferation of SIE programs in universities, research on their educational processes remains scant and scattered (Bayuo, Chaminade, and Göransson 2020). Most related studies have conducted research at the conceptual and macro levels, such as identifying the institutional forces that drive the emergence of SIE education at universities, conceptualizing the various ways in which universities can engage in SIE (e.g. Benneworth and Cunha 2015), or outlining courses and programs offered on university campuses (e.g. Skoll Foundation 2017). Several analyses of syllabi and teaching documents have been done, but most of these have been dominated by data from the business disciplines, and cross-disciplinary perspectives are lacking (e.g. Miller, Wesley, and Williams 2012). SIE courses and programs were initially begun in business schools, but their content and skillset have been increasingly expanded, used, and needed across sectors. Calls have been made for a review of curricula and course content toward a multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary orientation of SIE education (Bayuo, Chaminade, and Göransson 2020). More scholarly research is needed to explore the nature of SIE education and its teaching and learning processes, especially as the choice of curriculum content and topics has consistently been a considerable challenge for SIE educators (Azqueta, Sanz-Ponce, and Núñez-Canal 2023).

Considering the developing popularity of SIE education and the knowledge gap discussed above, in this study, we aim to answer the following research question: how do university programs structure SIE course offerings, and what are these SIE courses teaching? As SIE education brings together academics and practitioners from diverse disciplines with different perspectives, interpretations, and expertise, it is crucial to understand the fundamental nature of the curriculum. This understanding is vital for achieving coherence among the individual teaching and learning decisions made by educators. Therefore, this paper advances knowledge about SIE education by examining university-based SIE courses in multiple disciplines through the theoretical lens of curriculum theory (Ellis 2013; Schiro

2013). Curriculum theory enables the conceptualization of the essence of SIE education within a rich variety of disciplines, informing educators on the aim, content, and approach of SIE course design. This study focuses on universities in Hong Kong, a global city that is internationally connected, has a capitalist mindset, is marked by income inequality, and is a place where North American, European, and East Asian cultures meet (Postiglione 2013). Universities in Hong Kong cater to both local and non-local students, have an international academic staff, and are constantly represented at the top of university world rankings, and thus, they are role models for other universities in the region and worldwide (Lo 2015).

Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, several studies have identified diverse conceptualizations of SIE in curriculum design (e.g. Alden Rivers, Nie, and Armellini 2015), which lead to variations in the structuring and development of courses. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, no empirical study has examined the curriculum design and planning of SIE courses. Furthermore, no studies have used the critical lens of curriculum theory. This paper contributes to the literature by conducting a comprehensive analysis of syllabi developed by academics. This is accomplished through qualitative document analysis and is supplemented with semi-structured interviews with the same academics to triangulate the secondary data. Second, this paper presents a cross-disciplinary and cross-time analysis of SIE education among Hong Kong universities. The analysis shows the development trajectories, evolving discourses, and diverse emphases of SIE education. It provides higher education educators, leaders, and policymakers with a spectrum of ways to foster critical and socially innovative learners. Most importantly, it enables universities to make substantial contributions to sustainable development by reconceptualizing teaching and learning with SIE (Bayuo, Chaminade, and Göransson 2020). Third, by anchoring the examination of SIE teaching and learning within curriculum theory, this paper establishes a foundation for future researchers to conduct systematic and rigorous comparative analyses of curricula in diverse contexts (as recommended by Lam 2022).

# SIE in Hong Kong society and universities

The study of university-based SIE education in Hong Kong is valuable given the unique combination of characteristics of Hong Kong’s society, higher education, and SIE development. Higher education in Hong Kong, with its top global rankings and a cultural mix of the Eastern and the Western, has been recognized as one of the most competitive systems worldwide (Postiglione 2013). Hong Kong is one of the wealthiest yet most polarized societies in the developed world, and it faces severe social challenges (Chan, Chui, and Chandra 2022). Hong Kong’s social innovation ecosystem emerged in the early 2000s with strong public sector support (CUHK 2014). Increasingly, there has been greater awareness and recognition of innovators who ‘seek to develop solutions and organizational models that focus on sustainability, scalability and social impact’ (Cheung and Fung 2017, 14). The Hong Kong government established a SIE Fund in 2013 to promote further cross-sector engagement of innovative solutions and a more socially innovative and entrepreneurial-focused mindset in Hong Kong. Although there have been debates over the impact of the SIE Fund, scholars have agreed on its instrumental role in driving the emergence of the first batch of SIE education programs in Hong Kong universities (Hazenberg et al. 2019). Since the establishment of the fund, all eight of Hong Kong’s publicly funded universities have rolled out various SIE educational offerings. SIE ecosystem development in many Asian economies is emergent, and interest in SIE education among Asian universities is on the rise, led by Hong Kong’s example (Han and Lee 2020). However, although universities have raced to integrate SIE education, little is known about the frontline of teaching and learning, including aims, contents, approaches, and evaluations. There is a need to unpack the ‘black box’ of SIE teaching and learning processes.

# Curriculum theory as the theoretical lens

According to Tyler (2013), four fundamental questions must be answered in developing any curriculum and plan of instruction: (1) What educational purposes should the school seek to attain? (2) What educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes? (3) How can these educational experiences be effectively organized? (4) How can we determine that these purposes are being attained? These questions have influenced the development of analytical frameworks for examining entrepreneurship education and SIE education (Mir Shahid and Alarifi 2021).

Although educators hold implicit views about the purpose of education and have different perspectives on the appropriate features of the curriculum, these perspectives are essentially shaped by curriculum ideologies that prioritize different goals, objectives, approaches, and outcomes for education (Ellis 2013). Schiro (2013, 11) compared and synthesized different curriculum classification schemes and proposed four curriculum ideologies: scholar academic, social efficiency, learner-centered, and social reconstruction. Each of these curriculum ideologies carries its own set of assumptions and hypotheses regarding learning aims, curricular focus, teaching approaches, and evaluation.

The scholar academic ideology aims to enhance students’ intellectual capacities and cognitive skills. Curricula emphasize the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and concepts from the traditional academic disciplines. Separate courses demand scholar-teachers who are experts on their subject matter and who can guide the intellectual development of students in their disciplines. Evaluation typically involves examining students’ mastery of subject matter, adherence to traditional academic standards, and ability to apply knowledge in real-world contexts.

The social efficiency ideology takes a more pragmatic orientation and aims to prepare students for future employment and to promote practical skills that are relevant to the needs of the workforce. Its focus is on career readiness and efficiency in education. The teaching approach is typically practical and hands-on, focusing on project-based learning and real-world experiences. It emphasizes the application of knowledge in practical contexts. Evaluation typically involves competency-based assessments that measure students’ ability to apply knowledge and skills in real-world contexts.

The learner-centered ideology prioritizes the needs, interests, and abilities of individual learners. The curriculum focuses on giving learners opportunities to explore, follow their curiosity, and exercise personal choice and responsibility. A learner-centered curriculum is thus primarily concerned with the individual rather than academic subject matter or employability. Evaluation typically involves formative assessments that qualitatively measure students’ progress and growth. It emphasizes the process of learning and development of competencies rather than standardized testing.

The social reconstruction ideology aims to explore and solve societal issues through education. The curriculum is concerned with empowering learners to become agents of social change who can critically analyze and challenge social norms and structures. Its foundation is built on realworld problems, and learner participation is key. The content focuses on societal issues rather than academic subject matter or the learner’s individual growth and development. The academic disciplines do not represent an end, but are a means to solve problems.

Overall, these four curriculum ideologies highlight the different motives that underlie educators’ endeavors when they engage in curriculum activities or think about curriculum issues (Schiro 2013). Although in practice, many curricula incorporate elements of multiple curriculum ideologies to varying degrees, they offer a sound theoretical foundation for us to frame the curriculum in general and SIE education in particular. They facilitate opening up thinking about curriculum design and planning, balancing the complex and even conflicting views of educators, and inspiring more diverse practices. Therefore, this paper adopts curriculum theory as a theoretical lens to examine university-based SIE education in the context of Hong Kong.

# Methods

The study used documentary analysis and interviews to collect data. First, we conducted a summative content analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005) of SIE courses and programs offered at universities in Hong Kong. We followed the search strategies adopted by previous syllabus reviews (e.g. Wiley and Berry 2015). Hong Kong’s eight publicly funded universities served as our initial sampling frame. To identify credit-bearing SIE-related courses, we conducted a manual search of each university’s website for ‘social innovation’ and ‘social entrepreneurship’ and related keywords. Then, we used an Internet search engine to collect publicly available course syllabi. If the syllabi could not be found online, as in most of the cases, we reached out to the academics who taught or coordinated the courses to request the full syllabi. To supplement our list of courses from the Internet search, we also asked the academics to recommend other SIE-related courses that they knew about at their universities and at other universities in Hong Kong. We attempted to obtain the most current syllabus for each course. Whenever possible, we also asked the academics to share past syllabi of their SIE courses to track changes over time. A course was included in this study if it had ‘social innovation’ or ‘social entrepreneurship’ in the course title or as the main objective presented in the course description, or if it formed an essential part of the course design from the academics’ perspective.

Figure 1. Course distribution by discipline.

We obtained 53 syllabi from 43 distinct courses across all eight publicly funded universities. If a course changed instructors but retained the course code and title, we counted it as separate courses, as new instructors often made changes to the syllabus. The syllabi range from the academic years of 2011/12 to 2022/23. The earliest syllabus was created in 2011, which was the first time the concept of social entrepreneurship was introduced in a credit-bearing university course. A great diversity of SIE course offerings in terms of disciplinary fields and educational levels is represented in our sample (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 2. Course distribution by education level.

Our sample may not be a comprehensive list of all SIE-related courses in Hong Kong universities, but it is reasonably sized and covers all public universities. The Hazenberg et al.’s recent (2019) survey of university-based SIE education in Hong Kong identified 64 courses across all higher education institutions (public and non-public) and found that the majority were offered by the social sciences, followed by business and science and technology. It is thus likely that our sample represents a significant portion, if not almost all, of the SIE courses taught in publicly funded universities in Hong Kong.

While collecting the course syllabi, we also conducted semi-structured interviews with the academics who designed the syllabi. The purpose of the interviews was to supplement the document analysis and to obtain the rationales for certain design features of the curriculum. We interviewed 27 academics who were active in teaching and who had designed one or more syllabi included in the document analysis. The interview questions included ‘How did the course emerge?’ ‘What do you aim to achieve when teaching the SIE course?’ and ‘How did you come up with the syllabus?’ The interviews were carried out from October 2022 to May 2023. Informed consent was obtained from the academics who shared their syllabi and/or participated in the interviews. This research has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the authors’ university with reference number EA220225.

In analyzing the syllabi, we focused on sections related to course descriptions, learning objectives, content, teaching and learning activities, and assessment (examples of this analysis can be found in Appendix A). Through our inductive analysis of the syllabi, key themes were identified in the development of SIE education across time and the features of the curricula. Syllabi may not capture all of the learning that occurs in a course, but they can reflect the instructor’s intention to teach certain topics and are the methodological standard for assessing curriculum content (Miller, Wesley, and Williams 2012; Wiley and Berry 2015). These themes were triangulated with the interviews for a better exploration of the research questions. A list of the syllabi and interviewees for this study can be found in Appendix B.

# Findings

Two major themes emerged from the analysis: (1) the changing scope and positioning of SIE education and (2) the varying orientations of SIE curricula. The first theme of the changing scope and positioning of SIE education traces how the ideas of SIE moved from the periphery to the core of credit-bearing courses in university curricula, evolved across diverse disciplinary fields with distinct focuses and approaches, and expanded from single electives into more thorough academic programs. The second theme of the varying orientations of SIE curricula captures how the teaching of SIE is shaped by different orientations in curriculum design, including grounding SIE in disciplinary knowledge, framing a vision of social betterment, cultivating transferrable and career-specific skills, and facilitating personal transformation. Overall, the findings shed light on the multifaceted nature of SIE education in Hong Kong universities.

# The changing scope and positioning of SIE education

# Starting in the periphery and gaining momentum

The Hong Kong SIE sector emerged in the early 2000s following the public sector reform that introduced business ideas into the social welfare sector (Chan, Chui, and Chandra 2022). With vibrant development in practice, the concepts of SIE quickly gained attention from universities. SIE was first integrated into the undergraduate curriculum by academics from business faculties who viewed social enterprises as hybrid businesses and an emerging market phenomenon. The earliest course mentioning SIE was offered by a business school in the 2011/12 academic year with the title ‘Analysis of Management Topics’ (C1). The course was not designed to introduce SIE, but to ‘analyze fundamental issues and new trends that give new meaning to business’ (C1), especially after the 2008 financial crisis. Social entrepreneurship was presented as one emerging trend in the field of business among other topics such as creative business, design entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility. However, with the introduction of the SIE fund and the dedicated funding schemes to incentivize university education and research on the topic, the first batch of SIE courses quickly emerged, mostly in business schools (Cheung and Fung 2017). Courses titled ‘Social Entrepreneurship and Venture Philanthropy’ (C4) and ‘Social Entrepreneurship and Impact Investment’ (C7) have appeared in the formal curricula. Universities have increasingly incorporated SIE as part of their teaching mandate. The ideas of SIE have started to gain momentum and advanced gradually from the periphery to the core of credit-bearing courses.

# Diversifying discourse

As the momentum of SIE in practice built up with private and public support, courses in universities quickly expanded across institutions and into diverse disciplinary fields. Distinctive camps emerged with different focuses and approaches. For example, a business school course titled ‘Social Entrepreneurship and Venture Philanthropy’ (C4) looked at social enterprises as a new business practice and at venture philanthropy as a new funding vehicle and focused on training and practicing consulting skills related to the management and financing processes of such business organizations. In comparison, the course at a public policy school titled ‘Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation’ (C3) saw SIE as a novel approach for solving social problems via a dynamic citizen sector and related SIE to community building and the development of a sense of civic responsibility.

Notably, academics from the non-business disciplines also started to establish their own bases in SIE. For example, the series of syllabi shared by one academic from the social sciences reflect the shift in his course design from mirroring the topics in business schools on launching and managing social enterprises successfully to analyzing social issues and nurturing agents of social change with diverse paths through social innovation, social intrapreneurship, and social entrepreneurship. The change in discourse is also reflected in the change in his course title from ‘Mission-driven Social Enterprise’ (C13) to ‘Social Innovation and Innovative Practice for Social Work’ (C14) and then to the current ‘Social Innovation and Social Change for Good’ (C34). He further explained, ‘Previously … we started social enterprise courses for social workers, (but) not many of my students can be social entrepreneurs and start social businesses. We changed the focus to social innovation and social change for good for all students’ (P10, social sciences). Gradually, the concepts of SIE were also adopted by academics from other disciplines in their teaching, including those from design, education, and engineering. They focus more on the broader discourse of creative problem-solving with their own disciplinary tools and on engaging community members or organizations through service learning and experiential learning approaches, thus contributing to the diversification of discourses in SIE teaching and learning in universities.

# Expanding beyond single courses and becoming part of the core

With the maturing SIE ecosystem and the growing interest of members of the university community, some universities have gone a step further by transforming elective courses into more thorough academic explorations of SIE, as exemplified by the emergence of SIE-related specializations. Such programs include minors, majors, bachelor’s degrees, and masters’ degrees in SIE. These new programs aim to provide students with stronger connections between academia and practice through handson experience in social value creation. Some offer progressive levels of engagement from primarily classroom-based learning to hands-on practicums and internships. For example, an interviewee who taught and coordinated the social entrepreneurship specialization of a Bachelor of Commerce degree stated that their program is designed as a series of five courses, ranging from an introduction of SIE fundamentals to service-learning courses on community development and work-based learning courses with social businesses. Some programs explore the different aspects of the SIE process and aim to provide a holistic understanding of the topic and its practices. In a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Hons) in Social Entrepreneurship and Development Studies program, several courses approached SIE with different focuses, including ‘Managing and Organizing Social Enterprises’ (C40), ‘Stakeholder and Customer Engagement’ (C41), ‘Tool Kits for Social Entrepreneurship’ (C42), and ‘Leadership in Social Innovation and Development’ (C38).

As social and environmental issues are complex by nature, cross-disciplinary collaboration in SIE education is also emerging. The Master of Arts in Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management hosted by one university’s Schools of Graduate Studies exemplifies new programs emerging at the postgraduate level to cut across disciplinary boundaries. As shared by the program leader, this master’s program includes a series of courses designed to ‘cultivate innovative problem-solvers who can work and lead across disciplinary teams to address societal challenges by leveraging technology’ (P16, Interdisciplinary). Other SIE-related programs include the social innovation specialization in a Bachelor of Social Sciences degree, a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Social Policy and Social Entrepreneurship offered by a school of social sciences, and a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Social Design offered by a school of design.

# Varying orientation of SIE curricula

# Grounding SIE in disciplinary knowledge

Many of the SIE courses are offered within specific academic disciplines and are taught by educators who have expertise and interest in those disciplines. Thus, the syllabi for these courses encompass a wide range of perspectives on SIE and include the instructors’ disciplinary knowledge.

SIE courses offered in the social sciences place considerable emphasis on understanding unmet community-level demands and the challenges faced by affected populations. SIE is often viewed as a fresh perspective for analyzing social problems and ‘a new way of tackling societal grand challenges’ (C14, C34, C22). These courses encourage students to rethink and diagnose social issues through various theoretical lenses, such as a gender lens (C27) and leadership theories (C38). They delve into the intricate relationships between stakeholders, power dynamics, and underlying assumptions. In addressing social issues, many courses stress the importance of community-oriented approaches such as ‘community or civic engagement,’ ‘community asset mapping,’ and ‘community needs assessment’ (C14, C30, C31, C34). Furthermore, ensuring effective and sustainable communitybased interventions often involves topics such as community organizing, social impact assessment, and cultural competency. The organizational forms explored in these courses extend beyond social businesses to include social service agencies, civil society organizations, and private- and publicsector entities. Consequently, cross-sectoral collaboration is a key topic in these courses to ‘mobilize … resources from the market, the non-profit sector, the community, and the public sector’ (C34) and to ‘fill the gaps (between sectors)’ (C43). Additionally, social science courses tend to delve deeper into system change and ‘ecosystem development’ (C16) for SIE. For example, such courses explicitly discuss topics related to the ‘models and strategies of steering social change’ (C24), the ‘process of social change in creating social values’ (C43), or ‘how social enterprises leverage their work and impact to influence policy and systems change’ (C13). Policy often plays a central role in scaling SIE initiatives, with some courses discussing topics related to SIE in the public sector and to citizen-oriented, participatory policymaking. Social impact is achieved by seeding innovative solutions at the community level and nurturing them within a complex ecosystem to build substantial social capacity at the system level.

In contrast, SIE courses offered by business schools often emphasize creating and managing social businesses that yield both social and financial returns. They concentrate on the entrepreneurial and management aspects of such ‘new business practices’ (C11, C12) and the corresponding funding opportunities with ‘a new level of accountability and result-orientation’ (C4). For example, a finance and management course positions SIE in ‘mission-driven businesses … (that) bring transformational social benefits … through the application of business principles and market funding practices’ (C5). Other courses highlight ‘the application of entrepreneurial principles’ in missiondriven ventures and the need to ensure ‘the sustainability of the business’ (C7, C8). To better integrate SIE with their course content, business school educators often structure their topics to reflect the process of building a company while adopting it to the social impact space. They provide a comprehensive approach to social business creation, covering topics from establishing and operating a social business to scaling-up, financing, managing funder expectations, and measuring social and financial returns. The aim of SIE is to introduce new business practices, market norms, and customer experiences. Social impact is generated through the successful operation of social businesses.

Other disciplines, such as engineering, design, and education, are increasingly offering courses and programs in SIE. Many view SIE education as a means to contextualize their own discipline’s paradigm shift in curricula, reflecting a stronger connection with sustainability and humanistic perspectives.

SIE courses at engineering schools or interdisciplinary programs with an emphasis on innovation management have been designed with a strong orientation for problem-solving ‘at the juncture of technology and humanity’ (C25). These courses leverage technology to develop innovative products and services to address pressing global challenges. They often begin by critiquing dominant approaches to global technological and economic development based on their adverse impacts on underprivileged populations and comparing them with alternative sustainable development approaches. These courses prioritize hands-on innovation processes, focusing on ‘rural and disruptive technologies, conservation and development struggles and other critical issues’ (C25) and ‘design methods in a realistic context’ (C26). Students are introduced to problem-solving tools such as product design cycle, project management, and innovative thought processes.

Similarly, design school, driven by a paradigm shift to think critically about consumerism and capitalism, aims to ‘nurture designers to become pioneers and prime movers of changes through social and cultural interventions’ (C17) in their SIE courses and programs. Students learn how to apply human-centered design principles, tools, and methodologies to conceptualize and prototype solutions for social and cultural needs while considering factors essential to implementation, effective functioning, and sustainability.

Courses offered at education schools prioritize the learning processes for fostering a critical and socially conscious mindset. They view SIE as a pedagogical praxis that breaks away from conventional teaching and learning methods to cultivate ‘important twenty-first century skills like critical thinking, communications, and problem-solving’ (C9). Training teachers in SIE differs from training social innovators, as in addition to introducing essential tools of SIE such as design thinking, education courses also incorporate educational theories and methods, such as experiential learning and reflective learning cycles, to inspire student educators’ curriculum design. The aim of these courses is to broaden learners’ perspectives on alternative education methods, connecting learning processes more closely with competency development and a sense of social responsibility.

The syllabi demonstrate that SIE courses provide a diverse and rich context for aligning teaching and learning with social impact. Academics from different disciplines reinterpret the concepts by connecting them to their own disciplinary expertise and by augmenting the teaching with related theories and academic ideas. Student evaluation often involves academic writings, such as social issue analyses, response essays, or project reports. Evaluation is based on the extent to which their work embodies the core principles of an academic discipline, reflecting both the fundamental knowledge and intellectual depth essential to the field. These courses emphasize the importance of disciplinary expertise and intellectual rigor, thus adhering to the scholar academic ideology.

# Framing a vision of social betterment

In line with studies of SIE curricula that emphasize authentic learning and social value creation (e.g. Mir Shahid and Alarifi 2021), the courses offered by Hong Kong universities share a vision of social betterment and several common topics. SIE courses typically commence with an introduction of the field, highlighting the complexity of contemporary issues, the evolving nature of innovation and business, the growing interest in social impact creation, and the emergence of SIE at the intersection of traditional sectors. To develop a foundational understanding of SIE, most courses cover topics related to the characteristics, models, mechanisms, and strategies of social innovation and social entrepreneurship. Across disciplines, students are introduced to various tools, such as design thinking, theory of change, social business canvas, and other problem-solving and business planning frameworks, to facilitate their SIE learning process. Impact measurement is another essential topic of all SIE courses for students to evaluate and present the effectiveness and sustainability of their designed social interventions. Moreover, these courses recognize the complexity of social challenges and emphasize the importance of building partnerships and collaborating with stakeholders from government agencies, non-profits, businesses, and community organizations. These components constitute the foundation of almost all SIE courses.

Under the narrative of social betterment, courses that aspire for proximity to social issues tend to use teaching approaches that directly engage with the community. These approaches encourage students to explore new methods of participatory research and foster mindsets that catalyze change at the community level. Case studies are frequently incorporated to illustrate social issues and showcase methods for engaging and empowering community members. Cases are also used as a problem context for student projects, allowing students to practice their analysis and presentation skills as part of their assessment. Field visits are another important component of teaching approaches, allowing students to gain first-hand experience with people’s needs, map community assets, develop theory of change for potential transformation processes, and engage in authentic interactions. Courses related to engineering and design often include studio sessions that provide ample space for students to experiment and prototype solutions. These sessions enable students to participate more deeply in the social innovation process and implement solutions in the field.

According to the interviewees, engagement in projects that bring about micro changes to society allows students to ‘appreciate the complexity of real-world situations … and experience tensions before they approach society and start their own projects’ (P10, social sciences). Another interviewee emphasized the importance of such experiences, stating, ‘Students are used to doing small-scale projects, but social innovation at least allows them to glimpse how [certain solutions] can be upscaled to make a better impact on society’ (P6, design). These experiential learning opportunities not only foster a deeper understanding of social complexities but also inspire students to become proactive change agents.

Overall, these courses are designed to empower students to utilize knowledge and theories from various disciplines to investigate and experiment with solutions to societal issues. The evaluation process predominantly adopts a project-based approach, assessing students’ work on the extent to which it addresses social issues and demonstrates potential to effect positive change in society. This curriculum orientation demonstrates a strong commitment to the betterment of society and equips students with the necessary tools and methodologies to become agents of change. It effectively embodies the principles of social reconstruction, cultivating a generation of socially conscious and proactive individuals.

# Cultivating transferrable and career-specific skills

While some courses specifically aim to develop students into effective social entrepreneurs (C24, C28), others have broader goals of ‘preparing students for a career in the government, non-profit sectors, social enterprises, and social innovation projects’ (C22). Some courses also focus on equipping students with skills for ‘successful performance at work’ (C30) and ‘improve … ability to compete in the job market’ (C2). To achieve these objectives, the course syllabi highlight a range of skills that are nurtured through SIE education.

There is a strong emphasis on skills related to the strategic planning and implementation of ideas for change, such as problem-solving, action orientation, critical thinking, innovation, and creativity. Leadership skills, including the ability to build effective teams, work with diverse individuals, make decisions, and secure commitment, are also considered essential in SIE courses. Communication skills such as negotiation, conflict resolution, and intercultural communication are also emphasized, as students often need to collaborate with people of different backgrounds and interests. Skills related to empathy, perspective-taking, and social responsibility are also highlighted, particularly in courses involving community engagement.

In addition to these transferrable skills, some courses are designed to equip students with careerspecific skills. For example, some students are required to formulate a business plan or develop a funding proposal for the SIE Fund (C19, C11). These courses aim to develop students’ ability to ‘[conduct] research, write and present professional, credible, and convincing funding proposals, and assist in implementing the proposals’ (C4). These courses emphasize enterprising skills, including risk-taking, resource management, and financial, human, and technological capital management. Such skill development aims to enhance students’ future employability in social businesses and social impact organizations, as well as in the broader business and non-profit world.

Furthermore, certain courses, particularly those in business disciplines, focus on SIE in the context of social businesses with hybrid goals of achieving economic, social, and environmental values and impact. These courses engage students to work alongside social enterprises or innovators, enabling them to develop a better understanding of their business models, strategies, and impact mechanisms. As one interviewee described, SIE necessitates ‘a specialized set of management, marketing, and entrepreneurial knowledge and skills’ (P4, business). These specific career-oriented skills are best acquired by working with social entrepreneurs and organizations. Students are encouraged to apply their knowledge and skills to address certain operational and management problems faced by these practitioners. Students may also gain practical experience with the day-to-day work of the organizations through practicums or work-based learning programs. In addition, these and other courses often place students in the role of a ‘management consultant’ (C7) or a ‘marketing consultant’ (C35). Some even involve student-directed venture funds and engage students in a bidding process in which experienced investors and practitioners evaluate their SIE ideas and presentations (C4, C5, C7, C15). These courses often invite social entrepreneurs and investors to be mentors to guide students in idea generation and presentation activities (C7). One interviewee stated that ‘[students from counseling] are now tested with specific skills such as writing a proposal, securing funding, diversifying income, and writing an impact report’ (P7, social sciences). These perspectives reinforce the importance of equipping students with the relevant skills to efficiently navigate the realm of SIE and provide them with simulated professional experience as social entrepreneurs.

The syllabi of these courses encompass a range of skills deemed essential for a highly competitive graduate workforce. Evaluation methods focus on the extent to which students demonstrate mastery of both generic and career-specific skills. They are assessed based on student projects, where students apply relevant skills to engage stakeholders, tackle real problems, and communicate ideas. Furthermore, peer evaluations and self-assessments can be used to encourage students to evaluate their learning progress and skill development. Regardless of their specialized academic disciplines, students are expected to acquire a set of generic and career-specific skills upon completion of the course, which aligns with the ideology of social efficiency.

# Facilitating personal transformation

Irrespective of their disciplines, most courses emphasize opportunities for students’ personal development through reflective thinking, self-awareness, and self-confidence. Students are guided to explore their own learning processes and examine their ‘personal development in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes’ (C25). These courses foster self-confidence by encouraging students to ‘ask questions actively, challenge assumptions, develop a strong sense of curiosity, and engage in enquiry’ (C32). According to one interviewee, ‘(Some students) may not be very confident about their English ability and academic performance … We think that this (SIE) is another path for them to accumulate experience and become more confident’ (P23, business). Similarly, another interviewee noted that ‘(Students) want to contribute to society. SIE opens up a door for them to actually achieve that … Students’ mindsets are changed from sitting down and waiting for lectures to doing a lot of work, (and) from being risk-averse to embracing failures and adversity’ (P10, social sciences). These courses provide students with avenues to develop passion for a cause and to engage in self-directed discovery.

Reflection plays a crucial role in these SIE learning experiences and is evaluated through reflection journals and reports. For example, some courses require students to reflect on power dynamics between individuals and institutions in the creation of novelty and to write reflection reports to ‘analyze innovations from the gender perspectives along with considerations of other social factors, like class, race, ethnicity, economic status, ability, etc.’ (C27). The goal is for students to ‘formulate and articulate their own knowledge system based on knowledge and concepts introduced’ (P17, social sciences).

In addition, some courses provide opportunities for students to interview practitioners of SIE and to ‘appraise the leadership, attitude, and qualities of successful social entrepreneurs and innovators’ (C3). These discussions focus on authentic individuals and their experiences, allowing students to comprehend SIE identities and develop self-awareness by reflecting on their own strengths and positionality. For example, as part of its assessment, one course requires students to connect their learning with personal introspection regarding a range of SIE related competencies such as ‘curiosity, fearlessness, speed, integrity, grit, resilience, humility, service, and passion’ (C19). Another course asks students to maintain personal journals to reflect on their values and worldviews and to ‘think creatively and make a difference by doing simple things or adjustments in real life issues’ (C3). To facilitate reflections for personal transformation, one education faculty course integrates tools and theories of reflective learning cycles as part of training for student educators and the SIE experiences that they facilitate.

As one interviewee explained, ‘It’s important for the younger generation to have both brain and heart … to be able to know what they care about in their life and care about social justice … ’ and ‘to be able to see outside of their bubbles’ (P13, engineering). The transformative nature of SIE courses is captured in the statement, ‘(once) you see it, you cannot unsee it’ (P14, engineering). These courses help students connect learning with action, develop a professional identity and efficacy, and make a tangible impact on society.

The above examples illustrate how SIE courses prioritize individual growth and unique development by addressing students’ needs, interests, and challenges within a learner-centered ideology.

# Discussion

Our analysis reveals that SIE education in Hong Kong universities has evolved considerably over the years. The scope of SIE education has broadened, as more robust links with disciplinary discourse have been forged and more comprehensive academic programs have been created. The curricula of SIE courses have become increasingly multifaceted, displaying a commitment to diverse disciplinary approaches and to preparing students for social betterment, future employment, and intellectual and personal development. This diversity is evident in various aspects, ranging from classroom instruction to action and experience-oriented teaching, from theoretical education to community engagement, and from professor-led teaching to collaborative learning involving individuals from different sectors of society.

Tyler’s (2013) fundamental questions about curriculum design, in combination with the interconnectedness and complementarity of the curriculum ideologies (Ellis 2013; Schiro 2013), are useful for considering the context of SIE education at Hong Kong universities.

# Educational purposes of SIE education

The analysis reveals a notable evolution in the educational purposes of SIE education at Hong Kong universities, one that started at the periphery as minor content in a course in a faculty of business spurred by broad and global societal events, the financial crisis and social service sector reform. Momentum on SIE education was later generated by public policy attention and funding on SIE, leading to the emergence of the first batch of SIE courses in business schools. These schools also became increasingly interested in the new opportunities that SIE could bring to societal change and wanted to expose students to a new business-related societal phenomenon. As SIE education gained traction and was undertaken by other faculties and schools, the focus and objectives of SIE education were redesigned in accordance with disciplinary goals, concerns, theories, and approaches. This expanded and broadened offerings of SIE education, legitimizing and establishing it as an increasingly core component of university teaching, as evidenced by the numerous dedicated bachelor’s and master’s degrees, majors, and minors now offered. This trend appears to be linked to the positioning of universities as more responsive and connected to society while providing impactful education. It is important to note that current educational purposes are clearly delimited by disciplinary boundaries. Only 2 of the 43 SIE courses had academics from different disciplines coteaching, and neither of these courses had any formal inter-faculty collaboration arrangement.

# Educational experiences that are likely to achieve these purposes

From a curriculum ideology perspective, it can be argued that universities in Hong Kong have two primary objectives, ‘training up’ and ‘leading forth’ (Ellis 2013). The ‘training up’ aspect of the curricula is predominantly guided by experts and is dedicated to shaping students’ lives. It involves the acquisition of knowledge and skills essential for SIE practices, enabling students to excel in the field of SIE, either as social entrepreneurs or in other supporting professions, such as business consulting and investment. The scholar academic ideology supports the ‘training up’ objective by emphasizing theoretical foundations and disciplinary knowledge, but the social efficiency ideology is also present in the form of developing a set of comprehensive skills to effectively meet professional requirements.

The ‘leading forth’ aspect of the curricula is also evident. Current SIE education engages students in acquiring skills that are of general interest to them but also place them in positions to become potential actors and participants in the SIE dynamics of Hong Kong. The purpose of current SIE education in Hong Kong seems to be to empower students with the potential to become participants, or even leaders, in SIE, as evidenced by the educational processes of several SIE courses that include role playing, engagement with stakeholders, and welcoming SIE professionals to come to courses and act as mentors. In sum, these two primary objectives align with the perspectives on SIE education found in the literature: one focuses on preparing students to establish social enterprises and become effective social entrepreneurs, and the other emphasizes nurturing students’ mindsets and aspirations so that they become agents of positive change regardless of their career plans (e.g. Alden Rivers et al. 2015; Hockerts 2018). Our analysis not only corroborates these perspectives but also provides additional nuance and ideological connections to the design of SIE courses. By understanding the dual objectives of ‘training up’ and ‘leading forth’ within the context of SIE education, universities and teachers can better tailor their curricula to address the diverse needs and aspirations of their students, which will ultimately foster a more effective approach to teaching and learning in this field.

# Organization of educational experiences

Our analysis demonstrates that the SIE education courses being offered reflect multiple curriculum ideologies, which contribute to the development of multifaceted approaches to SIE education. In this regard, this study challenges Tam’s (2017) claim that the contents and approaches of universitybased SIE courses in Hong Kong are rather similar and homogenous by identifying a more comprehensive, multi-disciplinary perspective based on syllabi and interviews. However, two key aspects warrant further consideration for improving learning experiences.

First, as most courses are offered as single electives, it is crucial to address the limitations of isolated learning contexts and to develop strategies for continuous learning support within the curricula. For example, with the ‘training up’ objective, subsequent support for students seeking immediate opportunities is crucial beyond a single course. In contrast, with the ‘leading forth’ objective, access to long-term resources and guidance for following up on community engagement and project initiatives would help students to put their ideas into action. Second, the profiles of the academics teaching SIE courses play a role in shaping the educational experience. SIE education in Hong Kong universities still relies heavily on professionals with experience from the public, private, and non-profit sectors, who tend to emphasize methodology, work skills, and urgent social needs. While partnerships between universities, organizations, and communities can ensure that the knowledge and expertise of all stakeholders are valued and integrated into an authentic learning process, advancing the field also requires academic rigor aligned with the scholar academic ideology and a strong emphasis on students’ perspectives under the learner-centered ideology.

To address these concerns, a cluster of courses could be designed with progressive learning experiences. For example, a curriculum using this structure could include introductory courses focusing on understanding the basics of SIE, intermediate courses to build disciplinary theoretical and methodological foundations, and finally advanced courses to optimize models, establish organizations, and evaluate outputs. Such a curriculum structure would emphasize different orientations at various stages of development based on the students’ level of awareness, motivation, and skills (Mir Shahid and Alarifi 2021). Furthermore, incorporating interdisciplinary learning into SIE education can enhance the overall learning experience. This approach can involve designing courses that integrate content and perspectives from multiple disciplines, promote collaboration among faculty members from different disciplinary fields, and encourage team-based projects that require students to work collaboratively and apply their diverse disciplinary backgrounds to real-world social challenges. Facilitating reflective practices can also help students recognize the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, identify areas for personal growth, and develop strategies for effectively integrating diverse perspectives in their future work. By incorporating interdisciplinary learning into SIE education, educators can better prepare students to navigate complex social challenges and to develop innovative, sustainable solutions that contribute to positive societal change.

# Are the purposes being achieved?

Evaluations in current SIE curricula are primarily conducted within individual courses based on students’ work and skill development. The assessment approaches are varied and cater to the specificities of SIE learning within the disciplines associated with the SIE courses and the academics who teach them. They tend to focus on the ‘training up’ aspects of the curricula, with attention given to the extent of learning processes related to ‘lead forth’ actions and change. The real impact of educational projects on society is rarely evaluated. This may be related to time constraints within the curriculum, pressure to meet specific learning outcomes, and limited resources, making it challenging for university courses to avoid the ‘solutionism trap,’ which may lead to the oversimplification of complex problems, neglect of interconnected factors, and even unintended consequences (Chalmers 2021, 1368). To address these concerns, continuous efforts could be made to prioritize competencies such as critical thinking, holistic analysis, stakeholder involvement, and innovation (Swayne et al. 2019). Such efforts could include incorporating opportunities for students to reflect on the ethical implications and systemic dimensions of their proposed solutions and the voices of community and partner organizations. Nevertheless, the expansion of SIE education into diverse disciplines and its integration into university core curricula have greatly increased the number of students exposed to SIE concepts and practices, so in this sense, a key purpose of the SIE education, i.e. awareness and knowledge, is being met. This exposure stimulates students to reflect on the connections between their discipline-specific learning and SIE while also opening up possible avenues for their active participation in creating social value. By embracing these potential future developments, SIE education can continue to evolve and equip students with knowledge and skills necessary to drive positive social change and advance sustainable development.

# Conclusion

SIE education provides a valuable means to enhance the impact of universities on sustainable development through their core missions of teaching and learning. This study reveals the multifaceted approaches to SIE education and fills the gap in understanding the development trajectories and essential features of SIE curricula in the context of Hong Kong. The analysis shows that SIE education is expanding and in a constant process of evolution, and that this process tends to be mostly disciplinary driven. The analysis also suggests that the teaching and learning of SIE may be having a limited impact outside of the university classrooms despite the engagement of some courses with stakeholders and the implementation of more practice-oriented learning. Therefore, this study identifies room for improvement in the years and decades to come, mainly by creating stronger and more formalized interdisciplinary approaches to the learning of SIE in universities in a way that engages academics from different disciplines and faculties (which can eventually be achieved through, for example, general education initiatives, as they may be university organized rather than faculty centered). This would mean making SIE education part of transversal and multidisciplinary education for all students. Improvement can also entail the expansion of learning strategies that involve the community and the public at large and that engage students, academics, and stakeholders in more impact-based SIE learning.

This study has several limitations. First, it focuses on publicly funded universities in Hong Kong, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other institutions and the whole higher education system. However, our aim is to provide an in-depth analysis of various courses and themes within the specific context of these universities (which serve as role models for others in the territory), offering valuable insights and detailed explanations that can contribute to a broader understanding of SIE education in higher education learning settings. Additionally, what was stated in the syllabi and discussed in the interviews may not fully reflect actual educational experiences, and information provided by these sources may be overly positive or ambitious, potentially overlooking challenges, constraints, and limitations. Building on this study, future research could expand the scope to include a wider range of contexts and institutions, investigate the perspectives of students and community partners, and explore curriculum designs that facilitate and measure long-term impacts of SIE education on both individual learners and society. Moreover, exploring the influence of various aspects of academic profiles, including academic position, social network, personal concerns and resourcefulness will also enable a more nuanced examination of the factors that shape the design and development of SIE courses. By considering these additional perspectives and dimensions, a more comprehensive understanding of the elements influencing SIE courses and their implications for higher education will likely be achieved.
