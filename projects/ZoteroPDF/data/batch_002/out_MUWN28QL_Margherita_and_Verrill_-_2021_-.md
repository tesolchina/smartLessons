# Elevator Pitch Assessment Model: A Systematization of Dimensions in Technology Entrepreneurship Presentations

ALESSANDRO MARGHERITA $\textcircled{1}$ AND DAVID VERRILL $\textcircled{1}$

Abstract—Introduction:The creation of a technology venture brings the entrepreneur to interact with different stakeholders and persuade them of the quality of the business idea. In such endeavors, entrepreneurial storytelling and business pitches are crucial to attract stakeholder interest and potential commitment. We focus on longer and structured elevator pitches used by entrepreneurs seeking funds and partners for their startup, and we present an integrative framework of evaluation dimensions, specific items, and key evidence to assess a pitch. Research methodology: We conducted a systematic review of specialized literature on business venturing, entrepreneurship, and business communication, and we selected 40 research articles from which we have extracted concepts related to the quality and effectiveness of an elevator pitch. We analyze and aggregate concepts to derive a taxonomy of evaluation dimensions. Results and discussion: We identify four dimensions of evaluation of an elevator pitch: background and contextual knowledge showed in the presentation, project content and venture information, storytelling approach and style, and entrepreneurial flow or “algorithm” of the pitch. We detail the dimensions by defining 19 evaluation items and associated key evidence to support assessment. We undertake a preliminary application of the framework with three groups: Business investors, potential entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship students. Conclusion and further research: We advance the discussion on venture storytelling and provide practitioners with a useful tool to support the evaluation of an entrepreneurial idea presented through an elevator pitch.

to establish a new venture is commonly defined as technology entrepreneurship [1], [2]. It includes an articulated set of “desk” (idea stage), “premarket,” and “market” activities, which have been substantially impacted by the emergence of digital technologies [3], [4], and by a new logic of entrepreneurial collaboration based on collective intelligence and crowdsourcing [5].

The complexity of the process, along with above-average risks and requirements of technological development, makes a particularly challenging endeavor for entrepreneurs. To raise early stage capital to transform the concept into a sustainable venture, and become “investment ready,” the potential entrepreneur needs to interact with a number of potential stakeholders to whom the business idea or project is presented. The study of investors’ decision parameters in the evaluation of a new venture [6]–[9] and the analysis of how entrepreneurs’ social competence and business networks are positively related to financial success [10], [11] are not new. Fraiberg [12] has conceptualized entrepreneurs as workers able to deal with intricate interconnections among “genres, modes, languages, and spaces.” Because failure to sell the idea and the opportunity may raise doubts in potential investors about the viability of the venture, entrepreneurs need to develop an “attention contract” [13] and advance their “impression management skills” so that the audience draws positive conclusions [14], [15].

In the idea-sharing process, the potential entrepreneur commonly delivers an elevator pitch—a concise, carefully planned, well-practiced, and business-oriented verbal message about the entrepreneurial idea. The name is derived from the supposition that an entrepreneur sharing an elevator ride with a potential investor has very little time to share the story and obtain a follow-up meeting. The term is used to indicate metaphorically an eye-catching presentation able to attract attention and interest, and the concept is

# Practitioner Takeaway

Entrepreneurial storytelling and structured pitches are crucial to attract stakeholder interest and obtain potential commitment in technology ventures. Nevertheless, an integrative literaturebased definition of the quality and evaluation pillars of an elevator pitch is still not available for practitioners.   
We present an integrative framework of four dimensions of evaluation-background, venture information, presenter style, and entrepreneurial "algorithm'--and detail the dimensions by defining 19 evaluation items and associated key evidence to support assessment. We undertake a preliminary application of the framework with early-stage investors, technology entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship students.   
We advance the discussion on venture storytelling and provide practitioners with a useful tool to support the preparation and evaluation of an effective elevator pitch.

thus relevant in both business and nonbusiness situations. For example, in a Nature article, Doudna advocated for better training for future scientists, including guidance on how to craft a research elevator pitch [16].

A good elevator pitch is a combination of social skills, technical awareness, speed, and pragmatism required to influence the audience, and the use of a style appropriate to the nature and style of the project [17]. A study by van Werven et al. [18] has provided a comprehensive typology of arguments that an entrepreneur can use to obtain legitimacy, and a large stream of research [10], [14], [19]–[21] has evaluated the effect of entrepreneurs’ presentation and communication skills on investors’ decisions. Varga [22] analyzed aspects related to passion, audience knowledge, clarity of objectives, attire, and focus on benefits, and Diez-Prados [23] analyzed verbal and nonverbal engagement.

Although several guides on how to conduct a pitch are available in practice [24]–[29], scholars have typically focused on specific dimensions, such as defining different pitching strategies in different types of pitches [30]; the perceived entrepreneur’s passion, preparation, and presentation design [31]; and the role of emotional and cognitive narratives [32]. However, a comprehensive framework of quality and evaluation dimensions of elevator pitches has not previously appeared. In particular, it would be relevant to integrate content and approach-related elements to propose a comprehensive idea of where a technology entrepreneurship project stands and what is its potential for success. Such an integrative effort would be relevant users, such as entrepreneurship students and potential entrepreneurs, technology entrepreneurs (TEs), and individuals engaged to assess the value of a new venture idea.

In our study, we focus in particular on entrepreneurs seeking funds and partners to launch their startup and the “preseed” pitches, longer than the typical short elevator pitch, which they present to reach the target audience. Such pitches are quite formalized in the practitioner experience in terms of parameters, such as length (about 10 minutes), structure, and visual aids used to convey the key messages. In most cases, these pitches are followed by a question-and-answer session aimed to deepen or clarify issues. We look at those pitches as presentation “archetypes” because they require (more than simple “idea disclosure” messages) a number of crucial requirements in terms of structure, content, and style or approach.

To achieve our research goals, we undertake a systematic review of extant literature to extract key concepts, ideas, and factors associated with the quality and effectiveness of an elevator pitch. We investigate business venturing, entrepreneurship, and business communication literature, looking also at systematization and practitioner-oriented contributions providing guides for building a successful venture and obtaining funds at the venture’s early stages [33], [34]. We also looked at studies depicting the relation between idea and opportunity and the evolution of the venture from concept to exploitation (e.g., [35]), as well as studies highlighting the relevance of training programs to develop new entrepreneurs’ ability to communicate and persuade the audience [36].

The next section of this article describes the method and process that we followed to

systematically review the literature. Then, we illustrate the outcomes of that review and identify the specific dimensions and items of evaluation of an elevator pitch. Next, we reduce this conceptual exploration into a single analytical framework, which is also used for a preliminary application with three target user groups. Then, we discuss our findings and finally present conclusions, limitations, and paths for further research.

# RESEARCH PROCESS

We conducted a systematic review of specialized literature [37], [38] to gather definitions, conceptualizations, and analytical reviews of entrepreneurial presentations, with a specific focus on the elevator or business pitch. In particular, we conducted four activities, as shown in Fig. 1. In Step 1, we established the objective of the review, to derive an integrative framework, currently not present in the literature, of areas representing the perspectives of evaluation of an elevator pitch. The motivation and the boundaries of such framework development work were described in the previous section.

In Step 2, we used the Scopus database to search combinations of the keywords “elevator,” “business,” “entrepreneur ” and “venture” with the keywords “pitch” and “speech” in article titles, abstracts, and keywords. The full search string used was [TITLE-ABS-KEY (“elevator pitch”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“elevator speech”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“business pitch”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“business speech”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“entrepreneur pitch”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“entrepreneur speech”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“venture pitch”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“venture speech”)]. We limited the search to works published in journals to focus on academic contributions. We performed the query in mid-July 2020; the results are reported in Table I, divided by single keyword used. In fact, we also performed single searches to have an idea of the significance and diffusion of each concept. Due to duplications of works that can be found using different keywords, the total number of papers reported in

TABLE I NUMBER OF RESEARCH ARTICLES FOUND FOR EACH KEYWORD   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Keyword</td><td>Number of Articles</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;elevator pitch&quot;</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;entrepreneur* pitch&quot;.</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;business speech&quot;</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;business pitch&quot;</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;elevator speech&quot;</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>&quot;venture pitch&quot;</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total (Consolidated Total)</td><td>88 (78)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table I (88) is higher than the consolidated number of papers found using the full search string (78).

The predominant practitioner focus on the topic (which is where our study aims to fill a gap by developing an academic investigation and integrative framework) has suggested that we be less restrictive in the initial article-gathering effort. We have extended the number and the scope of search keywords to retrieve a larger number of research articles and support a more inclusive conceptual extraction and systematization effort. Although concepts have been identified and used to assemble a larger number of studies to consider, we have carefully analyzed all the retrieved sources to check the appropriateness and real interest of each article for our purposes.

We reviewed the abstracts of the 78 papers and excluded works that are not relevant to our research (e.g., technical pitches in medical and biological fields) or that are generic business and entrepreneurship works not specifically focused on analyzing approaches, concepts, and processes related to making an entrepreneurial pitch. We thus selected 40 works, all included in the final reference list of this article. Table II lists the scientific journals where the selected articles were published. Most of those papers (23) were published in the International Small Business Journal (5 articles), Journal of Business

In Step 3, we analyzed the 40 selected papers to extract and annotate key concepts using a draft classification schema based on the main topic area. This extraction and aggregation work allowed us to gradually identify the following four main categories of concepts analyzed.

Background knowledge and preparation required   
to hold a business pitch   
Presentation approach and personal style   
adopted by the presenter   
Content or information about the venture and   
the entrepreneur, which is shown in the pitch

- Logical reasoning or entrepreneurial “flow” of the pitch, and the entrepreneurial follow-up

Table III reports the outcome of the review and classification work, with the identification of the four areas of focus, the related concepts, and the associated references.

The next section describes Step 4 of the review process, in which we have used the retrieved items and key concepts to further detail the taxonomy of dimensions involved in the delivery and evaluation of the elevator pitch. For each of the four macroareas, we define a number of aspects and associated key points of analysis.

# AREAS OF EVALUATION OF AN ELEVATOR PITCH

Background Knowledge and Preparation The delivery of an elevator pitch is based on preparation about the relevant technical background. The potential entrepreneur is expected to know what a company or business organization is and how it works, and what its distinguishing subsystems are (e.g., financial and technical resources, processes and operations, product and innovation outputs, and the financial and intangible value created). Besides, the realization of a technology-based business project also requires knowledge of project management methods and approaches. Previous research has addressed the multifaceted aspects and criteria involved with the evaluation of entrepreneurial speeches and storytelling. These include both dimensions mostly placed at the business (plan) level and aspects related to more “theatrical” aspects (e.g., 39, 40). Chen et al. [41] analyzed how a venture capitalist perceives entrepreneurial passion and how this perception may influence their investment decisions. That study showed that preparedness has a positive impact on funding decisions. Good preparation decreases stress, which can be heightened by an elevator pitch. In this regard, Burns [79] identified 7 Ps of speech anxiety reduction: positive perception, positive thinking, positive self-talk, positive visualization, positive breathing, positive preparation, and positive behavior.

A second area of “preparation” is related to the process required to build a technology venture. The roadmap to build a technology entrepreneurship venture includes a number of “idea,” “premarket,” and “market” stages [80], [81]. “Desk” activities focus on preliminary venture conceptualization and planning issues (i.e., opportunity definition, value proposition, and business planning). “Premarket”

activities include venture configuration and preparatory activities (i.e., capital raising, team organization, legal formation, and product development). Finally, “market” activities focus on venture implementation and process execution (i.e., management of operations, value appropriation, and venture growth). Although the practical experience is crucial for undertaking the activities above, research has shown that the profit of a new venture tends to be low when the entrepreneur has only startup, managerial, and high-growth experience without an educational background [82].

A third dimension of preparation or backgroundrelated aspects concerns issues, such as the

purpose and types of business presentation, the required skills, and techniques for handling questions (e.g., TRACT: thank, repeat, answer, confirm, and thank). Delivering a business presentation or pitch requires playing a role, telling a story based on a canvas, and using voice and gestures to persuade the audience. Goffman’s The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life [83] analyzes the theatrical performance involved in face-to-face interactions. When in contact with other people, an individual will attempt to guide the impression that others might make of them by changing setting, appearance, and behavior. This tendency applies also in entrepreneurial interaction, where the performer (potential entrepreneur) is on stage in front of the audience. Anderson and Warren extend Goffman’s ideas by showing that “entrepreneurs

have a distinctive presence in society that is shaped by cultural norms and expectations” [52, p. 589], whereas Anderson [40] studied the value of theatricality—particularly the application of dramatism and dramaturgy—as additional conceptual tools to analyze the entrepreneurial process.

Finally, the potential entrepreneur should exhibit contextual or situational awareness. The presenter should do a thorough analysis of the audience and the “environment” in which the pitch will be held. In particular, it is relevant to focus on values, needs, interests, constraints, backgrounds, and demographics of the audience. These elements will support the entrepreneur in the delicate effort of customizing the pitch and selecting the arguments used. Business planning literature highlights the importance of adapting the presentation—for example, by addressing the different focus of bankers (who stress financial aspects over the market and entrepreneur), versus venture capital and business angels (who highlight both market and financial dimensions). Business angels place more emphasis than venture capitalists on the entrepreneur and “investor fit” considerations [39]. Fisher et al. [44] showed that the criteria for a new technology venture may vary according to the audience. Table IV reports a snapshot of aspects related to the background and preparation dimensions, which were extracted from the literature and integrated with the introductory information provided earlier in this paragraph.

Presenter Style and Approach TEs pitch their business idea or venture with the goal of creating audience interest by offering credible and applicable evidence. Oral communication skills are thus crucial for a nascent entrepreneur. More generally, oral presentation and communication skills are also considered by managers among the most important competencies for graduates entering the workforce [49]. A pitch is more than a presentation transmitting information. It is more like a conversation that helps the listener to imagine how the world would be if the new idea being presented were realized. Commitment is expected to produce action by the audience. The

elevator pitch can be stressful because it creates pressure on the presenter. The time is brief, and the presence of “judges” in a formal setting may hinder the real potential of the entrepreneur to tell the full story in an effective way. In this regard, the traditional elevator pitch could be replaced by a model of reception elevator pitch [57].

O’Leary [25] described the 9Cs of a perfect pitch. First, the pitch should be concise—succinct and clear, with as few words as possible. Second, the pitch should be clear—not filled with acronyms and technical jargon. Third, the pitch should be compelling—stating problems that can be solved and describing how they could be addressed. Fourth, the pitch has to be credible— spelling out what makes the entrepreneur qualified to do what is being envisioned. Fifth, the pitch is conceptual—initially staying at a high level. Sixth, the pitch is concrete—tangible and easily grasped. Seventh, the pitch has to be consistent—showing coherence and making a durable fit with the target audience. Eighth, the pitch is customized—adapted in style and content to the specific audience. Ninth, the pitch is conversational—capturing the target and stimulating discussion and understanding.

A second aspect of evaluation concerns the presenter. Presentation factors [19] relate to the entrepreneur’s style of delivery. Entrepreneurs adopt different tactics to engage the audience.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Aspect</td><td>Main Points</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">1.

Common tactics include demonstrations (i.e., live demos and photos of a new product or technology) and real-life stories. Clarke et al. [59] showed how figurative language and gestures may also influence investment decisions, since they help investors to enhance the perception of one venture’s potential. Sensegiving may also play a direct role in achieving support for a venture [53]. In the early stages of a venture, metaphors are used to emphasize agency and control, and the predictability and transparency of a novel venture. It is also important to note the relevance of addressing cultural sensibilities (e.g., eye-to-eye contact or gestures).

Finally, enthusiasm and emotional layers are crucial aspects to consider. In the 1990s, Beck and Wegner [47] studied the role of enthusiasm in technical proposals and found differences between social science/humanities proposals and science/engineering ones. The concept of “signaled ethos” [48] has been discussed as a useful mechanism for understanding the “images” that authors create of themselves. There are five categories of signaled ethos in business speeches: “deference,” “self-criticism,” “similitude,” “expertise,” and the “inclination to succeed.” Cardon et al. [50] showed that the display of entrepreneurial passion is a factor in business angels’ investment decisions, which are shaped by the enthusiasm, preparation, and commitment that entrepreneurs exhibit. Table V shows the dimensions of pitch evaluation that relate to the presenter, which were extracted from the literature and integrated with the introductory information provided in this paragraph.

# Venture Information and Pitch Content

Besides looking at how things are communicated, it is crucial to evaluate what is being said. Pollack et al. [66] have highlighted the positive correlations among entrepreneurs’ preparedness, cognitive legitimacy, and the amount of funding received. Cognitive legitimacy is the knowledge about a new activity and what is needed to succeed [84]. Substance-oriented or nonpresentation criteria include company, market, product, and finance issues [19].

There are many business and entrepreneurship textbooks and practitioner guides [24], [85] that define the key elements to be included in a pitch. The pitch should start with a strong opening (or “hook”) that grabs the audience’s attention. An introduction increases the audience’s willingness to listen and understand a speech. In particular, anecdotal openers (or personas) increase the presentation’s comprehensibility and the speaker’s credibility [62].

Spinuzzi et al. [67] studied strategy reuse in entrepreneurs’ pitches. Entrepreneurs reuse professional communication content, and this reuse can be characterized as accepting (repeating verbatim), continuing (extending arguments), and resisting (rebutting arguments). Kirsch et al. [63] showed that venture capital funding decisions are weakly associated with the preparation and submission of planning documents and information.

The pitch should state an unmet customer need (problematic scenario) and explain how the

proposed solution can satisfy that need. The presentation should leave the audience wanting to know more, and it should be concluded with an explicit request (“ask”) for financial, technical, network, or expertise assistance (call for action).

First, the contextual opening should be framed in terms of a techno-human-social endeavor, sector/industry framing, and trend or challenge. Second, customer pain includes the relevant need or market gap, problem characteristics/intensity, and call for action. Third, the solution includes the conceptual/functional solution, the competitive space and mapping, the response to the gap, and the product. Fourth, the team and roles include the current board, advisors, employees (or team), motivation, education, experience, organizational model, and roles. In this aspect, it is relevant to highlight the role of “entrepreneurial ties” to increase the innovativeness of the startup, and the positive impact in terms of expected level of competition, novelty to customers, and novelty of technology [65]. Fifth, the business process describes key operations and technology, the venture value system, and customer channels. Sixth, revenue and financials include pricing strategy and mechanisms, revenue sources, and financial projections. Seventh, the ask and follow-up include the timeline and milestones, preand postmoney valuation, and financial and advisory needs. Table VI provides a list of evaluation topics and specific items related to the venture, which were extracted from the literature and integrated with the introductory information provided in this paragraph.

# Reasoning and Logical Flow of the Pitch

Although the entrepreneur’s approach, style, and emotional aspects are crucial to convince the audience in an entrepreneurship presentation, there is an important link between the propensity to fund a venture and the presence of rational aspects in the pitch. In fact, although emotional appeals are useful to reinforce arguments, they are not sufficiently persuasive on their own [76]. The

lack of rational elements may thus guarantee the failure of the entrepreneur’s attempt to be persuasive.

Beyond the overall structure and content of the entrepreneurial narrative, it is thus crucial that the pitch present solid arguments that can help achieve resonance and plausibility. In this regard, van Werven et al. [78] identify the claims, arguments, and rhetorical strategies that entrepreneurs adopt when holding a pitch. The claims are related to the following.

Customer needs and call for action   
Product/solution and its ability to provide benefits   
Venture and enabling environment   
Intermediate or expected performance of the venture   
Team composition and capabilities   
Funding and other requests

The elevator pitch should represent and demonstrate the existence of a consistent logical flow, a robust stream of ideas, which we call the “entrepreneurial algorithm.” An algorithm is a method or process for solving a problem or accomplishing an objective through a number of steps, and the creation of a technology venture is a process for addressing a customer problem and accomplishing the entrepreneur’s business objectives. The pitch is thus aimed at describing the process and demonstrating that it can really work, starting from an “input”—a problem, interest, vision, passion, or need of the TE—and ending with an “output” —a venture that exists and is sustainable on the market. A precondition or initial assumption is that the problem, although complex and challenging, can actually be solved.

Then, there are four “assessment points” that build up the “entrepreneurial algorithm,” which are as follows.

Existence of a concrete solution in the hands (or   
in the mind) of the TE   
Realizability of the solution by the TE and   
his/her team   
Identification of a significant market potential,   
with clear customers segments, for the solution   
Current feasibility of the venture in terms of   
process and financial maturity

Fig. 2 shows the entrepreneurial algorithm, with the four assessment points and the negative “ways out”—the solution gap, realization gap, market gap, and preparation gap. The chart, which addresses

one of the four dimensions of the proposed framework—the logical flow or reasoning “algorithm” underlying the pitch—is aimed at showing the key evaluation (and self-assessment) steps that can be identified as a go/no go pitch.

# ELEVATOR PITCH ASSESSMENT MODEL (EPAM)

Assessment Scorecard In the previous sections, we have used the outcomes of the literature review to identify four areas of evaluation of an elevator pitch. For each area, we have developed a schema to describe a number of specific items. Building on those findings, this section presents an integrative assessment scorecard or EPAM. Table VII shows the scorecard with the four dimensions of evaluation and the detail of each dimension with the identification of 19 specific evaluation items. For each item, Table VII also reports evidence or “signals” that can support the assessment or the stakeholder’s reflection on that aspect.

The EPAM is specifically focused on preseed pitches held by entrepreneurs in front of potential investors and partners of their startup. This form of entrepreneurial storytelling is formalized in the practitioner experience in terms of a number of aspects, such as length, structure, and visual aids, used to convey the key messages. Although the application of the model to other business or nonbusiness situations should be assessed before it is applied (different audiences and situations require different content and approaches), the framework can be potentially applied to pitches held in front of a larger range of relevant stakeholders besides investors and partners, such as customers, distributors, and potential team members.

Note that the framework is not an assessment or evaluation tool per se, and more fine-grained evaluation criteria could be identified. But the dimensions of analysis reported in Table VII provide a checklist of parameters to be operationalized using more specific measurement scales and parameter.

# Preliminary Applications with Target Users

From a practitioner perspective, the framework has the following three potential types of users.

1. The assessment model can be used by TEs engaged to deliver a pitch in different phases of the venture creation journey. The framework offers these users a comprehensive checklist of issues to address to deliver an effective pitch in front of a number of entrepreneurial stakeholders.

Fig. 2. Reasoning and logical flow of the pitch.

2. Another potential user of the model is entrepreneurship students involved in business communication and elevator pitch training sessions. Our model can be used as an education tool to support the development of purposeful competencies and skills. At the same time, the model can be useful for educators engaged to evaluate students’ presentations and elevator pitches, which are delivered in coherence with the provided model.   
3. Finally, the model can be useful for investors to support their venture evaluation and investment decision process. Although the investment decision is largely dependent on other aspects beside the pitch, the framework provides a literature-based model of evaluation aspects that can be useful to define a comprehensive assessment.

We conducted a preliminary application of the framework with each of these user types.

First, we submitted the model for an expert review to two investments entities: a Boston-based

angel group and an Italian business angel. We sent the elevator pitch assessment scorecard (see Table VI) to the managing directors of these investment companies and asked them to review the model to determine whether all the aspects have been properly identified and described. The managers provided general feedback on the framework, based on test applications of the framework in entrepreneurial meetings and evaluation sessions, along with amendments and suggestions for refinement.

A second application of the model was done in an engineering course for 25 undergraduate students focused on technological innovation and technology-based entrepreneurship. The course, held at the Department of Engineering for Innovation of the University of Salento, included about 80 hours of mixed theory development and practical training. A part of the learning process was dedicated to training the students to prepare and deliver an elevator pitch for a technology venture project. Fostering an entrepreneurial mindset and intentions, and networking skills in students is indeed a critical function of modern entrepreneurship programs [42], [86]–[88]. The

TABLE VII ELEVATOR PITCH ASSESSMENT MODEL “camp model” described in entrepreneurship education is focused on the generation or transformation of new ideas in concepts and basic plans [89]. In our application, we required students to prepare their pitches using the model as a design and evaluation scorecard, which was subsequently used by the instructors to define improvements and annotations on the presented pitch, and to formulate an evaluation.

Finally, we provided the model to three TEs engaged in product development and partner scouting activities. The entrepreneurs, working on a digital publishing project, a multiservice wine selling platform, and a digital-enhanced accommodation service, have interacted with one of the authors of this article for a number of mentoring sessions. The entrepreneurs were thus provided with the framework to support the preparation of business presentations and elevator pitches held in June and July 2020.

processes (information collection and interaction), and feedback.

These applications provided insights on the utility of the model as an integrative checklist to support the preparation of an elevator pitch or business meeting (entrepreneur and student perspective) or to evaluate the potential of an entrepreneurial project (investor and trainer perspective). The model can thus be a tool for those engaged in venture assessment and entrepreneurial evaluations. Two potential critical factors are that the number of items in the scorecard makes it complex to use in real time and that investment decisions are of course based on aspects beyond the business presentation (due diligence, personal knowledge, and other extra-presentation factors). Students found the scorecard useful to know in advance the criteria used to evaluate their work (process transparency) and the key points to focus on to improve the pitch. One point raised by the students is the need to accompany the scorecard with a more detailed guide or handbook. Finally, the framework provides useful insights on investors’ expectations and required evidence, and it can be a useful template for structuring a business presentation. However, customized versions of the model for specific audiences would be useful.

Although the application in different contexts may be constrained in terms of generalizability, the model offers an integrative definition of key general evaluation dimensions and items, which can be useful in different stakeholder contexts, with the real customization need being in terms of the choice and depth of information to convey to the specific audience.

who may support idea validation, construction, and execution. To convince potential investors, the entrepreneur normally uses a business or elevator pitch to share the value proposition and the deriving opportunities for engagement, establishing with the audience a sort of platform for communicative interaction [90]. The quality of the elevator pitch and its potential to persuade stakeholders to get involved in the entrepreneurial projects depend on a number of factors related to the presenter, the venture idea, and the narrative provided.

In this article, we have addressed the lack of a theory-based and integrative definition of these factors, and we have presented a systematic analysis of key evaluation dimensions affecting the quality and effectiveness of an elevator pitch, and the consequent evaluation of the potential new venture. We aim to propose a pragmatically oriented design [91] for evaluating entrepreneurial presentations and the potential of new venture ideas. The framework includes four areas related to background knowledge and preparation, pitching approach and style, content of the narration, and the logical flow of arguments made in the presentation. We have detailed these four areas by defining 19 items and related evidence that can support the assessment of an entrepreneurial pitch. We also validated our framework with two early stage investment experts, three TEs, and a group of 25 students.

Our research contributes to existing theory on entrepreneurship and business venturing by providing a framework that integrates a large but fragmented academic and practitioner knowledgebase on what constitutes a good entrepreneurial pitch. First, we complement previous attempts to identify success factors and drivers of positive investors’ decisions, which have been focused on specific emotional aspects [32], [76] or the use of speech and gestures to influence the audience [53]. In our article, the emotional

dimension is incorporated in the presenter-related aspects, which are complemented by three other types of quality drivers for an entrepreneurial pitch.

We found significant similarities and differences between our work and that of van Werven et al. [78]. In particular, although the focus and the nature of our findings are quite dissimilar, we share an attempt to provide an integrated framework to support further theory development and a relevant guidance for practitioners as well. The article by van Werven et al. [78] describes high-level claims that entrepreneurs make in their presentations, discounts claims by identifying underpinning or supporting arguments, and associates a number of rhetorical strategies. Claims and arguments are related to customer needs and the call for solution, the product and its benefits, the environment of the venture, the current and expected performance, the team’s composition and skills, and the funding needs or other “asks” directed to the audience. That study is thus the systematization of a good narrative along with claims and rhetorical strategies. Our work expands that contribution by identifying four areas of discussion in which claims are embedded. In particular, the content of claims and the rhetorical strategies are elements that are found in the content-related dimensions and in the entrepreneurial algorithm of our framework. Moreover, we also provide details and evidence for each item associated with the four areas.

# CONCLUSION

The creation of a new technology-based venture brings the potential entrepreneur to interact with a number of different actors and persuade them of the quality of the business project. In such an endeavor, entrepreneurial storytelling and business pitches are crucial to attract stakeholder interest and potential commitment. In this article, we systematically review the literature and identify 40 research articles from which we derive concepts associated with four areas that impact the quality and effectiveness of an elevator pitch. We further detail these areas by classifying 19 specific items and evidence types to support pitch delivery and evaluation, and undertake a preliminary application with three potential users of the framework.

This article has several limitations, which can also represent paths for future research. First, the model was validated only by submitting the framework to a single-validation process, although it is articulated in three contexts. A more extended scholarly evaluation—such as including technology entrepreneurship and business communication experts, and the application of real business venturing analysis—would support the definition of a more robust model. Second, although the scorecard is useful for evaluating an elevator pitch, its operationalization to support practical preparation and evaluation would require development of measurable items for each evaluation aspect of the scorecard.
