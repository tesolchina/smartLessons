The Three Minute Thesis (3MT) is an academic competition that challenges graduate students to explain their research in 3 minutes to a non-specialist audience. While there have been a few studies examining rhetorical moves and interactional metadiscourse in 3MT presentations, studies focusing on features related to comprehensibility, a key competition requirement, have been lacking. This study examines how highly-specialised research is made comprehensible to nonspecialist audiences through "code glosses", communication strategies that function to facilitate understanding by reformulating, explaining, or elaborating on what has been said (Hyland, 2005). Analysing a corpus of 50 successful 3MT presentations in the electrical and computer engineering discipline, we found code glosses to be one of the most frequently used interactive metadiscourse types in the data. Significantly, Analogies and Definitions emerged as salient-enough features in our data that we added them as additional categories of code gloss, extending Hyland's (2007) two categories of Exemplifiers and Reformulators. Our analysis shows how examples, definitions, analogies, and reformulations are used in distinct ways in 3MT presentations to make the presented research accessible, coherent, and engaging to audiences. Our findings expand current understandings of code glosses, and extend the current knowledge on the 3MT genre by providing insights into its distinctive linguistic features vis-a-vis comprehensibility.

# 1. Introduction

The nature of research dissemination has evolved over the years. With the marketisation of higher education (Fairclough, 1993) democratisation of science (Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2019; Nowotny, 2003), and growing acknowledgement of the importance of cross-disciplinary ollaborations (Ngai et al, 2018; Warriner  Miller, 2021) academic instiutions and scholars across he world are increasingly recognising the importance of effectively disseminating and communicating scientific research to diverse audiences, including specialists from other disciplines, administrators, industry partners, and the general public. Such science-related communication (with science understood in its broadest sense) which i targeted at non-specialist audiences has been described as \*science popularisation' (e.g. Perrault, 2013). Examples of conventional genres of science popularisations that have been studied are popular science magazine articles and boos (se e.g., Fahnestock, 1986; Hyland, 2010; Varghese & Abraham, 2004), and examples of newer forms or genres of science popularisations which have also attracted some scholarly attention include academic blos (e.g., Luzon, 2013), tweets (., Orpin, 2019), ED tlks (g., Matiello, 2019), \*0-second sciee" podasts (Ye, 2021), as well as hree inute Thesis (3MT) presentations (e.g., Hu & Liu, 2018).

The 3MT is an academic communication competition which challenges doctoral students tocondense a colossal research thesisinto a 3-minute presentation, accompanied by just a single static slide. Developed by The Universty of Queensland in 2008, this initiative enhances graduate students poken communication skils, which are "often marginalised' in graduate programmes that tend to focus more on thesis and reearch writing (krbis et al., 2010, p. 39), and also fosters graduate students aility to disseminate resarch to a wider audience than would typicall be reached by conventional research genres. The immediate competition audience omprises the judging panel, and faculty and graduate students from diverse disciplines, but because many 3MT presentations are posted online, there is also a larger, indeterminate global audience via the Internet. With the ability to communicate with diversified audiences recognised as a graduate attribute highly valued by employers (Rayner & Papakonstantinou, 2015) and a crucial yet challenging communication skil for early carer researchers (Merga & Mason, 2020), the 3MT has expanded from a local institutional event in Australia to a global event held in more than 900 universities across over 85 countries.

Despite the popularity of the 3MT competition and the recognition of the need for graduate students to develop competencies of communicating with non-specialist audiences, EAP research has continued to focus primarily on specialist genres such as research articles (Hafner & Mille, 2019). Only recently has the 3MT genre started toattract reearch attentio. Hu and Liu (2018) conducted the first empirical study on the 3MT by characterising the genre structure of 142 presentations in terms of eight rhetorical moves (Orientation, Rationale, Framework, Purpose, Methods, Results, Implication, and Termination). Other studies have identified similar moves in their 3MT corpus (e.g, Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020; Jiang & Qiu, 2022), explored the use of stance and engagement resources to interact with the audience across ifferent disciplines (e.g., Hyland & Zou, 2021, 2022; Qiu & Jiang, 2021), and examined the neoliberal discourse practices of the 3MT (Rossete-Crake, 2020). While the extant studies have produced useful insights into the linguistic pats of the 3, the i nt yt a focused investigation f lingistic fures relatd to omprehensbilit, one of the two key requirements of the 3MT competition (the other being engagement). According to the official judging criteria, the presentation needs to provide clear description of the background, research design, results, and so fort, of the reearch and to ensure that \*the language was appropriate for a non-specialist audience." 2

In this study, we draw on the notion of code glosses to provide an investigation of how such \*smallacts of reformulation and exemplification' (Hyland, 2007, p. 266) are used to make the specialised research comprehensible to the audience. We review the literature on code glosses in academic genres and descibe the corpus as well s the methods to analyse the data before presenting the findings and highlighting its implications. Our study extends the current knowledge on the 3MT genre by providing insights into its linguistic features vis-a-vis comprehensibility as well as itsdistinctiveness as an academic genre. We also contribute to the study of code glosses by proposing new categories to Hyland's code gloss framework.

# 2. Code glosses, metadiscourse, and academic genres

# 2.1. Code glosses and metadiscourse

While the termcode gloss was not used pecifically, the notion of code gloses has been studied in traditional grammar as forms of apposition that expres semantic relationships of equivalence or inclusion between two inguistic units of the same rank (Quirk et al. 1985). Within Systemic Functional Linguistics, the discussion of logico-semantic relations, particularly "expansion', which includes elaboration, extension and enhancement Halliday, 1994), relates to Hyland's (2007) notion of code glosses'. Elaboration occurs when "one clause elaborates on the meaning of another by further specifying or describing it" (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 461). It is emphasized that in elaboration the second unit does not introduce new element but \*provides afurther characterization f one that is already there, restating it clarifying i, refining it, or adding a descriptive attribute or comment (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 461). The meaning of a prior linguistic unit s elaborated by the subsequent noun phrases or clauses to provide further description as well as cohivetie. lly, the axplict iistic sias sch as like, for xmple, this mes, and  ther wors to inicate the elaboration and link the two units. Such signals, traditionall refrred to as"apposition markers, not only provide cohesive linking but also enhance clarity and persuasion while revealing the speaker's awareness f the audience. As Hyland (2007) argues, restricting such discourse features to "apposition markers' is therefore less productive than seeing them as metadiscourse markers.

Metadiscourse refersto the commentary on a text made by the speaker or writer to negotiate their ideas and relationships with thir audience in a particular context (Hyland, 2005, 2017). Scholars, particularly those adopting a broad approach to metadiscourse, call the above appositive or elaboration features "code gloses". As a type of metadiscourse, code glosses frst appeared in Vande Kopple's (1985) pioneering metadiscourse model and were defined as linguistic items that \*help the reader grasp the appropriate meanings of elements in texts" by defining, explaining or delimiting the glossed words (p. 84). In his metadiscourse model, Hyland (2005) ists code gloses as one of the five types of interactive metadiscourse (others are transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers and evidential), which "organise propositional information in ways that a projected target audience is likely to find coherent and convincing" (p. 50). Code glosses supply additional information to the audience by rephrasing, explaining or elaborating what has been said' to facilitate comprehension (Hyland, 2005, p. 52, emphasis added).

According to Hyland (2007), code glosses represent several "basic communication strategies used in the negotiation of meaning" (p. 269) in both spoken and written language and can be clasified into two main categories: reformulation and exemplification. Reformulation involves the processof rephrasing or reworking a prior unit to present it from a different perspective and reinforce the message, whers exmplifiction inoles the proessf llustrating a prior unt thouh eaple. Aordngl, theexplici inuistic signals (e.g., in other words, for exampl) for these code glossing processes are often referred to as reformulation/exemplification markers (Hyland, 2007), or reformulators/exemplifiers (Cao & Hu, 2014).

# 2.2. Code glosses in academic genres

Previous studies have focused specifically on the use of code glosses in academic writing (Hyland, 2007), or is specific forms, i.e, reformulation markers (Barabadi et al, 2021; Cuenca, 2003) and exemplification markers (Triki, 2021). Recently, some scholars have investigated the pedagogical use of exemplification strategies such as hypothetical scenario" (Nesi & Alsop, 2021) in university lectures to help explain highly abstract or technical concepts central to the discipline.

Much of the literature on code gloses is found in metaiscourse studies as part f their investigations into the overall metadiscourse features in various academic genres, with exceptions such as work by Triki (2021). Most of these examined written genres, such as journal articles (Ca0 & Hu, 2014; Hyland & Jiang, 2018), doctoral theses (El-Dakhs, 2018), textbooks (Hyland, 1999), and science popularisations (Crismore & Farnsworth, 1990). Some have analysed spoken genres, such as university lectures (Lee & Subtirelu, 2015) and TED talks (Mattillo, 2019), but, to the best of our knowledge, none has focused on 3MT presentations. The findings from most of these studies show that code gloss were infrequently used when compared with other interactive metadiscourse. For example, in their multidisciplinary journal article corpora of 2.2 million words, Hyland and Jiang (2018) found code glosses to be consistently one of the leas frequently adopted types of interactive metadiscourse. Similarly, both Hyland's (2004) study of doctoral theses and Lee and Subtirelu's (2015) analysis of university lectures found that ode glosses were les frequently used than other interactive metadiscourse such as transitions.

Given our focus on the non-specialis genre of 3MTs, previous investigations of code glosses in other non-specialist geres may offer more pertinent insights into this metadiscursive feature. The comparative analysis of textboos and journal articles by Hyland (1999) found a higher frequency of code gloses in textbooks than in journal articles. This genre dierence was explained in terms of the variation of audience and purpose: students, unlike experts, need more assistance in comprehension, and the frequent use of code glosses to provide definitions and additional information in textbooks could help clarif meanings considered to be problematic for the students. Therefore, we may surmise that there might be similar frequent use of code glosses in other non-specialist genres such as science popularisations as the audiences of these, lacking domain knowledge, may also need more explanations and elaborations. According to Hyland (2009) to reach a wider audience, popularisations may choose either to avoid jargons (hence eliminating the eed for code gloes r  offer gloses  tmnologies and expressions unfamilia to the non-specialist reders. Unfrtunately, other than providing some examples, Hyland (2005, 2009, 2010) did not provide quantitative results of code gloss in the science popularisations he examined, which could otherwise provide information about the relative frequency of code gloss in the genre. In another study involving science popularisations, Crismore and Farnsworth (1990) compared the metadiscursive features of a science journal article with its corresponding popular science article on the same topic and written by the same author. Surprisingly, code glosses were found to be infrequent in both texts. This was eft unaccounted for and might be due to factors such as small sample size (as only one popularisation text was examined). By contrast, Farahani and Kazemian's (2021) study of TED talks shows that code glosses are second only to transitios as the most frequent interactive metadiscourse feature in their corpus. As investigations into the use of code gloses in non-specialist or spoken genres are stil scarce it remains unclear if code gloses are inded a frequently-used feature in such genres.

Extant studies investigating academic blogs (Luzon, 2013), TED talks (Mattello, 2019), and 3MT presentations (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020) through lenses smilar o code glosses, however, did report frequent occurrences of such features. For instance, the recontextualisation "strategies to tailor information' (Luzon, 2013) used by Carter-Thomas and Rowley-Jolivet (2020) in their qualitative study of 30 3MT presentations share similaritie to code glosse inthe use of specific devices such as providing definitions, examples and analogies suggesting the possbility of finding frequent use of code glosses in 3MT presentations. It i also worth noting that while recontextualisation includes ll instances of information-tailoring strategies code glosses consider only those that function to elaborate a prior discourse unit (Hyland, 2007).

Different from previous studies on the 3MT, our study focuses specificaly on code gloses, taking into account only those strategies that elaborate on prior discourse. We have also limited our analysis here to one discipline and to writen transcriptions. This focus enables us to provide a more detailed analysis of the features of the 3MT vis-a-visthe linguistic forms and functions of code glosses in contributing to the comprehensibility of the presentation. Specifically, we aim to address the fllwing question: How are 3MT presentations made comprehensible to the audience through code glosses?

# 3. Corpus and analysis

Our corpus comprises 50 3MT presentations delivered between 2013 and 2019 by PhD students in the follwing countries: Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore. They were randomly selected from a poo of videos posted on the official 3MT website (https://threeminutethesis uq.eduau/) as well as YouTube, Vimeo and university websites. All elected presentations met three data selection criteria (1) The presentations were delivered by PhD students studying in English-speaking countries, so as to minimise the potential influence of the student's English language proficiency on presentation performance. (2) The presentations were iven by presenters in their university's final-round competitions. This ensured that the presentations in our data set would be reasonably effective and successul instantiations of the genre. Presentations in national or regional contests were excluded so as to maintain the homogeneity of the data sample in the corpus (Adolphs & Carter, 2013). (3) All presentations were from the discipline of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Previous studies of 3MTs have often examined presentations from various disciplines with the aim of establishing potential disciplinary differences in discourse features. As our aim is to examine how the presenters discourse choices may be influenced by and representative of the nature of the 3MT genre, we decided to collect data from only one discipline so as to be able to attribute most, if not all of our findings to the genre factor, rather than having toconsider the potential additional variable of disciplinary diffrences. We posit that unlike the discipline-based nature of academic writing, academic talks may be more homogeneous in nature (see Swales, 2004, p. 205) Likewise, in their study of 3MT presentations, CarterThomas and Rowley-Jolivet (2020) have also reported that there were "few notable diffrences between disciplines' (p. 12)

The discipline of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) was chosen, mainly because our online search showed that it is one of the disciplines with the largest number of 3MT presentation videos available online. ECE is an engineering discipline focused on developing and applying technologies such as signal processing, artificial intelligence, computing and power systems by integrating electrical and electronic systems (Batten, 2013; https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-electrical-engineering). ECE technologies have widespread application, including in electronic devices, medical imaging devices, Internet of Things, among others. After the videos were chosen, we transcribed them verbatim and orthographically with punctuation added for ease of reading. To ensure transcription accuracy, each of the transcribed texts was also audit-checked against the videos by two to three independent and highly proficient English speakers who hold master's degrees in applied linguistics or education. The proofread transcripts, together with a hyperlink to the online video, were then imported into MAxQDA (version 18.2.2) for data coding and analysis. Table 1 provides the metadata for our corpus.

The first step of analysis was a move analysis (Swales, 2004). This was conducted to provide a macro-level view of the data to facilitate our subsequent identification and interpretation of the functions of various metadiscourse devices within specific moves. To identify the rhetorical moves of 3MT presentations, we combined Hu and Liu's (2018) eight-move 3MT model with Swales (2004) "Create a Research Space (CARS) model so as to create streamlined five-move model for the purposes of this study. Previous research has shown that acombination of the CARS model with other models can better describe the move structure of spoken academic genres such as conference presentation introductions (see e.g., Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2005).

Given that the main focus of Hu and Liu (2018) was to provide a detailed map of the generic structure/stages of 3MT presentations whereas the current study focuses on providing a detailed micro-level linguistic analysis of the use of a specific metadiscursive feature (code glosses), referencing rhetorical moves only to contextualise the discussion, we felt that using the eight moves from Hu and Liu (2018) might lead to an unnecesarily detailed analysis and that simpler five-move model would sufie for the purposes of this study (See Table 2.).It will be noted that Hu and Liu's (2018) Purpose, Methods and Results moves have been conflated as one move, Occupying the Niche. The Rationale and Framework moves have also been replaced by Establishing a Niche. Other moves were also renamed, and functional descriptions revised, but they are more or lessimilar to the original. These moves are treated or retained as separate moves because of their distinct rhetorical functions and how they work to highlight the unique features of the 3MT.

The moves were annotated by the irst author, following arecurrent process of data coding, discussion with the other two authors, and inter-coder reliability checking. The inter-coder was an Applied Linguisics PhD student with published research on move analysis and the agreement reached $9 3 \%$ based on independent coding of ${ \bf 1 0 \% }$ of the data. Where there were differences in the analysis of individual cases, these were resolved through discusson among the authors, leading to the refinement of the coding scheme and recoding of the data. It should be noted that the 3MT presenters do not always follow a linear order of moves s shown in Table 2, and some moves (e.g., Establishing a Niche and Occupying the Niche) tend to occur recursively.

After conducting the move analysis, we coded and analysed the instances of code glosses in the presentations. We started with Hyland's (2007) two categories of Reformulators (or \*reformulation markers") and Exemplifiers ("exemplification markers") sing Hyland's (2005) list f potential code glossitems as a sarting point, we first conducted a preliminary analysis by searching the corpus for those frequently-occurring itms from the literature. We then conducted a bottom-up analysis by carefull reading each speech text and manuall identifying and annotating additional items that function metadiscursively but were not included in the search list These included items such as like, just imagine and let us picture (see these words incontext in Table 6, and a full lis of the code glosses from our data in the Appendix).

To Hyland's two categories of code glosses, we added two categories - Definitions and Analogies, based on our preliminary analysis. First, in analysing our data, we found that offering deintions to explain concepts unfamilia to the non-specialist audience is a frequent feature in our corpus. Giving definitions was in fact one of Vande Kopple's (1985) three discourse functions of code glosses (the other two being explaining and delimiting), and it was also addressed in Hyland's (2007) discussion of the \*reformulation) category. Our decision to introduce this third category of code glosses was also influenced by Adel (2006), who highlighted that definitions are metadiscursive by nature given that \*Igliving definitions is commenting on language" (p. 117). While Adel's analysis was limited to instances of defintions with explicit markers or what she called iscourse Labels (e., is defined as), Triki (2019) in a more recent study made a case for treating instances of definitions without explicit lexical signals as metadiscourse. Her main argument is that such instances of definitions function in the same way as those with a definition marker such as define, to establish equivalence between defined and defining units. She further suggested that the copular verb be, often seen in classcal definitions, could be considered as a definition marker, similar to those explicit ones such as define. Therefore, in coding our data, we included instances of defintions with low explicit forms (e.g, through syntactic apposition or copular is) so as not to miss these metadiscourse instances that may reflect potentially important features of the genre.

Second, in analysing our data, we found that presenters were frequently using analogies drawn from experiences and concepts from outside the sphere of the specialist rearch. A long-established discursivestrategy to help audiences understand technical, astract or unfamiliar phenomenon and to advance one's argument (Heywood, 2002; Mazzi, 2012), analogies work by creating a likeness a parallel, acorrespondence or some kind of similarity (van Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992, p. 97) between two things. But while scholars have disussed the use f "analy markers (eg, like as and similar) in discipline-basd writing (Mazz, 2012), to the best of our knowledge, analogies have not been regarded as a distinct and separate type of code glos. The closest we come to this is in Hyland's (2007) discussion of exemplification, in which \*providing a paralle or similar case (p. 279) was mentioned as one of the functions f exemplification. However, the examples given by Hyland are not analogie per e (e.g., Atradition may be reflective and designed, like the deliberations of th Supreme Court ..). ased on the analysis of our data, we identified Analogies as a separate category f ode gloss dueo ther abilit to elaborate  prior unit to faclitate the adiences understandng, and ecause the function differently from instances of Exemplification and Reformulation. As we show in ection 4.4, analogies play an indispensable role in the 3MT to make the research comprehensible to the non-specialist audience.

The coding of code glosses was done by the first author of this paper. To ensure coding reliability, a researcher who holds a PhD in Applied Linguistcs and is well versed in metadiscourse analysis was invited to be a "second coder for this study. Both the first author and the second coder worked independently on $1 0 \%$ of the data and achieved an inter-coder agreement of $9 5 \%$ before resolving differences through discussion. The rest of the data was coded by the same author, who recoded $3 0 \%$ of the instances three months after the initial coding with full agreement between the two.

The instances were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis served to provide a broad overview of how code glosses are used in our data. The raw frequencies were normalised to 1000 words to enable a comparative asesment to be made between the relative frequencies of the features in our corpus and those reported in the literature. The qualitative analysis allowed us to examine the use f code gloses in context, and to identify distinctive uses of this feature in 3MTs. In combination, the analyses worked to offer a nuanced picture of the 3MT as an interesting academic genre produced within a very specific context.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Overall use of code glosses in 3MT presentations

We identified a total of 210 instances of code gloses in the corpus, with an average of 4.2 instances per presentation. This high frequency featured prominently as the second most frequent type of interactive metadiscourse in our corpus (the results for the other interactive metadiscourse types are reported separately Liu, 2022]). Other interesting patterns and forms have also been observed in the specific uses of code glosses in the corpus. Table 3 shows the frequency of Exemplifiers, Definitions, Analogies, and Reformulators in the corpus. It can be seen that Exemplifiers were employed almost as frequently as Definitions, Analogies, and Reformulators combined. This indicates that the 3MT presenters in our corpus often helped the audience comprehend the research by llustrating and clarifying the content through examples, while also, though les frequently, providing definitions, making comparisons, and rephrasing what has ben said. In terms of representation across the corpus, the percentage of presentations that each category of code gloss was found in ranged from $4 0 \%$ to $8 0 \%$ In the following analysis, we discuss in detail these specific code glossing features, including those patterns and forms possibly specific to the 3MT genre.

Fig. 1 below illstrates the distribution of the four categories of code gloses across the five identified rhetorical moves f the 3MT presentations. It is clear that code glosses occurred mostly in Establishing a Niche and Occupying the Niche, and very infrequently in other moves such as Claiming Significance. This indicates that code glosses were mainly used to help explain the research background and clarify the presenter's own research methods and results, whil only occasionally use for other purposes such as to explicate the implications of the research. These will be elaborated on in the following sections.

# 4.2. Exemplification in 3MT presentations

A total of 100 Exemplifiers were found in 40 presentations ( $8 0 \%$ of the corpus). To illustrate the meaning of a prior unit, Exemplifiers in the corpus function to supply example to illstrate abstract or technical concepts in order to help the audience understand the presenter's research. In what follows, we adopt the following conventions: the prior discourse unit to be exemplified (defined, clarified through analogy, or reformulated) is underlined, the metadiscourse markers (e.g., Exemplifiers) are indicated in bold italics, and the exemplification (or definition or analogy or reformulation)i in italics. Table 4 shows examples of Exemplifiers in our corpus.

As shown in Table 4, the presenters supplied specific examples of "sensory loss", "neurological conditions", \*minorities", and IOT applications to aid in the non-specialist audience's comprehension of these technical and non-technical concepts. Even if some ter. minology (e.g. "minorities") may not be entirely incomprehensible to audiences, the provision of pecific examples in the 3MT is an important way for presenters to clarify the specific ways in which they are using particular terms in their work, and/or to focus the audience atention on aspects that are most pertinent. Such exemplification functions in a way similar to Hyland's (2007) observation of the use of examples by academic writers to elaborate a general category of event, people or phenomenon by providing particular instances. In terms of linguistic signals, the most frequent Exemplifiers in the corpus are like (35 occurrences) and such as (28 occurrences). This pat differs from Hyland's (2007) finding which showed like being used much le frequently than such as, which is not surprising due to the spoken nature of our data. In sum, through the provided examples, the concepts referred to in the pre sentations were made accessble to the audience helping them comprehend the research background and the presenter's own reseach.

# 4.3. Definitions in 3MT presentations

Definitions are the first new category of code glosses we are adding in this study. A total of 41 Definitions were found in 27 presentations $5 4 \%$ of the corpus). Our analysis found that they functioned in two major ways to facilitate the audience's comprehension: 1) providing research background (21 instances) and 2) explaining research methods (20 instances):

First, Definitions can be used to provide the audience with general background to the research presented. For instance,the pre. senter in Example (4) in Table 5 opened her presentation with a definition of the thyroid, a smal organ in our neck that produces hormones, before moving on to some statistics on the people with thyroid diseases. Opening a presentation with a formal definition was rare in our dat. Most instances of such Definitions in our corpus ocurred much later in the presentation. For instance, the term "molecular communication" (Example (5) in the presentation entitled Talking Like Bacteria" was not introduced until the talk reached the middle point. Similarl, apresentation on "computational thinking (Example (6) started with a story of what average ten-year-old pupils like to do with computers before introducing the key concept of the research on the application of computational thinking skills to primary school learning.

Worth noting at this point are instances of Definitions in our data where the item to be glossed appears after the Defintion rather than before. (Examples (7) and (8) in Table 5 are representative of such instances.) As code glosses are typically astrategy used to elaborate on prior discourse, we consider instances such as these to be exceptions to the norm. In Example (7), we see the presenter providing the Definition, an aessible explanation of what \*polysomnography' involves, before the technical term \*polysomnography" is introduced. And in Example (8), we note that the acronym MRI, frequently used in medical circles, is firs spelled out in full Magnetic Resonance Imaging" before the acronym is ued.

subsequently abbreviated items to be "definitions" of the abbreviations, where acronyms appear in our data alongside their full versions, we have considered the latter to be Definitions.

Second, Definitions are also often used to explain the presenter's research methods. As illustrated in Examples (9) to (11), the key terms \*thermodynamics", "energy harvesting" and "airborne network" were first introduced in the presentation of the research background and later defined by the presenters when they were explaining their methods. Given the non-specialist profileof the audience, the provision of definitions to these key terms, which might not always be needed in a more traditional academic presentation (such as a conference presentation), is an important way to help the audience beter comprehend how the research was (going to be) conducted.

Apart from their discourse functions, we also note some interesting findings with regard to the linguistic or formal features of the Definitions in our corpus. First, Definitions can be presented through naming (Triki, 2019), acronyms, or formal definitions. Naming instances are reversed definitions which provide a technical term (via signals such as known as) for something already explained in accessible language, as shown in Example (7) in Table 5. Acronyms can also be provided (via words such as or) with or without the naming process mentioned above to explain technical terms (see Example (8), and the short forms (e.g., MRI) would be frequently referred to in the subsequent discourse. This i perhaps because using acronyms can facilitate both the delivery and understanding given the extremely short length and non-specialist nature of the presentation. In total, we observed 14 instances of naming and introducing acronyms, while the remaining 27 of Definitions are considered as "formal definitions (Flowerdew, 1992), where the technical terminology is presented before the explanation, meaning, or elaboration is provided.

Second, for these formal definitions, the majority belong to what Flowerdew (1992) would call yntacticall signalled definitions, which use syntactic features such as copula BE, apositions, and relative clauses to \*relate the classto the characteristic" (p. 212) Definitions of such instances are realised through the following three syntactic patterns.

i) they are realised in a single sentence pattern of either A term/phrase $^ +$ copular BE + defining unit, forming the classical definition pattern of \*An A is a B which C' (Flowerdew, 1992, p. 209), or A term/phrase $^ +$ appositive noun phrase. Eleven such instances of Definitions were identified in the data (see Examples (4) and (9)).   
ii) There are 10 instances of the pattern A term/phrase $^ +$ relative clause, where the relative clauses are often introduced by which/ where/in which, as illustrated in Examples (5), (6), and (11). In academic writing, the use of where and when in definitions is considered "overly informal' to readers (Swales & Feak, 2012, p. 73), but we note that these do appear in 3MT presentations.   
ii Defintions can also be realise through more than one sentence where the term to be defined i first inroduced at the end of the first sentence and then substituted by referential items such as this, these and they in the subsequent sentence. There are three such instances in our data, one of which is shown in Example (10).

In sum, Defintions are used in 3MTs to help the audience better understand the presented research. Through Definitions, speci alised terms or concepts are made comprehensible to the non-specialist audience. The recognition of the role played by Defintions in contributing to the comprehensibilit of the discourse has led us to introduce this as a distinct category of code gloses, alongside Exemplification, Reformulation, and Analogy.

# 4.4. Analogies in 3MT presentations

Analogies are the second new category of code glosses we propose. There are 40 such instances in 24 presentations $4 8 \%$ of the corpus). These are instances where presenters make use of comparisons that draw on familiar experiences or concepts from outside the sphere of the specialist research in order to help the audience understand the technical content or concepts being presented. Using linguistic signals such as like and just as, Analogies therefore work to ilustrate the specialised or abstract concepts and make the unfamiliar familiar.

As instantiated in Examples (12) to (15) of Table 6, words such as like, ust like and it's ike are used to introduce short comparisons or analogies that appeal to familiar or concrete experiences. Mundane experiences and activities such as taking pictures, online shopping, and observing traffc at an intersection, and everyday object (eg., paper) are drawn upon by the presenters to explain the highly technical content of CAT scans, quantum communication, drone data exchange and \*Vapor Deposition (a technique for developing semiconductor materials for electronic devices). Without the aid of these analogies, the technical content in the prior unt might be challenging for most non-specialist audiences to comprehend.

Aside from the short analogies just discussed, there are several more extensive ones involving the creating of imaginary scenarios. These might be thought of as extended analogies which function to either \*make examples or descriptions more vivid and pertinent" (Adel, 2006, p. 76) or "explain a complex event" (Ciapuscio, 203, p. 212) to the non-specialist audience, and there were seven such instances in the corpus. As llustrated in Table 6 Example (16), a presenter seeking to explicate how his research on a new ultrasound imaging technology calld CMUT would be significant and beneficial draws his audience into the presentation by asking them to imagine a scenario where they are undergoing a physical check-up in a doctor's office. Similarly in Example (17), the presenter il lustrates his research on how delays of communication might be minimised in a network of drones by inviting the audience to \*picture" cars in trffic choosing optimal routes in a busy city. In both examples, a familia scene is invoked to help the non-specialist audience towards understanding the complex and highly specialised content.

To sum up, Analogies of varying lengths are used to draw on experiences and things which are familiar to the audience and from outside the sphere of the specialist research. This way of using code gloses in the 3MT genre renders specialised research topics, complex technical concepts, and the social significance of the research more accessble, vivid, and relatable to the non-specialist audience.

# 4.5. Reformulation in 3MT presentations

Reformulators, which work to rephrase a prior unit and reinforce the message (Hyland, 2007), accounted for about $1 4 \%$ of the code glosses. A total of 29 instances were identified in 20 presentations ( $4 0 \%$ of the corpus), and the majority occurred in the Establishing a Niche and Occupying the Niche moves. Table 7 provides examples of Reformulators in our corpus.

Reformulators in the corpus were used to rework concepts and numbers, as llustrated in Table 7 Examples (18) to (21). Signalled linguistically in the corpus mainly by that is, which means (that), and this means (that), Reformulators used in this way explicate the meaning of technical concepts, non-technical/abstract content and numerical figures in the prior discourse unit,so as to facilitat the audience's comprehension and ster them toward the preferred interpretations. Three broad pattrns were observed in the data.

First, Reformulators were used to rework technical oncepts in a prior discourse unit, so that it would be better understood by the audience. In Example (18), for instance, the underlined discourse units contain the technical concepts "non-modifiable, and nontransferable", and these are \*reworked, gloed and expressed in an alternative way (represented in the italicise portion) so as to provide more clarity and reinforce the message.

Second, it is worth noting that it i not only highly specialised content which might be reformulated in 3MTs. Even content which is less technical and not particularly abstract could also be rephrased to spell out the implication' of the research and/or the practical benefit to the audience. Such instances of Reformulators ften occurred in the Claim Significance move where presenters were discussing the social implications of their findings. In Example (19), the reformulation (in itlics) of the underlined discourse units serves to enable the speakers to steer audiences towards particular preferred interpretations (Hyland, 2007) that reinforce the positive im plications of their findings.

Third, numerical figures which were reported in the 3MT presentations were also frequently reworked and recast in more concrete and immediately accessble terms to help the live audience process the meaning and significance of what might be fairly abstract numerical data. Such reformulations typicall occurred in our corpus when the speakers cted numerical data whil trying to create a research pace (i.., in the Establish a Niche move), for example, to establish the scale of the problem to be investigated (see Examples (20) and (21). In both examples, the reformulation of the numerical data cited (underlined) into a form that was likely more easily processed and more immediately comprehensibl to the audience (italicised) appeared to not only simply explain the data but also create an impact on the audience.

In sum, the above analysis has demonstrated the ways Reformulators work in 3MTs to make the presented research accessible to the non-specialist audience. Reformulation might be applied to both language and numerical data, and both highly-technical content as well as content that i not especially technical. It isclear that Reformulators play an indispensable role in the 3MT, a genre that prioritises ensuring the comprehensibility of research dissemination to a non-specialist audience.

# 5. Discussion

Our study set out to addressthe question of how 3MT presentations are made comprehensible to the audience through code glosses. Code glosses have been reported to be one of the most frequently used types of interactive metadiscourse in a previous study (Liu, 2022), with transitions being the most frequently used followed by code glosses and frame markers It is possile that th frequent use of code gloses is a response to the requirement in the 3MT judging critria that the language used be \*appropriat for a non-specialist audience In addressing this requirement, resenters might choose either o void or to reduce the use of jargon or specialised terms. While presenters are advised to avoid jargons and academic language", the presence of many specialised terms in our corpus, such as "MRI, \*EEG", and \*start-stop applications", suggests that most presenters have chosen to offer the terms and explain them. This is perhaps because specialised terms often constitute the key concepts of the presenters' highly specialised doctoral research, and some use of these terms may be unavoidable. Apart from the need to clarify specificterms, part of making the language of the presentation "appropriat for a non-specialist audience also means that presenters need to elaborate and rework their abstract or technical content in various ways, making the research background, results and significance of their research accessble to the audience, as our analysis in the previous sections has shown.

The genre-specific factors mentioned above could explain why the frequency of code glosses in our 3MT corpus is higher than that found in most studies of other written and spoken academic genres (e.g., Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Jiang, 2018; Le & Subtirelu, 2015), including science popularisations (Crismore & Farnsworth, 1990). For instance, both Hyland's (2004) study of doctoral theses and Lee and Subtirelu's (2015) study of universty lectures show that code glosses only ranked in third place among the interactive metadiscourse features in the respective corpora. This is notable because university lectures are, like 3MTs, also a spoken genre, and the nature of the audience (non-specialists in 3MTs and novices in university lectures isimilar. It is possible, then, that the unique communicative settings of the 3MT (e.g., explit competition requirements and criteria, heterogenous audience make-up) may have prompted the greater use of code gloes. In fact from a diffrent lens, Carter-Thomas and Rowley-Jolivet (2020) also observed that 3MT presenters in thir corpus deployed many \*recontextualisation' strategies which share similarities to code glosses in the use of specific devices such as defintions and analogies to facilitate comprehension. In sum, the frequent use of code glosses not only un. derlies the primacy of elaborating content in the 3MT context to facilitate the non-specialist audience's comprehension but also points to a distinctive feature of the genre.

Several salient observations emerged as we qualitatively analysed the diffrent categories of code glosses in our 3MT corpus. First, we highlight the importance of Defintions in our analysis of code glossing strategies and how they enhance the comprehensibilit of the presentation. Definitions play an important role in helping the audience understand the background and methodological aspects f the reported research. Some of them are referred to in the literature as \*nominal" or \*naming" definitions (Flowerdew, 1992; Triki, 2019), whereby the speaker switches from non-technical to technical expressions. Similar observations of \*frequent switching from colloquial to technical language and vice versa' have also been made in doctor-patient conversations, a kind of expert to non-expert communication (Gilich, 2003, p. 240). Similarl, Mattillo (2019) observed that TED talks given by medical experts to non-specialist audiences oten defined and described the medical phenmena (., diease, cell before supplying a label to refer to it. Gilich (2003) suggests such switches indicate both the tiloring of information to non-experts and the construction of expert identit. In the context of 3MTs, thee instances f switching from accesbl language to technical terms involve the use of Defintions to ensureaccuracy and construct an expert identity.

Second, the use of both short and extended analogies drawing on everyday experiences and familiar concepts from outside of the field of specialist research emerged as being a significant feature in our corpus. While such analogies are not particularl common in canonical academic genres such as journal articles and dissertations, it is worth noting that they have been identified in science popularisations such as blogs (Luzon, 2013) and TED talks (Mattillo, 2019), which also utilise analogies to reduce the pecificity and technicalit f the content and make specialist knowledge accessible and engaging to non-specialist audiences (Mattiello 2019). Analogies feature in $4 8 \%$ of the presentations in our corpus, making it an important strategy for enhancing comprehensibility in 3MTs. In particular, the use of imaginary scenarios as extended analogies was observed to be an interesting and distinct feature of the 3MT presentations in our corpus. The presence of imaginary scenarios in 3MTs was earlier noted in Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas (2019), and Carter-Thomas and Rowley-Jolivet (2020). Describing the use of "scenarios" as a particular feature of the 3MT genre" when compared with other academic genres (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020, p.7), they found 8 instances of "scenarios" in a corpus of 15 3MT speeches in their earlier 2019 study, which is rlatively more than our study. It i worth pointing out that their work employed a slightly diffrent analytical lens, that of \*'recontextualisation', and they included allinstances of imaginary scenarios without considering if thir role was to elaborate (or not) any prior discourse unit. In the present study, only those scenarios elabo. rating a prior unit were counted. It is also worth noting that Nesi and Alsop's (2021) examination of the pedagogical use of imaginary scenarios in university lectures found frequent use of hypothetical scenarios to laborate technical terms and complex concepts central to the discipline. Like Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas' work, Nesi and Alsop's analysis was not undertaken from a metadiscourse perspective, and hence their identified instances of scenarios were not necessrily oriented towards the audience and contained those spoken by a third party, i.e, not the lecturer (see Nesi & Alsop, 2021, pp. 45). Taking into consideration the extreme short length of the 3MT and the extensive textual length required to create imaginary scenarios, it is of significance that 3MT presenters choose to employ imaginary scenarios, not only to help explain specialist terms or concepts, as ecturers do, but also to communicate the social significance of the research (see Example 16) in a more tangible and effective way to non-specialist audiences.

Third, even though Reformulators are used les frequently in our corpus as compared to other code glossing strategies, it is the variety of the kinds of rformulation that 3MT presenters engage in - with both language and numerical data, with both abstract or technical content as well as non-abstract or non-technical content - that make this a characteristic f the 3MT genre which priorities comprehensibility.

Our identification of Definitions and Analogies as istinct categories of code gloss i a significant contribution of ths study into how code glosses are used to aid comprehension in 3MT presentations. In the analysis of our data, Analogies (to explain highly technical and specialised reearch by drawing on experiences, concepts, and ideas familiar to the audience and fromouside the sphere f the specidlist research) and Definitions (to explain concepts and terminology unfamiliar to audiences) had emerged as salient-enough features of 3MTs that we added these as additional categories of code glosses, extending Hyland's (2007) two original categories of Exemplifiers and Reformulators. Our analysis complements the extant studies of similar 3MT features (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020) by providing a more nuanced description of how definitions and analogies are used to tailor information to the 3MT audience. It should be noted that while the use of analogy asa comprehensibility trategy has also be reported in several studies of science popularisations (e.g., Calsamiglia & van Dijk, 2004; Ciapuscio, 2003; Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2019; Scoto di Carlo, 2014), these earlier studies have not viewed analogies specifically as types of code gloses, and our proposal here to view analogies as a distinct category of code glos, based on our consideration of how they functioned in our corpus, might also be seen as a contribution to the field's understanding of code glosses more generally.

Taken together, it is the "'small acts of elaboration, embellishment, and clarfication' (Hyland, 2007, p. 266) used by 3MT presenters that help them create ccessible, coherent, and convincing presentations. While it may be thecase that certain features, such as making analogies and creating scenarios, can also be found in science popularisations such as TED talks or pedagogical genres such as universty lectures, it is the 3MT's frequent and diverse use of code glossing strategies, all of which occur in a compact mini-presentation, that distinguishes it as aunique mix of academic, pedagogical, and popularisation discourse features. The hybridty of the 3MT discourse is likely the result of the unique rhetorical context of presenting one's research to a non-specialist audience in a tightly regulated academic competition within the wider context of the marketisation of higher education.

The findings of this study may prove useful to both graduate students preparing to deliver 3MT or other non-specialist academic presentations, as wellas teachers providing istruction on such presentations. To make research findings and implications accessible and meaningful, aes that might be usefull focused on include the use of elaboration and reformulation strategies (such as supplying concrete example, using analogies, and rephrasing content), and the useof definitions to help audiences grasp key terms and concepts. What isvital in any pedagogic application of our findings is for teachers and graduate students to be aware of the rhetorical context of the presentation and how and why certain code glossing strategies, when used at particular stages of the presentation, may serve to engage audiences and enhance comprehension. The various linguistic forms and structures identified in this study could be used as teaching materials in lectures or workshops to scaffold students' mastery of the unique rhetorical features of the 3MT.

We acknowledge the limitations of our study, particularly regarding the size and representativeness of the corpus. Our presentations are sampled from one discipline and findings thus need to be interpreted with caution. While we anticipate that most of the code glossing features identified in this study would be applicable to all disciplines given that the 3MT is a genre targeted at nondiscipline-specific audiences, it would be useful for future studies to examine if similar patterns and linguistic forms of ode glosses can inded also be found in 3MTs delivered by students of other disciplines. We would also point out that comprehensibility is a complex construct, and code glosses are but one feature of 3MTs that help to make the presented research accessible and engaging to the audience. We also acknowledge that other features such as rhetorical moves (e.g., Hu & Liu, 2018), recontextualisation strategies (e.g., Bondi et al., 2015; Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020), the selection of content from the speaker's PhD thesis to be presented, and multimodal nature of the communication could also affct the comprehensibility of the spech. Future research might explore other discourse features that work towards the same goal, for example how gestures might contribute to comprehensibility or how the single slide works together with the spoken language to provide clarity to audiences.

# 6. Conclusion

This study set out to explore how 3MT presentations are made comprehensible to the audience through the use of code glosses. Our fine-grained analysis of the use of code glosses sheds light on how the use of exemplification, definitions, analogies, as well as reformulation helps presenters create audience-friendly, coherent, and engaging presentations. Through examining how code gloses are used in 3MT, we hope that we have contributed to a better understanding of this increasingly important academic genre in higher education.
