# BALEAP news – Introduction to SIGs: Meet the STEM SIG

The STEM SIG was set up in April 2022 to connect, support and encourage EAP professionals working at higher education in stitutions in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.

STEM education is an exciting area of EAP. Not only can we explore the differences between STEM EAP and general EAP, but also the notable commonalities which are valuable to understand and highlight. Moreover, STEM EAP can vary considerably depending on level of study, context (support or credit bearing) and discipline. There can even be considerable variation within a discipline. Several members of the group are working on cross-campus initiatives, which adds another interesting perspective.

Working in a highly specialised area can feel quite isolating, so opportunities like this to share experience across institutions are a key part of support and professional development.

Since launching in 2022, we have run a number of online sessions led by members worldwide. These have been opportunities to share experiences, our own research and discuss published papers.

Reading relevant research articles is an important means of continuing professional development. However, the volume of pub lished research can make it time consuming to identify and digest relevant papers. Therefore, Patrick Fitzgerald suggested ‘Three Minute Papers’. These are an opportunity for members to share key points from a paper or resource which they have found useful in their work. In the current format key points from the paper are presented at an online meeting. This is followed by a discussion of how the issues raised by the paper impact on participants teaching contexts. Participants have an opportunity to read the full paper before the event. Four ‘Three Minute Paper’ events have been held to date, covering the following topics: Authenticity in learning materials development; Thesis/dissertation writing; Phrasal and clausal complexity in undergraduate students' academic writing and evaluating prior scholarship in literature reviews of research articles. Feedback suggests that the current format has worked well and that there is potential to develop this further.

Collaborations started through the STEM SIG have also led to contributions at BALEAP events. In 2022, Laura Duncan and Ana Vuˇci´cevi´c recorded a lightning talk as part of the BALEAP 50th Anniversary Event entitled ‘Interdisciplinarity and Collaboration Perspectives from STEM’. At the BALEAP Biennial Conference in April 2023, Lori-Ann-Milln, Sanchia Rodrigues, Natasha Rust and Aaron Woodcock enjoyed meeting some of you at the SIG fair and leading a lively symposium, ‘Deconstructing student needs in EAP for STEM’ where they discussed the differences and the commonalities between ESAP for the various STEM disciplines. They highlighted how meeting student needs was very much dependent on the resources and time provided by the institution. With this, they could focus on the specific discourse, genre and register required for successful communication in the field. They also mentioned how important the relationships built with the faculty are and the need for ongoing collaboration. There was great engagement and interest from the audience – the team are continuing to answer questions from the talk on our website: https://baleapstemsig.wordpress.com/2023/04/ 19/event-deconstructing-student-needs-in-eap-for-stem/

If you are interested in the STEM SIG, please visit our website at https://baleapstemsig.wordpress.com/There are details of up coming events and how to join the mailing list as well as a chance for you to tell us about your interest in STEM.

Alternatively, you can email us at stem@baleap.org.

We want our SIG to be an active community, and are pleased that our events so far have been led by a wide range of people from different institutions. Please get in touch if you've got an idea, ranging from a question you'd like discussed to research you would like to share. We would love to hear from you.
