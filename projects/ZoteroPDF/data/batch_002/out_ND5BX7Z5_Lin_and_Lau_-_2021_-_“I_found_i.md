Evaluation has been identified as a significant feature of both written and spoken academic discourse. However, few studies have discussed how evaluative language is used to construct meaning in oral defenses, and even less is known about the topic in oral defenses conducted in English as a lingua franca contexts. To fill this research gap, the present study draws on Martin and White's (2005) appraisal theory to quantitatively and qualitatively examine evaluative language in a corpus of English-medium Master's thesis defenses carried out in Taiwan universities. The results show that the three attitudinal resources were used to surprisingly similar extent, which suggests that the theses and oral presentations preceding the Q&A sessions are objectively appreciated, that the examiners are emotionally affected, and that the candidates' abilities, particularly their research capacity, are being judged. This phenomenon can be attributed to the common academic discourse convention of objectifying the subjective practice of the evaluating entity and the physical presence of the participants. Examiners draw on expressions of subjective feelings to personalize their evaluative discourse, which contributes to the creation of interpersonal relationships during these high-stakes assessment events. This effect is enhanced by the use of evoked attitude type and graduation.

# 1. Introduction

Evaluation has been identified as asignificant feature of both written and spoken academic discourse; as Hyland and Diani (2009, p. 5) note, "mong all the activities of the academy, what academics mainly do is evaluate'. Evaluation functions to establish academics authority and the credibility of their own research (Itakura & Tsui, 2011), in addition to advancing scientific knowledge (Vanden. broucke & De Craen, 2001). The last two decades have seen extensive research on evaluative linguistic resources such as hedging expressions (Hyland, 1998), boosters (Silver, 2003), atitude marker (Conrad & Biber, 200), stance markers (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016), reporting verbs (Thompson & Ye, 1991), and metadiscourse (Hyland, 2005). These resources are discussed in relation to a wide range of written academic geres, particularly research artices (El-Dakhs, 2018; Ho0d, 2004), theses (Feng & Zhou, 2007; Milton & Hyland, 1999), examiners' reports on doctoral theses (Holbrook et al., 2012; Starfield et al., 2015), book reviews (Lan, 2011), and academic book blurbs (Liao & Yu, 2010). Comparatively ittl attention i paid to evaluatie resources in relation to spoken academic genres, e. the use of hedging devices in lectures (Lin, 2012), seminars (Aguilar, 2008), and doctoral disertation defenses (Recski, 2005). Notably, les is known about evaluation in Masters-level oral defenses despite them being a wellestblished, high-stakes assesment during which examiners judge the quality of Master's theses. To address this gap, such oral defenses are the fcus of this paper.

# 1.1. An overview of oral defenses

A dissertation/thesis defense, also known as aviva" or an ral defense", is typically an official meeting held afer a postraduate student has submitte afinal manuscrip of his/her dissertation. The oral defense serves the purpose of quality asessment for academic intitutions allowing the commitee t evaluate whether the dissertation under review contributes o scholarship in the field of study and whether the candidate merits the awarding of a degree. The oral defense i also an occasion for verifying the authorship and originality of the disertation (Phillips & Pugh, 2010), and provides "an opportunity for an important academic conversation (wales, 2004, p. 169) in which the candidate can defend and justify his/her research. However, this type of academic spoken discourse differs widely between institutions in terms of "name, structure, length of time, degree of formality and the amount of critical discussion expected' Lin, 2017,p. 14). Swales (2004), making use of the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE), defines four main stages of American oral defenses: \*preliminaries," \*the defense proper," in-camera sesson," and \*closing segment. The frst involves greetings and introduction, and the last is the announcement of the oral defense outcome (usually a conditional approval subject to either minor corrections or major revision and resubmission). In the second stage, i. the defense proper, the candidates must first give a presentation elaborating on his/her research project and then defend the thesis by responding to questions raised by the committee The commitee members then hold an in-camera session', in which they engage in closed-door deliberations on the candidate's overall academic performance and reach a consensus regarding the asessment result. However, the oral defense process may vary slightl cross countries. In Norway, for example, the "disputas" procedure is followed, in which candidates give two forml lectures before the actual defense, and a separate question and answer (Q&A) session is arranged for individual examiners (Swales, 2004). In the U.K., however, the entire procedure is conducted in closed-door meetings.

# 1.2. Discourse features of oral defenses

In addition to variations in defenses general structure and degree of opennesand transparency, researchers observe variations in their discoursal features and formalities. Informal feature, such as humor, laughter, and vocatives, ave been identified pervasively across the MICASE corpus; they are intertwined with formal expressons and subject-specific terminologies, together resulting in a "mixed' style (Mezek & Swales, 2016, p. 362). Mezek and Swales consider the oral defense an opportunity for allparticipants to perform appropriate academic role. ommitte members in particular can demonstrate that they are sensible and thoughtful people "who are reositories of expertise and yet are capable of humor, and who are able to wear their cholarship sufficiently lightly so as not to alienate the other participants (2016, p. 363), despite the institutional formal constraints and the serious purpose of the academic event.

The interpersonal dimension of disertation defenses has recived rather limited reearch attention in recent decades. For example. Recski's (2005) analys identifies a correlation between candidates use of modal (un)certainty and their attitudes to propositions and arguments. Don and Izadi (2011), focusing on the dynamic interactive nature of face, investigate how Iranian participants in dissertation defenses exploit \*face' to achieve a culture-specific voicing of relational connection and separation. Meek's (2018) research indicates that instances of laughter and humor play an important role in Swedish doctoral disertation defenses, especially in mitigating face threats and tension and nurturing a les confrontational atmosphere. These studies certainly contribute to our un. derstanding of doctoral dissrtation defenses. However, the corpora under study were mainly collcted in Anglophone or European academic environments. Few studies have ventured into the Asian academic context although dissertation defenses are common occurrences in higher education in Asia.

# 1.3. Context of this study

In many Asian countries efforts have been made to globalize higher education curricula to increase universties competitiveness and attract more domestic and international students. As part of this intiative, universities have gradually begun to promote the use of English as the language of instruction and academic exchange. This trend has sparked some interesting research, such as studies investigating the chllenges posed by full-English teaching (Hu & Lei, 2014; Lin et al., 2018), curriculum planning (Huang, 2017), and institutional policies and practices (Lau & Lin, 2017). However, while numerous studies explore second-language writing, studies of English-medium spoken academic discourse during high-staes asessment events such as disertation defenses remain scarce. o fill this research gap, this study investigates a corpus of English-medium Master's thesis defenses carried out at Taiwanese universities.

Across Taiwanese universities, oral defenses for Master's students generally conform to Swales's four-stage structure and are usually open to the public However, they are not subject to explicit rgulations or asesment critria. Master's-level oral defense commitees in Taiwan seem to follow unwritten rule that reflc the widespread influence of U.s. academic ractices. According to 2020 statisics published by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan (see Appendix A), the ratio of Master's to doctoral graduates per year has remained at approximately 15 to 1 for the last 10 years (e.g. 54,248 Master's graduates versus 3,306 doctoral graduates in 2018) Although passing an oral defense is a common final requirement for a Master's degree imposed by higher education institutions in Taiwan, how asssment commitees evaluate candidates' research and how students are expected to behave during defenses remain unclear. This causes students unnecessary anxiety and insecurity (Morley et al., 2003).

This study draws on Martin and White's (2005) appraisal theory to comprehensively explore how examiners of Masters thesis defenses perform their evaluations and what they evaluate in Taiwan's current English as a lingua franca (ELF) context. The findings provide useful insights into the use of evaluative resources and the roles of institutional norms and practices during such gate-keeping oral events, and are thus expected to enefit students, committe members, and practitioners of English for academic purposes. Studies of examiners written reports on theses (Holbrook et al, 2004; Mullins & Kile, 2002) suggest that examiners and students understand evaluative language diffrently and show that misunderstandings can arise when students are unable to recognize what is being evaluated or to differentiate betwee focal areas of evaluation. Compared with examiners written reports, oral defenses have a more impromptu quality and may thus pose even more challenges for the participants, especially non-native English-speaking commitees and candidates from various ethnic backgrounds. This topic merits further investigation.

In sum, we explore the pattrns of use of evaluative resources by examiners of Master's thesis defenses in Taiwan's ELF context to answer the following questions:

- How do examiners evaluate in English-medium Master's oral defenses conducted in Taiwan universities?   
- What do they evaluate?   
- To what extent do examiners express positive/negative or inscribed/evoked values in oral defenses?   
- What are the contributing factors in the observed results?

# 2. Research framework--appraisal theory

Given the nature of oral defenses, the spoken-word data derived from dissertation defense meetings are particularly rich in evaluative language and thus suitable for comprehensive analysis based on Martin and Whit's (2005) appraisal framework. This framework comprises three main resources for evaluative meanings: atitude, graduation, and engagement. As we explored the use of engagement resources in the same corpus in an earlier study (see Lau et al., 2021), we focus here on attitude and graduation. Atti tudinal reources include thre sub-categories: afect (emotie reactions), judgment (ethical evaluation of people and behaviors), and appreciation (aesthetic asessment of the social value of entities, such as texts, proceses or phenomena). All three attitudinal sub-categories have positive and negative evaluative orientations, i.. polarities. For example, the utterance I m confused indicates a negative affect response, whereas The findings are interesting expresses positive appreciation of the findings.

With regard to the encoding of attitudinal meanings, Martin and White distinguish between inscribed and evoked attitudes. An inscribed attitude is directly expressed via language through a variety of atitude-related lexico-grammatical structures, such as \*epithets, aributes, circumstances, processes of different types (mental, behavioral, relational), modal adjuncts, nominalized processes" (Adendorff  de Klerk, 2005, p. 496). For instance, the thet cler in the utterance Yor organization isvery cler in the corpus under scrutiny explicitly conveys a positive atitude of appreciation regarding the structure of the candidate's thesis. Elsewhere, evoked attitudes ar indirectly conveyed by the expression f ther atitudinal meanings in the co-text. Consider the following example from the cors: o eored houg l the dertions to  tht orallpce. n aii th addat   all f te elevant descriptions, the examiner conveys a negative evoked attitude, namely the committe's judgment of the candidate as having failed to present an overall picture or a cohesive argument in his or her thesis.

Graduation resources classfy the value orientations of affect, judgment, and appreciation, i.e., scaling up or scaling down. Ths grading system also contains two sub-categories: force, which includes degree (e.g., very clear) or quantity (eg, a lot of), and focus which involves sharpening or softening a categorical ssertion (e.g, rel solutions, kind of similar). A more comprehensive discussion of graduation resources is presented in Section 3.2.

Two key advantages of appraisal theory facilitate comprehensive and thorough analysis of evaluation in English-medium oral defenses. First, as pointed out by Hyland (2005, p. 174), appraisal theory i the most systematic analyzing tool that offer a typology of evaluative resources available in English. It integrates evaluative resources that are often examined separately in the literature, such as hedges (Hyland, 1998), boosters (Silver, 2003) attitude markers (Conrad & Biber 00), and evidtiality (Chafe, 1986). Second appraisal theory operates at the discourse-semantic level. As illustrate in the above discussion of inscribed and evoked attitues, it "enables appraisal analysts to identify not only the linguistic realizations of evaluation at the lexico-grammatical level, but also the implicitly expressed evaluative meanings embedded in the co-text (Xie, 2016, p.3). Dueto these strengths, appraisa theory ffers the ideal framework for this study.

# 3. Methodology

Afer the initial corpus compilation, the researchers first conducted comprehensive data annotation manually based on the appraisal framework and then performed qualitative textual analysis, supported by data quantification and interpretation.

# 3.1. The corpus

To addres the research questions, spoken-word data from five Master's issertation defenses were collected from 2015 to mid2017, transcribed, and compiled as the corpus under study. The participants were recruited from the English and Applied Linguistics departments of four research-oriented universities in northern and central Taiwan. These two specific departments were chosen because few other departments at the universties require Master's or doctoral oral defenses to be conducted in English, although ful. English instruction is heavily promoted in higher education in Taiwan, as mentioned earlier. An advantage of studying Master's oral defenses in specific disciline i that gneral fatures rlated to a specific academic discourse context can be observed, subject to les interference by other variables such as differences in discilines or discrepancies in English proficiency. The analysi focused on the defense proper, i.e. the Q&A session, which lasted for between 40 and $9 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ in the five dissertation defenses. The research participant, including the candidates and the committee members, were mainly from Taiwan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Gambia (see Table 1). All were non-native English speakers, apart from the American examiner in TD3. The researchers obtained informed consent to the recording fthe oral defense proces from allof the participants and asured them that the privacy and confidentialit of their personal information would be maintained whenever possible. To facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis of evaluative language, the recorded spoken-word data were systematicall transcribed and digitized into text files; the data transcription followed MICASE conventions. The corpus compiled for the study contained 23,792 words in total.

# 3.2. Data annotation scheme

Each oral defense transcript was read carefully line by line and manually categorized and annotated by the researchers in the light of Martin and White's (2005) appraisal taxonomy. Linguistic resources in incomplete, unintelligible utterances, a common phe. nomenon in spoken discourse, are not treated. The tgging of attitude resource involved three aspects (see Fig. 1): (1) attitude tye (affect, jument, r aprciation and itsrtive subt ) tite mde . inried drel xrd r eokd indrectly conveyed, denoted by $t )$ ; and (3) attitude orientation, in terms of positive $( + )$ or negative $( - )$ polarity.

Extract (1) exemplifie the coding of atitude, in which the utterances that's fine with me and I m happy with that manfest and latent concerning the candidate's use f a dichotomous analysis model explicitly embody the committe's positive appreciation as reaction and positive affect as happiness.In contrast, by saying you did make some you know grammatical mistakes in (2) and that's another limitation or problem in (3), the examiners separately flag a negative judgment as capacity and negative appreciation as composition.

(1) Okay, that's fine with me $[ +$ Appreciation (reaction)]. But then, how would the analysis be uh well based on that kind of separation okay explicit and implicit, I mean, you mention that okay, uh you need to have both okay in the analysis. I am happy with that manifest and latent $[ +$ Affect (happiness)]

(2) Of course you did make some you know grammatical mistakes [-Judgment (capacity)] (3) Positive psychology education is not going to work that well or something, or maybe that's another limitation or problem [-Appreciation (composition)]

Examples (1) to (3) show that the resources that construe inscried positive or negative attitude are mainly lexis and grammar, i. mistake, problem, that's ie, and I'm happy. In addtion to lexis-/rammar-riented claification, evoked atitude may be cued by other attitudinal values in the co-text. valuation, as Thompson and Ye (1991) ugest is best understood as operating at the discourse lel, as i i ofte cumulative and may be achieved over relatively long stretches of text. A discourse-semantic aproach to appraisal analysis thus enable the analysts to uncover not only the explict linguistic cue of evaluative language t the lexico-grammatical level, but also indirectly conveyed attitudes evoked from the co-text. For instance,

(4) You mentioned that in your eh the technique you are going to have qualitative interviewing, but why the procedure is statistics procedure? I think qualitative interview is does not belong to statisics procedure [t -Appreciation (composition)]

(5) I would love to give you some sugestions to make your research become better [t-Appreciation (reaction)] and more valuable [t -Appreciation (valuation)]

(6) You provided a lot of details about psychology $[ t +$ Judgement (capacity)]

In (4), the examiner highlights a mismatch between the heading and content of the methods section (I think qualitative intervie is does not belong to stisics procedure). In other words, the examiner criticizes the logic of the candidate's writing. In (5), the examiner offers suggestions for improving the current version of the theis. Despite the use of the positie inguistc tms bette and valuable, the provision of suggestions conveys implict, negatively charged appreciation as reaction to and valuation of the thesis, which is not good or valuable enough in the examiner's opinion. The comment You provided a lot of details about psychology in (6) implicitly praises the candidate for thoroughly describing the issue under discussion. The discourse-semantic approach facilitates the interpretation of implicitly expressed evaluative meanings embedded in the co-text and borderline cases.

The tagging of graduation resources includes the following aspects (Fig. 2): (1) the grading type (force or focus) and its respective subset; and (2) the grading orientation, either up-scaling/sharpening () or down-scaling/softening (), as shown in (6):

# 3.3. Annotation procedure

Applying the appraisal framework to the annotation and analysis of evaluative language implies a certain degree of subjective interpretation by the analysts. To ensure the ccuracy and consistency of data annotation, the tagging involved thre stages. In the first stage, the firs rearcher examined the datatth formal structral and dicoursal levels, identifie all incribed and eoked instances of evaluative language in use, and categorized them following the annotation schemes illustrated in examples (1)-(6).

The second stage proceeded to a tabular analysis, which i a convention in the appraisal literature (e.g., Marshall, 2010; Martin &

White, 2005). Each instance of evaluative language was classified and displayed in an Excel table with defined column headers for specific categories and sub-categories. This contributed to a systematic database of evaluatie terms in use and facilitated a more detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis supported by the descriptive statistics derived from the table. Appendix B presents the samples of the tabular datasets of atitude. It is hoped that the incorporation of qualitative and quantitative methods will paint a comprehensive picture of the distribution pattern of evaluative language, making it possible to generalize descriptive discussion, in contrast to most previous evaluation studies, which are highly qualitative.

Finally, the second researcher, who has taught systemic functional linguistics and appraisal theory at graduate level, independently coded the entire dataset. Among the total 1,010 linguistic cues of evaluation identified from the corpus, the researchers disagreed in 174 cases, which indicated that the annotation had high consistency $( = 8 2 . 7 ~ \%$ and validity. Discrepancies were resolved after thorough discussion and clarification of the defined criteria, which were applied to any other similar cases.

# 4. Findings

# 4.1. Attitude in Master's oral defenses

Table 2 shows the overal instantiations and percentage distribution of attitude types in the corpus. As can be seen in the table, appreciation $( 3 8 . 1 \% )$ and judgment $( 3 6 . 9 \% )$ are used to a similar extent, comprising three quarters of the incidents; affect accounts for approximately one quarter $( 2 4 . 8 ~ \% )$

The distribution pattern is somewhat unexpected and differs considerably from the quantitative findings on evaluation in academic written genres, e.g. research artices (Ho0d, 2004) and thesis literature reviews (Xie, 2016), in which appreciation constitutes the dominant attitude type, accounting for $8 0 \% - 1 0 0 \%$ of total occurrences. Appreciation represents only $3 8 . 1 \%$ of the total usage in the present research context, thesis defenses. This may be attributable to commitees' adherence to the common academic iscourse convention of institutionalizing feelings as propositions (Martin & White, 2005) or objectifying the subjective practice of the evaluating entity (Martin, 2000, p. 147). Notably, appreciation occurs $4 0 \% - 6 0 \%$ less frequently in oral defenses than in academic written genres, indicating a significantly higher incidence of emotion-based and behavior-related evaluation in the former context. In other words, more than two thirds of evaluation during an oral defense is connected with the academics involved in the spech event.

Affect and judgment account for $2 4 . 8 ~ \%$ and $3 6 . 9 ~ \%$ , respectively, in the corpus. The former are evaluative resources used to construe personal emotions, and the lattr are used to asess the candidates' behavior as moral or immoral, as legal or ilegal, as socially aceptable or unacceptable, as laudable or deplorable, as normal or anormal and so ont (White, 2013). The broad distribution of the two sub-systems may be associated with the physical presence of the participants in a system of hierarchical institutional power. More specifiall, thesdent' rearch capacity is beng judgd . ou avent don ., o n do . The athritative examiners draw on expressions of subjective feelings (e.g. I'm hap, I'm confused) to personalize the evaluative discourse, enacting sensible, thoughtful repositories of expertise. This contributes to the creation of appropriate interpersonal relationships.

The breakdown of each sub-type is also presented in Table 2. Whilst capacity $( 3 3 . 8 \% )$ and dis/satisfaction $( 1 6 . 7 \% )$ constitute the dominant subcategories of judgment and affect, respectively, no significant difference was observed between those subsumed under appreciation. They are discussed in more detail below, drawing on examples from the corpus.

# 4.1.1. Appreciation

Appreciation as composition is related to the arrangement of information, generally referring to the coherence, cohesion, logic. fluency, and format of discourse (Gosden, 2003) and the clarity, detils, and simplicity of the message (Starfield et al., 2015). lthough composition is used slightly more frequently than reaction and valuation, it often co-occurs with the atter and with other ub-types subsumed under judgment and affect.

(8) I think you did touch upon culture in some parts of the analysis $[ t +$ Judgment (capacity)], but not others [t -Judgment (capacity)]. I think it's a bit too selective [-Appreciation (composition)] (TD5)   
(9) This kind of uh special $[ +$ Appreciation (valuation)] unique $[ +$ Appreciation (valuation)] quotes which might require more elaboration explanation about the content the context [t -Appreciation (composition)] otherwise we just don't understand [t -Affect (dissatisfaction)] what's going on with this quote launched my book," because this is definitely quite different [-Appreciation (composition)] (TD2)

In (8), an opening, positive judgment of the candidate's capacity (you did touch upon culture in some parts of the analysis precedes a negative one (but not others. The partialtreatment of the culture issue in different part of the thesis leads the examiner to reach a verdict of inadequate discussion of the topic (ts a bit toosective), a negative appreciation as composition. This negatively-charged statement is mitigated by the down-scaling elements I think and a bit to maintain rapport in this highly face-threatening peech event (see Section 4. for more details of graduation). Excerpt (9) shows the co-occurrence of appreciation as composition, valuation and affect. Valuation evaluates the good or bad qualities of an entit, or ealuates ts usefulness or importance in its social sense Martin & White, 2005). In (9), the candidate's inclusion of various interview quotations in the thesis is positively evaluated through the ati tudinal lexis special and unique. This is followed by evoked negative appreciation as composition concerning a lack of in-depth elaboration (which might require more elaboration explanation about he content the context). As this lack of elaboration may make the content difficult for the reader to understand (we just don't understnd), it elicits a negatively-charged affective evaluation from the examiner. The present round of appraisal ends with another negative appreciation as composition (what's going on with this quote "aunched my book, because this isdefintely quite diferent), oosted by the upgraders defitely and quite, to highlight the roblem of resenting distinctive types of quotes without adequate explanation in the thesis.

Excerpts (8) and (9) demonstrate a common evaluation mechanism among examiners: incorporating praise as a way of sugarcoating criticism to achieve a "critical but fair' tone and establish interpersonal relationships between examiners and candidates in this highly face-threatening aessment event. Notably, although appreciation mainly targets these, oral presentations preceding the actual Q&A sessions are occasionally evaluated, as shown in (10) below, in which the presentation is positively appreciated as composition (that's a really good ending) and valuation (That helps you uh helps me).

(10) So, yeah, I mean that's a really good ending $[ +$ Appreciation (composition)] . That helps you uh helps me $[ +$ Appreciation (valuation)] as well (TD1)

Reaction in this context relates to peoples sensory assessment of what is appraised, which greatly resonates with subjective feelings and emotions (Martin & White, 2005). Examples of reaction in the corpus are predominantly encoded to evaluate research matrials, methodology, or coherence of ideas, as illustrated in the following excerpts.

(11) I am not criticizing your corpora but what you were using areall Spoken Singapore English corpora, however there are no audios? No spoken files, it seems bizarre [-Appreciation (reaction)] (TD3)

(12) So about the students, I think it's a littl bit confusing [-Appreciation (reaction)] I'm not sure what you're referring to [-Affect (insecurity)] (TD2)

(13) Because when I ooked at your thesis, the first chapter, it came to me quite shock [t -Appreciation (reaction)] when you talked about identity before that you never mentioned about identity [t -Judgment (capacity)] (TD1)

In (11), it sems bizarre conveys the examiner's negative feling toward the spoken corpora without original audio, on which the research project about Singaporean English was based. In (12), the examiner notes that the interchangeable use of the terms migrant workers and Indonin sdns  t the rch participan in the thesis causes consio its  tl bt ofusin. Excrt (13) reveals the examiner's shock at the lack of a rationale in the literature review for research on ELF low-achievers' identity.

# 4.1.2. Judgment

Despite the examiners' presumed institutional duty to appreciate the theses, in $3 6 . 9 \%$ of the total observations the examiner passes judgment on the candidate by asesing their academic (mis)conduct explicitl or implicitly in relation to disciplinary norms. n particular, the candidates are judged on their capacity $( 3 3 . 8 \% )$ in relation to what they are (un)able to do. A small percentage $( 2 . 6 \% )$ of observations focus on tenacity, regarding the cautiousness and resoluteness of the candidates.

(14) In your literature review okay you spend you you provided a lot of details about psychology $[ t +$ Judgment (capacity)] . Right? Psychology so yeah I think this suggests that I think you can make a link between positive thinking project and the positive psychology [t -Judgment (capacity)] (TD4)

(15) But you haven't defined this in your research writing [t -Judgment (capacity)]. Right? I only se bio-data in your research $^ { [ t + }$ Judgment (capacity)], but you need to discuss more about their occupation [t -Judgment (capacity)] (TD3)

In (14), the candidate's provision of details about psychology in the iterature review is positively judged, prior to an implicit comment on the candidate's incapacity to depict the correlation between psychology and positive thinking: you canmake a link between positive thinking project and the positive sychology. In (15), a positive judgment as capacity, I only seebiodat in yor reearch, is urrounded by two comments on incapacity. The first points out the candidate's inabilit to define \*middle-class ingaporeans: But you haven't defined this in your research writing. The second suggests that the candidate should discuss the occupation of the research participants: you need to discus more about ther occupation. These neatively-charged judgments s capacity you can make a link . in (14) and you need to discuss ... in (15) urge the candidates to act and address the gaps.

The examiners' judgment as tenacity predominantly evaluates the candidates' lack of cautiousness or carefulness, such as the misinterpretation of research findings in (16) and inappropriate use of modal verbs in (17). The typical structure you need to be cautious/careful ... is used.

(16) I don't think that would be representative of the culture in a sense. So I think you need to be very cautious in your in terpretations in your analysis [t -Judgment (tenacity)] (TD5)

(17) And then I think you need to be careful when you use modal verbs [t -Judgment (tenacity)]. You use a lot of may or could. think that will make you not so sure about your findings (TD4)

# 4.1.3. Affect

The third attitudinal resources affect, is used asurprisingly high percentage of the time by examiners in the defense corpus. It deals with emotion, especially the examiners' (dis)satisfaction $( 1 6 . 7 ~ \% )$ and (in)security $( 7 . 6 ~ \% )$ , drawing on favorable I-/we-oriented grammatical structures, I'm not sure, I'm curious, I wonder, I guess I don't know and their variations, which often serve as a lead-in to criticisms or problems. For instance,

(18) So I mean the context we'renot quite ure [-ffect (insecurity)] coz we might gues [t-Affect (insecurity)] oh they come to Taiwan maybe next time they go to Hong Kong, they could go to Dubai, or they go to Singapore and then that might be the reason why they learn English. We don't know the context [t -Affect (dissatisfaction) (TD2)

(19) However we do not relly know the the difference between the improvement of the two groups [t -Affect (dissatisfaction), okay control group and one experimental group, so maybe you have to add that part [t -Judgement (capacity)], so we can know well you know both of them [t -Affect (dissatisfaction)] (TD4)

(20) because this example of coding scheme on page 37 and 38, actu-I mean, I also got quite confused -Affect (dissatisfaction)] (TD1)

Excerpt (18) presents instances of affect as insecurity and dissatisfaction, introduced by the context we're not quite sure, we might guess .., and we don't know the context. This criticizes the insufficient information provided on the research context. In (19), the examiner expresses his discontent at the omission of the results of comparing the control and experimental groups: we do not relly know the difeence . and so maye you have to dd that part, so we can know well you know both of them. Bsis the use of the common grammatical structures, several lexical items, especill confused, interested, or enjoy, are utilized to convey the examiners' (dis) approval of specific parts of the thesis in the corpus, such as in (20): I also got quite confused about the coding scheme.

# 4.1.4. Inscribed and evoked attitude

The distribution percentage of attitude types in the corpus is shown in Table 3. As can be seen, evoked attitude $( 6 7 . 7 \% )$ is more than twice as frequent as inscribed attitude $( 3 2 . 2 \% )$ , indicating that implicit evaluation is greatly favored over explicit evaluation.

To obtain a more comprehensive view of connections between atitude types and polarities, Table 4 delineates the percentage listribution of inscribed versus evoked attitude and positive versus negative attitude in the corpus.

The occurrence of negative attitude $( 7 8 . 0 \% )$ is close to four times higher than that of positive attitude $( 2 1 . 9 \% )$ , a consequence of the principal eneric objective of the given assessment event to provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improving the thesis and enhancing the candidate's research capacity. These face-threatening acts are performed predominantly by resorting to evoked linguistic resources $( 6 4 . 9 \% )$ rather than inscribed resources $( 1 3 . 1 \% )$ , at a ratio of 5 to 1. Evoked linguistic resources are crucial facesaving elements used by examiners to achieve negative politeness and maintain rapport with candidates and supervisors; the latter could be regarded as thesis co-authors in certain areas. For instance:

(21) She says I am an active but lazy learner. So it's an active learner. But, that's what she said. Thats her perception. So it's not reality [t-Appreciation (valuation)]. So how can you actually consider that as the nature, okay, N-face of identity? I just found there is a discrepancy between perception and also reality [t -Appreciation (composition)]. ..okay somebody said I am handsome, then I am handsome. You need some kind of objective evidence [t -Judgment (capacity)] (TD1)

Excerpt (21) comprises three evoked criticisms, including ppreciation as valuation (So it's not reality), appreciation as composition (I just found thre is icreancy bween peretion nd lo ret), ad judgment as cacity (You ned some kind of obtive eidce). These comments question the validity of aqualitative discussion based entirely on the research participants subjective perceptions, and hence advice is given on adding objective evidence In sharp contrast with the significantly high percentage of evoked criticisms the majority of the positive evaluations are inscribed ( $1 9 . 0 \%$ inscribed versus only $2 . 8 ~ \%$ evoked; the former is more than six times higher than the later. The committes opt for bald on-record praise to encourage and inspire the candidates (Wei et al., 2019) and achieve positive politeness.

(22) I think it's a very important chapter in the thesis $[ +$ Appreciation (valuation)] (TD2)

# (23) Your organization is very clear $[ +$ Appreciation (composition)] (TD4)

(24) I found it very special $[ +$ Affect (satisfaction)] and interesting $[ +$ Affect (satisfaction)] (TD3)

Excerpts (22) to (24) llustrate the inscribed positive evaluation of a specific part/organization of the thesis and the uniqueness of the ssues under discussion, which areall trengthened by the upgrader very (see Section 4.2 below on graduation). Although positive evaluation accounts for approximately $2 0 ~ \%$ of the total instances, their occurrences intertwine with the other $8 0 ~ \%$ of negative comments, thus constructing an institutionally recognized critical but fair persona for the examiners.

# 4.2. Graduation in Master's oral defenses

Graduation in the defenses functions to scale up or scale down the examiners affect at/appreciation of theses or their judgment of candidates' abilities. The graduation instantiations are closely distributed between force $( 5 7 . 0 \% )$ and focus $( 4 2 . 9 \% )$ in the corpus, as shown in Table 5. In terms of orientation, up-scaling $( 4 1 . 6 ~ \% )$ is more than twice as frequent as down-scaling $( 1 5 . 4 ~ \% )$ for force, whereas the opposite is true for focus ( $. 1 2 . 8 ~ \%$ up-scaling versus $3 0 . 1 ~ \%$ down-scaling). The breakdown of the sub-types reveals that intensity $( 4 8 . 0 \% )$ and realization $( 2 8 . 9 ~ \% )$ respectively constitute the dominant choices for force and focus.

A descriptive analysis of the occurrence of up-scaling or down-scaling the strength of attitude reveals that their use is associated with the examiner's degree of investment in and commitment to the construed values. Amplifying evaluative language is mainly used as an attention-catcher to highlight problems, to praise/emphasize good parts of the thesis for rapport enhancement, and to intensify the counterfactual contribution or value of the thesis as part of a polite request for improvement. In contrast, diminishing strength generally operates as a safety net for the examiners to expressciticisms, contrary views, and explanatory reasoning. These functions intertwine in the examiners' utterances to achieve the institutional goal of asssing the thesis while maintaining a harmonious allince between assertiveness and tentativeness. This is in accordance with the expected academic conventions, depicting authori. tative examiners who offer a relatively \*suportie stance" (Hyland & Jiang, 2020, p. 6) in the extremely evaluative proces of thesis defense, as shown in (25) and (26). These examples present, in truncated form, a common disciplinary mechanism of intensifying or softening evaluation.

(25) What you were using are all [Force (quantity)] spoken Singapore English corpora, however there are no audios? No spoken files, it seems [Focus (realization)] bizarre [-Appreciation (reaction)] . I think [Force (intensity)] if you research have tones on it will [Focus (realization)] make the corpora more [Force (intensity)] valuable [t -Appreciation (valuation)] (TD3)

The thesis discussed in excerpt (25) explores itch variation in the discourse final particles of Singaporean English, drawing on non original audiofiles. The word allin the lead-in statement What you are using are all spoken Singapore English corpora amplifies the statement's stregthto arct h student's attentionto the iu rased at the beinning of the pasge. Next the examiner's negative reaction,  spoken fie t ss rr, is sftd y ss it tivs dith ttive vrone h crrt round of evaluation ends with aounterfactual valation, I think f your reearch have tones on it wil make the corpora more valuable. Uprading the strength of the counterfactual valuation with the lexical items will and more sems to redirectattention to the obvious weakness of the corpora, justifying the examiner's negative reaction, and urging the student to make improvements.

(26) I think [Force (intensity)] we need that kind of support [S: more right?] to sort of [Focus (authenticity] triangulate [t -Appreciation (composition)] ..I think [Force (intensity)] if you could [Focus (realization)] really [Force (intensity)] present difernt tiangulation [t-Judgment (capacity)] that would [Focus (realization] be very [Force (intensity] helpful [t -Appreciation (valuation)] (TD1)

The examiner in (26) starts with a negative appreciation of the thesis, which explores EFL low-achievers' learner identity (re) construction based entirely on interview data; in other words, the thesisis overdependent on a single research instrument. Hence the examiner clls for triangulation, such as the incorporation of observation data, as is proposed in the later part of the interaction. This opening troubleshooting remark on the reearch design (1 think we need that kind of support t sort of triangulate) is mitigated by I think and sort of. fter the student's clarfing elaboration, the is is re-statd by the pestent xaminer, whose implicit, aderse criticism of the student's inability to triangulat in counterfactual form, I think f you could really preent different tiangulation, is modfied by both boosting and softening words: Ithink, could, and reall. However, the expected advantages of triangulation, that would be very helpful, are upgraded by would and very. The cumulative emphatic effect suggests the crucial importance of triangulation and the

necessity of further revision.

Excerpts (25) and (26) illustrate a common evaluation mechanism-opening with troubleshooting statements that lead to sug. gestions for revision. This approach, however, may cause comprehension problems for non-native English-speaking students. Consequently, explanatory description and exemplification patterned by up-scaling and down-scaling linguisicelements are sup. plemented by the examiners to support students with limited knowledge of discipline-related subject matter.

(27) And Taiwan is the one of the destinations. So I mean [Force (intensity)] the context we're not quite [Force (intensity)] sure [-Affect (insecurity)] coz we might [Focus (realization)] guess [t -Affect insecurity)] oh they come to Taiwan maybe [Focus (realization)] next time they go to Hong Kong, they could [Focus (realization] go to Dubai, or they go to Singapore and then that might [Focus (realization)] be the reason why they learn English. We don't know the context [t -Affect (dissatisfaction)] because on page 17 that is your literature review so you in page 17 you did [Force (intensity)] mention about the Indonesian migrant workers go to Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan $[ t +$ Judgment (capacity)]. You did [Force (intensity)] mention that $[ t +$ Judgment (capacity)], but again you didn't you just I think [Force (intensify)] the data should [Focus (realization)] be accessible [t -Appreciation (composition)] (TD2)

The examiner in (27) explicitly expresses his concern about the insufficient iformation provided on the context of the study, namely Indonesian migrant workers' English-learning motivation: So I mean the context we're not qut ure, boosted by I mean and quite. The subsequent in-depth explanation introduced by coz we might ges. or they go to Singapore and then that might be the reason why they learn English is mitigated by might, maybe, and could, prior to a repetition of the issue: We don't know the context (affect as dissatisfaction), in an attempt to help thestudent understand the central problem. Next the examiner moves on to a positive judgment of the capacity of the student: you did mention about the Indonesian migant workers go to Middle East and You did mention that. This positive judgment, and thus the resultant rpport ehancement effet, is furthr intensified by the modl auxiliary did. The exainers strateic use of emphatic praise balances the preceding crticisms, the supportive explanation, and the concluding negative appreciation: think the data should be accessible.

# 5. Discussion of findings

This paper analyzing evaluative language in English-medium Master's thesis defenses conducted in Taiwan universties based on Martin and White'sappraisal theory yields a number of interesting findings and answers our research questions. The three sub-systems of attitude are used to a surprisingly similar extent, which suggests that the theses and the oral presentations preceding the Q&A sessions are jectively apreciatd, the exainers are motionll affected, and the canddate bhaviors, particularly their reearch capacity, are judged. The observed distribution pattern is somewhat unexpected, differing considerably from quantitative findings regarding evaluation in academic written genres (Hood, 2004; Xie, 2016), in which appreciation is the dominant attitude type. The finding for apprecition in the preent rearh context theis defense, may be attributable to comites aherence to the aademic discourse onvention of institutionalizing feelings as propositions (Martin & White, 2005) or objectifying the subjective practice of the evaluating entity (e.g. referring to research materials, analytical procedures, unsupported claims, coherence or clarity of ideas. However, the conspicuously less frequent use of appreciation reflects a significantly higher incidence of emotion-based and behavior-related evaluation; that is, evaluation associated with the academics involved in the speech event.

The nature of the focal face-to-fae asesment context motivates the committees to passpredominantly negative evoked judgments on the candidates capacity by exploiting you-oriented patterns. These patterns engage the candidates in the immediate speech events and advise them to take further action to improve their theses. However, the commitees also draw on I/we-oriented expressions of subjectivefelings to personalize their evaluative discourse and display greater emotive involvement. The commitees' emotional responses invite the candates tocollaboratively manage affectivit and take up a shared attitudinal stance (Selting, 2010). This may facilitate the creation of appropriate interpersonal relationships between participants at different levels of the academic hierarchy during this assessment event. This potential effect is enhanced by the use of the evoked attitude type and graduation.

Given the examiners' principal generic objective during the focal asessment event, i.e. to provide constructive criticism and suggestions for improving the theis and hancing the canddate's rearch capacity, theexpresin f neative attitude ccurs nearly four times more frequently than that of positive attitude. These negatively-charged evaluations are conveyed predominantly through evoked linguistic resources rather than inscribed resources, at a ratio of 5 to 1. Evoked linguistic resources are crucial face-saving elements used by examinersto achieve negative politeness when interacting with candidates and supervisors. Although positive evaluation accounts for only one fth of the examiners' use f evaluation here, it i interspersed with their potentiall demoralizing negative comments. This motivates and inspires the candidates whil constructing an institutionally recognized critical but fair persona for the examiners.

The use of graduation in the corpus is ssociated with the examiners' degree of investment in and commitment to the construed values. Amplifying evaluative language is mainly used as an attention-catcher to highlight problems, to indicate/praise good parts of the thesis to enhance raport, or to emphasize the counterfactual contribution or value of the thesis as part of a polite request for improvement. However, diminishing strength generall operates as a safety net enabling the examiners to convey criticism, contrary views, or explanatory reasoning. These functions co-occur in the attitude sub-systems to achieve the institutional goal of thesis evaluation while maintaining a balance between asertiveness and tentativeness and depictig examiners stance as authoritative yet supportive (Hyland & Jiang, 2020).

# 6. Conclusion

The flexibility and sensitivit of the appraisal theory framework enable this pioneering study to thoroughly investigate and characterize the use of evaluative language in Master's oral defenses in the present ELF context. The major contribution made by this research lies in uncovering the complexities of evaluation in a high-stakes examination context focusing on the dynamic layering of attitudinal meanings. For example, we show that an examiner might comment explicitly on the content of a candidate's thesis (i.e. appreciation) whil simultaneously expressing an implicit judgment on his/her ability. The results answer the research questions concerning what examiners evaluate and how they perform evaluation in oral defense, and have important pedagogical value. Previous studies (Holbrook et al., 2004; Mulins & Kiley, 2002) indicate that examiners and students differ in their understanding of evaluative language, and find that misunderstandings may result from students' inability to identify the focus of evaluation. These problems may contribute to students' sense of intimidation during their defense and their perception of the examiners as faceles, feared and potentially testy (Carter, 2008, p. 365). This study's answers to the \*what" and \*how" questions can be incorporated into teaching English for academic purposes, by focusing on the complexities of the evaluative language used by examiners, who serve critically but supportively on behalf of a specialized discipline.
