Generating research questions

Employing the complex dynamic systems theory (CDST) perspective, this case study reports on how three Chinese graduate students majoring in psychology developed their English for Academic Purposes (EAP) reading ability and to what factors they attributed the development in the process for generating research questions for their degree theses. Their EAP reading ability development was investigated by analyzing their reading performance on fourteen journal articles during one semester on a weekly basis from a CDST perspective. Four dimensions of EAP reading ability were investigated and were examined by 14 reading tests, two synthesis writings, and two presentation tasks. The factors that they attributed to were explored by weekly semistructured interviews. The results revealed that, i) the reading comprehension ability of the three students showed different non-linear development patterns and finally reached a high level; ii) ability to analyse how research questions were proposed developed slower but finally reached a satisfactory level; iii) the synthesis ability developed even slower; and iv) critique ability only developed at a preliminary level. Major influential factors included students' disciplinary knowledge, vocabulary, and the supervisor's guidance. This study may shed light on EAP reading instruction and degree thesis writing.

# 1. Introduction

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) reading ability has been perceived as the most needed skil in students higher academic pursuit (Author, Chen, & Verspoor, 2021; Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001; Huang, Cheng, & Chern, 2006; Jordan, 1997; Kuzborska, 2015; Parkinson, Jackson, Kirkwood, & Padayachee, 2007; Ward, 2001). It serves diverse purposes at various stages in the journey of a. ademic study, for example, selecting key disciplinary literature (e.g., Kwan, 2009), writing literature review (e.g., Kwan, 2008), or writing laboratory reports (e.g., Kell-Laubscher, Muna, & van der Merwe, 2017; Parkinson et al., 2007). However, how EAP reading ability develops and serve the urpose of generation of research questionsthe core ssue and one of the most difficult aspects of any research undertaking-is unfortunately eldom addressed. To raise valuable questions also marks real advance in science (Einstein & Infeld, 1966, p. 92). Idefying reearh questions by reding journal articles i considrd as an important approach (laxer, Hughes, & Tight, 2010; Mackey & Gass, 2016; White, 2009), because reading previous empirical work, theoretical ideas, and recent policy and practice may facilitat a new study to fit into a broad domain context and reduces the riss of being repetitive or irrelevant.

Considering dificulty and importance of raising research questions, the present study intends to explore how EAP reading ability develops with a specific and genuine purpose of conceiving research questions for degree theses.

The construct of EAP reading ability is multidimensional and contextualised (Davies, 2001; Douglas, 2001; Jacoby & McNamara, 1999). For example, with the purpose to scafold EAP reading and writing for South African students in science study from under-resourced schools, Parkinson et al. (2007) emphasised four dimensions of EAP reading aility, including i) abilities of under. standing difficult words and key terms, i identifying topic sentences, i) integrating information from multiple sources, and iv) understanding the general argument of articles. To explore factors influencing reading comprehension ability, Nergis (2013) used vocabulary knowledge, syntactic awareness, and metacognitive awareness as dimensions of EAP reading ability. To examine Chinese chemistry major undergraduates' ability to comprehend college level chemistry textbooks written in English, Author et al. (2021) proposed six dimensions of EAP reading ability. The dimensions included to understand the meaning of basic terminology, to identify specific information in a text, to understand the relationship betwen sections, and to summarise the central idea of a text. These studies reveal that the construct of EAP reading ability is multifaceted, and diverse subskillsare concerned about by researchers according to different reading purposes and learning contexts.

EAP reading is a purpose-directed and context-specific behavior. However, the unique interface between a reading purpose of generating research questions and reading ability developed has rarely ben investigated. To generate research questions, graduate students and their supervisors would emphasis pecific dimensions of EAP reading ability. They willfocus on textual meaning rather than on linguistic forms. They need to read extensively, comprehend and summarise the main idea of articles, compare strengths and weaknesses of different research methods, synthesise research findings acros multiple studies, and evaluate soundness of logical reasoning of the conclusion. To academic superviors, if the purpose of reading assgnments is to support students to form research questions, they may guide students to red journal article criticlly, teach them how to analyse the logical relationships betwen core references and rearch questions of the articles they are reading, direct students to integrat understandings of several articles, and encourage them to evaluate the articles. These specific needs of reading shape the construct of EAP reading. Considering that the purpose of EAP reading for the present study is to generate research questions, with reference to reading abilitie assessed in other studies (e.g., Alderson, Brunfaut, & Harding, 2015; Harding, Alderson, & Brunfaut, 2015), consulting with the supervisor, four dimensions of EAP reading ability were investigated, i) ability to comprehend the main idea and identify important details of journal articles; i) abity to analyse how rearch questions were propose ii) aility to ynthesise informtio frm multiple articles, andiv) ability to critique journal artices. Investigation of EAP reading ability development during the process of generating research ques. tions willbe valuable because it wil help reveal how this specific reading purpose might interact with the development of different dimensions of EAP reading ability.

Research on EAP reading ability development have mostly employed cros-sectional approaches, with pre- and post-test designs (e. g, Amer, 1994; Kasper, 1995; Martinez, 2002; Pritchard & Nasr, 2004). For example, with a pre-post design, Pritchard and Nasr (2004) showed that students in the experimental group who used authentic materials and were asked to negotiate for meaning to understand difficult concepts gained significantly more than the control group who used simplified materials. Only a few studies have employed a longitudinal approach to capture the proces, not just the outcome, of EAP reading ability development (e.g., Kuzborska, 2015). Recently, Author et al. (2021) took the Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST) perspective to investigate the EAP reading ability development of 27 Chinese Chemistry major undergraduates. The CDST perspective, along with related research methods, such as the moving min-max graphs, uncovered features of EAP reading ability development which had not ben investigated before. Further studies in this new line of research are needed because the CDST-based research is concerned with the developmental process in addition to learning outcomes, which could uncover the complex nature of EAP reading ability development.

EAP reading ability is a complex dynamic system, and the CDST perspective can be employed to discover how EAP reading ability develops with diverse reading purposes and in different academic contexts (Author et al., 2021). EAP reading ability involves heterogenous and interdependent components, including discipline knowledge, English proficiency (e.g, lexical and syntactic ability) purposes of reading, and reading strategies. The environment of the EAP reading systems is also complex, including reading material, requirements f academic supervisors, instutional contexts, and social contexts. The system's internal components change over time, the ways in which components interact with each other exhibit variegated paterns, competing, mediating, or cooperating with one another. In the procesof EAP reading ability development, students may be first concerned about comprehension of discipline textbooks writen in English. During this process, they are les likel to evaluat r critique the book content. They even try t fill up gaps with elaboration when comprehension breaks. However, f their reading purpose is to generate research questions for their own degree theses they may constantly employ evaluative and critique ability to seek research gaps in the literature. The manners that the internal components interact with environment change over time. The interactions afford energy for the development of the complex system. For example, educational contexts (.g., supervisor's guidance) may interact with a learner's reading activity and promote the development of EAP reading ability.

Considering the importance of EAP reading in graduate study and the paucity of investigation on research questions formation process, as well as the potential value of CDST-based research aproach, he current study aims to explore the fllowing two research questions.

RQ 1: How does EAP reading ability develop for graduate students majoring in psychology in the processof generating research questions for their degree theses? RQ 2: To what factors do the graduate students attribute their EAP reading ability development?

# 2. The study

# 2.1. Setting

The present study was conducted at a top university in central China. It lasted for an academic semester of 16 weeks. Three female graduate students -aged 24, 21 and 22-majoring in psychology under the supervision of the same professor participated in this study. All of them were in the stage of selecting reearch questions for their degre theses. Besides, thir common supervisor involved in the whole research process They had completed four subject courses, which were conducted in Chinese. They had finished one general EAP course, in which general argumentative writig ability, critical thinking ability, and cross-cultural communication ability were addressed. They had read onetextboo in English, Cognitive Psychology by Stenberg and Sternberg (2012) They were required by their supervisor to read journal articles in Englishto become familiarised with the research field of psychology and to find tentative research questions for their degre thees, which will be written in Chinse. Different from the tradtional rearch inqury of reading-to-writ. in the present study, EAP reading was emphasised, but EAP writing was not a component.

# 2.2. Participants

To protect their privacy, aliasesAnna, Beth, and Carol-were assigned to the participants, respectively. Anna, a second-year graduate student, acquired her undergraduate degree in psychology at the same universty where the present study was conducted. She was admitted into the graduate school exempted from admission examination for her academic excellence. Beth, a first-year graduate student, obtained her bachelor's degree in human resource management at another university. She was admitted to the graduate program based on her performance on graduate entrance examinations of this university. The third participant, Carol, was also in her first year of graduate study. She had majored in computer science at another university for her undergraduate study.

The English proficiency of the participants was between B2 and C1 in terms of Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). They allobtained passing scores in the graduate entrance exam (excet Anna), and the national College English Test (CET) bands4 and6.The fullscore f the CET 4i 710poins, and a score of 426 i rarded as satisfactory by intitutions, which is roughly equivalent to B2. The CET 6 is a higher-level test. We obtained informed consent from the participants and compensated them for their time in the study. Table 1 shows the profile of the three participants.

# 2.3. EAP reading ability

With reference to theoretical analysis of the construct of EAP reading ability (e.g., Davies, 2001; Douglas, 2001; Jordan, 1997) and reading dimensions asessed in previous studies (e.g., Alderson et al., 2015; Cheng, 2008; Author e al., 2021; Nergis, 2013; Parkinson et al., 007), as well asthe reading purpose f the present study, EAP reading ability was conceptualise as \*the ability to comprehend, analyse, synthesise, and critique journal articles in the field of psychology published in English for the purpose of generating research questions for their degree theses." Four dimensions were emphasised, although other aspects, such as rhetoric structure, were also addressed.

First, participants' ability to comprehend the main idea and identify important details of journal articles was examined. Reading comprehension questions were designed to explore their development. The questions included i) what questions or hypotheses the researcher proposed in thearticle you are reading; i) wha core references the reearcher cited ii) what major research methods the researcher employed; iv) what major results the researcher found; and v) what conclusions the research made. These questions covered major parts of a typical journal article, which indicated adequate level of content validity of the ability tocomprehendthe main idea of journal articles.

Second, participants' ability to analyse how research questions or hypotheses were proposed in the article was investigated. Ths analytical ability was closely related to the reading purpose of the present study. The supervisor intended to direct tudents' attention to reasoning or arumentative processes of journal artice, so that they may lean how to generatetheir own research questions for the degree theses. The development of this dimension was explored by using Question 6 in the Reading Test.

Third, participants ability to synthesise information from multiple articles was explored. To synthesise refers to combining diverse ideas or information into a coherent whole by comparison and contrst, recognising similarites and diffrence in various aspects across multiple articles. In the current study, this dimension of EAP reading ability was examined by using two synthesis writings and two presentation tasks. Each presentation task required participants to present a synthesis of the reading artices a critique, and ther

tentative research topics and research questions.

Finally, abilit to critique was examined. Critique means \*critical asessment. Whil synthesis ability focuses on combining and integrating ideas from multiple sources based on an accurate representation of information from original articles, critique ability requires students to express their evaluative comments. Readers were required to evaluate one specific journal aticle and articles of one topic. Different felds are likely to impose diffrent emphases on critiques (Swales & Feak, 2012). Supervisors may also guide students to focus on specific aspects according to reading purposes.Critique ability of a single article was examined by question seven on the reading tet (i.., what are the trenghs and waknesss ofthe artice). Critique aility of multilearticles was investigated with the same tasks used for measuring synthesis ability.

The first two dimensions of EAP reading ability (i.e., comprehension and analysis) formed the basis for the third and fourth dimensions (i.e, synthesis and critique). In other words, accurate understanding of journal article information and its reasoning processes are the prerequisite for the development of synthesis and critique abilities.

# 2.4. Reading materials

To explore the development of EAP reading ability of the three participants, 14 journal articles were selected by their supervisor based on his expertise and judgment of the qualit and textaldifficulty levels f the artice (se Table 2), considering that the length of an academic semester was 16 weeks. All rticles were research based (consisting of research questions, method, results, discussion, and conclusion sections) and they were not reading material for other subject courses. Other materials were also encouraged to read, but their performance of comprehension was not recorded. The keywords of these articles were "moral judgment," \*power," "emotion, "social cognition, and "voice recognition, covering two major research topics (ie., moral judgment and voice recognition).

# 2.5. Data collection

Data collection lasted for a whole semester of 16 weeks. Before data collection, the researchers, including the supervisor, explained the purpose of the current study to the thre participants. With their consent, the researchers negotiated with them the time for the reading and reading tests.

From week 1 to week 5, participants read articles 1 to 5, one for each week in sequence. A reading comprehension test followed each reading. After the reading and a paper-pencil reading test, a semi-structured interview was conducted in Chinese. The reading session and the test were elf-paced and lasted about 120 minutes. No resources were not allowed to use during these two sessions. The interview lasted about 20 minutes. The questions that guided the interview were i) how well do you understand thearticle in general? ii) compared with the last reading, what did you do better in today's reading? and ii) what would be the possibl causes for your progressor obstacles? Reading, reading test, and interviews were conducted in the first researcher's ofice, which was shared with 10 teachers of a teaching cohort and structured like a meeting room.

After the 5th reading, the supervisor required them to write a synthesis at home, and resources were llowed. The intructions for this task were i) to compare and identify siilitis and differences in rearch desigs, methods, finding, and conclusions of the five articles you read; and i) to present adequate evidence for your claim. In week 6, a presentation was arranged. The instructions for the presentation included i) to briefly report the content of your synthesis writing; i) to present your evaluative comments on the five articles as well as adequate evidence i) to report reearch gaps you identified; and iv) to preent rearch questions you believe that were worth investigating based on the gaps you identified. The presentations were held in the supervisor's office which was similar with the first researcher's ofice but equipped with an overhead projector. The presentation for each participant lasted for 60 minutes. From week 7 to week 15, participants read the remaining nine articles on a weekly basis and completed corresponding reading tests and semistructured interviews. In week 16, they were required to hand in the second written synthesis and deliver the second presentation. Interviews were conducted immediately after each of the two presentations.

# 2.6. Data analysis

To explore answers to the first research question, four dimensions of EAP reading ability was examined, including i) ability to comprehend the main idea and to identify important details of journal articles; i) abilit to analyse how research questions or hy. potheses were proposed in the article; ii) ablity to synthesise information across multiple journal articles; and iv) abilit to critique. Regarding the first dimension,to examine the trajectory of development and amplitude of change, the moving min-max graph of ther scores on the reading tet (see Appendix) was used (Verspoor, Bot, & Lowie, 2011). The test was rated by the supervisor, and the scores were checked by the other two researchers of the present study. A separate session of face to face feedack was arranged after thir performance was scored every week. The purpose was to givestudents an opportunity to clarify the meaning of the ideas or sentences in their produced work if these were unclear for the researchers. The inter-rater reliability was $9 5 \%$ Disagreement happened mainly on the frst several tests where the meaning of some answers was vague due to the use of incomplete sentences. To see f any sudden and radical changes (or phase shifts, se Baba & Nitt, 2014)occurred during the development, the freely available Change Point analyzer tool was utilized (Taylor, 2000). The total score was 100 points with 20 points for each of the 5 questions. The maximums and minimums were identified for every three consecutive reading scores to display the amplitude of change. The raw score ines and the moving min-max ines jointly illustrate the developmental trajectories (Author et al., 2021). The development of this dimension was also triangulated by data from semi-structured interviews.

The second dimension of EAP reading ability was explored by Question 6 on the reading test (see Appendix), which is How were the research questions or hypotheses proposed by the researcher()?" The moving min-max graph of the supervisor's ssessment on the question and the Change Point analyzer tool were used.

Synthesis ability was explored by the supervisor's evaluation of the written synthesis and presentation tasks. The supervisor focused on how well the participants integrated the reading articles into a coherent piece of work by comparing and identifying similarities and differences in research designs, methods, findings, and conclusions. The supervisor evaluated their change by examining how specific their opinions were and to what degreethey could provide evidence to suport their opinions. The following three expressions represented degrees of specificity and adequacy of evidence from the lowest to highest.

Expression 1: The two articles have similar findings.   
Expression 2: Both articles found the effects of social power on moral decision-making and on bias were complex.   
Expression 3: Both articles examined the complexity of how social power influenced moral decision and bias. Both articles investigated solutions to explain seeming contradictory findings of previous research. However, they employed different approaches. Article 2 utilized a moral orientation scale to assesfour thinking styles, while article 3 divided bias into implicit prejudice and stereotyping.

Critique ability was examined in by their responses to the seventh question on the reading tes as well a the supervisor's evaluation of the performance on the synthesi and presntation tasks.With the refeence to Dobson and Feak (2001) the rating of critique ability focused on three aspects, including i) how sound the research design and methods are; ii) how sound the logical reasoning of the conclusion from the results is; ii) how logically sound thearticle posed research questions from its core references. The supervisor rated their evaluative comments by checking to what degree they provided evidence. Table 3 shows the methods used to explore the four dimensions of EAP reading ability.

To investgate the second research question (i.e., To what factors do the graduate students attribute their EAP reading ability development), semi-structured interviews after each reading test were employed. The interviews were conducted in Chinese, recorded, and transcribed. The data were analysed through a two-cycle coding system (Miles, 1994) in terms of \*progres and obstacles" and "facilitating and inhibiting factors" after a thorough reading of all responses of three participants.

3.1. Comprehending the main idea by identifying important details of journal articles

To accurately understand the main idea of an article is the basic dimension of EAP reading ability. It i also the prerequisite for synthesis and critique abilities. The development of this ability was first explored by examining their performance on the comprehension test. Their scores are shown in Table 4.

The change of the three participants scores as wellas the amplitude of change were presented by the moving min-max graphs. Fig. 1a shows that Ana's reading ability of main idea comprehension improved rapidly in the first four readings, remained in a stable state for si wees in the middl priod, and slightl fluctated at a high level in th lat five redings.  suden and radical hange was detected in week 4 (see Fig. 1b). The developmental trajectory of Beth is similar with that of Anna. Her comprehension ability improved rapidly in the first five readings, although taking longer time than Anna to reach a high level of comprehension. Different from Anna, her omprehension ability fluctuated slightly in the middle period,followed by steady increase for five weeks, and a slight decrease in the last week. The change-point analysis identified a sudden change in week 2 (see Fig. 1d).

The developmental trajectory of Carol shared lttle with those of Anna or Beth. Shown in Fig. 1e, her starting point was the lowest among them. Her comprehension scores remained low for nine readings except for the seventh reading. Furthermore, the amplitude of change, indicated by the gap between min-max ines, remained large for 12 readings, while the length for Anna was five readings, and for Beth nine readings. Her score increased in the ast reading, which was different from Anna and Beth. A sudden change was found around week 3 (see Fig. 1f).

Allparticipants reached a high level in the las few weeks. This change was triangulated by thir dfferent remarks in the earlier and latter stage f the study. In the first three weeks, they talked more frequenty about ostace  reding comprehension, but in the last five weeks, they mentioned more about their progress (Fig. 2). The obstacles that they rerred most frequently were identifing core references," followed by \*understanding of methods section (especially statistical data analysis part)" and "understanding of conclusion section." One of the participants made the following comments in week 3.

Beth: I am confused about the meaning of core references. I do not know whether they mean the references that motivated the author to rit this articlr those h th hr ited rety. Moroer, thber of cre efece iffer in rticle. ons n this question.

However, near the end of the present study, the same participant expressed progress and confidence in reading comprehension

Beth: Core references are closely related to the research questions proposed by the author. Among the core references, the author noted that some problems need to be further investigated or other hypotheses could be used to explain a phenomenon.

The factors that facilitated or inhibited their progress f reading comprehension were also explored in interviews. The frequency was shown in Fig. 3. The inhibiting factors that they mentioned frequently were i) vocabulary, both discipline-specific and general words; and ii) academic backround. Two of the three participants did not major in psychology in undergraduate study, and they tended to attribute their reading difficulty to their limited academic knowledge of psychology.

Carol: I don't think I understand the article $( 3 ^ { r d }$ reading). There are so many terms, prejudice, bias, stereotyping. I thought they mean the same thing, but they do not inths rticl. Perhaps cause my major was ot psychology, even thee ts brought me so much dificuly.

The participants also talked about the factors that facilitated their progres. One of them was memorization of words. Realizing limited vocabulary hindered their progressin reading comprehension, they began to memorise unfamiliar words. The researchers also helped them collect and organise words they marked in the reding articles, so that they could review them ater the reading. They also mentioned that the supervisor's guidance helped them.

Anna: My supervisor taught me that my reading should center on the research questions of the article. This research-question-centere.   
reading strategy is very helpful. It helps me quickly identify answers to the comprehension questions.

Regarding the first dimension of EAP reading ability (i.e., comprehending main idea by identifying important detals of journal articles), the three participants developed very fast in the earlier stage, luctated slightl in the latter weeks, and finll reached a higher level. The factors that promoted their progress were memorizing unfamiliar vocabulary and the supervisor's guidance during the reading process.

# 3.2. Analysis ability regarding how research questions of articles were proposed

The second dimension of EAP reading ability was investigated, which is participants' ability to analyse how research questions or hypotheses of an article were proposed. The supervisor believed by guiding his students to analyse how other researchers put forward their research questions, they might learn some general logic reasoning methods to help them with generation of their own research questions for their degree theses.

Fig. 1. The moving min-max and the change-point graphs of the main idea comprehension.

Participants performance on Question 6 (i., How were the research questions or hypotheses proposed by the researchers?) and comments in interview were used to explore their development of analysis abilit. Their scores were shown in Table 5. The change of the three participants scores, the amplitude of change, and phase sifts were presented by the moving min-max and the change-point graphs (see Fig. 4).

Different from the performance on Question 1 (i.e., What were the research questions or hypotheses of the article you are reading?) this question about How" challenged them for a long period excet Anna. As shown in Fig. 4a, she reached a high level in week 4. The change-point analysis showed a sudden increase round week 3 (see Fig. 4b).

For Beth, the scores on question 6 were below 90 points out of 100 until wee 5. Beth experienced the greatest amplitude of change (see Fig. 4). A sudden change was found in week 4 (se Fig. 4d). Carol's development was comparatively moderate but stll underwent a sudden change in week 5 (see Fig. 4eand 4). She reached a high level until week 10. Overal, this dimension of EAP reading ability challenged them more than th firt dimension. They spent longer time to develop this aility although llparticipants could obtain a score above 90 in the last five readings.

Regarding factors that facilitate their progress they attributed ther improvement to the supervior's guidance. They remarked that the supervisor's elaboration afer the third reading helped them greatly. He guided them to understand how researchers proposed research questions by tracing the argument development of the authors.

Fig. 2. Frequency of obstacle and progress mentioned in the interview.

Supervisor: The authors of this article first presented wo contradictory explanations of aphenomenon (i.., power lds to greter bias) Then they hypothesised that the two explanations accounts for two diferent types of bias, one for prejudice and one for stereotyping Because the mechanisms for these two types of bias diffr, so the two contradictory explanations were both correct The contradiction of the two explanations is a research gap that the authors identified. To fillthe gap, the authors proposed their research questions.

The supervisor also illustrated other methods that research questions were proposed, for example, identifying a gap in research methods, or a gap in research design that might missa moderator variable. The participants believed that supervisor's guidance was the major facilitating factor for the development of analysis ability.

Regarding factors that inhibited their progress the participants mentioned dffrent factors in the interview. Anna recalled that she did not pay dueattention to related paragraphs where research questions were proposed. She just read the whole article paragraph by paragraph. Beth said key concepts and terminology challenged her most, and she attributed the difficulty to her disciplinary background. Carol said she did not posss adequate disciplinary knowledge of the research background. Although she could locate the paragraphs that the research questions were proposed, ifficulty in comprehension hindered her to analyse the logic of the reearcher's argument.

# 3.3. Ability to synthesise information from multiple sources

The third dimension of EAP reading ability, which is the ability to synthesise information from multiple articles, was explored by using the supervisor's evaluation of their performance on two synthesis writing and two presentation tasks. For the synthesis writing tasks, the supervisor emphasised thre aspects, including i) whether the participants could represent and integrate the information of articles accurately; ii) whether they could compare multiplearticles and identify similarites and differences in research methods, results, or conclusion, and i) whether they could identfy unresolved controversies. For the preentation tasks, the supervisor required them to present informed evaluative perspectives if osible research questions, based on synthesis writig. They all showed higher synthesis abilit in the second synthesis and presentation in week 16 than in week 6. Table 6 shows that in the second performance the participants incorporated more detal from the readings in their synthes and presentation. For instance, in the first synthesis, when Anna wrote about similrities btween articles 2 and3, she wrote that thee wo artice found that the efects of social power onmoral decision-making and on bias were complex, but she did not present details about in what way they were complex. However, in the second synthesis, she wrote that articles 6 and 8 examined the relationship between power and voice recognition, but article 8 divided the processing of tone into early and late processing stages, and the results revealed that high versus ow power led to different tone processing at the two stages.

Different from the development of the irst two dimensions of EAP reading ability, three participants attributed their progress to different factors. Anna remarked that to read the articles repeatedly helped her understand them thoroughly, so that she could appreciate similaritis and differences better. Bet said information from the internet helped her. She remarked that intilly she had no idea about how to write a synthesis but by searching the internet and reading information from different sources, she undersood the key elements of a synthesis Carol attributed her progressto the supervisor's feedback on her first synthesis and presentation. The supervisor suggested that she should incorporate evidence and details to support her claims in the synthesis. As to inhibiting factors Anna recalled that she had littl experience writing synthesis, and she believed more practice could help her. Beth remarked that she was faced with sere challenge of writing the firs synthesis because she had no knowledge of key elements or features of synthesis. To

Carol, her low comprehension ability hindered her to grasp relevant details, and consequently she was unabletocompare similarities and differences across multiple articles.

# 3.4. Critique ability of evaluating single and multiple articles

The development of the fourth dimension of EAP reading ability (i., critique ability) was investigated in two aspects, evaluation of single and multiple articles, as suggested by Swales and Feak (2012). First, their critique ability of a single article was examined by their performance on Question 7 on the reading test, which i, What do you think are strengths and weaknesses regarding the content of the article in terms of ) how sound the reearch deign and methods are i) how well the evidence supported the conclusin ii) how sound the researcher posed research questions from it core references. Second, their critique ability of multiple articles was inves. tigated by supervisor'sevaluation of the synthesis and presentation tasks. The critiques were required to focus on content rather than on language because they would not write their theses in English.

Regarding critique abilit of a single article, Anna was the first that expressed her evaluative comments. Doing the 3rd reading, Anna remarked that the reearch topic of racial discrimination was not closely related to the context in China. Chinese people would be more interested in topics about discrimination against migrant workers or against people from rural areas. As to the 7th reading, she said that the logical development of the whole article was not sound enough. She expressed positive evaluation about the 13th and 14th readings. Beth did not express any judgment on the articles except the last reading. She said she was still in the process of accumulating reading experiences. To the 14th reading, she commented that the research method was simple, and the discussion section was very clear. Carol made her first evaluative comment about the 12th reading. Before that, she said she could not make any evaluative comments; ll articles must be good; otherwise the supervisor would not lt them read. As to the 12th reading, she reported that the way the reearcher proposed the reearch questions was clear and logical. She said that i irst argued against the proposition f another article; then it advanced his own reearch questions. Regading the 14th reding, she commented that lthough the article was short and the experimental design was simple, it generated enough evidence to support his hypothesis. Regarding critique ability of multiple articles, they only expressed superficialevaluative comments. nna said she liked artices with the topic of voice reconition better than moral judgment, but her critique was based mostly on her personal opinions rather than in terms of significance of the topic in the disciplinary context (Dobson & Feak, 2001). Beth expressed positive evaluation on nearly allthe artice, and considered reading them provided an opportunity to accumulate background knowledge. However, her evaluation was merely personal with verylittle disciplinary support. Carol argued against a claim proposed in two articles about moral judgment but did not present any details or supporting evidence.

As to the factors that influenced the development of critique ability, it seems that their academic background played a big role. Anna made the most evaluative comments, and she also showed confidence in expressing her judgment. She was the only participant that majored in psychology in undergraduate study.

# 4. Discussion

4.1. How does EAP reading ability develop for gaduate students majoring in psychology when they read to generate research questions for their degree theses?

Considering the reading purpose of the current study, which was to generate research questions for master's degree theses, four dimensions of EAP reading ability were investigated. They included i) participants ability to comprehend main idea by identifying important dtais f joual artices; i) ability to analyse hw rearc questions r hypoths wre roose in the artice ii bility to synthesise information from multiple articles; and iv) critique aility to evaluate single and multiple article. These four dimensions of EAP reading ability developed in heterogenous ways. As to the first dimension,all three participants developed in non-linear trajectories. They developed rapidly in the earlier stage and fluctuated slightly in the latter stage. The development also showed idiosyncratic patterns. This non-linear and idiosyncratic development pattern of EAP reading ability was in line with the results of Author et al. (2021). They reported that al 27 Chinese chemistry undergraduates developed ther reading aility of textbooks written in English in non-linear patterns. Furthermore, each of them showed their own unique progres trajectory. From a CDST perspective, the development of a complex system is the result of the interaction between internal components of the system and the interaction between the system components and is environment (de Bot, Lowie, & Verspor, 2007; Elis & Larsen-Freeman, 2006; Larsen-Freeman & Cameron, 2008). Although they shared some common environmental factors, such as the same supervisor, their internal components were not the same, and the interaction was not identical. As a result, they presented diverse developmental trajectories.

In addition to non-linearity and the idiosyncrasy nature of the EAP reading ability development, the current study also found that the one with the greatest amplitude of change yielded the largest larning outcome. This finding was aligned with other CDST-based studies (e.g., Author et l., 2021; Lowie & Verspoor, 2019, Spoeman & Verspor, 2010). It presented further evidence of the claim that variability can be used to foresee development outcome, although the sample size of the current study was small

Regarding the second dimension (i.e., ability to analyse how research questions or hypotheses were proposed in an article), the participants progressed into asatisfactory level at diffrent times. Compared with the qestion of \*What were the research questions of the artice, the question of How were the research questions proposed" posed much greater challenge to the participants. The ability developed about two or three wees later than their ability to identify reearch questions and reached high levels. Although it had seldomly ben examined in previous research (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2013; White, 2009) this dimension of EAP reading ability was closely related to the present study. The supervisor assumed that analyzing the reasoning proces of how researchers conceive research questions in journal articles could help his students learn the logic argument loop and inspire them to generate their own research questions for their degree theses.

As to the third dimension (i.e., the ability to synthesise information from multiple articles), two of the thre participants developed to a satisfactory levelalthough they experienced tremendous challenges in the firs synthesis and presentation task. Compared withthe first two dimensions, which reached high levels at the end of the current study, the dimension of synthesis ability was not high enough. What the supervisor had valued most-incisive identification of controversial explanations, hypotheses, or findings across multiple readings--was not revealed in their assgnment performance. The difficulty involved with the development of synthesis ability was also reported by previous researchers (e.g., Dovey, 2010; Kuzborska, 2015; Kwan, 2008; Parkinson et al., 2007). Kuzborska noticed that a requirement to present an informed perspective of atopic was perceived by students to be far more burdensome than an understanding of others perspectives. The difficulty of synthesis may be because it involves more and higher levels of cognitive pro cesses. Only after students possess adequate reading comprehension abilit can they synthesise information from multiple sources. This dimension of ability requires readers to compare similarities and differences of diverse aspects (e.g., theoretical frameworks, research methods, findings) and to integrate diverse facets of comparisons into a holistic synthesis. It is believed that with more practice of synthesis writing, their synthesis ability might improve. However, in the present study, the participants only wrote sum maries twice.

Regarding the fourth dimension (i., critique ability to evaluate single and multiple articles), the participants unfortunately did not reach a satisfactory level. One of the participants expreed adequate critical responsestothe readin journal artce, ut two of them only showed preliminary and superfial evaluative perspectives. Although critique abilit is valued in all academic disciplines, the development of ths ability is trmendously difficlt (Holmes, 2004; Kuzborska, 2015). It i probably because to read criticlly,students should go beyond comprehension, to analyse to compare, and to present evaluative judgments. Another reason for the slow development of critique abilit may be that related practices were not adequate. The participants need more opportunities to practice.

4.2. To what factors did they attribute their EAP reading ability development?

The present study explored to what factors the participants attributed their EAP reading development. Major factors that they reported included their disciplinary knowledge, vocabulary, and supervisor's guidance. However, it seems these factors influenced different dimensions of EAP reading in different ways.

The first dimension, reading comprehension, was strongly influenced by disciplinary knowledge and vocabulary, although iden tification of core references was enhanced with the guidance of the supervisor. The role of these two factors to AP reading ability was also reported by a number of previous studies (e.g., Author, Chen, & Cheng, 2022; Davis, Huang, & Yi, 2017; Nergis, 2013; Uso-Juan, 2006).

Regarding the second dimension of EAP reading ability (i.e., aility to analyse how research questions or hypotheses were proposed in an article), the participants atributed its develoment mainly to the upervisor's guidance. They even did not realise its importance before the supervisor asked them to answer a question. The supervisor's emphasis on this ability was also related to the purpose of reading journal articles, which was to facilitate students to generate research questions for their own master degree theses.

The participants mainly atributed the development of synthesis and critique abilities to the supervisor's guidance, although critique ability had not yet flly developed. Previous rearch has also reorted the crtcl role of teachers to scaffold the development of the highly valued synthesis and critique abilities (Parkinson et al., 2007). Kuzborska (2015) reported that students from different disciplines (e.g., management, finance, and accounting) unanimously commented that tutors feedack seemed to have been a major cause for them to understand how to read texts criticall. lthough reading is commonly regarded as a behavior that reader is sitting by a desk and decoding texts by themselves, studies repeatedly reported the significant role ofteachers in the development of reading ability development. More studies are needed to report the les visible and les valued role of teachers in students EAP reading aility development.

Focusing on the unique interface between the reading purpose of generating research questions for degre theses and EAP reading ability development, the present study tracked the developmental trajectory of four dimensions of EAP reading ability and explored what factors that the participants atributed the development to. The interface between the purposes of EAP reading and the dimensions of the construct of EAP reading is complex because both sides are multitudinous. The purposes of EAP reading which were reported include i) to understand textbooks and science texts (e.g., utor et al, 2021; Davis et al., 2017; Ward, 201); i to mprove general academic literacy (e.g., Parkinson et al., 2007) ii to raise genre awarenes (e.g., Cheng, 2008); iv to improve perspective taking (Kuzborska, 2015); v) write laboratory reports (Kell-Laubscher et al., 2017); and vi) to write theses (e.g., Kwan, 2009; McCulloch, 2013). The construct of EAP reading abilit is also composed of diverse dimensions, for example, vocabulary (general and discipline-specific words), syntactic and discursive abilitie, as well as synthesis and critique abilities. The nature of multipledimensions of EAP reading construct is similar with that a diamond, which isalso multi-faceted. Which facets of a diamond sparkle is impacted by the direction and magnitude of light. Similarl, which dimensions f the construct of EAP reading are highlighted is also closely related to reading purposes.

Different EAP reading purposes may orient the attention of students, instructors, and researchers to specific dimensions of EAP reading ability. In the present study, the supervisor required participants to identify core references which were related to the proposition of the artice research questions, and he also directed participants' atention to the reasoning processof how researchers raised research questions. These kil were intructed intentionally and examined specificall, although other reading skills might develop incidentall (e.g., reading fluency). The present study explored these specific and fine-grained dimensions of EAP reading ability during the process of generating research questions for degree theses. It may shed new light on the understanding of the interface between reading purposes and EAP reading ability development.

# 5. Conclusion

Tracking the development of EAP reading ability of three graduate students majoring in psychology over time, the present study found that the four dimensions of EAP reading ability (i.e., comprehension, analysis, synthesi, and critique abilities) developed in different trajectories. Furthermore, individuals developed in thir idiosyncratic patterns. Comprehension ability developed earlier than analysis ability. While comprehension and analysis abilities finally developed into high levels, synthesis ability reached at a satisfactory level, but critique ability only showed ittle development. Furthermore, different factors were found to be related to the four dimensions of EAP reading ability. Disciplinary knowledge and vocabulary were more closely related to the development of comprehension ability than other factors. Supervisor's guidance contributed significantly to the development of analysis and synthesis abilities.

The present study may contribute to the literature in three aspects. First, this study was conducted in a "natural' educational setting. Viewing EAP reading as a purpose-directed and contex-specific behavior, this study explored the unique interface between graduate students' reading purpose of generation research questions for degree theses and the development of EAP reading ability. Second, this study provided further evidence that CDST-based perspective is a valuable complement to the traditional cros-sectional research. It uncovered inter-individual and inra-individual developmental variations even under the guidance of the same supervisor. Finally, this study reinforcd the role of teachers in the process of EAP reading development. Although reading is generally viewed as behaviors of readers involving with reading materials, the less visible role of teachers is genuinely significant.
