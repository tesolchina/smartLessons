Phrasal complexity is one of the sub-constructs of syntactic complexity, which focuses on phrasal elaboration. This paper identifies the use of different types of phrasal elaboration demonstrated in Chinese college students' argumentative writing, and investigates phrasal complexity in written production of Chinese EFL tertiary learners majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and English (EM), in comparison to sample essays written by expert writers collected from EFL textbooks (TB). A framework of indices of phrasal elaboration is first established in this study based on grammatical form and syntactic function of phrases. The study finds that the following grammatical forms appear significantly more in argumentative writing collected from textbooks or produced by proficient English majors (with no significant difference found between the two groups): noun phrases functioning as subjects/objects, prepositional phrases (as against to-infinitives, which are significantly fewer) functioning as adverbials, prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers and their multiple embedding, multiple attributive embedding as premodifiers, and appositive phrases. Pedagogical implications for L2 English writing are provided.

# 1. Introduction

Syntactic complexity refers to variety of syntactic forms of language production and degree of sophistication of such forms (Lu, 2010; Ortega, 2003; Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998), where variety refers to the range of syntactic structures, and sophistication refers to the extent to which the syntactic structures are elaborated and complex. In second language (L2) writing research that focuses on assessing learners' written production, syntactic complexity refers to a subsystem of linguistic complexit (Housen & Kuiken, 2009; Lu, 2017) characterized as the extent to which language produced in performing a task s elaborate and varied (Elis, 2003, p. 340). Linguisic complexity consists of several sub-constructs, including lexical, interactional, propositional, and grammatical/syntactic complexity (Bulte & Housen, 2014; Elis & Barkhuizen, 2005); syntactic complexity has received the most attention among L2 writing researchers.

The construct of syntactic complexity is fundamental and significant to research in domains of applied linguistics and second Ianguage acquisition (SLA). Syntactic complexity, together with accuracy and fluency, has long ben used not only to describe performance by native speakers or first language learners, but also recognized as a complementary dimension for measuring L2 proficiency, as well s serving as an index of language development and progress(e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Housen & Kuiken, 209; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Pllott, 2009; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). Measures of syntactic complexity are therefore important in the field of SLA and L2 writing research. Researchers have investigated the relationship of syntactic complexity to L2 proficiency (e.g, Biber, Gray, & Staples, 2016; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003) and to L2 writing quality (e.g., Kyle & Crossley, 2018; McNamara, Crossley, & McCarthy, 2010; Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013; Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015). Attention has also ben paid to the trajectory of L2 learners' syntactic development (e.g., Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011; Bulte & Housen, 2014, 2018; Xu, 2017), factors affcting syn. tactic complexity in L2 writing (e.g., Ansarifar, Shahriari, & Pishghadam, 2018; Lu & Ai, 2015; Yoon & Polio, 2016), as wl as validty and reliabilit f omplexity measures (g., Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016; Elis & Barkhuizen, 2005; Malvern, Chipere, Richards, & Duran 2004; Ortega, 2003; Pallotti, 2015; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998).

Phrasal complexity, in contrast to clausal complexity, is one of the sub-constructs of syntactic complexity, which focuses on grammatical devices such as phrasal elaboration (e.g. attributive adjective $^ +$ noun, prepositional phrases as post-modifiers, etc.). It has graduallygained attention of research in recent years, with scholars such as Biber and Gray (2010), Biber et al. (2011), Lu (2011), Norris and Ortega (2009) proposing that academic writing features phrasal complexity rather than clausal embedding and is characterized syntactically by the use of noun phrase constituents and complex phrases. Phrasal complexity is research ground worthy of investigation, perhaps shedding light on the development of L2 writing, and in turn improving writing instruction and assessment practice (Taguchi et al., 2013).

# 1.1. Measures of syntactic complexity and the rising awareness of phrasal contribution

Specifically,traditional variables measuring syntactic complexity can be clasified into length-based and ratio-based measures that involve T-units (a main clause plus allassociated dependent clauses), such as the mean length of T-units (words per T-unit), mean length of clauses (words per clause), clauses per T-unit or dependent clauses per T-unit. The underlying assumption is that complex sentences are generally long, and contain various embedded clauses contributing to structural complexity. Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) commented that T-unit-based measures are the most satisfactory measures for the description of syntacticomplexity since they are associated linearly and consisently with practices in programs and schools, as well as with holistic rating levels, and therefore, ae able to indirectly characterize language development and language proficiency.

However, with their widespread aplication, syntactic complexity measures based on T-units, despite their easy form of formula and convenience of calculation, have been criticized for their redundancy and disproportionate focus on clausal embedding. For example, Norris and Ortega (2009) observed that the T-unit-based indices all feature subordinate clauses, and therefore are all equivalent, thereby viewing syntactic complexity as "a phenomenon of subordination exclusively" (Norris & Ortega, 2009, p. 560) They also added that the only way in which values for this family of measures would show an increase is when more subordinate clauses are produced. In this way, the evaluation of syntactic complexty in large measure depends on the number of clauses and their length, regardless of other grammatical devices used to create complex sentence structures.

Likewise, Biber et al. (2011) criticized the inappropriateness of mere T-unit measurement for the assessment of writing development since T-unit-based measures failed to distinguish among learner groups at different proficiency level; furthermore, empirical studies (eg., Bardovi-Harlig, 1992) have filed to \*ind consistent increases for T-unit-ased measures as students advance in language proficiency" (Bardovi-Harlig, 1992, p. 13). Kyle and Crossley (2018) concluded T-unit-based indices produce difficulty in interpretation. For instance, clauses can be lengthened both by the adition of complements and through phrasal elaoration, but the values of such indices are not able to report which specific grammatical device is employed in terms of grammatical elaboration.

# 1.2. Empirical studies on phrasal complexity

As argued by Biber et al. (2011), unlike other spoken and written registers, academic writing has its phrasal discourse style, in which extensive use of noun phrase modification can be observed. Biber and Gray (2016) clamed that \*phrasal modifiers are equally importantalthough fundamentall differentreflections of complexty (Biber & Gray, 2016, p. 256) and calle for \*at last equal attention to the phrasal structures that make academic writing distinctive' (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2013, p. 197).

Consequent research took into consideration the contribution of complex noun phrases to overall syntactic complexity. Norris and Ortega (2009) advocated consideration of an additional holistic measure: mean length of clause. The underlying assumption is that the addition of phrases and non-finite clauses wil contribute to the length of finite clauses, so this measure serves as a complement to measures of clausal complexity and can be interpreted as a reflection of phrasal elaboration. Lu (2011), as well, through his Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (SCA) which is able to conduct automated analysis of syntactic complexity, included indices such as complex phrases per clause/T-unit and complex nominals per clause/T-unit, taking into account the dimension of phrasal elaboration Pallti (2015) proposed using measures like number of words per phrase, number of phrases per clause, as well as number of clauses per T-Unit to measure syntactic complexity where the number of words per phrase and number of phrases per clause evaluate complexity on a phrasal level, while the number of clauses per T-Unit evaluate complexity on a clausal level.

De Clercq and Housen (2017) following Palloti (2015)'s work, employed length measures of the noun phrase, the clause, and the AS-unit, as wellas a clause-linking measure representing the number of lauses per AS-unit In a later study, Bulte and Housen (2018), similarly, in addition to using traditional syntactic complexity measures like mean length of T-unit, mean length of finite clause, included mean length of noun phrase as well in order to examine complexity at phrasal level. In short, though dfferent scholars may define measures of syntactic complexity with slight differences, previous research has shown that a richer set of dimensions is more usefully descriptive when measuring syntactic complexity in a holistic manner.

The incorporation of phrasal complexity measures yielded a great number of research findings that informed the previous un. derstanding f features of academic writing. For instance, Lu (2011) analyzed a corpus of English essays written by first language (L1) Chinese students and found that complexity measures that best discriminate betwen proficiency levels are the number of complex nominals per clause (e.g., adjective $^ +$ noun, possessives, prepositional phrases), as well as the mean length of clause and sentence. McNamara et al. (2010) maintained that the best indicators of writing quality include features such as complexity at phrase level (number of words before main verb), lexical diversty, and use of les frequently appearing words, again lending support to the claim that complexit measures beyond the clause level are relevant indicators of English writing proficiency. More specificall, it has been claimed that subordinating conjunctions and that-relatie clauses are more frequent in the lower scored essays, while more atributive adjectives, post-noun-modifying are more frequent in higher-rated esays (Taguchi et al., 2013), supporting the claim that complexity measured by the use of dependent clauses does not necessaril characterize academic writing. Similarl, Kyle and Crossey (2018) also proposed that fine-grained indices of phrasal complexit (e.g, number of dependents per prepositional object) are stronger predictors of sophisticated academic writing than either traditional syntactic complexity indices (e.g, MLC) or minutely counted clausal complexity indices.

More recentl, researchers have interrogated syntactic complexity at the phraal level and investigated the relationship of phrasal complexit to academic writing quality. In a closer and more detailed look into the characteristics of academic writing at noun phrase level, Lan and Sun (2019), focusing onthe measures of 11 noun modifiers, found that the modifiers, especially one at the phraal level. appear more frequently in academic context. Gardner, Nesi, and Biber (2019) discovered in student assgnment writing that "informational density, characterized by long words, nominalizations, atributive adjectives and abstract nouns, increases with levels of academic study (from undergraduate to master's level). Casal and Lee (2019) also concluded that phrasal syntactic complexity, rather than clausal complexity, is a more significant measure for comparing academic writig of different graded tiers, again lending support to previous claims of the contribution of phrasal complexity to academic writing quality.

Despite exhaustive efforts to perfect measures to represent syntactic complexity and indicate language proficiency, previous research is, however, not without its limitations. Basically, most indices, be they length-based or ratio-based, are dificult to be interpreted in detail. For instance, a high value of mean length of noun phrase can be interpreted to mean that learners of acertain proficiency level ae able to produce onger phrases, ut i fails to rort how the lgth f noun phrai increased, or in ther word What constitutes complex noun phrases (Biber, Gray, Staples, & Egbert, 2020). Phrase level complexity, i some studies (e.g., Norris & Ortega, 2009; Youn, 2014), were indirectly rflected in other clausal measures, such as mean length of clause. Against this ackground, related research seems to require a comprehensive analytical framework of phrasal complexity involving more linguistically inter pretable and self-explanatory indices. Besides, though researchers have considered the contribution of phrasal elaboration, findings are stil imprecise as to phrasal complexity and empirical interpretations to determine the relationship between phrasal elaboration and L2 writing development.

# 1.3. The present study

The present study aims to explore a more detailed use of phrasal elaboration in the writing of college students, and to investigate how L2 leaners advance in phrasal complexity as they become more proficient in English. Phrasal complexity isapproached from two dimensions, grammatical forms (non-finite clauses and phrases) and syntactic functions (oun modifiers, adverbials, subjects/objects) We compare English argumentative writing produced by L1 Chinese collge students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (STEM), and prose produced by 1 Chinese college students majoring in English (EM), with essays by L1 English expert writers collected from EFL textbooks (TB) we then analyze how phrasal complexity is diferent in argumentative writing produced by the different groups mentioned above.

The current study aims to address the following questions:

Q1: What are the patterns of reliance on phrasal elaboration in the argumentative writing of STEM, EM, and TB? Q2: Where do differences, if any, lie in the use of phrasal features in argumentative writing of STEM, EM, and TB?

This study hopes to provide a systematic and lingusticall interpretable framework for measuring phrasal complexity through supplementing the present evaluation of syntactic complexity in a more holistic manner. The research findings are expected to ll. minate phrasal complexity features of different syntactic functions, and thus contribute to a clearer understanding of complexity at the phrase level in written registers.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Data sources

A dataset consisting of three sub-datasets was established: argumentative writing produced by STEM students and English majors and sample essays composed by expert writers colected from EFL textbooks of Englis argumentative writing, respectively. Each subdataset included argumentative writing of 15,00-25,000 words in total. To control for the efect of task/genre on syntactic complexity, argumentative writing was chosen for analysis in this research because argumentation displays higher syntactic complexity and more similarity with academic registers in contrast to other types of writing, such as narrative writing (e.g., Lu, 2011; Polio & Yoon, 2018; Yoon & Polio, 2017). We use the terms "argumentative writing" and \*academic writing" interchangeably in this essay; here we mean not disciplinary writing like that found in profesional journals, but rather the types of agumentative writing used and required in university-level classes.

Participants in this research included 41 sTEM students and 30 English majors who were all junior students from a top-50 university in southwestern China. Among the participants, 13 were females and 28 were males in the STEM group, while 25 were females and 5 were males in the EM group. These students were enrolled acording to their performances in the National College Entrance Examinations in which English proficiency was tested. The underlying assumption is that the two types of students might display approximately the same level of English language proficiency by the time they were enrolled, but after three years of training, English majors might demonstrate a higher levelof English proficiency surpassing that of the STEM group and approaching the competence of native peakers, especill i syntactic proficiency demonstrated in English writing. To be specific, TEM students, afer entering college, received only general English instruction whil English majors received instruction not only focusing on English language skills, (ie., istening, speaking, reading and writing), but aso on English and American culture and literature, English grammar and English academic writing. In addition to course orientation, intensity and durationof instruction also diffred markedly between EMs and STEM students. The English trining program offered EMs, on average, 18 class periods per week for three years while STEM students reived many fwer clas periods - 4clss perids per wek n he first r, 2 clas perds r weekfor the second yar nd no English courses for the third year.

Datasets were created in the hope that the collected essays represented the highest level of syntactic proficiency in each student group, so every piece of argumentative writing by STEM students and English majors, before being collcted, was the production of untimed writing and multiple revisions by its author. To reduce the potentialinfluence of topic familiart on the written output, and considering that the analysis in this research is product-oriented rather than content-oriented, topics of argumentative writing were not restricted. Students were encouraged to engage with any one of the provided controversial topics including, but not limited to, plastic surgery, budgeting money, campus love, taking a gap year, etc. Argumentative writing texts by expert writers were collected from two EFL textbooks: Contemporary College English (Intermediate Writing-Book Two: Argumentation and Persuasion) and Writing Criticall (Book Three Argumentative Writing) published by the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Pres (FLTRP), which are widely used for argumentative writing teaching at college level in Chinese universtie. very unit in the textbook focuses on a certain argumentative topic where sample essays composed by native English writrs are provided to familiarize students with the ssue and writing techniques. These textbooks are special designed for college-level English argumentative writing teaching, and the language in the articles by expert writers (with moderate dificulty for students) is expected to serve as a model for students when composing their own argumentative writing.

As demonstrated in Table 1, argumentative texts collcted from textbooks (TB) were usually longer than those produced by EMs and STEM students; therefore, we included fewer argumentative texts from the textbooks to balance the total number of words inthe three sub-datasets. Even though we reduced the number of argumentative essays collcted from textboos to 26 pieces, the total number of words was stil 10,000 more than that of EMs and of STEM students. We did not reduce the length of the TB texts so as to retain their completeness and authenticity. Frequency comparisons of grammatical features were done on the basis of the number of occurrences per clause. A clause hre is dind as  ytacticstrcte wth a subject and fite verb, inldng indendet relative, adverbial, and nominal clauses, but excluding non-finite clauses, in line with the work of Fischer (1984), Lu (2011), Casal and Lee (2019), to name a few. In this way, the impact of the difference of words in total in three subsets could be eliminated.

# 2.2. Framework of phrasal complexity indices

We approached the analytical framework of phrasal elaboration from two dimensions: grammatical form and syntactic function. Phrases as sentence constituents can be divided into different cateories based on their different syntactic functions. They can function as subjects/objects of a verb, as adverbials or as attributes. Among al the grammatical forms of phrasal elaboration that can realize syntactic functions of subjects/objects, adverbials and attributes, 13 indices were selected for this study, as shown in Fig. 1, to capture phrasal features of argumentative writing and to measure phrasal complexity. Complexity of such phrasal structures was determined according to syntactic complexity hierarchies raised by Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) and Biber et al. (2011).

# 2.2.1. Phrases functioning as subjects/objects

In this category of phrasal elaboration functioning as subjects/objects, three grammatical forms of interest were included: noun phrases, infinitives and gerunds, with a hypothesized gradual increase in phrasal complexty. Phrases with nouns as heads are the most common form of subjects/objects. Noun phrases are normally structured with determiner, premodifier, the head noun, and postmodifier, where the head and determiner are basically required, while premodifiers and postmodifier can usually be omitted (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 199, p. 240). In the category of phrases functioning assubjects/ojects, theterm \*noun phrase" refers only to the head noun plus any determiner, excluding any atributes that may be present in the noun phrase, for the premodifiers and postmodifiers were captured and analyzed in another category (i.e, functioning as atribute, to be introduced below). Infinitives (to- and bare forms) and gerunds with or without their subjects were also included in this category of phrases functioning as subjects/objects. The proper use of gerunds, in contrast to infinities, may be more challenging for L2 leanerstomaster, especially those with subjects (e., \*they ard about you missing the firs class). Objects captured in the analysis included direct and indirect objects to a transitive verb, noun phrases fllowing a copular verb, as well as objects to phrasal and prepositional verbs.

# 2.2.2. Phrases functioning as adverbials

Different scholars defined the category of adverbials variously (Hassegard, 2010). For instance, there are four categories of grammatical functions of adverbials according to Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik (1985): adjuncts, subjuncts, disjuncts and conjuncts. Biber et al. (1999) viewed adverbials as clause elements that add circumstantial information about the proposition (circumstance adverbial), expresstances stance adverbials), or state relationships between two units of discourse (linking adver. bials). Aarts (2001) used the term \*Adjuncts' in a wider sense than that in Quirk et al. (1985) to name adverbials, the grammatical construct that is optional and expreses peripheral information (Aarts, 2001, p. 21). This study, however ike Aarts (2001), did not discriminate different subcategories of adverbials, unlike Quirk et al. (1985) or Biber et al. (1999). Prepositional phrases (e.g., She will meet me in the clssroom") and non-finite adverbial lauses were captured in this category of analysis Non-finite adverbial clauses include toinfinitive clauses (e.., To travel abroad, learning foreign language is essential), and other forms of non-finite adverbial clauses such as -ing and d particple  Exhauste, he rtnd home, leving allhis belongings behind). For the later, this category of grammatical features was named \*non-finite adverbial phrases" for the convenience of discrimination. We therefore took into consideration these 3 grammatical features in this category of analysis: prepositional phrases toinfinitives and non-finite adverbial phrases.

# 2.2.3. Phrases functioning as attributes

Phrasal elaboration can also be realized through the use of atributes, or, in other words, noun modifiers. Common forms of noun modifiers include atributive adjectives, nouns as noun pre-modifiers and prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers. Non-finite adjective phrases, multiple atributive embedding as pre-modifiers and post-modifiers and appositive phrases, which are more common in an academic register, were aso taken into consideration. Finll, we counted 7 grammatical features of phrasal complexity that function as attributes.

All elected phrasal complexity indices are presented in Table 2, together with illustrations of each grammatical feature.

# 2.3. Coding and data analysis

This study relied on the manual analysis of texts, since the automatic syntactic taggers and analyzers available have dificulty identifying noun phrases of different syntactic functions. This method of coding is advantageous in that it yields more accurat reults, but cannot be easily used to analyze very large amounts of data. Though automated tagging can be used to analyze very large corpora, Biber and Gray (2011) admitted that the automated tagging system was not completely accurate and that, for structures such as prepositional phrases and appositive phrases, manual coding needed to be employed.

The coding was conducted based on the smallest grammatical unit of phrases. An example from our datasets to illustrate the coding process i provided below where the captured indices of phrases functioning as subjects/objects in the analytical framework are in bold, adverbials in italics, and attributes underlined.

Summary of results:

1. Number of (finite) clauses: 8   
2. Phrases functioning as subjects/objects: Noun phrases (9); Infinitives (2)   
3. Phrases functioning as adverbials: Prepositional phrases (6)   
4. Phrases functioning as atributes: Aributive adjectives (3); Nouns as noun pre-modifiers (1); Prepositional phrases as noun   
post-modifiers (1); Multiple attibutive embedding as pre-modifiers (1); Multiple prepositional embedding as post-modifiers (1)

When the coding of allphrasal complexity indices of the dataset was completed, an independent coding was done by an applied linguist who has more than 20 years of English grammar teaching experience at college level. The coding results were then compared; average agreement reached $9 0 \%$ . The disagreed cases, which mainly concerned the identification of non-finite adverbial phrases and non-finite adjective phrases, were reolved afer further discussions. After identifying these grammatical features in our dataset, we counted the occurrence of each grammatical feature and divided it by the number of clauses per text. Because of the violation of assumptions of MANOVA, we firstly used a nonparametric rank-based MANOVA (Dobler et al., 2020). For the clusters of variables (cluster 1: phrases functioning as subjects/objects; cluster 2: phrases functioning as adverbials; and cluster 3: phrases functioning as attriutes wth significant ifferences acros three groups, we used a ne-way ANOA on ranks, also known as the Kruskal-Walli tes, with Bonferroni correction to determine which variables were significantly diffrent across groups. Finally, pairwise Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction were conducted for comparisons between groups.

# 3.1. Research question 1

Table 3 summarizes the descriptive statistics of each phrasal complexity measure for STEM, EM and TB groups. For each measure calculated in the study, the table presents is minimum and maximum value, together with mean value and standard deviation (SD) The value is normalized by being divided by the number of clauses, representing the frequency count of each phrasal complexity feature per clause. Fig. 2 graphically llustrates the mean value of normalized frequency of phrases functioning as subjects/objects, While Fig. 3 and Fig. 4preset the mean value of normalized frequency of phrases functioning as adverbials and atributes respectively.

In the use of phrasal modification, the three groups showed similarity among l indices. Noun phrases as subjects/objects were used most frequently acros three groups, followed by infinitives and gerunds. For phrasal elaboration functioning as adverbials, prepositional phrases were used the most frequently among the different types of writer, with to-infinitives being the second most popular and non-finite adverbial phrases the third. For phrasal elaboration functioning as attributes, the top three most widely used phrasal elaboration devices as atriutes by all groups wereattributive adjectives, prepositional phrases as post-modifiers, and mul. tiple attributive mbedding as pre-modfiers. The least frequently used forms of phraal elaboration by all thre groups were non-finite adjective phrases, multiple prepositional phrases as post-modifiers and appositive phrases.

Results of the Kruskal-Walls test with Bonferroni correction are hown in Table 4. 7 out of 13 variables--noun phrases functioning as subjects/objects, prepositional phrases and toinfinities functioning as adverbials, as wellas prepositional phrases as noun postmodifiers, multiple attributive embedding as pre-modifiers, appositive phrases and multiple prepositional embedding as postmodifiers - were significantly different at the group level.

For the 7 variables that were found to be significantly different across groups, pairwise Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction were conducted for comparisons between groups. The results are presented in Table 5.

Statistical analysis showed significant differences in the mean value f 5 out of the 13 grammatical devices of phrasal elaboration between TB and STEM groups: noun phrases functioning as subjects/objects, prepositional phrases and to-infinitives functioning as adverbials, as well as apositie phrases and multiple prepositional embedding as post-modifiers; 4 out of the 13 grammatical devices between EM and STEM groups: prepositional phrases and toinfinities functioning as adverbials, as well as prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers, and multiple atributive embedding as pre-modifiers. No significant difference was found in the studied grammatical devices between TB and EM groups.

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Phrasal elaboration functioning as subjects/objects

The significant difference for the use of phrasal elaboration functioning as subjects/objects lies in the use of noun phrases $( \eta ^ { 2 } =$ 0.0714, medium effect size) between TB and STEM groups. There were significantly more noun phrases that serve as subjects/objects found in textbook texts (1.3612 times per clause) than writing produced by STEM students (1.2728 times per clause). In contrast, the results did not reveal any significant difference in the use of infinities and gerunds as subjects/objects among the three groups. It is interesting, but not surprig, that although infinitives and gerunds are viewed as a grammatical construct that is ssumed to be more syntactically complex and acquired in later stages, these two grammatical devices did not distinguish among groups when functioning as subjects/objects. Biber et al's (1999: 754) work on register distribution of grammatical featuers indicated that non-finite complement clauses, i.. to-clauses and ing-clauses (as opposed to finte complement clauses, ie. that-clauses and wh-clauses) are most common in written registers (fiction, news, and academic prose) and rare in conversation. Note that the infinitives and gerunds captured in this category have a more limite syntactic function (only those functioning as subjects or objects were counted) than the nonfinite complement clauses in Biber et al. (1999). There were also seemingly contradictory findings, with regard to the use of in. finitives and gerunds found in more concrete post-predicate structures. For instance, one of the research findings of Biber et al. (2011: 23) was that the structure "verb $^ +$ -ing clause" appears in conversation 6.5 times more than that in academic texts and \*verb $^ +$ to clause" in conversation 1.4 times more. In addition, "desire verb. $+ \ t o$ clauses' was found to be frequent in low-scoring spoken task responses of TOEFL iBT tests, as was reported by Biber and Gray (2013: 43). As for comparison among written registers, \*verb + to clauses" were produced significantly les often in academic proe (2.1 times per 1000 words) than in novels and newspaper prose (4.3 and 4.2 times per 1000 words, respectively) (Biber & Gray, 2016). A possible reason for the differences from previous findings for infinitives and gerunds could be the contribution of infinitives and gerunds as post-predicates complementing an adjective (as opposed to complementing a verb) included in Biber et al. (1999). The presence of infintives and gerunds in the subject position, though probably les frequent, could alsobe an influential factor given that the above-mentioned explicit structres in Biber et al. (2011) and Biber and Gray (2013, 2016) are al post-predicate structures. By implication, we believe more empirical research, possibly analyzing phrasal features in the subject and object positions separately under the assumption that the two functions have different scopes for complexity and involving adjective post-predicate structures, may be needed to probe further into the phrasal complexity of written registers.

# 4.2. Phrasal elaboration functioning as adverbials

For phrasal elaboration functioning as adverbials, the frequency of prepositional phrases is significantly different $( p = 0 . 0 0 0 <$ 0.05; $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 9 4 9$ large effect size) between TB and STEM groups as well as between EM and STEM groups. TB group (0.4658 per clause) produced approximately twice as many prepositional phrases as STEM students (0.244 per clause) did per clause. In one of the few studies that involved the variable of prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials (most studies only investigated post-nounmodifying prepositional phrases, or did not discriminate between the two), Biber and Gray (2010) discovered that prepositional phrases used as adverbials are more common in academic writing than in conversation. Similarly, as was reported in the work of Biber et al. (2011), the frequency of the occurrence of prepositional phrases as adverbials is significantly higher $( p < 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ in academic writing (31.6 times per 1000 words than in conversation (22.9 times per 1000 words). We are unable to make further comparisons with existing research findings (e.g, whether prepositional phrases as adverbials are more frequent in high-rated writing) given the limited amount of scholarship available, but as far as our rearch indicates, using preositional phrases as adverbals sms to be more favored by proficient textbook writers and English majors, as compared with using to-infinitives and non-finite adverbial phrases.

Excerpt 1 (text.1306 in TB group)

This attitude has several reasons rooted in the development of modern society. One reason is the great change which occurred in the twentieth centuy wth respect t the choice of a ove oject. In the Victrian age, as in many traditional culture, love was mostly not a spontaneous personal experience which then might lead to marriage. On the contrary, marriage was contracted by convention -either by the respective familie, or by a marriage broker, or without the help of such intermediarie; it was concluded on the basis of social considerations, and love was supposed to develop once the marriage had been concluded. In the last few generations the concept of romantic love has become almost universal in the Western world.

Excerpt 2 (text. 349 in STEM group)

Students' evaluation of teaching is an intuitive yardstick to test teachers' teaching effect. The universty is not the workshop of knowledge production while the teaching proces is not mechanical handling. Students' scores cannot directly reflect teachers' teaching level. In this case, if teachers want to know whether there are omissions in thir taching designs, whether the teaching focus is clear, and whether the teaching process is coherent, self-judging alone is far from enough. They need to give students a certain authority and listen to their opinions and suggestions. The teaching evaluation can comprehensively consider teachers teaching achievements from many aspects.

Excerpt 1 is a part of an essay collected from textbooks and Excerpt 2 isthe writing produced by a STEM student. The contrast may reflect th ifference i the use of prepositional phrases as adverbials between two groups. Prepositional phrases which function as adverbials are underlined in italics. In Excerpt 1, the writer used a high number of prepositional phrases to enrich the content and provide peripheral information on where (e.g., in many traditional cultures) when (e., in the twentieth century), and how (e.g., by convention) of the icussed object as wellas signaling the connections between discourses (e.g., on the contrary), while in Excerpt 2, the writer used fewer prepositional phrases as adverbials.

Secondly, it is found that STEM group (0.1292 times per clause) used significantly more to-infinitives $( p = 0 . 0 0 < 0 . 0 5 ; \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 2 1 _ { \ L }$ large effect size) than TB group (0.0758 times per clause) and EM group (0.0815 times per clause). It sms that toinfinitives are more popular with L2 English learners of lower proficiency considering the tatistical results. It s also worth noting that although non-finite adverbial phrases are considered to be more tructurally complex than prepositional phrases and toinfinitives, few were observed in collected textbook texts, only 0.026 times per clause, the lowest among three groups, while in contrast prepositional phrases as adverbials were prevalent, occurring 0.466 times per clause, the highest among the three groups. This research findig echoes Biber et al. (2016); in this study a developmental progression of grammatical complexity features for both L1 English and L2 English writers was hypothesized to begin with \*finite dependent clauses" (e.g., finite adverbial clauses), and then to advance to non-finite dependent clauses" (e.g., to-infinitives $^ +$ non-finite adverbial phrases), and finally to "dependent phrases" (e.g., prepositional phrases).

# 4.3. Phrasal elaboration functioning as attributes

For phrases functioning as atribute, a significant difference lies in the use of prepositional phrase as noun post-modifiers between EM and STEM groups, with medium effect size $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 0 3 2 )$ . Prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers have been frequently reported to be observed in academic writing as opposed to conversation (Biber & Gray, 2010), higher-rated essays (Taguchi et al. 2013), or higher-level (MA-level) writig (Parkinson & Musrave, 2014). Along with atributie adjectives, prepositional phrases are the second most commonly used phrasal elaboration in argumentative writing produced by all groups, though EM and TB groups produced more of them than the STEM group. We assume that this phenomenon of using prepositional phrases can be possbly explained by register awarenes. In comparison to conversation, argumentative writing is a relatively formal register and it style is fairly close to that of academic writing, in which using prepositional phrases as noun post modifiers isa prevailing way to supplement and compress information. Writers who have the awareness of register ifference may adjust their writig styles and tend to use more prepositional phrases to enrich information of the head noun when it comes to argumentative writing. This was also found to be true in Biber and Gray (2013), who undertook a comprehensive lexico-grammatical description of the discourse produced in response to TOEFL spoken and written tass by test takers from different score levels. They found that prepositional phrases ocurred circa 80 times per 100 words in spoken tasks while, in contras, circa 103 times per 1000 words in writing tasks with the rate foccurrenceof prepositional phrases $2 5 \%$ higher. They also concluded that TOEFL iBT test takers at all proficiency levels \*demonstrate the ability to vary their linguistic styles acros the spoken and written modes" (Biber & Gray, 2013, p. 63). In a word, EM and TB's high frequency of the use of prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers can also be interpreted as a result of adjusting linguistic style.

Multiple prepositional embedding as post-modifier i another measure discriminating textbook texts and argumentative writing of STEM students $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 8 0 5$ , medium efect size). The mean value of the frequency of multiple prepositional embedding as postmodifier in textbook texts is 0.0544, 2.5 times as much multiple prepositional embedding per clause as the sTEM group produced. This grammatical device of intensive structural embedding, creating dense information with few verbs, contributes much to the compressed discourse style of academic writig, with the underlying functional motivation, as claimed by Biber and Gray (2016: 207), of a "drive towards economy of expresson," that is to convey the maximum amount of information in the fewest words possible. Excerpt 3illustrates how the textbook text employed multiple prepositional embedding to enrich the information of the head noun and condense the sentence.

Excerpt 3 (text. 1362 in TB group)

Research has shown that without the awarenes, intention or control of an individual, the perception [of a connection [be. tween subjects and behaviours]] are reinforced by their repetition. This is not simply a matte of ffcting opinion but [of having a real effect [upon behaviours and ability]]. For example, research has shown that when gender is made salient, people perform acording to the stereotypical ability of their gender (e.g. women less capable at maths, men less capable at empathy)-however, when gender is not mentioned, there is no such correlation in performance. The subconscious nature [of this compliance [to a norm]] demonstrates that while individuals may consciously reject gender roles, their subconscious continues to unknowingly make gendered associations and behave in gender "appropriate" ways.

Similar to multiple prepositional embedding as post-modifiers, another measure of structural embedding captured in the analysis multipleaributive embedding as pre-modifiers also helps achieve the goal of economy of expressing ideas, and was found to significantly discriminate between EM and STEM group texts $\left( { p = 0 . 0 0 5 3 } \right)$ . Excerpt 4 is an example of how English majors used multiple attributive embedding as pre-modifiers (underlined in italics).

Excerpt 4 (text. 438 in EM group)

For one thing, Chinese people are so hard-working that it surprises or even shocks almost every westerner. A typical Chinese teacher works roughly $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ a day, 7 days a week, teaching 20 classes a week and spending hours and hours in the office; an ordinary Chinese worker, devotes over $4 4 \ \mathrm { h }$ a week working in domestic manufacturing industry. China makes the goods that supplies the world's markets and is now the world's No.1 exporting country. This is due to a combination of different factors in which hard work is the key. It is the hard-working Chinese people that has created the world's second largest economy, attracting companies and investment from around the world, and creating a little global village in China itself.

In Excerpt 4, the hard-working Chinese people" means \*the Chinese people who work hard'" \*the world's No.1 exporting country" can be paraphrased as the exporting country that ranks first in the world"; alittle global villge is equivalent to "aglobal illage which is small insize". This compressed' style, as Biber and Gray (2010) noted, is distinctive in academic writing. EM group (0.2081 times per clause) used even more such attributes than TB group (0.1664 times per clause). This perhaps resulted from the syntactic influence of the first language of EMs involved in this study. In Chinese, nearly all atributes are placed organically ahead of the head noun. So L1 Chinese learners might be well familiar with the use of multiple atributive embedding. However, the STEM group, though sharing the same L1 background with the EM group, failed to produce the same level of multiple atributive embedding as EM did. This could possibly be due to their lower language proficiency in that the production of multipl attributive embedding needs careful consideration and the cognitive effort for extracting and summarizing information.

Appositive phrases were used least frequently among the three groups of writers, and a significant difference was found $( p =$ 0.0004), with textbook texts, for example, containing 3 times as many appositive phrases as written texts of STEM students u (2017) put forward a sequence of development of syntacticomplexity in which the use of appositive phrases is one of the top targets. Xu (2017) explained that although such structures are not structurally sophisticated, they reflect the complexit of thoughts in that they make the head noun more specific by adding extra descriptive information.

Non-finite adjective phrases are also called reduced sentences, which in previous studies (e.g., u, 2017) were often regarded as an indicator of higher English language proficiency. Biber and Gray (2010) also argued that non-finite adjective phrases used in academic writing are around 4 times more than that in conversations. Besides, non-finite adjective phrases, also named \*participles' in other syntactic complexity studies, were claimed to appear significantly more in higher-rated/level essays (Ansarifar et a., 2018; Casal & Lee, 2019). However, no significant difference in this grammatical device was found across groups in the present study. Non-finite adjective phrases can be derived from finite attrbutive clauses, but by contrast, appear more concise. Excerpt 5 and Excerpt 6 shown below can demonstrate the difference.

Excerpt 5 (text. 534 in EM group)

In addition to is educational characteristic, a gap year is also an essential period guding students to have a better understanding of their future career and get full prepared. By working in the gap year, students graduating from high schools are able to experience in advance what the job related to their preferred major is like. Current information of market and job trend can also be available so that they can have a blueprint of their future career about is primary work and specific qualifications needed to get the job. After figuring out whether it s the desirable job that really suits them, they can make comprehensive plans based on the experience derived from the gap year to guide them through college years.

# 5. Conclusions

This paper studies the use of diffrent types of phrasal elaboration demonstrated in Chinese college students' argumentative writing, and investigates how phrasal complexity varies acros Chinese EFL tertiary learners majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and English (EM) by using a framework of indices of phrasal elaboration that take into account different syntactic functions of phrases. Allstudent-produced datais compared with that in EFL textbook sample esays (TB) composed by expert writers. For the various grammatical forms analyzed that serve diffrent syntactic functions, noun phrases functioning as subjects/objects, prepositional phrases (as opposed to toinfinitives that functioned significantly les frequently as adverbials) prepositional phrases as noun post-modifiers and their multiple embedding, multiple atributive embedding as pre-modifiers, and appositive phrases were found to be significantly more common in argumentative writing collcted from textbooks or produced by proficient English majors as compared with written production of STEM students.

The present study is not without limitations. irst, the research findings were derived based on the analysis of a relatively smal set of data. Increasing the size of the corpus to include more writing samples is recommended, though i is more labor-intensive since many phrasal complexity indices involved in this study may be hard to extract by automated analyzers. Also, we did not restrict argu. mentative topics and the proficiency difference between groups was assumed based on their program characterisic. In addition, the analytical framework in this study, which is designed based on different syntactic functions of phrasal elaboration, can be further buttressed with more research findings shedding light on phrasal complexity development, and we welcome more future empirical studies on phrasal complexity from dimensions of grammatical forms and syntactic functions.

This study provides significant pedagogical implications since the derived research findings of the use of phrases, which is distinctive in academic registers (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016), are linguisticall interpretable for not only EAP researchers and teachers but also EAP learners. EAP teachers at college level, who are aware of the potential phrasal complexity development, may have a clearer and more targeted teaching goal and approach to instructing students how to improve their academic writing at phrase level, and correspondingly devise courses and teaching materials that help students gain clearer understandings of phrases in academic registers varying in syntactic complexity. The grammatical forms that were found in this study to significantly distinguish groups and contribute to the styl of structural compression, for instance, preositional phrases functioning as adverbials and noun post-modifiers multiple prepositional and attributive embedding, and appositive phrases, are particularly worthy of attention. Further research may be of great practical signficance if i wereto investigate thefects of edagogical methods involving tageted instruction of complex phrasal stuctures on L2 writing quality and competence. EAP learners, ater seeing their gap in their use of sophisticated language in writing, especiall in the use f phrases wth different degree of complexity, may develop reister awareness when peforming writing tasks and consciously produce written texts that are syntacticlly appropriate for the target register. Their cognitive proces of lin guistic intake of phrasal structures of different syntactic functions, as wellas their motivation and preference for selecting different grammatical devices to elaborate phrases may need further investigating to provide more insightul interpretation of the development of syntactic complexity.
