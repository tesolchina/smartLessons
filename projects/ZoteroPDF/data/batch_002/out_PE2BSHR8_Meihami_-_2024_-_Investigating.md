# ABSTRACT

Research in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has turned into a critical way of addressing the interrelationships between L2 pedagogy and technology. This autobiographical narrative inquiry aimed to investigate CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research (Colpaert, 2020). To that end, the autobiographical narratives of 24 CALL researchers were collected and analyzed using a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. The findings indicated that the researchers addressed the research needs of the CALL community of practice by focusing on contexts and conditions, CALL research streams, future directions, and creating academic knowledge. Moreover, the researchers addressed their CALL research identification through addressing local, global, and real-world audiences for authentic communication topics. Furthermore, to show their competence in their CALL studies, they attempted to review CALL literature comprehensively, cite papers from experienced CALL researchers, use comprehensive research designs, and publish/present CALL research in academic journals/conferences. Additionally, the findings showed that they tried to build relatedness in their studies by citing academic articles and books, using methodologies implemented by experienced CALL researchers, and having research collaboration locally and globally. Finally, CALL researchers attempted to become autonomous in selecting research methods, academic writing styles, and addressing CALL materials and applications in CALL research to show their autonomy in their CALL research. Therefore, it can be concluded that the role of the CALL community of practice is rather critical in leading the types and qualities of the strategies used by CALL researchers.

# Introduction

After some forty years of research in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has been published and presented in various journals and conferences, it is time to have a retrospective analysis of CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research. The topic gets its legitimacy from the seminal position paper by Colpaert (2020), in which he addressed a series of important issues concerning genuine CALL research. There is no one-size-fits-all definition for the term genuine since different communities of practice can describe and define the term genuine differently. However, genuine CALL research can be defined as the characteristic of those investigations accepted by the CALL community of practice, as invaluable contributions that can problematize CALL issues. Understanding CALL researchers’ strategies to make their research studies genuine is critical now that the technological innovations are fast-paced, leading to many research investigations in CALL. Therefore, the current paper attempted to investigate the CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research. However, it is crucial to mention that by genuine research, the researcher does not mean that some CALL studies are genuine and the others are fake. On the contrary, it is believed that all CALL studies are genuine yet with different degrees of genuineness. To put it another way, there is a continuum for genuineness in which CALL research can have different positions. Conceptually, this continuum of genuineness is created by putting together some indicators, recently proposed by Colpaert (2020): ‘[N]eed, identification, competence, relatedness and autonomy’ (p. 658). Investigating CALL researchers’ strategies to reach these indicators is critical to understand how the CALL community of practice addresses genuine research. These indicators are discussed later in this paper.

What is genuine is a philosophical question, which can have distinctive interpretations in different fields. In the dictionary of Meriam-Webster, it is stated that a genuine thing is ‘actually having the reputed or apparent qualities or characters’. From one perspective, therefore, something which has ‘the reputed or apparent qualities or characters’ accepted by the majority of a specific community can be a genuine thing. However, this is critical to address who/what/and how to determine the genuineness concerning different issues. Here, the community of practice (Wenger, 1998) theory can explain the phenomenon. A community of practice is established by individuals engaging in the process of collective learning regarding different practices. In another word, a group of people who share a particular concern and work around that concern can be called a community of practice. In a similar vein, the CALL community of practice has many concerns, including CALL research. Therefore, the

CALL community of practice has its domain and identity, which direct its practices.

The CALL community of practice members are researchers and instructors conducting CALL research and integrating CALL in their L2 teaching/learning. Accordingly, ‘who’ determines ‘what’ and ‘how’ qualities and characters of genuine CALL research can be answered through the CALL community of practice. The CALL researchers who are members of the CALL community of practice can define characters of genuine CALL research to determine such CALL investigations. Practically, it can be achieved implicitly and explicitly. On the one hand, the research movements, including the preferred CALL topics, research methodologies, writing styles, ways of conducting CALL studies, etc., occurring in different CALL communities of practice, such as CALL journals or CALL conferences, can implicitly direct the research practices of CALL researchers. Therefore, CALL researchers monitor the signals sent out by the CALL community of practice, and when they figure out that some CALL topics, research methodologies, writing styles, ways of conducting CALL studies are preferable compared with others, they find a tendency toward doing their research in accordance with such CALL signals. They tend to do so since they may believe that the characteristics of the research movements determine the characteristics of genuine CALL research. On the other hand, research studies examining the scientometrics features of CALL research, such as citation practices, topic and research methodology orientations, etc. (e.g. Goksu et  al., 2020; Lim & Aryadoust, 2021), define the CALL research directions explicitly, which, in turn, help to understand the characteristics of genuine CALL research.

Therefore, CALL researchers who engage in and align with the characters proposed and practiced by the CALL community of practice can produce genuine CALL research. As stated earlier, recently, five characters of genuine CALL research have been proposed by Colpaert (2020). He states that he reaches these indicators ‘[B]ased on literature, publication policies, feedback and advice from associate editors, reviewers and editorial board members, and [his] personal experience as editor of [CALL] journal’ (Colpaert, 2020, p. 658).

Although some studies (e.g. Burston, 2015; Chapelle & Voss, 2016; Gillespie, 2020; Lim & Aryadoust, 2021) have been conducted to analyze CALL topics during different time intervals, comparable work on CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research has been lacking. On the one hand, these invaluable studies cannot help us figure out the fundamental needs which drive CALL researchers to conduct a CALL investigation. On the other hand, understanding CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research is conducive to helping us understand researchers’ identifications with the topics. In addition, this can help us to understand how CALL researchers show their competence in their CALL research. Furthermore, we can understand how CALL researchers address relatedness in their studies if we recognize their strategies to do genuine CALL research. Finally, this is important to know how CALL researchers apply their autonomy in their CALL studies. Consequently, inspired by Colpaert’s (2020) editorial position paper, the current study investigated the CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research concerning need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy (Colpaert, 2020, p. 658).

# Background: CALL research

CALL research is believed to address central variables related to language, learners, context, technological tools, tasks/activities, and peers/ teachers (Egbert, 2006). Consequently, a comprehensive definition for CALL research would be one in which research investigations ‘take an analytic approach by looking at one or more of these variables in any number of ways or studies that look at the system of which of these variables are part, at their interactions and complexities and their effects on one another’ (Egbert, 2006, p. 5). According to Chapelle (2013), five areas of research should receive the central attention in CALL: (1) learners’ meaning construction while engaging in CALL, (2) the way learners develop specific linguistic features while engaging in CALL, (3) how learners develop their intercultural competence while engaging in CALL, (4) the practicality of the materials examined in different CALL research by materials developers, and (5) the investigation of learners and teachers’ experiences in CALL. Moreover, CALL research challenges have also been touched upon in the CALL community of practice. An editorial by Levy, Hubbard, Stockwell, and Colpaert (2015) mentioned that CALL research challenges had been addressed in many research studies (see Hubbard, 2003; Schulze & Smith, 2013; Stockwell, 2012). Hubbard (2003) stated that by increasing the number of graduate students who are new to CALL and see CALL alluring to their professional development, ‘there is value in assisting these newcomers in making sense of the field and understanding what experienced members of the CALL community consider important questions to answer’ (p. 142). Furthermore, researchers have attempted to conduct many CALL studies to broaden the CALL community’s understanding of the missing topics in CALL (e.g. Hubbard, 2005; Lim & Aryadoust, 2021; Zhao, 2003).

The effectiveness of CALL research has been focused on across different investigations. For instance, Felix (2005) examined CALL effectiveness research in which the strengths and weaknesses of the CALL research studies during 2000 and 2004 in terms of research design were investigated. Felix (2005) stated that there was a positive trend concerning combining quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Additionally, CALL affordance has been the subject of many discussions (e.g. Blin, 2016; Dey-Plissonneau & Blin, 2016; Nicolaou, 2020). The focus of such research studies has largely been the language learning and teaching affordances that CALL provides.

# A frame of mind for genuine CALL research: a community of practice perspective

In his editorial position paper, Colpaert (2020) introduced five indicators of genuine research, including need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy. It is crucial to mention that the CALL journals (e.g. CALL journal, Language Learning and Technology, CALICO, ReCALL, Teaching English with Technology, JALT CALL, CALL-EJ), published by different publishers across the globe, are the main contexts for representing CALL research. Colpaert (2020) stated that he obtained these indicators by drawing on the ‘literature, publication policies, feedback and advice from associate editors, reviewers and editorial board members, and [his] personal experience as editor of [CALL] journal’ (p. 658).

The first indicator proposed for genuine CALL research by Colpaert (2020) is ‘need’. There may be various needs pushing CALL researchers to conduct CALL research, such as publish or perish (Colpaert, 2012), addressing a pedagogical problem, or researchers’ internal interest. The pivotal question is which strategies are used by CALL researchers to address the CALL community needs. The CALL community of practice has an influential role in exposing the needs. Therefore, the needs are perceived and acknowledged by the CALL community members, including teachers, learners, educational stakeholders, etc., and then these needs become the main topics for the CALL researchers. Accordingly, a direct interrelationship can be imagined between what the CALL community of practice perceives as needs, including educational needs, and what CALL researchers investigate.

The second indicator of genuine CALL research, proposed by Colpaert (2020), is identification. Colpaert (2020, p. 659) differentiated between identification of and with, in which identification with ‘stands for the extent to which you feel connected with a topic or subject: you have a personal reason, you develop a certain interest or even passion’. Thus, identification with CALL research can show what motivations drive CALL researchers to conduct CALL research. Furthermore, gauging CALL researchers’ identifications with CALL research helps us understand how they define the usefulness of their CALL research for the

CALL community. The more CALL researchers identify with CALL research, the more they are motivated to do comprehensive CALL research. Identification with can be discussed with regard to Wenger’s (1998) notion of engagement in which the CALL researchers’ participation in mutually negotiated activities can provide a shared repertoire for them to construct and reconstruct their research activities.

The third indicator, competence, can be defined as how CALL researchers think about their competence in doing CALL research and how they show their competence in their CALL research. Colpaert (2020) mentioned that the less competent researchers try to disguise their lack of knowledge and competence by mentioning unrelated names, defining vague concepts, and explaining basics. Moreover, CALL researchers can show their competence in CALL research by adopting and interpreting multidisciplinary theories, models, and references. However, it should not be ignored that new knowledge is built upon previous knowledge. Therefore, CALL researchers should be competent about the previous CALL knowledge. This means that CALL researchers need to constantly negotiate with the CALL community of practice to align with the necessary competencies. This is where the engagement and alignment of CALL researchers with the CALL community of practice may lead them to develop their CALL professional identity.

As the fourth indicator of genuine CALL research, relatedness is associated with how CALL researchers ‘build on CALL research in literature …, refer to CALL colleagues in other CALL-related Journals such as … ReCALL CALICO Journal, JaltCALL or System’ (Colpaert, 2020, p. 660). It is the area of respect and competence: Respect for other CALL researchers and the competence to know the related literature. CALL researchers use the CALL-related literature to create the rationale for their studies. The critical question is how CALL researchers address relatedness in their CALL research. Each community of practice has its own primary and secondary contexts for representing the relatedness. Generally, when discussing the concept of relatedness in CALL, the primary contexts of representing the relatedness are the CALL journals, such as CALL journal, CALICO, ReCALL, JALT CALL, Teaching English with Technology, etc. Moreover, the secondary contexts of representing the relatedness for CALL research will be other applied linguistics journals, such as applied linguistics, System, Language Teaching Research, and many others. The point is that the secondary contexts publish all topics related to L2 pedagogy, not just the CALL-related topics. Therefore, such journals’ relatedness for CALL topics will be lower than the primary contexts, the specific CALL journals. Consequently, the relatedness will increase when CALL researchers publish their research output in specific CALL journals. This is because the CALL community of practice, similar to other applied linguistics communities of practice, has its context of representation. The critical point is that the CALL community of practice members can negotiate with other applied linguistics communities of practice.

The fifth indicator of genuine CALL research proposed by Colpaert (2020) is autonomy. This indicator shows how CALL researchers address ‘originality and creativity’ in their research. It ranges from topic selection to methodology design. Colpaert (2020) believed that autonomy indicates the agency of the CALL researchers in the way they address literature, methodology, technology, and stakeholders (including teachers and learners). Thus, it is essential to know how CALL researchers apply their autonomy to their CALL research. To have a community of practice perspective in this regard, it can be said that ‘autonomy’ is where CALL researchers try to negotiate between self and the community. These negotiations are opportunities for the CALL researchers to practice their autonomy. Moreover, through such negotiations, the CALL researchers can influence and be influenced by the CALL community of practice.

It can be seen that the five indicators proposed by Colpaert (2020) can be addressed through a community of practice perspective. The following research question has been posed to be addressed in this study:

What are the strategies that CALL researchers use to conduct genuine CALL research?

# Methodology

# Research design

This study was an autobiographical narrative inquiry to address the phenomenon of genuine CALL research among CALL researchers. As Czarniawska (2004, p. 17) stated, ‘narrative is understood as a spoken or written text giving an account of an event/action or series of events/ actions, chronologically connected’. Thus, since CALL research can be considered an action, it would be possible to delve into CALL researchers’ strategies to do genuine CALL research through narrative inquiry. Furthermore, as a way to understand individuals’ experiences (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000), narrative inquiry can be a valuable method to this aim. Two reasons should be mentioned why the researcher used narrative inquiry as a design to address the research question. First, since the study sought to show how CALL researchers involve in the phenomenon of genuine CALL research, the narrative inquiry could help the researcher delve into this phenomenon. Second, the narrative inquiry could help the researcher obtain CALL researchers’ experiences concerning their strategies to conduct genuine CALL research. Figure 1 indicates different steps of the research design in the current study adapted from Creswell and Poth (2018).

Figure 1. T he research design (adapted from Creswell and Poth, 2018).

As shown in Figure 1, first, the researcher determined whether using narrative inquiry could be appropriate to conduct this study. Since the purpose of the study was to delve into the phenomenon of CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research, the narrative inquiry could be an appropriate method to address the topic. Then, the researcher selected some participants who had the experience of doing CALL research and participating in the CALL community. The participants were CALL researchers who had ‘field text’ (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000), meaning they had special CALL research experiences. Next, the researcher had to select among different types of narratives that the CALL researchers could produce. The researcher selected autobiographical narratives from different types of narrative, including biographical, autobiographical, interactional, historical, autoethnography, to address the purpose of this study. The reason behind selecting autobiographical narrative to be used in this study was that the researcher wanted to focus on the genuine CALL research from the accounts of the CALL researchers; thus, autobiography could be an appropriate narrative type (Creswell & Poth, 2018). The researcher had to select a proper narrative analysis method to analyze the autobiographical narratives in the next stage. In this study, a deductive-inductive thematic analysis of the narratives was used to obtain CALL researchers’ strategies. A deductive-inductive thematic analysis is an approach to qualitative data analysis in which the researchers can simultaneously use predetermined analytical frameworks deductively, and delve into the data inductively to analyze the data to address the research questions.

# Participants: the CALL researchers

The participants of this study were 24 CALL researchers who were involved in doing CALL research in different countries, including Iran (9 researchers), Poland (4 researchers), the United Kingdom (3 researchers), the United States (3 researchers), and China (5 researchers). In recruiting those CALL researchers, the researcher used purposive sampling by setting some criteria. Therefore, the researcher asked 60 researchers across different countries to provide their narratives about the strategies to conduct genuine CALL research. Although the researcher sent his inquiry to 60 CALL researchers who had the required criteria, only 24 of them provided their narratives. The researcher set the following criteria to select the CALL researchers (Table 1).

The CALL researchers who participated in the present study had at least five years of research experience in CALL, published at least five CALL research studies, and published at least a paper in the leading journals of CALL (listed as the third criteria). For instance, Researcher 15, with ten years of researching in CALL, had 12 CALL research studies, including ten papers and two book chapters. Three of her papers were published in CALL journal, and two of them were published in CALICO. Therefore, she met the criteria: more than five years of researching in CALL, more than five CALL research outputs, and publication in the leading CALL journals. Information regarding CALL researchers’ publications was obtained from their academic accounts, such as their university profiles, Google Scholars, Researchgate, etc. By the way, if the researcher needed further information, he asked the CALL researchers. Table 2 indicates background information about the 24 participants of this study.

It is essential to mention that the researcher did not need to seek permission from any institutes to run the current study. Nevertheless, to secure the participants’ safety, privacy, and confidentiality, the researcher explained the purpose of the study when asking them to produce their narratives.

# Data source: the CALL researchers’ autobiographical narratives

The main data source in the current study was autobiographical narratives produced by CALL researchers. By asking CALL researchers to produce autobiographical narratives, they needed to use their autobiographical memory (Smorti, 2011) about their CALL research experiences, practices, and beliefs. Consequently, to help the CALL researchers direct their memory about their CALL research, the researcher provided them with some questions to think about before producing their narratives. These questions were based on the five indicators of genuine CALL research proposed by Colpaert (2020): Need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy. The researcher directed the autobiographical memory of the CALL researchers to produce autobiographical narratives concerning genuine CALL research. Therefore, the researcher could obtain the strategies used by CALL researchers to do genuine CALL research. To compose the questions, the researcher reviewed the five indicators comprehensively proposed by Colpaert (2020). Table 3 shows the questions and their correspondence indicators.

The questions helped the participants concentrate on the autobiographical memories related to the purpose of the study, the genuine CALL research, and then externalize them in autobiographical narratives. The participants were told that they could produce their narratives in oral or written format. They were also asked to produce their narratives in English. In terms of narrative length, it is worth mentioning that the shortest narrative was with 574 words (Researcher 14), and the lengthiest one was with 1150 words (Researcher 5).

# Data analysis: a deductive-inductive thematic analysis

Thematic analysis is a qualitative data analysis method that concentrates on participants’ content of experiences and participants’ reflections on their experiences to obtain specific themes in the qualitative data (Barkhuizen, 2015). Consequently, it ‘can be a method that works both to reflect reality and to unpick or unravel the surface of reality’ (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 81). There are various approaches to identify thematic analysis, including inductive and deductive (theoretical) thematic analysis. While the former approach tries to identify the themes through linking to the data themselves, the latter would tend to be driven by the researcher’s theoretical or analytic interests in the area and is thus ‘more explicitly analyst driven’ (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 84). Moreover, there are two approaches to theme identifications concerning the level of identification: semantic and latent. The semantic approach helps the researchers identify the themes based on predetermined codes, whereas the latent approach involves interpretive works from the part of the researchers. In the current study, the researcher used a deductive-inductive thematic analysis—a combination of deductive and inductive thematic analysis—to analyze the autobiographical narratives produced by CALL researchers. Hence, the researcher used Colpaert’s (2020) five indicators of genuine CALL research, including need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy, to deductively and semantically find the related content in the narratives about the indicators. Then, he inductively and latently examined the narratives to delve into CALL researchers’ strategies. The researcher used a deductive-inductive thematic analysis to find a more comprehensive viewpoint concerning the CALL researchers’ autobiographical narratives. In the present study, the researcher used phases of thematic analysis proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006) to analyze the narratives (Figure 2).

It is crucial to note that the analysis through these phases was done recursively, meaning that the researcher moved back and forth to obtain comprehensive findings. Concerning the first phase, familiarizing with the data, the researcher put the CALL researchers’ narratives in MAXQDA 20, a qualitative data analysis software. Moreover, in this phase, through reading and rereading the narratives, the researcher immersed himself in the data to find the parts of the narratives which indicated or implied the five indicators. In the second phase, the researcher examined the narratives for the ideas related to the five indicators that enabled the researcher to produce the initial codes. The researcher identified the initial codes through both semantic and latent approaches. In the second phase, the researcher created as many codes as possible for the potential themes (Braun & Clarke, 2006). After the narratives were initially coded and collated in the third phase, the researcher classified the codes into identified themes. To do so, the researcher went through three strategies. First, he used Creative Coding of MAXQDA 20, enabling the researcher to create parent codes and then produce the potential themes. Second, the researcher merged the codes which could be associated together based on the literature. Third, the researcher communicated with the participants to see whether the identified themes were acceptable and could explain their narratives. These three strategies, altogether, helped the researcher identify the themes. In the fourth phase, the researcher reviewed all the identified themes. The researcher used Smart Coding Tools of MAXQDA 20 to get a comprehensive overview of the obtained themes and their associations with the entire data. By doing so, the researcher examined whether the themes cohere together meaningfully, considering the entire data. Some modifications, deletions, and combinations happened among the identified themes, and final themes were obtained in this phase. In the fifth phase, the researcher tried to name the themes to be illustrative. He used the related literature, related metaphors, and interesting ideas in the narratives produced by CALL researchers. Finally, in the sixth phase, the researcher provided a report on the findings of the study.

Figure 2. P hases of thematic analysis used in the current study (adopted from Braun and Clarke, 2006, p. 87).

Moreover, the rigor of the study was considered in the current study. Therefore, the credibility, transferability, and dependability of the findings were addressed to enhance the rigor of the study (Ary et  al., 2014). The credibility of the findings was addressed through member checking. Thus, the researcher asked some of the participants to see whether the obtained themes were in line with what they wanted to assert in their narratives. Moreover, through peer debriefing, the researcher asked a colleague to go through some parts of the narratives to see whether she could reach the same themes. The researcher addressed the transferability of the findings by including a cross-case comparison. As stated earlier, the participants were CALL researchers from different countries. Moreover, the researcher tried to remove the selection effect (Ary et  al.,

2014) to enhance the transferability of the findings to a specific group. To do so, the researcher set the criteria to select those who conducted CALL research and affiliated with CALL researchers. Finally, the researcher addressed the dependability of findings by asking his colleague to go through parts of the data to conduct a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. This is an inter-coder agreement. The inter-coder agreement between the two coders was satisfying, around $8 0 \%$ , which could be due to comprehensive discussions on the deductive-inductive thematic analysis between the researcher and the second coder.

# Findings

The analysis of the narratives indicated intriguing information about how CALL researchers address the need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy in their CALL studies. In the following paragraphs, the researcher reports how CALL researchers addressed each indicator of genuine CALL research, providing some parts of the narratives to show each indicator. Figure 3 indicates the main themes and subthemes for each indicator of genuine CALL research.

# Need: ‘needs are the sources of knowledge’

The autobiographical narrative analyses showed four primary needs based on which the CALL researchers chose their topics. These four main needs are contexts and conditions, CALL research streams, future directions, and creating academic knowledge. The findings indicated that contexts and conditions were the sources of conducting CALL research. For example, Researcher 3 stated, ‘the new educational conditions may ask for new educational technologies which can be the primary need to conduct a CALL study’. Researcher 5 narrated, ‘…as a CALL researcher; I try to understand the applicability of CALL in new contexts, such as in a collective society’. It seems that by addressing the applicability of CALL in new contexts and conditions, CALL researchers tend to address one of the CALL community’s needs. Researcher 20 mentioned, ‘… the fast changes in technology asks for research about its applicability in new situations … [therefore] CALL researchers need to address new situations and contexts in their CALL research …

Moreover, the CALL researchers declared that they address the needs of the CALL community based on the CALL research streams, meaning that the directions of recent research in CALL. This seems, however, to have a positive and negative side. As narrated by Researcher 7, ‘… the recent publications in CALL journals show the needs of CALL community’ which they can ‘select a necessary and uninvestigated topic to be in line with the stream’ (Researcher 7). Furthermore, CALL journals can help CALL researchers identify the ‘hidden topics of the editorial board’s interests’ (Researcher 9), pushing CALL researchers to pursue these topical needs. Accordingly, addressing CALL research streams can be of two sides, as narrated by Researcher 1 in which ‘… some [CALL researchers] follow the topics in CALL journals to find a new topic for publication

. this is not the need of the CALL community … some others to find the limitations of the previously conducted studies; this is where the CALL community’s needs lie …’.

The analyses of the narratives produced by CALL researchers indicated that addressing future directions is among the needs of CALL community. The future directions, as asserted by Researcher 15, ‘…can lead us to do studies which are the needs of CALL community to prepare for unpredicted conditions such as COVID-19’. Here, the key research studies conducted by CALL key researchers can ‘be good sources of CALL … [to provide] directions about necessary CALL topics’. Consequently, it can be understood from the narratives produced by CALL researchers that the research studies conducted by key CALL researchers have the potentiality to create a venue for conducting new research in CALL. For example, Researcher 24 mentioned this issue in his narrative in which he stated, ‘…I have always followed the research studies by well-known CALL researchers to find some ideas for research … I believe that the topics addressed by famous CALL researchers are the needs of CALL community …’.

Finally, one intriguing theme obtained through the analyses of the narratives produced by CALL researchers was creating academic knowledge. Researcher 14 narrated that ‘…CALL research studies are the venue for creating new knowledge for CALL practices’. He believed that ‘the critical need of CALL community is CALL research that leads to new CALL knowledge’. Moreover, ‘creating academic knowledge can help CALL community to change their CALL practices and become professionals’ (Researcher 6). Consequently, it can be stated that CALL researchers think that they are responsible for addressing the needs leading to academic knowledge. This can be understood through part of a narrative produced by Researcher 22 in which she stated, ‘… we need to focus not only on the CALL research related to different affordances of CALL but to create new knowledge to be used in academic contexts ….’. All in all, the impact of the CALL community of practice on affecting the ways CALL researchers address the CALL needs is observable in these extracts in that CALL researchers try to engage in and align with the needs negotiated in the CALL community.

# Identification: ‘in search of global topics’

The second indicator of genuine CALL research addressed in this study was identification. According to Colpaert (2020), it is related to the source of motivation for conducting CALL research. The analyses of the narratives produced by CALL researchers showed three main themes concerning their CALL research identification: addressing local, global, and real-world audiences for authentic communication topics. CALL researchers identified their CALL research with ‘the educational puzzles in L2 classes’, which led them to ‘reflect upon L2 teaching and learning problems to select a CALL research topic’ (Researcher 17). Hence, local topics originating from one’s classroom problems may lead to doing CALL studies to solve the problems with the affordance of CALL. Researcher 13 indicated how he believed reflection on local language teaching and learning could be the topic of CALL research. He stated, ‘… I have addressed my students’ L2 learning problems by conducting action research about CALL … the results have fascinated me in removing the problems and helping me publish papers …’.

Moreover, addressing global topics focusing on the gaps in CALL literature was another identification for doing genuine CALL research. It is shown that ‘the gaps in the studies conducted by the scholars around the world can be good motivation for new CALL studies’ (Researcher 9). Furthermore, ‘the studies done by researchers globally are mind-provoking to conduct new CALL research’ (Researcher 6). In addition, topics related to the real-world audience for authentic communication ‘can be motivation for doing new CALL research’ since ‘the relatively recent massive growth in Web 2.0 applications and social media provide further opportunities’ (Researcher 14) for addressing such topics. Therefore, it can be stated that CALL researchers believed that genuine CALL research should identify with new technology types to be the most effective. Researcher 16 mentioned this point in his narrative in that he asserted, ‘… the new technologies need to be considered in CALL research to make them valuable … this can help use CALL research results for authentic communication, which is the need for L2 contexts…’. The CALL researchers also prefer topics that are the local needs with global identifications, say global topics. Researcher 11 mentioned in her narrative that ‘…CALL research needs to solve local problems first, and simultaneously has global effects on the CALL community’. Consequently, it can be said that one way to address identification in CALL research is to investigate global topics which can have benefits for the CALL micro-community of practice (local context) and CALL macro-community of practice (global context). However, the critical point is that there is a very blurred boundary between needs and identifications. It can be said that the two indicators have different interdependences with one another. The three themes, thus, were obtained by asking for clarifications on the part of some participants to distinguish between identification and need.

# Competence: ‘research design, the manifest of competence’

The findings obtained from the analyses of the narratives produced by the CALL researchers indicated five themes to show their competence in their CALL studies: Reviewing CALL literature comprehensively, citing papers from well-known CALL researchers, using comprehensive research designs, and publishing/presenting CALL research in academic journals/ conferences. Researcher 19 believed that ‘a comprehensive understanding of the related literature about the topic’ can help them develop their competence. Moreover, CALL researchers believed that reviewing CALL literature comprehensively ‘helps to establish an appropriate methodology for CALL research’ (Researcher 5), which in its turn develops CALL researchers’ competence in doing CALL research. Reviewing CALL research comprehensively may lead to critical conceptualization, which can be seen as the illustration of CALL researchers’ competence. Researcher 17 mentioned this issue in his narrative in which he mentioned, ‘…using different approaches to develop a critical literature review helps me show pivotal relationships, differences, and effects of CALL concepts …’. Because of the complex nature of new conceptualizations in CALL, researchers who can provide acceptable new conceptualizations of the CALL notions can be known as competent CALL researchers.

The analyses of the narratives produced by CALL researchers showed that citing CALL research done by CALL key scholars has been one way that CALL researchers try to show their competence through it. Researcher 4 asserted that ‘it [competence] can be addressed through reminding others of famous figures of CALL community’ since ‘it [citing CALL research done by CALL key scholars] can show that our CALL research is in line with what scholars of CALL think and do’. According to CALL researchers, this strategy may lead to ‘acceptance of the research papers by different CALL journals’ (Researcher 23). They also believed that using a comprehensive research design can show the CALL community that they are competent to do CALL research. CALL researchers declared that ‘research designs and the ways CALL researchers collect and analyze data are important factors to show CALL researchers’ competence’ (Researcher 18). Moreover, Researcher 16 believed that ‘a research design with a robust theoretical underpinning can lead to an academic CALL research … [research design] shows the competence of the researcher’. The research design was mentioned as a pivotal issue for some participants. They asserted that using new methodologies with new procedures has been facilitative to join the professional and competent CALL researchers’ community. Tapping upon this issue, Researcher 3 asserted ‘…[I] use some new data analysis techniques such as SEM [Structural Equation Modeling] to analysis data … to reach comprehensive results which can show my research studies are useful for CALL community … [it] removes probably the committing errors …’

One more theme obtained from the CALL researchers’ narratives concerning competence was publishing/presenting CALL research in academic journals/conferences. Researcher 21 believed that ‘publishing in prestigious CALL-related journals can show [their] competence to the CALL community’ since he assumed ‘CALL journals as the academic context to exchange CALL-related ideas at the highest academic level’. Moreover, some CALL researchers considered ‘…presenting CALL topics in CALL or other applied linguistics conferences as a way to show [they are] able to conduct CALL research’ (Researcher 12). Furthermore, they asserted that ‘by presenting [their] papers in CALL conferences, [they] can debate on [their] topics which can be a manifest of [their] competence’ (Researcher 20). Researcher 1 stated how publishing a paper in a CALL journal can represent CALL researchers’ competence in doing CALL research. He mentioned, ‘… to show I am competent CALL researcher and join CALL community, I have done my best to publish in CALL journal, but I came with several rejections … finally, I made it [publishing a paper in CALL journal] …’.

# Relatedness: ‘collaboration with CALL academics’

Three central themes were obtained from the narratives authored by CALL researchers concerning relatedness: Citing academic articles and books, using methodologies implemented by well-known CALL researchers, and collaborating with CALL researchers. CALL researchers asserted that they ‘should cite the current CALL research in their papers to help them join to CALL community’ (Researcher 22). They also believed that ‘the citation sources should be relevant to academic sources’ in which ‘academic sources are the one accepted by the CALL community … [to] create the relationships between [our] papers and the CALL context’ (Researcher 9). The CALL researchers seemed to be so eager to use research published in the specific CALL journals. They believed that such citation practices could establish a high relatedness. Moreover, they believed such citation practices as a way to enhance the chance of publication. For example, researcher 5 pointed out, ‘…it is without saying that I have tried and am still trying to cite papers published in the world-leading CALL journals such as CALICO, CALL, and Language Learning and Technology to establish a firm relationship between my CALL studies and that of the CALL community … [which] can enhance the chance of publication…’. Therefore, it can be assumed that the CALL community of practice members try to use the CALL publications accepted by a larger number of community members. This can be referred to as what is acceptable by the CALL community of practice. Thus, when CALL researchers cite a paper from a leading CALL journal whose editorial board members and reviewers have accepted that paper, they can align with what is acceptable by the CALL community of practice.

Moreover, the CALL researchers narrated that they use research methodologies of CALL key studies and researchers as a strategy to address relatedness. They asserted that ‘…through using or replicating a research design which an experienced CALL researcher has used, the relationship can be met … [to] develop the robustness of the CALL studies’ (Researcher 7). One intriguing point concerning this theme was that the CALL researchers had associated ‘robustness’ of their research with using methodologies implemented by experienced CALL researchers, as far as these methodologies could address their research quests. This way, they thought they could develop their papers’ relationship with the ‘highly accepted CALL research studies’. For example, Researcher 18 asserted that ‘…through using the method section utilized by experienced CALL researchers, I try first to enhance the rigor of my study and second to relate my papers to those published by experienced CALL researchers’. This is another representation of CALL researchers’ attempt to be in line with the CALL community of practice requirements, since it is believed that the community has a positive attitude toward the research done by experienced CALL researchers. One proof for such a claim can be the higher number of citations given to those research studies.

Furthermore, CALL researchers recited that they addressed relatedness by considering CALL research collaboration. They believed that ‘research collaboration in the field of CALL can be conducive to create a CALL network …[thus] it is helpful to use other CALL knowledge’ (Researcher 14). Moreover, CALL research collaboration ‘if done locally can help CALL researchers of the same context to acknowledge their co-researchers’ opinions’ (Researcher 6). Additionally, CALL researchers believed that global CALL research collaboration ‘is very important to create new CALL knowledge for the CALL community’ (Researcher 18). Researcher 15 mentioned that CALL research collaboration could enhance relatedness by acknowledging the knowledge of others. She stated, ‘…research collaboration can open up a context in which CALL researchers share their knowledge to address CALL research with critical lenses …’. This reminds us of negotiation among the CALL community of practice. According to the findings, such negotiations regarding local and global research collaboration can help the CALL researchers become members of the CALL community of practice.

# Autonomy: ‘the more autonomous, the more creative’

Finally, the CALL researchers’ narratives were analyzed to identify how they showed their autonomy in their CALL research. Three main themes have been obtained: Being autonomous in selecting research methods, choosing academic writing styles, and addressing CALL materials and applications. Researcher 12 stated that ‘by selecting among the related methodologies [they] show that [they are] autonomous CALL researchers’. Some CALL researchers asserted that ‘while using the research methodologies and designs of experienced CALL researchers are important, [they] try to select the final research design by combining the methodologies and designs [by themselves] …’ (Researcher 5). Researcher 20 stated how he tried to become autonomous in selecting a research method to show his autonomy in doing his CALL research ‘…I do my best to study what has been implemented as the research methodologies of CALL community to be able to decide how to use them in my own study …’. From a community of practice perspective, these findings indicate how CALL researchers are affected by the community (by using research methodologies introduced by the CALL community) and simultaneously try to affect it (by introducing their own methodologies).

CALL researchers also believed that ‘CALL research can be composed without a specific writing style to help the researchers put their effort and energy on the research rather than the writing style’ (Researcher 17). This way, some CALL researchers asserted that ‘by having [their] own writing style, [they] can show their autonomy and build an identity for ourselves’ (Researcher 13). This point is mentioned in a narrative in which a CALL researcher stated, ‘writing CALL studies can be the researchers’ signs; through many CALL research studies, you have many signs to show your autonomy to the CALL community’ (Researcher 22). Thus, once again, it can be seen that CALL researchers want to have their effects on the community, this time through their specific writing style.

Furthermore, the CALL researchers tried to show their autonomy in their CALL studies by using and implementing CALL materials and applications in new contexts and with new perspectives. It is indicated that ‘by addressing CALL materials in new research contexts’ (Researcher 7), CALL researchers try to show their autonomy to the CALL community. Moreover, CALL researchers believed that ‘[addressing] CALL applications which are used for a specific research purpose by the CALL community in a novel way is evidence of autonomy in CALL research’ (Researcher 11). This is where they want to experience autonomy with creativity to conduct their CALL research. As Researcher 4 stated, ‘…autonomy can lead to creativity in the studies’, which in its place ‘can bring novelty to the study’.

# Discussion

The present study investigated the strategies used by CALL researchers to conduct genuine CALL research. The findings indicated that CALL researchers addressed the CALL community research needs by focusing on contexts and conditions, CALL research streams, future directions, and creating academic knowledge. Moreover, it was revealed that CALL researchers addressed their CALL research identification through addressing local, global, and real-world audiences for authentic communication topics. Furthermore, to show their competence in their CALL studies, they addressed reviewing CALL literature comprehensively, citing papers from experienced CALL researchers, using comprehensive research designs, and publishing/presenting CALL research in academic journals/ conferences. Additionally, the findings showed that they tried to build relatedness in their studies by citing academic articles and books, using methodologies implemented by experienced CALL researchers, and having research collaboration locally and globally. Finally, CALL researchers attempted to become autonomous in selecting research methods, academic writing styles, and addressing CALL materials and applications in CALL research to show their autonomy in their CALL research.

As the findings indicated, the CALL researchers have used different strategies to make their CALL studies genuine. It seems that the CALL community has been turned into a community of practice (Wenger, 1998), in which CALL researchers learn how to join it through engagement, imagination, and alignment. Therefore, it can be pointed out that through participating in the CALL community of practice, the CALL researchers negotiate their strategies to create genuine CALL research. When the CALL scholars participate in these negotiations, the less experienced CALL researchers can learn from their strategies. Such negotiations were evident in different indicators of genuine CALL research, such as citing papers from experienced CALL researchers, using comprehensive research design, and publishing/presenting CALL research in academic journals/conferences.

The situational options (Gesuato, 2009) can be another reason for the strategies developed by the CALL researchers to produce genuine CALL research. Each community of practice can have its own specific situational options. The situational options are related to the decisions and policies made by the journals’ editorial board members (Whissell, 2013). Accordingly, some hidden publication strategies are imposed on the researchers’ community. These strategies can be the ones related to genuine CALL research imposed on the CALL community of practice by journals’ editorial board members. Therefore, the strategies mentioned by the CALL researchers to produce genuine CALL research might have roots in those situational options. One evidence for making this claim is CALL researchers’ tendency to follow the way experienced CALL researchers have addressed their CALL research. It seems that situational options imposed on the CALL community can be of positive and negative sides. The positive side is that since these situational options are imposed by editorial board members who are well-informed of the current status of CALL, this can lead the field on the right path. However, the negative side of such situational options might decrease the autonomy and creativity of the CALL researchers to address their studies.

The findings of this study also direct attention to researchers’ enthusiasm and interest (Wylie, 2018) to produce genuine CALL research. The strategies used by the CALL researchers to address the indicators of genuine CALL research showed their CALL research enthusiasm. For instance, reflections on teaching/learning problems to identify a CALL research topic; and research collaboration to address the relatedness of their CALL research showed that these strategies were directed from their research enthusiasm. Thus, it can be stated that there is a relationship between CALL researchers’ research enthusiasm and the strategies that they use to produce genuine CALL research. This relationship is critical because research enthusiasm can lead to research motivation to conduct professional research studies (Wylie, 2018). It can also be argued that the critical CALL research studies constructing the current CALL knowledge are conducted by leading CALL researchers who were internally motivated to do those studies.

Moreover, the current study’s findings also indicated that the field of CALL has reached a stable position concerning genuine CALL research. Hubbard (2003, p. 142) mentioned some ways to recognize useful CALL research questions, including ‘the common scholarly route of browsing the literature, or simply generating interesting questions from one’s practical experience with language teaching and CALL’. Moreover, Felix (2005) argued about the research design of CALL research studies. That said, the current study’s findings showed that the CALL researchers use strategies such as reviewing CALL literature comprehensively, using comprehensive research designs, using methodologies implemented by well-known CALL researchers, and being autonomous in selecting the research methods to develop genuine CALL research. Implementing such strategies shows that the previous concerns raised by CALL researchers (e.g. Felix, 2005; Hubbard, 2003) have been addressed in the current CALL studies.

The act of negotiations in doing genuine CALL research was evident to be addressed by CALL researchers. They used different strategies, such as research collaboration, following experienced CALL researchers, etc., to affect the CALL community and simultaneously to be affected by it. Participating in such negotiations is essential for CALL researchers to construct their identity in the CALL community of practice. This is where the mutual engagement of CALL researchers in a joint enterprise, the CALL research, creates a shared repertoire for them (Wenger, 1998). Such a shared repertoire helps them create a ‘knowledge-building community’ (Hoadley, 2012, p. 286), which is the main context of generating CALL knowledge. This CALL knowledge community is a dynamic one in which the members recognize the CALL research needs, identifications, competence, relatedness, and autonomy, or in one word, genuine CALL research.

# Conclusion

The current study’s findings indicated that CALL researchers addressed the genuineness of their CALL research concerning need, identification, competence, relatedness, and autonomy. Therefore, it can be concluded that the role of CALL community of practice is rather critical in leading the types and qualities of the strategies used by CALL researchers because the CALL researchers often follow the leading CALL researchers to select strategies for creating genuine CALL research. Thus, the experienced CALL researchers can lead the CALL research stream by providing what is important and what is not in CALL research and how to address the critical CALL topics concerning the methodology and design.

Semantically, the term genuine is the opposite of the term fake. However, this meaning is not the intention of Colpaert (2020), nor is it the researcher’s intention of the present study. As stated earlier in this paper, genuineness is the matter of a continuum that each CALL research can have a degree of it. However, it is critical to suggest other terms that can remove the misunderstandings caused mainly by the semantic meaning of the term genuine. The researcher believes that the term ‘academic’ can be substituted with genuine to make it more tangible. Therefore, academic CALL research can be defined based on the five indicators provided by Colpaert (2020). However, it is just a suggestion, and further research needs to be conducted to introduce more comprehensive terms.

Future researchers can conduct follow-up research with more CALL researchers to obtain a more comprehensive portrait of CALL researchers’ strategies to conduct genuine CALL research. Moreover, it was not applicable in this research to distinguish between the strategies used by experienced and novice CALL researchers to conduct genuine CALL research, which future researchers can address. Therefore, future researchers can set criteria to distinguish novice and experienced researchers, such as the quality of their publication, citation analysis, etc. Secondly, they can examine how they are similar and different in choosing the strategies to be genuine CALL researchers. Furthermore, it is essential to conduct studies to see why some CALL researchers choose some strategies to conduct genuine CALL research over others. Furthermore, it is suggested to select CALL researchers based on a strategy in which there is a correspondence between the number of participants and the studies done in their countries about CALL.
