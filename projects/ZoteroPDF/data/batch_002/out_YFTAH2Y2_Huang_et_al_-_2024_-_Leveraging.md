Researchers have acknowledged that English-medium Instruction (EMI) instructors’ professional development (PD) is crucial for promoting high-quality student learning outcomes, resulting in an increasing number of EMI PD programs worldwide across a variety of academic fields. Much research on EMI PD has focused on how to support EMI teachers rather than who can serve as teacher developers. This paper presents a glocalized EMI PD program designed collaboratively by experienced ESP teachers and EMI instructors in Taiwan’s higher education. The study focused on a cohort from the medical and healthcare faculty, revealing significant improvements in their EMI pedagogical knowledge and selfefficacy. These enhancements were evidenced by increased skills and understanding related to EMI. Additionally, it highlighted the positive outcomes of dispelling EMI misconceptions, increasing awareness of effective language use in teaching, as well as addressing the nuances of EMI pedagogy and self-efficacy. The above findings suggest that ESP teachers can be leveraged as legitimate designers of PD programs to effectively address EMI university instructors’ needs, given their expertise in ESP, disciplinary literacy, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Therefore, this study serves as a valuable reference and springboard for the future development of EMI PD programs.

# 1. Introduction

Research on English for Medical Purposes (EMP) has primarily focused on students’ linguistic and psycholinguistic needs, as illustrated in the literature (e.g., Reynolds et al., 2021; Roberts, 2020). With the increasing significance of globalization, there has been growing recognition of the requirement of interlingual communication in medical professions, emphasizing medical English as a lingua franca (Tweedie and Johnson, 2022). A comparable trend is observed in medical education within higher education institutes, where English is used as a multilingual or educational franca between instructors and students from different nations (e.g., Jenkins, 2015; Tweedie and Johnson, 2022), supported mainly through top-down government and university policies that promote English-medium instruction (EMI) due to the internationalization of higher education that encourages global mobility (e.g., Botha, 2016; Dearden, 2015; Jiang et al., 2019; Tsai and Saunders, 2017). Unlike EMP’s characteristic of a language-driven focus, EMI refers to “[t]he use of English to teach academic subjects (other than English itself) in countries and jurisdictions where the first language of the majority of the population is not English” (Macaro, 2018, p. 1). While EMI is a worldwide phenomenon, Dearden (2015) identified medicine as a field where English is less frequently used as a medium of instruction than other subjects (e.g., commerce and engineering), presumably due to the concern over a discrepancy in language use between the educational and workplace contexts.

In recent years, research has examined students’ perceptions and performance in language requirements for students in medicine and health-related fields to ensure their success in taking EMI courses and gradually attended to EMI instructors’ professional development (PD) needs. Studies have shown that students value EMI (e.g., Botha, 2016; Dearden, 2015; Tsai and Saunders, 2017) and that regardless of medical students’ English proficiency, they might perform well in EMI, even though they might not enjoy the experience (e.g., Joe and Lee, 2013). There is also a widening consensus on the supportive roles EMP has for students to acquire disciplinary knowledge in EMI courses (e.g., Dafouz, 2021, in general; Wei and Hricko, 2021, for medical schools). This line of research shows that EMI instructors often self-perceive as content teachers whose role is to enhance students’ professional competence via a foreign language rather than as English teachers to increase students’ English proficiency (e.g., Dearden, 2015; Jiang et al., 2019). As a result, EMP instructors shoulder the responsibility for addressing students’ diverse needs in EMI medical education, with cooperation or collaboration with EMI instructors (Jiang et al., 2019; Tsou et al., 2016).

Moreover, the need for teachers to have EMI PD has been recognized in medicine and health-related fields, especially in language needs. For example, Dearden (2015) notes that EMI can be challenging for instructors to translate formal medical expressions into informal ones, especially when English is not the instructors’, students’, or future patients’ first language. Examining health science in higher education, Tuomainen (2018) specifies Finnish teachers’ needs for language practice, such as pronunciation, oral English, and grammar. As a result, research has identified pragmatic strategies for accommodating this challenge, such as those discussed by Jiang et al. (2019) and Lu et al. (2017). Furthermore, Pun and Onder-Ozdemir (2023) discovered a language gap between the professional and educational contexts in the EMI course of veterinary medicine, highlighting a need for PD for EMI instructors in medicine and health-related fields. Gustafsson (2020) proposes a usage approach to address EMI instructors’ linguistic needs in medical education, which could serve as a model for future EMI PD development.

Overall, the literature on EMP has recognized the primacy of EMI PD for university instructors, the amount and scope of the related research is still limited, with more focus on what to develop in an EMI PD program rather than on who is a suitable candidate to do so. To address this issue, this paper focuses on two objectives: First, it outlines the contextual background and design of a glocalized EMI PD program developed by the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) teachers based on their collaborative experiences with EMI university faculty in Taiwan. Second, it presents the feedback provided by EMI instructor participants regarding the EMI PD program. This feedback is specifically analyzed in the context of medicine and healthcare. The central research question that guides this part of the study is as follows: “What are the responses of the EMI instructors in medicine and healthcare to the EMI PD program?” By presenting the EMI PD program developed by ESP teachers and the participating teachers’ responses, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing effort to improve the quality of EMI and leverage the expertise of ESP teachers as EMI program designers.

# 2. EMI PD and ESP

This section discusses the importance, content, and delivery of EMI PD and the role of ESP teachers in EMI PD.

The perceived importance of EMI PD in response to the internationalized landscape can be illustrated by several European initiatives, such as the British Council’s EMI Skills course, the EMI Certificate Courses for University Lecturers by Oxford EMI training, and EQUiiP (Educational Quality at Universities for Inclusive International Programmes) (2016–2019) at seven universities with Erasmus $^ +$ partnerships (e.g., Dafouz et al., 2020). EMI PD is important for university instructors, mainly because they may often lack pedagogical training (see Sánchez-Pérez, 2020). Unlike K-12 teachers, faculty in higher education as disciplinary experts shoulder responsibilities for teaching, research, and service, but are often ill-prepared for teaching, let alone EMI awareness. This lack of preparation can undermine their self-efficacy, which in this context refers to their belief in their ability to perform teaching tasks effectively when using a foreign language (Tsui, 2018). As a result, research has shown that EMI instructors are eager for more support in their professional development (Macaro et al., 2020; Macaro et al., 2018; Park et al., 2022). Nevertheless, there is a divergence in their opinions regarding whether they prefer EMI PD programs organized by the governments or international organizations (Macaro et al., 2020; Tsui, 2018).

Jiménez-Muñoz’s (2020) interviews with experienced EMI instructors revealed two important findings: a lack of necessary pedagogical support due to the misconception of prioritizing English proficiency, and the inability to directly transfer general pedagogical support to the EMI context. These findings raise concerns regarding the content components and delivery methods of EMI PD programs that effectively address instructors’ needs. Research has underscored the significance of EMI faculty’s linguistic, pedagogical, and intercultural competence. For instance, Park et al.’s (2022) study of Korean university professors reveals a preference for training English language proficiency and teaching skills, proposing a model for EMI PD that emphasizes English proficiency, EMI teaching skills, intercultural competence, reflection, and disciplinary differences. Curle and colleagues (2020) suggest EMI lecturers require pedagogical skills (e.g., a learner-centered approach to teaching, scaffolding, and the ability to collaborate with ESP or EAP teachers), communication skills (e.g., the ability to handle intercultural communication and the use of accommodation strategies), and English language skills (e.g., disciplinary English and English for classroom management). Deroey’s (2023) review of 25 articles on EMI PD indicates four essential components of the EMI PD programs, including (a) language confidence, skills, and foci (highlighting the primacy of ELF), (b) communication strategies (involving oral and multimodal techniques to increase intercultural competence), (c) pedagogy (promoting student-centered and interactive methods), and (d) EMI awareness (requiring an understanding of rationales and theories behind EMI). These findings correspond to the recommendations made by Klaassen and de Graaff (2001) two decades ago, which include effective lecturing that acknowledges non-native English-speaking students’ needs, awareness of difficulties in English acquisition, reflection on EMI beliefs and practices, and culture-related issuesda concept referred to by Lauridsen (2016) as the “Bermuda triangle” of EMI instructors’ teaching competence, highlighting “interactions of language, pedagogy, and culture” (p. 1072).

The necessity of technological competence has also received great attention in EMI PD. For instance, Tsui (2018) and Pérez Cañado (2020) incorporated flipped teaching and digital tools into training programs. Specifically, digital tools can be divided into two types based on the purpose of use: language support tools, as shown in Morell et al. (2022), and teaching support tools, as evident in Arau Ribeiro et al. (2019) (see Deroey, 2023, for a review). It is no wonder that Jiménez-Muñoz (2020) further advocates the integration of language, pedagogy, and ICT (Information and Communication Technology).

The “how” of EMI PD can be approached from two angles: designing modules and delivering them. The primacy of context-specific EMI PD through needs analysis has been highlighted in the literature (e.g., Deroey, 2023; Sánchez-Pérez, 2020). Such program design usually involves conducting surveys, interviews, and/or class observations as the initial step to identify the needs of university faculty (Deroey, 2023; Macaro et al., 2020; Macaro et al., 2018; Park et al., 2022). As stated by Deroey (2023), “needs can be identified through pre- and post-training surveys, consultations, teaching observations and peer mentoring. Familiarity with research on EMI and lecture discourse can further help ensure that content and delivery match actual language use and needs in the classroom” (p. 9).

According to Deroey’s (2023) review, most EMI PD programs are conducted face-to-face, with some using a blended method. It is reported that “online discussion forums” can “reinforce the community of practice and stimulate engagement with the materials” (p. 7). Group classes often include workshops, seminars, and guest lectures; individual support is provided through consultation or coaching after observations of classroom teaching; and most important of all, peer support takes place in discussions, such as those which could take place following microteaching observations. Deroey (2023) concludes, “A blended, modular training approach can be recommended for the flexibility it offers lecturers in choosing what and when to learn. This approach can involve various learning and support components, such as online independent learning tasks, classes, observations, coaching and peer support” (p. 10).

The wide diversity in content and delivery of EMI PD programs presented above underlines the importance of contextualization, particularly regarding discipline-specific genres or disciplinary customization. However, this diversity also presents challenges (Deroey, 2023), as evidenced by few studies tailored to specific disciplines (Gustafsson, 2020, for medicine; Pun and Onder-Ozdemir, 2023, for veterinary medicine; Tuomainen, 2018, for health), and reported difficulties in meeting different needs of the heterogeneous groups of teachers in terms of their age, EMI experiences, English proficiency, and disciplines. Nonetheless, solutions can be found in Deroey (2023), which suggests peer interaction and one-on-one support as effective methods.

However, the relationship between ESP and EMI instructors remains unclear. Much research, to date, has focused on ESPEMI teacher collaboration, with a dichotomization of ESP teachers as language experts and EMI lecturers as content specialists (e.g., Dafouz, 2021; Jiang et al., 2019; Mancho-Barés and Arnó- Macià, 2017). The relationship has been described as typically unbalanced, with ESP teachers being marginalized as assistants due to a lack of content knowledge (e.g., Tsou and Chen, 2014; Tsou and Kao, 2014). The study intended to investigate existing power dynamics between EMI and ESP instructors. Leveraging the expertise of ESP teachers in the design and delivery of EMI PD programs is essential, as shown in Deroey’s (2023) review, which also reveals the predominance of trainers with language-related backgrounds. By acknowledging the distinctive contributions of ESP teachers to EMI Professional Development (PD), this paper introduces a globally adapted EMI PD program crafted by ESP educators and reports on the feedback received from EMI faculty members in the field of medicine and healthcare participating in a university EMI PD initiative funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan.

# 3. The glocalized EMI PD program in Taiwan’s higher education context

This section elaborates on two key aspects: the contextual background of a glocalized EMI PD program in higher education in Taiwan and the design of the program itself.

# 3.1. The contextual background of the glocalized EMI PD program

The glocalized EMI PD program operates within a strategic framework designed to align with Taiwan’s 2030 Bilingual Policy. This policy promotes the internationalization of education by enhancing English communication skills for global competitiveness, reflecting a heightened demand for bilingual proficiency in local talent (National Development Council et al., 2021, p. 1). In accordance with this directive, the Ministry of Education (MOE) launched the Bilingual Education for Students in College (BEST) project in 2021, aiming to enrich learner-centered pedagogy, foster students’ collaborative and communicative competencies with international professionals, and elevate the global standing of Taiwan’s higher education (Ministry of Education, 2021; National Development Council et al., 2021).

The EMI PD program, which was launched as a component of the BEST project and is currently being carried out at the EMI PD Center created by National Chung Kung University (NCKU) in 2022, provides a robust support system for university EMI professors throughout Taiwan. The primary objective is to enhance the implementation and effectiveness of EMI teaching methods in several academic fields, including medicine and healthcare, science and engineering, arts and humanities, and social sciences. The main key performance indicator (KPI) for the initial two-year period was to organize and conduct five EMI training cohorts for a total of 600 university instructors from these four fields. The program utilized a fully online delivery model that incorporated both synchronous and asynchronous learning, making it more accessible for university faculty across the nation to participate willingly and without cost.

The instructional team, consisting of 11 experienced ESP educators from various universities in Taiwan, served as EMI teacher trainers. Their participation varied across cohorts to accommodate individual schedules. The curriculum of the EMI PD program is a purposeful combination of knowledge acquired from the instructional team’s extensive experience in teaching ESP and joint efforts with university academics involved in EMI. This synergy, as illustrated in Table 1, manifests through four developmental stages: the initial needs analyses for ESP implementation (2009–2014), followed by program evaluation and evolution (2014–2019), ESP and EMI collaboration (2015–2017), and the ongoing refinement of EMI PD needs analyses (2020–2022). These stages trace the ESP teachers’ journey from a general to a specialized instructional focus, equipping them with the expertise to craft and tailor EMI teaching programs responsive to the specific demands of Taiwan’s higher education institutions.

It is worth noting that, in stage four, the ESP teachers compared EMI PD programs established in Taiwan and those offered by international institutes (e.g., British Council, Oxford EMI training, Ohio University OPEN MOOCs, etc.) as the stakeholders often recommend them. They also discussed recent theories and empirical studies on EME (English-medium education), bilingual, multilingual, and plurilingual education. From these discussions, it was concluded that the program should emphasize pedagogies and languaging as university faculty in Taiwan lack formal pedagogical training compared to K-12 teachers, and hence it is of utmost importance for them to gain pedagogical knowledge as the initial step for future PD (see Figure 1 and Table 2). Additionally, this program challenged the prevailing misconception that superior English proficiency among instructors and students is the sole indicator of successful EMI course delivery. To counter this notion, a glocalized EMI PD program was developed in Taiwan to address the fallacy that “E” in EMI stands for English-only and Standard English. The term “glocalized” highlights the importance of tailoring such global concepts as EMI course design and ELF to empower and enable EMI instructors to teach disciplinary content intelligibly and comprehensibly to students in their contexts. This design has been piloted by the Taiwan Ministry of Defense in its efforts to promote bilingual education since 2021.

# 3.2. Design of the glocalized EMI PD program in Taiwan

This section describes the delivery and content of the glocalized EMI PD program developed by the ESP educators in Taiwan (see Figure 1 and Table 2), designed to inspire ESP teachers on plausible ways to advance EMI PD rather than to provide detailed descriptions of the whole program.

The glocalized EMI PD program is a 36-h blended program of 32-h synchronous and 4-h asynchronous teaching. Synchronous teaching includes $3 0 \mathrm { h }$ of classes and a 2-h group discussion on microteaching held online. The classes are designed to be interactive, engaging, and informative, with various tasks and discussions to enhance EMI instructors’ understanding of languaging and pedagogies (to be discussed below). Teacher participants worked together collaboratively and planned and conducted group microteachings at the end of the class, allowing them to design and implement EMI teaching with peer support. Then, they will discuss their microteaching with their instructors, and gain feedback from both instructors and peers. In contrast, asynchronous teaching entails EMI instructors’ individual work on analyzing videos, preparing microteaching, and providing written self and peer feedback about microteachings at their convenience. These activities help check EMI instructors’ understanding, application, and evaluation of EMI concepts, and allow instructors to adjust their teaching as a result. In so doing, using the blended, online mode is intended to motivate EMI participants by making learning flexible, in line with findings from Deroey’s (2023) recent review on EMI PD.

# Glocalized EMI PD Program in Taiwan

![](img/34bcb7c3a31ce50b24f6c790aeb8ff92b3409de469c50a234865704b2b283047.jpg)  
Figure 1. Design of the glocalized EMI PD program in Taiwan.

Workshop classes focus on two main themes: pedagogies and languaging (see Figure 1 and Table 2). Pedagogies refer to methods, strategies, and practices that enhance and empower university teachers to revisit, review, and redesign disciplinary courses via English. It includes four sub-themes taught consecutively, with each sub-theme building on the previous one to help instructors have a basic understanding of the concepts. These sub-themes are as follows:

1. Introduction to Glocalized EMI PD includes the clarification of bilingual and EMI policies, the introduction of ELF and the roles of languages and pedagogy, the new identity as an EMI instructor, and the distinction between EGP, ESP, and disciplinary literacy. These concepts, as Deroey (2023) notes, aim “to promote a better understanding of EMI and inform attitudes towards it” (p. 6).   
2. Course Design and Teaching Procedure is designed to help teachers transform transmissive teaching into an interactive one, as implied in Tsai and Saunders’s (2017) study on an EMI medical program in Taiwan. Restructuring a course is necessary to enhance students’ understanding of disciplinary content via a foreign language. It involves concepts of backward design, teaching procedure (Orientation-Delivery-Interaction-Recap, i.e., ODIR), alignment of intended learning outcomes and assessment, and a task design for balancing higher-order and lower-order thinking (Kao and Tsou, 2022).   
3. Translanguaging and Multimodality introduces the concept of teaching as a semiotic practice and discusses the use of L1 and different modes to enhance students’ understanding of disciplinary knowledge in English. It focuses on providing comprehensible audio-visual and textual support and delivering information with multimodal resources.   
4. Under the category of pedagogies, AI/Digital Enhancement introduces different AI/digital tools to engage students in learning via English (e.g., Slido, Jamboard, and Pear Deck).

Table 2 Content of the Professional Development Course provided by the EMI PD Center.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Theme</td><td>Content</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Languaging - Intelligibility &amp; Comprehensibility</td><td>Intelligibility/comprehensibility Instructional language</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Instructional language</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Signposting language</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pedagogies -&gt; Comprehension</td><td>Backward course design &amp; ODIR procedure</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AI/digital enhancement</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Translanguaging</td><td>T</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> Multimodality</td><td>m</td></tr></table></body></html>

The term “languaging” instead of “language” is used to highlight the active role played by language(s) as a tool for communication in EMI classrooms and occupational contexts such as to negotiate and construct knowledge. It can be divided into four sub-themes:

1. Intelligibility and Comprehensibility covers the ways to make utterances spoken in English accessible and understood by AI/digital tools (e.g., YouTube’s auto-generated captions, Otter.ai’s speech-to-text, effective use of Google translate, and NaturalReader’s text-to-speech), with a specific focus on delivering information with distinct articulation, appropriate stresses, and adequate volume, varying intonation, drawing students’ attention, and pausing at meaningful units. 2. Instructional Language provides language support in each ODIR procedure by simplifying languages and using signposting and multimodality effectively. In so doing, EMI instructors can clearly define and emphasize key topics, concepts, and terminologies, connect new information to students’ prior knowledge, and provide comprehensible input. 3. Interactional Language is highlighted to engage students (e.g., rapport building and collaboration encouragement) and inform teaching (e.g., checking comprehension, detecting difficulties, and fostering critical thinking) by diverse grouping, language, and AI/digital enhancement. In so doing, EMI teachers can elicit responses, give feedback, and engage students with interaction techniques. 4. Signposting Language introduces linguistic elements such as transition or linking words, phrases, and clauses, serving as a roadmap to enhance comprehension. These expressions are taught in relation to the ODIR procedure, providing teachers with guidance for ensuring cohesion and coherence in the instructional processes.

The above description aligns with Morell’s (2020) advocacy for an interactive and multimodal approach to EMI PD. Unlike Tuomainen (2018), Gustafsson (2020), or Pun and Onder-Ozdemir (2023) which contextualize specifically for one discipline, our program is designed for four broad disciplines due to limited budget and time. However, examples tailored to the specific needs of multiple disciplines were included.

# 4. The study

This paper examines data from the first cohort of faculty participants in medicine and healthcare in 2022. The rationale for focusing on this initial cohort is that their participation in the PD program was completed prior to the writing of this manuscript, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the collected data. A total of 27 university EMI faculty, specializing in medicine and healthcare participated in the study. Of these participants, $67 \%$ $n = 1 8$ ) were female and $3 3 \% ( n = 9 )$ were male. Among the participants, $6 8 \% ( n = 1 7 )$ did not have previous EMI experience, while $3 2 \% ( n = 1 0 )$ had EMI experience before engaging in the PD program. In terms of institutional backgrounds, $4 8 \% ( n = 1 3 )$ of the participants were instructors in public universities or colleges, $3 0 \% ( n = 8 )$ from private institutions, and $2 2 \ \%$ $[ n = 6 ]$ from technical and vocational universities or colleges. The surveys solicited minimal background information to maintain participant anonymity in this small training group. As such, only EMI teaching experience was directly queried in the pre- and post-program surveys. Other demographic details, such as gender distribution and institutional affiliation, were inferred from enrollment records rather than individual survey responses.

This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data, to examine the professional development of university faculty in medicine and healthcare. Specifically, the study focused on participant responses to evolving perspectives and practices in EMI. A pre-test, post-test, and one-group design was employed in this study. Quantitative data were collected using the EMI PD program surveys, which were administered at the beginning and end of the program. This design allowed for a comprehensive analysis of participants’ EMI experiences and the effectiveness of the EMI PD program.

The survey, designed as a primary evaluative tool for the EMI PD program, was structured into three sections: participants’ EMI experience, their perceived self and EMI instruction efficacy, and perceived self and program efficacy. The EMI instructor self-efficacy section contains statements related to participants’ beliefs and perceived competence in EMI teaching, while the expectations or feedback section entails their views on the PD program itself. The pre-program survey included an additional open-ended prompt: “Please briefly describe your expectations for this training program and for yourself, aiming to gauge participants; initial expectations for the program. The survey was conducted anonymously and voluntarily in Chinese. In addition to inquiring about the participants’ EMI experience, the two main sections in both surveys are:

# 4.1. Perceived self and program efficacy

In this section, the participants rated the expected (pre-program) or perceived (post-program) helpfulness of 10 PD program components related to EMI course design and teaching. These items covered a range of EMI instructional strategies and faculty PD support, including

(1) ODIR teaching procedure, (2) backward design, (3) multimodality,

(4) translanguaging,   
(5) instructional language design and implementation, (6) classroom interaction design and language,   
(7) AI (Artificial Intelligence)/Digital enhancement in EMI, (8) EMI checklist,   
(9) small-group discussion and collaboration, and   
(10) small group and individual microteachings.

# 4.2. Perceived self and EMI instruction efficacy

Participants were asked to respond to six statements using a 6-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree; 2: disagree, 3: slightly disagree, 4: slightly agree, 5: agree, 6: strongly agree). These statements, consistent in both pre- and post-program surveys, included:

(1) I am competent in EMI teaching;   
(2) I can successfully design an EMI course and lesson;   
(3) I believe students can learn as well in well-designed EMI classes as in Chinese-Medium Instruction (CMI); and (4) I will continuously offer and promote EMI courses.

These items pertained to participants’ perceptions of their EMI competence and beliefs and were used to evaluate changes in their EMI instruction efficacy after the program.

Before its administration, the survey was piloted in another small-scale EMI training course to ensure its reliability and validity. Feedback from the pilot phase informed necessary revisions and refinements of the survey instrument.

The qualitative data, on the other hand, were collected through a combination of written responses and focus group discussions. The data were derived from the four guided reflection questions on the post-microteaching reflection, two openended questions on the post-program survey, and the recordings of the post-microteaching discussion in respective focus groups. Both guided reflection questions and open-ended questions focused on the participants’ identification and descriptions of their perspectives and potential EMI practices that were impacted through their participation in the EMI PD. The four guided reflection questions were:

1. What did you and/or your group do well in the microteaching, and would you like to keep doing it?   
2. What do you plan to work on to continue developing your EMI instructional and interactional language?   
3. What development or improvement in your instructional and interactional language did you notice?   
4. What do you plan to work on to continue developing your EMI instruction?

The two open-ended post-program survey questions were designed to explore participants’ experiences. The two questions were:

1. How have your thoughts about EMI and your EMI teaching practices changed due to your participation in the program?   
2. Which aspects of the program have been influential in contributing to these changes?

The post-microteaching discussion was organized as a focus group discussion, with participants divided into three groups, each consisting of nine participants and one trainer. These discussions were conducted online and recorded to allow for later analysis. This format allowed participants to comment and reflect on their microteaching, peer feedback, and experiences in the PD program, facilitating a deeper understanding of the program’s impact.

Our data analysis utilized a data-driven framework, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods to obtain insights from participant responses. Quantitative data, comprising frequencies, percentages, and proportions, revealed changes in EMI faculty’s perceived competencies and beliefs following the EMI PD program. This approach, recommended by Boone and Boone (2012) for data not suitable for parametric testing, provided a descriptive analysis of our findings.

To further validate these insights, we used the Mann–Whitney U test. This nonparametric test, suitable for ordinal Likert scale data and robust against normality violations, was selected based on de Winter and Dodou’s (2010) findings that nonparametric tests can yield results comparable to parametric tests with Likert data. The combination of descriptive statistics and the Mann–Whitney U test allowed us to not only describe our data’s central tendencies and dispersions but also to statistically confirm the significance of the differences observed before and after the program.

Qualitatively, data were analyzed by the authors based on Carspecken’s (1996) reconstructive and thematic analysis. The process involved discovering implied meanings, assigning codes, and rearranging codes to establish categories and themes. Themes that emerged and were identified from the participants’ responses to the survey or guided reflection questions were then cross-verified through a comparative analysis of the various forms of data collected.

# 5. Results and discussion

The quantitative and qualitative results are reported and discussed respectively below.

5.1. Quantitative results

5.1.1. Survey analysis of perceived self and program efficacy in EMI PD

Table 3 compares participants’ evaluations of the key EMI PD program components before and after the program. The means and standard deviations for each program component are reported alongside the percentage frequencies of participant agreement levels.

Descriptive analysis shows significant increases in mean scores for components like the ODIR procedure, backward design, and multimodality, with post-program scores reaching 5.88, 5.60, and 5.80 respectively. These scores, along with high agreement percentages, underscore the participants’ enhanced pedagogical knowledge.

The Mann–Whitney $U$ test results reaffirmed these observations. For example, the ODIR procedure’s pre-program mean of 4.16 ascended to a post-program 5.88, with a significant $U$ value of 115.000 $p < . 0 0 1 )$ . Similar significant enhancements were observed in backward design $\mathit { U } = 1 5 0 . 0 0 0$ , $p = . 0 0 1 $ ), multimodality $\ b { U } = 1 3 2 . 5 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), and instructional language $U = 1 6 5 . 0 0 0$ , $p = . 0 0 1$ ).

In sum, an obvious significant, positive shift in how helpful participants perceived the key program components was demonstrated through descriptive statistics and the Mann–Whitney $U$ test, suggesting the program’s effectiveness.

Further evidence of the program’s impact is seen in translanguaging, classroom interaction, AI/digital enhancement, and the EMI checklist. All demonstrated considerable gains in perceived usefulness, with $U$ values ranging from 133.500 to 169.500, all achieving $p$ -values below .002. These components are essential for effective EMI pedagogy and were rated as more beneficial post-program, indicating an overall trend of increased efficacy. An interesting and significant improvement among these university EMI instructors was in small group collaboration and microteaching. The participants’ level of agreement reached 88 and $7 6 \ \% ,$ , respectively, after the program, and the corresponding $U$ values of 147.500 and 170.000 suggest statistically significant EMI pedagogical gains $( p < . 0 0 2 )$ .

The combination of descriptive statistics and Mann–Whitney $U$ test results provides an overview of the success of the EMI PD program in improving the pedagogical competencies of its participants. The consistent increase in average scores and significant statistical indicators confirm the program’s effectiveness in promoting a deeper understanding and application of effective EMI teaching practices.

5.1.2. Survey analysis of perceived self and instructional efficacy in EMI teaching In alignment with Deroey’s (2023) recommendation of “promoting confidence by avoiding a remedial language approach” (p. 3), our team intended to enhance EMI instructors’ self-efficacy by cherishing their disciplinary expertise, and reimagining EMI teaching as multimodal communication, with English being one of the modes. The survey data, as detailed in Table 4, reveal a clear progression in participants’ perceived self-efficacy in using EMI, with a notable shift in agreement levels regarding the program’s positive influence on their EMI teaching competencies.

Survey responses indicated a shift from $^ { * } 4$ -somewhat agree” to higher agreement levels (“5-agree” and “6-strongly agree”) on items measuring self-perceived competence in EMI teaching, effective EMI course design, and commitment to EMI course offerings and promotion. Notably, mean scores neared the six-point Likert scale’s maximum, highlighting strong perceptions of the program’s efficacy. Before training, $56 \%$ of participants believed students could learn equally well in well-designed EMI and CMI classes, which increased to $8 4 \%$ post-training.

The Mann–Whitney U test confirmed significant improvements in faculties’ self-perceived EMI teaching competence $U = 8 0 . 5 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), indicating increased confidence and validation of the program’s effectiveness. Similarly, the faculty’s confidence in their course design skills also significantly improved $\mathbf { \nabla } U = 9 6 . 5 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), showing an enhanced capacity in EMI course development and implementation. There was also a significant positive change in the belief that students could learn as effectively in EMI as in CMI $U = 2 0 9 . 5 0 0$ , $p = . 0 3 4 ,$ , reflecting the program’s success in instilling confidence in the efficacy of EMI methodologies. Finally, a significant rise in the commitment to actively provide and advocate for EMI courses after the program $( U = 1 9 3 . 0 0 0 , p = . 0 1 5 )$ , indicating a strengthened determination to continue teaching in EMI. Overall, these data support the significant impact of the EMI PD program in strengthening faculty members’ EMI teaching skills and their dedication to EMI pedagogical methods.

# 5.2. Qualitative results

This section addresses the four key themes from the qualitative analysis, including clarification of misconceptions, improvement of pedagogical knowledge, development of languaging awareness, and enhancement of perceived EMI selfefficacy.

# 5.2.1. Clarification of misconceptions

The first emerging theme from the responses of the first cohort of EMI faculty in medicine and healthcare is the clarification of misconceptions of EMI policy and teaching. First, the EMI courses under the Bilingual 2030 Policy may often be mistaken for English-only instruction. However, the explanation and guidance of ESP teachers helped the participants understand the purpose of EMI in their contexts (e.g., “Disciplinary Literacy in English is more practical for medical teachers and students”) and the pedagogical importance of EMI (e.g., “EMI teaching is not only about English,” “it’s not teaching only in English,” and “it’s about bilingual”). A more comprehensive understanding of the EMI policy may increase teachers’ willingness to use EMI in the future, as suggested by Deroey (2023).

Second, the focus of EMI teaching on the part of the participants has shifted from language, or more specifically, English proficiency, to pedagogy. As one participant wrote in the post-program survey: “professional capability is still the most important thing. EMI [PD] helps me understand that I should not only rely on English language ability but use more languages and teaching tools flexibly for better teaching” $( \mathsf { P } 1 ^ { 1 } )$ . This quote implies that the program has communicated well that teaching is essentially about using semiotic resources to facilitate effective communication. The current EMI PD program would also seem to counter the erroneous perception held by some participants, perhaps due to previous training approaches in Taiwan, that EMI instructors should strive for near-native-like competence and that teaching is synonymous with public speaking or conference presentation. As one participant expressed her frustration about the focus of prior EMI PD programs in the post-microteaching discussion:

Our university also offered a lot of EMI professional training workshops, but we all felt very bored after taking them. The main reason is that the trainers are all foreign [English native-speaking] teachers, and they don’t say how to teach. [Instead, these courses focus on] such as how to improve grammar, or oral English. we even have one-on-one sessions . and it’s all free, but I don’t think I’ve made any progress. $( \mathsf { G } 1 - \mathsf { P } 3 ^ { 2 } \cdot$ )

The above response highlights the primacy of prioritizing pedagogical enhancement in EMI PD programs over improving English proficiency or achieving near-native-like English proficiency, aligning with the actual needs of EMI faculty in Taiwan. This perspective reflects an expanded awareness among EMI instructor participants, extending beyond the scope of Tuomainen’s (2018) study and aligning more closely with the findings of Jiménez-Muñoz (2020).

One crucial concern, specific to medicine and healthcare instructors, is how subjects in the National Medical Examination can be taught in English. We addressed this issue in the workshop class by emphasizing that not all subjects need to be taught in English to develop such competency. In light of this insight, one of the participants even reached the following conclusion: “This is a revolution in teaching, and every teacher needs this EMI PD” (P4). The metaphor “revolution” suggests the need for transformative practices in EMI PD in Taiwan conceptually and urgently.

# 5.2.2. Improvement of pedagogical knowledge

Another benefit observed from post-program surveys and reflections is the increase in participants’ perceived pedagogical knowledge, encompassing course design (learner-centered, interactive, and backward design), teaching procedures (using the ODIR method), and effective teaching strategies (translanguaging, multimodality, and AI/digital enhancement). This finding collaborates with the survey results mentioned above.

A detailed analysis of the participants’ written reflection indicates the different roles each notion might play in the participants’ EMI pedagogical knowledge. First, the concept of interactivity transforms a teacher-centered practice (transmissive teaching) into a learner-centered one (dialogic teaching) and hence teachers would focus on “what students can perform” and “how to engage students” rather than “what teachers should teach” (G2-P2). One feature of developing a student-centered approach can be reflected in the repeated use of “less is more” (duàn she lí - 斷捨離) as a guiding principle. The participants expressed that careful attention was paid to selecting topics or concepts that would be taught to engage students. One participant concluded in the post-program survey, “If I want to teach EMI class in the future, I’ll try my best to duàn she lí. The 50-min class is designed to be 30 min. I use AI to interact with students in a timely manner, and try to - avoid losing students’ attention” (P18). The accommodation of student needs reflects one of the program’s features: orientation.

Moreover, ODIR became a catchphrase for the participants to redesign their courses, as evidenced in their EMI microteachings at the end of the training. Participants appreciated the notion of ODIR because it helped encourage students’ participation, check student comprehension, and reduce overreliance on complex English in teaching. One participant summarized his/her learning in the program in Day 5 reflection, “ODIR is . a new and fascinating concept to me in terms of breaking teaching into meaningful pieces that help me focus on the real learning needs of the students so that more effective and efficient teaching design in the future can be made” (P11). ODIR is repeatedly mentioned in the participants’ responses to the first (things the group does well) and last survey questions (things to be kept developing). One teacher even proclaimed, “ODIR is like DNA” (G1-P4) in the final microteaching discussions. It is interesting that a medical teacher used the metaphor “DNA” to suggest that ODIR may have become a core component for effective EMI practicesdi.e., the concept of ODIR has been internalized for systemic self-reflection and important implications for their future EMI practice.

The usefulness of translanguaging and digital tools has been shown in the literature (Deroey, 2023; Morell, 2020). It is no wonder that the acronym “ATM” strategies (i.e., AI/digital enhancement, translanguaging, and multimodality) emerged as a popular term among participants. One participant explained: “In the process [individual and group microteachings], we constantly reminded ourselves of the ideas of ODIR and ATM” (G1-T4). Of the three teaching strategies (ATM), AI/digital enhancement was the most practical. In this context, AI/digital enhancement refers broadly to the use of artificial intelligence and digital tools, including but not limited to speech-to-text, text-to-speech, translation tools, and other ICT tools for instruction and student engagement. Examples of these tools include Otter. ai, NaturalReader, Deepl, Slido, Jamboard, Pear Deck, etc. This result is consistent with the usefulness of digital tools in previous research (Arau Ribeiro et al., 2019; Deroey, 2023; Jiménez-Muñoz, 2020; Morell et al., 2022; Tsou and Tsai, 2022; Tsui, 2018).

More importantly, the participants understand the backward design approach via our EMI PD design. A participant expressed what s/he learned in the survey: “Language isn’t the most important. What is [more important] is to [have] ILOs (intended learning outcomes) that help students to learn. ” (P12). A participant further explained the change in the postmicroteaching discussion: “I had no experience as a teacher before. In fact, we just follow what our teachers had taught us before, pouring all the things into my head. So I also teach students like this. What I’ve discovered since last week: what my current students want may not be me pouring things to them all the time” (G2-P2). Such reflection indicates that the program effectively addressed and met the pedagogical needs of the EMI faculty in medicine and healthcare.

# 5.2.3. Development of languaging awareness

Another key theme from our analysis is the development of languaging awareness, referring to teachers’ understanding of how languages and other semiotic modes are used for communication and meaning-making in educational contexts.

First, the qualitative analysis shows that the participants developed their knowledge about using instructional and signposting languages in the ODIR procedure. Repetitive phrases included “simplify language,” “spoken language, “slowing down,” “pausing,” “active voice,” and “beginning with verbs.” “Use of simplified spoken language along with signposting will improve the comprehensibility of EMI courses” represented a recurring theme in the participants’ reflection. One participant differentiated paraphrases from signposting languages: Although both are strategies to increase comprehension, paraphrases may need varied sentences, but signposting languages have a template to indicate topic shifts.

Second, linguistic and non-linguistic resources were seen as essential. The participants expressed that effective EMI teaching requires “making good use of charts, images, explanations, and gestures.” They concurred that simple disciplinary concepts could be taught in merely English, while difficult concepts can be explained with the assistance of Mandarin Chinese. “It really depends on different courses, different levels of students in different classes.” In other words, the participants accepted the concept that teaching itself is multimodal and that the timing of translanguaging is based on contexts, as reflected in the literature (e.g., Deroey, 2023; Morell, 2020).

Third, in line with ELF, the EMI training underscores intelligibility and comprehensibility rather than requires accuracy and nativeness through introducing accessible AI and technological tools for speech recognition, such as YouTube’s autogenerated captions, Otter. ai’s speech-to-text, effective use of Google translate, and NaturalReader’s text-to-speech. The participants employed these resources to examine and improve the intelligibility of microteachings. One participant expressed, “[the program] provides many tools that allow us [teachers] (or future students) to improve speaking speed and clarity” (P18). “EMI teaching is not only about English. We can involve many AI devices and programs to the lecture, making it more interesting and informative. I’ve learned many new programs I can apply; it’s very useful for me,” noted one participant in English (P8). One participant even mentioned the distinction between intelligibility and comprehensibility: intelligible speech may not be understood by students and hence comprehension checks in recap or interaction are necessary. The above positive comments are consistent with prior literature on promoting digital tools for language enhancement (Deroey, 2023; Morell, Aleson-; Carbonell & Escabias-Lloret, 2022).

# 5.2.4. Enhancement of perceived self-efficacy

Corroborating the survey results, the analysis of the EMI instructor participants’ post-microteaching written reflections also reveals enhancement of perceived self-efficacy. As the participants wrote in the post-microteaching survey:

Before the PD, I felt that EMI teaching was difficult, and I wondered if I was able to keep up [with the training]. After the PD, I think teacher trainers’ teaching demonstration and practical exercises make learning a pleasant experience. It makes people want to try EMI teaching. (P13)

Today’s sharing and group learning were very beneficial. It was a time of concept integration and collaboration in the past few days, and I also saw the creativity of each group! This will be very helpful for future EMI classes. (P5)

. In the professional courses of the Dentistry Department ., the focus is on the National Medical Licensing Examination. Based on the feedback from the students, they expect the teachers to provide them with professional knowledge to pass the exam and have little exposure to interactive teaching methods, which also have a low level of student acceptance. However, through the course training and with some reflection, perhaps the opportunity to change my teaching has emerged, allowing students to learn at different levels. (P17)

The above three quotes highlight the primacy of “how” to increase perceived EMI self-efficacy beliefs, including class teaching (demonstration and activities), peer learning (group discussions), teaching practice (microteaching), and reflection, as evidenced in Deroey (2023). One explanation for the advancement of perceived EMI self-efficacy is that the participants had mastery experiences of their success in EMI microteachings, as well as verbal or social persuasion (positive comments and constructive feedback) provided by ESP educators, as well as their peers. As a result, a sense of achievement, fulfillment, and companionship prevailed, as suggested in Tsui (2018).

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This study presented and examined a glocalized EMI PD program designed collaboratively by experienced ESP teachers and EMI instructors in Taiwan’s higher education, specifically targeting a faculty cohort from the medical and healthcare disciplines. Quantitative analysis, using pre- and post-program surveys, showed significant gains in participants’ perceived self-efficacy and EMI pedagogical competencies. These findings align with existing literature, highlighting the importance of self-efficacy and pedagogical knowledge for effective EMI instruction (Pagèze and Lasagabaster, 2018; Tsui, 2018). The survey results demonstrated a marked improvement in participants’ self and instructional efficacy.

Qualitative analysis further revealed the positive outcomes of the glocalized EMI PD program among the EMI faculty in medicine and healthcare. These outcomes included the dispelling of misconceptions, an improvement in pedagogical knowledge, the development of languaging awareness, and an increase in perceived EMI self-efficacy. EMI instructors clarified the misconception that EMI necessitates near-native English skills. Instead, the focus shifted toward prioritizing effective pedagogies. They better understood effective EMI course design, teaching procedures, and teaching strategies than before. They heightened awareness of the role of different languages, modes, and semiotic resources in facilitating communication and enhancing learning. Consequently, their confidence in English teaching increased, potentially impacting teaching practices positively, a correlation supported by prior research (Deroey, 2023; Tsui, 2018). Future research could explore the relationship between self-efficacy and languaging beliefs, especially considering the mediating role of EMI teaching experience length (Chen, 2019; Tsui, 2018).

The findings have two implications. First, the positive responses from the participants suggest that the glocalized design satisfies the practical needs of EMI instructors at universities in Taiwan. The real need, as ESP teachers expected, concerns a prerequisite for pedagogical knowledge, ELF and EMI awareness, as well as effective use of AI/digital tools, translanguaging, and multimodality, partially corresponding to the prior literature (Curle et al., 2020; Deroey, 2023; Klaassen and de Graaff, 2001). In particular, this study demonstrates that pedagogical concepts, skills, and tools are necessary mediators in systemic, oriented, and sustainable professional development since related concepts were repeatedly verbalized as a guide in articulation and reflection. Given that the ODIR procedure is relatively easy to understand for EMI faculty in medicine and healthcare, it is suggested that future research examine whether the ODIR procedures are equally applicable and effective across all roles medical teachers take, i.e., lecturer, tutor, mentor, and coach (see Gustafsson, 2020). For example, research could investigate how language is used to provide guidance and support within the ODIR framework for the mentor and coach roles. Such results can become a springboard for other EMI contexts with similar needs or future research on EMP.

Second, given the positive feedback gained from the participants, it is reasonable to leverage ESP educators to play roles as designers and facilitators in EMI PD programs, not simply as language experts in adjunct ESP courses for better facilitation. Like Morell (2020), this study advocates for ESP scholars to become teacher educators through a multimodal and interactive approach to EMI practices. However, what sets the current study apart from Morell’s work is the focus on establishing a systemic, oriented, and sustainable professional development led by ESP educators, rather than merely relying on workshops using a specific teaching approach. While the study results suggest that ESP teachers may be well-suited to become EMI PD developers, it is important to note that not all ESP teachers possess the necessary skills and expertise to take on this role. In this study, the ESP teachers had extended experience in collaboration with EMI instructors, suggesting that experience and training may be a prerequisite for developing effective EMI PD. Therefore, it is essential to provide professional development opportunities for ESP teachers, focusing on identifying the needs of EMI faculty through collaboration with EMI instructors as a preliminary step.

There are several limitations and directions for future studies. First, it is crucial to recognize that the participants in this study were the first group of EMI trainees, which may result in unique experiences compared to those of subsequent cohorts. Their voluntary engagement in the initial program implementation might have influenced their behavior, motivation, engagement, or changes in attitudes and perceptions. Also, the anonymity of participants’ responses made it challenging to understand what compelled them to think so or what effects this perception might have had. Thus, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution when generalizing the feedback given by these EMI instructors to all EMI faculty in Taiwan. Future research may explore the experiences of subsequent cohorts and compare their feedback to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the EMI PD program’s effectiveness and transferability across different groups of EMI instructors in Taiwan.

The second limitation is that data regarding EMI in authentic classroom contexts in post-training periods were not gathered. While participants’ beliefs and attitudes about EMI may have improved, their actual enactment of EMI course design and use of translanguaging and multimodality may differ. Therefore, further research is needed to examine how much the EMI participants’ beliefs match their practices. The link between teachers’ training and student achievement in EMI practices is also worth investigating. Collecting real practice data can provide valuable feedback to identify areas for improvement for the EMI PD and enhance the quality of EMI practices.

Despite the repeated emphasis on the importance of intercultural competence in the prior literature (e.g., Curle et al., 2020; Deroey, 2023; Klaassen and de Graaff, 2001), a limitation of the current EMI PD design is the lack of attention to this dimension due to restricted time. As the internationalization of higher education is also an important goal of the Bilingual 2030 Policy, it is essential to incorporate intercultural competence into EMI PD and ESP PD in the future. Research in these directions can benefit EMI and ESP PD in higher education.

In conclusion, this paper showcases the glocalized EMI PD in Taiwan and presents that EMI medical and healthcare faculty may have been empowered as pedagogies-and-languaging-informed disciplinary educators. This result suggests the usefulness of the EMI PD in medicine and healthcare and shows the potential for further exploration of the role of ESP educators. In particular, this paper leverages ESP educators’ roles as designers of the EMI PD instead of merely marginalized language teachers or linguistic experts. Given the context-specific nature of the EMI PD program, this research does not aim to overgeneralize the findings. Instead, it aims to encourage the transformation of ESP educators’ roles by glocalizing EMI PD in their own contexts.
