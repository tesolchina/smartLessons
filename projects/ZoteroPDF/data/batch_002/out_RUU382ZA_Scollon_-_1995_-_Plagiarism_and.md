# ABSTRACT

The concept of plagiarism, as used both in considerations of academic writing and in international negotiations over intellectual copyright, assumes a model of communication based on autonomous, rational, individuals who behave as originators of their own discourses. But studies of communication, beginning with Goffman's concepts of production format and footing - and also including the concepts of enactment, social role, face, politeness pragmatics, metaphors of self and communication, and innatist/social concepts of knowledge - indicate that such a unified, autonomous, and original communicative identity presupposes an oversimplified model of communication, centrally based in the ideology of the rational, autonomous individual which has been dominant in Europe since the Enlightenment. The concept of plagiarism masks the assertion of this ideological position. (Plagiarism, ideology, identity, intercultural discourse)

Intellectual copyright is a term which has been in the news for years. International negotiations over this concept cover everything from scholarly works to brand names of products and pornographic videos. Scholars and teachers have a primary interest in questions of intellectual copyright - both in regard to our own writing, and as an aspect of teaching expected forms of attribution to our students. One suspects that pornography and brand names are somewhat more central to the lawyers who participate in international negotiations; nevertheless attribution of authorship in academic writing remains a perennial problem in writing, and crosses lines of cultural identity.

Treatments of academic plagiarism tend to presuppose a common ideological ground in the creative, original, individual who, as an autonomous scholar, presents his/her work to the public in his/her own name. Thus the issues raised in The Chronicle of Higher Education concerning a historian's originality (Magner 1993a,b) focus directly on the establishment of the facts of the case; they do not probe further into whether the underlying presuppositions are in need of examination. The emphasis in such public discussions is focused on two main questions: (a) How close is the wording in one case to a prior instance published by another author? and (b) Was the infringement intentional? That is, the problem is taken as a legal issue, while the legal persons underlying the issue are presupposed without further examination.'

In some other cases there is a growing recognition that differences in cultural traditions may be at issue in what are at first couched as straightforward problems of plagiarism. Thus Miller 1993, points out that, while it is now fairly well known that Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized in writing his doctoral dissertation, it is less well known the extent to which he and many others in the American oral preaching tradition borrow widely and freely and with clear peer and colleague sanction from unacknowledged sources. As Miller argues, problems of plagiarism cannot be understood unless a broader culturally contrastive perspective is taken. But Duranti 1993, while generally supporting the need for a critique of the ideological basis underlying concepts of plagiarism, points out that, when it is one's own work being purloined, it is rather more difficult to take a neutral or relativistic stance.

In another and quite separable domain but within the same broad cultural base, that of newspaper and broadcast journalism, Bell 1991 has also argued that what might be called plagiarism in academic contexts is viewed as common daily practice in putting out the daily news. Little of what appears in print, according to Bell, is likely to have followed principles of attribution held so dear within academic contexts.

Many stories, ostensibly written by local journalists, and even bylined to them, consist largely of material they have rewritten (often only lightly) from press releases issued by newsmaking organizations. A large proportion of news which appears to be produced by local reporters is primarily the work of press officers working for companies, government departments or other organizations. It is in practice virtually impossible to identify accurately which copy has been originated by a local newspaper or broadcast station. (1991:17)

In the domain of the teaching of English, the debate over plagiarism extends somewhat beyond the question of illegality to the pedagogical issue of how and what should be taught. McCormick 1989 and Nienhuis 1989 are fairly characteristic in asserting that what appears to be plagiarism is simply the result of the students' failure to understand correct forms of attribution. In contrast to these, Murphy 1990 argues on the basis of an actual case that at least some plagiarism in student writing is clearly intentional. As in the case of international negotiations as well as professional academic writing, it is normally taken for granted in these studies that the concept of plagiarism itself needs little further examination.

I begin with a brief review of the position which might be called the traditional view. There are, nevertheless, at least eight problems with this traditional view which have become well known in discourse analysis and yet have not, to my knowledge, been brought together to confront and challenge the traditional view of the person of the author which underlies the traditional view of plagiarism. I then suggest that the traditional view of plagiarism constitutes, in fact, an ideological position which privileges a concept of the person established within the European Enlightenment, and that as such it obscures our understanding of the construction of identity in intercultural discourse.

# THE TRADITIONAL VIEW

Handbooks on English usage, textbooks on English composition, and dictionaries all give definitions of plagiarism which show only minor variations in wording.2 For my purposes, the definition from The concise Oxford dictionary (Allen 1990:909) will do.

plagiarize: 1. take and use (the thoughts, writings, inventions, etc. of another person) as one's own. 2. pass off the thoughts etc. of (another person) as one's own.

This dictionary goes on to identify the Latin word plagiarius kidnapper' as the etymological source.

At least in regard to books, it seems clear that this definition follows in a line of historical inheritance directly from Kant's Science of right. After a discussion of the meaning and use of money, Kant turned to the question of the right to own ideas. He wrote:

A book is a writing which contains a discourse addressed by some one to the public, through visible signs of speech. It is a matter of indifference to the present considerations whether it is written by a pen or imprinted by types, and on few or many pages. He who speaks to the public in his own name is the author. He who addresses the writing to the public in the name of the author is the publisher. When a publisher does this with the permission or authority of the author, the act is in accordance with right, and he is the rightful publisher; but if this is done without such permission or authority, the act is contrary to right, and the publisher is a counterfeiter or unlawful publisher ([1788] 1990:425).

Kant went on to clarify that the mechanical or physical object, the book, may be owned by an individual purchaser as real property, but the discourse which the book contains remains the personal property of its author. Plagiarism, then, in the view held at least from Kant's time to the present is the misappropriation, as one's own personal property, of the specific forms of discourse of another person.

The seriousness with which plagiarism is taken in contemporary academic life can hardly be underestimated. As St. Onge puts it (1988:51),

In this skeptical age, finding any unexamined concept is something of a novelty. To find a sacrosanct term is almost like finding a new biological species or medical syndrome. Plagiarism shares a curious semantic feature with the term pornography. Even though we cannot agree on specifics, "We know it when we see it."

Studies of plagiarism tend to be polemical in nature, condemning the plagiarist on the basis of wickedness or incompetence. They base their rhetorical force on the assumption that no reader is likely to come forward in defense of any position which might be construed as favorable to plagiarism. Nevertheless, I argue that the concept of plagiarism implies a number of things -- about the nature of discourse, the nature of the person who undertakes to communicate, and concepts of the ownership of discourse as individual or personal property - which are directly in contrast to what contemporary discourse analysts take to be the nature of communication.

A widely used dictionary of applied linguistics gives the following definition of communication:

The exchange of ideas, information, etc. between two or more persons. In an act of communication there is usually at least one speaker or sender, a mEssaGe which is transmitted, and a person or persons for whom this message is intended (the receiver) (Richards et al. 1985:48).

This definition is in substantial agreement with those advanced in many other sources (Rogers & Agarwala-Rogers 1976, Samovar & Porter 1988). Goffman 1981 provided a summary statement of what he took as the prototypical or taken-for-granted set of assumptions underlying contemporary studies of communication. These are in agreement with the definitions I have just quoted.

Traditional analysis of saying and what gets said seems tacitly committed to the following paradigm: Two and only two individuals are engaged together in it. During any moment in time, one will be speaking his own thoughts on a matter and expressing his own feelings, however circumspectly; the other listening. The full concern of the person speaking is given over to speaking and to its reception, the concern of the person listening to what is being said. The discourse, then, would be the main involvement of both of them. And, in effect, these two individuals are the only ones who know who is saying, who is listening, what is being said, or, indeed, that speaking is going on - all aspects of their doings being imperceivable by others, that is, "inaccessible." Over the course of the interaction the roles of speaker and hearer will be interchanged in support of a statement-- reply format, the acknowledged current-speaking right - the floor - passing back and forth. Finally, what is going on is said to be conversation or talk. (Goffman 1981:129)

# PROBLEMS WITH THE TRADITIONAL VIEW

Studies of interpersonal and intercultural discourse over the past few decades, many of these stimulated by Goffman's work,' have begun to highlight problems in taking this model of communication at face value. Put most simply, these definitions of communication reflect not universal characteristics of communication, but a cultural model which can be located in terms of a particular historical moment and a particular cultural group.

To demonstrate the complexity of the problems which have been raised, I very briefly indicate eight areas in which the concept of the person of the communicator (speaker or hearer), as taken for granted in the contemporary definitions given earlier, has been shown to be problematic. These areas are:

(a) Production format   
(b) Footing   
(c) Enactment   
(d) Social role   
(e) Face   
(f) Politeness pragmatics   
(g) Metaphors of self and communication   
(h) Innatist/social concepts of knowledge

Perhaps I need not point out how superficial my treatment of each of these problems will necessarily be, since a significant literature already exists in most of these areas. At the same time, in preparing this review of these separate literatures, I have found that there is still relatively little overlap among these points of view. Scholars who undertake major studies of face rarely include an analysis of the complexities of Goffman's production format, even though they usually trace their initial references to an early article by Goffman himself. By contrast, Goffmanesque studies of social interaction or conversational analysis rarely bother to question the individualistic and even innatist position which underlies their assumptions about the nature of speakers and hearers.

The result is that I need to give somewhat more detail and explication than might be wished by someone familiar with these diverse sources; at the same time, I may seem to be passing over major points far too quickly for a reader unfamiliar with these points. I can only ask the reader's forbearance, and hope the reader will understand that my main point is not to consider these eight problems in detail, or to offer any serious critique of the position taken in the sources I quote. My point is to show that, taken together, these views of the self present no coherent, unified biological, socially constructed, or communicatively relevant entity which might be thought of as taking responsibility for either authorship or thievery in the form of plagiarism.

The conclusion to which this analysis will lead me is that the concept of plagiarism as currently advanced - both in international negotiations over intellectual copyright, and in our more practical day-to-day moments of trying to teach academic writing - cannot be taken as universal. This concept of plagiarism represents a particular and problematic ideological position. To carry this thesis through to the problem of intercultural discourse, I argue that the apparent difficulty that at least some non-native writers of English have in correctly using reference, quotation, and paraphrase, and in avoiding plagiarism, might be better construed as reflecting a different ideological base. That is, some of this difficulty should be understood not as an inability to learn something simple, but rather as unconscious resistance to an implicit ideology of what has been called "the potent private self" (Moerman 1988:67).

# EIGHT PROBLEMS IN CONSTRUCTING "THE AUTHOR"

It seems that Goffman's intent was never to raise questions of relevance to intercultural discourse. One might, in fact, say that he often regarded concepts of culture, or even society, to be intellectual dodges of the really crucial questions of how social life is constructed in the day-to-day interactions between human beings. Then it is only fair to see his critique of what he called the "traditional analysis of saying" (1981:129) as a critique of his contemporaries' too simplistic conceptualizations of the nature of communication. Nevertheless, the points he called into question regarding the participation framework in his major article "Footing" (Goffman 1981) provide the major spadework by which the foundations of the social construction of self in discourse can be exposed, and then used for intercultural discourse analysis.

# Production format: Animator, author, and principal

Goffman's Frame analysis (1974) introduced the concepts he later developed under the heading of "participant framework" and "production format" in his 1981 article. In that article he defined three distinct aspects of the production of communication: the animator, the author, and the principal (144). The animator he defined as

the sounding box in use, albeit in some actual cases he can share this physical function with a loudspeaker system or a telephone. In short, he is the talking machine, a body engaged in acoustic activity, or, if you will, an individual active in the role of utterance production.

This role of animation is contrasted with those of both author and principal, in that the animator has responsibility only for the production of the utterances, not for what is said or how it is said. The production of what is said is the responsibility of the author. As Goffman defined this role, the author is "Someone who has selected the sentiments that are being expressed and the words in which they are encoded" (1981:144). But, of course, the person who has selected the sentiments and the words in which they are expressed may or may not choose to take responsibility for them. The one who stands behind those words is the principal: "Someone whose position is established by the words that are spoken, someone whose beliefs have been told, someone who is committed to what the words say" (1981:144).

While Goffman's definitions are designed for discussions of spoken communication, these distinctions seem useful in studies of written discourse as well. For example, the idea of animation is that someone, whether the author or some other person, takes the role of producing the discourse for reception. In office-memo preparation, for example, this animation role is often delegated to office staff. In publication, the role is normally delegated to the publisher, and then re-delegated to the printer. Presidents and other political dignitaries often have press secretaries who animate their discourses. Actors animate the discourses of Shakespeare.

It should be clear that, while animation in itself does not raise questions of plagiarism, one may be easily blinded to a socially complex institutionalization of the rights to animation. Publishers may animate the discourses of legally contracted writers, and secretaries may animate the texts of their bosses. The rights to such animation are grounded in the institution of the publishing corporation, or the bureaucratic organization in which boss and secretary work.

Authorship and principalship are somewhat more problematic. The presupposed position taken in questions of academic plagiarism seems to be that author and principal are one and the same person, while animation may be delegated. That is, it is assumed that the person who is committed to the wording and who establishes a position thereby, namely the principal, is the same person as the person who selects the wording actually used. When this person selects wording of another person, he or she will indicate something about both authorship and principalship. That is, it is assumed that the writer will correctly reference the source of the words - attribute authorship - and s/he will tell the reader what stance is being taken in respect to his/her commitment to those ideas. The question of authorship is established through the use of quotations and the citing of sources. The question of principalship. however, is established quite differently through the use of "laminator verbs" (Goffman 1974:505), such as finds, reports, claims, and alleges.

Animator, author, and principal are, in fact, quite rarely unified in the person of a single human being. Furthermore, preliminary studies have indicated that these three roles are not distributed in the same way either across different media of communication - or, more importantly for questions of intercultural communication, across languages. A contrastive rhetorical study of six news stories in two languages across three news media (newspaper, radio, and television; Li et al. 1993) has shown that, in newspaper and radio accounts of the same news event, the English accounts presented the stories under the authorship of single named reporters. That is, the stories were presented as having been written by a particular person, who was given a byline in the case of the newspaper, or voice identification in the case of the radio account. By contrast, in the Chinese (Cantonese) versions of the same stories, produced under virtually identical functional conditions, authorship was presented as the work of the anonymous editors of the newspaper and radio corporations. In both cases, principalship, i.e. taking responsibility for the facts being reported, was delegated through a complex set of laminating verbs such as it was reported, and by other linguistic means such as the use of allegedly.

In contrast to the newspaper and radio versions, the television stories in English and Cantonese were similar to each other; the news corporations tended to play down the authorship roles and to present the unified animator, author, and principal roles by using "actualities," i.e. by having individuals speak directly to the camera.

My point is that the concept of the unified animator/author/principal, pre. supposed in most discussions of plagiarism, is not an entity easily found in normal discourse. For example, there is reason to believe that the animator is most often not the author and principal in most cases of professional writing. Secretaries and typesetters animate the texts authored by both scholars and business people. With regard to the present article, I am authoring it and taking principal responsibility; yet I can only guess at how it will be animated in the final and crucial instance of its printing as a journal article. This animation I gratefully leave to the editor of the journal, the publisher, and their staff.

Author and principal are also more easily separated than one might suppose. Thus, in co-authored academic works, one author often takes on greater wording (authoring) responsibilities, yet the co-authors share principalship equally. When senior authors, such as professors, co-author with junior authors, it is often the case that the text is, in the main, authored (i.e. worded) by the junior author, but gains considerable weight of authority (i.e. principalship) because the senior partner places his/her person behind the statements made. Editors of professional publications are rarely listed as authors of the words found in them, but in many cases the actual wordings owe much to their nearly invisible activities.

In cases ranging from office memos to news reporting, but including academic writing, author and principal are often separated, and presented with different linguistic means. As I have suggested, in contrasting journalistic practices with academic practices at least, production formats are not identically constructed, either across all media or when different languages are used.

# Footing

In discussing production format, I have argued (following Goffman 1974, 1981) that the person taken to be speaking or writing is a person who is socially constructed within the discourse. Sometimes, in addition to conventional but different distributions of the three possible production roles, a speaker or a writer steps aside and shows him/herself to be occupying still further roles - behind, or at least outside of, the roles of animator, author, and principal. These are the sort of temporary departures from an ongoing stance which Goffman has called "changes in footing":

A change in footing implies a change in the alignment we take up to ourselves and the others present as expressed in the way we manage the production or reception of an utterance. A change in our footing is another way of talking about a change in our frame for events (1981:128).

Changes of footing may be observed in virtually all forms of discourse, spoken or written. An elementary school teacher may, in mid-lesson, say Please pay attention to what I'm saying. An essayist may place a structurally analogous aside in a footnote. Changes of footing are often, but not always, signaled by some form of code or register shifting. Thus Lin 1990 has shown that frequent use of code-shifting from English into Cantonese, in Hong Kong elementary classrooms, is a means of changing the footing in the relationship between the teacher and the student.

In collecting news stories for the study reported by Li et al. 1993, 1 recorded the following portion of a radio news report:

1 [NARRATOR, CHARLIE CHARTERS] Twenty die in New Year tragedy./ Witl   
2 Brian Curtis I'm Charlie Charters this is the Metro News World   
3 Report./   
4 Twenty people have died after New Year's celebrations in Lan Kwai   
5 Fong went out of control as crowds stampeded over fallen party goers./   
6 The government has promised to hold an enquiry and police have   
7 sealed off the area as they collect what evidence remains of the   
8 nighttime tragedy./ Most of the injured and dead were rushed to   
9 Queen Mary Hospital and it's from there that Metro's Francis Moriarty   
10 joins us live with the latest details.   
11 [FRANCIS MORIARTY] Yes   
12 (long silence)   
13 [NARRATOR, CHARLIE CHARTERS] Francis!   
14 [FRANCIS MORIARTY] I'm here.   
15 [NARRATOR, CHARLIE CHARTERS] Can you give us the latest details?   
16 [FRANCIS MORIARTY] The latest details?   
17 [NARRATOR, CHARLIE CHARTERS] Yeah, the latest details on the   
18 injuries.

# RON SCOLLON

19 [FRANCIS MORIARTY] Um, I can only give you the figures that I've   
20 been given. I don't know if you have anything further or more   
21 comprehensive than that.   
22 [NARRATOR, BRIAN CURTIS] Francis, we're live on the radio [AM 1044]   
23 in Hong Kong./   
24 [FRANCIS MORIARTY] [[Live, live on the radio, sorry, em]] (shift to   
25 "radio narrator voice") The latest figures that I have up HE::re   
26 are that, eh, there were eighty-six casualties. Eh, that includes   
27 the twenty people so far who are dead./ There are also a   
28 number of critically injured, eh, ten at this hospital./ I think all   
29 of the critically injured should be here. There are other injured   
30 who were taken to Ten Shu Kin Hospital and also to, eh, Queen   
31 Elizabeth Hospital. Eh, that, that rounds out the total number of   
32 eighty-six. (report continues)

The reporter who was at the scene in a hospital at first took himself to be simply speaking over the telephone to the studio. Once he discovers that he is, in fact, speaking "live," he adjusts his footing from that of a tired, relatively uninformed field reporter, speaking person-to-person and off the record, to an attentive, professional reporter who is on the job. This change in footing is a change in the person that the reporter, Francis Moriarty, is presenting to the public.

The consequences of this concept of footing for our studies of identity in intercultural discourse, as well as for the problem of plagiarism, are shown in two places. In the first place, animator, author, and principal are aspects of the production of utterances which may be separated from each other; and moreover, any of these multiple roles and framings may be stepped out of temporarily - or, in this case, for the duration of the radio broadcast - in the normal processes of conducting discourses.

The reporter first animates one self: a private, tired self. He then animates a second, public news-reporter self. As a private self, he seems willing to accept principalship for the information he is giving. Nevertheless, the public self he animates accepts principalship for his role as a reporter, but delegates principalship for the facts he is presenting. That is to say, his position in regard to his person shifts along a different cline from his position in regard to the facts.

That, then, is the first problem: Determining just who is to be taken as speaking (or writing) at any particular moment in a discourse is normally, not exceptionally, problematic.

The second problem that footing introduces is that shifts in footing, as well as in production format, are often signaled in linguistically subtle ways - by shifts in intonation, timing, rhythm, lexical choice, grammatical choice, or any of the other choices by which users of the language can distinguish codes or registers. Learners of a language or second language users are often less than fully competent in signaling such differences, or in reading the signals used by others. It is often a taxing job to try to make such subtle distinctions;

as a consequence, it is often difficult to make firm determination of just how these roles and framings are being presented in ordinary discourse.

# Enactment

The shift in footing I have used as an example may also be used to introduce what I mean by enactment. It might be argued that, rather than a change of footing - which Goffman took as a rather temporary shift of stance, to which one ultimately returns - it might be better to say that the reporter, Francis Moriarty, began by failing to enact the role of radio news reporter; but upon being reminded that he is on the air, he steps up to enact the role.

In giving a lecture, I may enact the role of public lecturer, however successfully or unsuccessfully I may do so. But when the microphone begins to malfunction, I change the footing: I step out of the lecturer role, and take on the role of fixer of microphones. It should be observed, however, that this is not a serious role change. I do not say, Excuse me, I'll be back in an hour, and then depart to pick up my tool kit. The role of fixer of microphones is really an enactment, a very staged affair in which no listener would really expect me to do more than a bit of preliminary fussing with equipment. If I cannot succeed at that level, I am expected to step back into my lecturer role and delegate the microphone to a true expert.

Teachers frequently use such enactments as part of the pedagogical process. For example, Boswood et al. 1993, in a study of audio-taped feedback on student writing, discuss ways in which teachers of English composition take on various roles as means of giving feedback to students on compositions. For example, Boswood (19) writes:

At first my role adoption was unconscious. Then, as I became more aware of the kinds of comments I was making, and as I was forced by the immediacy of the medium to adopt a role other than distant anonymous marker, I began to deliberately manipulate the potential for role adoption. With the proposals, I sometimes adopted a role consistent with the simulation in which the task was situated. One appropriate role was the Head of Research and Development in the simulated company, and a potential assessor of the proposals. An alternative, less specific role was a helpful, senior colleague who was looking over a draft of the proposal and giving advice.

The difference I propose between changes in footing and enactments is based largely on duration. Goffman's notion of footing indicates a rather brief departure from an otherwise established participation framework. The temporary ot even ephemeral nature of footing is emphasized when Goffman argued that his paper on footing "is largely concerned with pointing out that participants over the course of their speaking constantly change their footing, these changes being a persistent feature of natural talk" (italics added, 1981:128). The enactments used by teachers will often span much longer stretches of time. In some cases, teachers enact the role of naive reader or listener for a large part of their interactions with students.

More germane to my subject of plagiarism, students are often, perhaps normally, asked to enact the role of professional scholars in the fields for which they are training. In a study at the University of Alaska (Scollon 1981) 1 found that teachers of university courses primarily used a socialization model of education in their classes. That is, a student in a sociology class would get higher grades to the extent that s/he was able to enact the discourse roles used by sociologists; in other words, sociology students were more successful if they wrote and talked like sociologists than if they used the discourse forms from their own major specializations. English majors were expected to use the language and style of literary criticism, not that of philosophical argument or of behavioral psychology.

# Social role

This process of taking on the voices of others is one to which I return when I discuss the thinking of Mikhail Bakhtin. One could argue that there is a continuum of role displacements, from the temporary changes that Goffman described as footing changes, through what I am calling enactments, to taking on fully developed social roles as a permanent aspect of one's social identity. For example, it would be difficult in some cases to say when a student's writing, as an enactment of a scholarly role for the purposes of passing classes, shifts over to being actual scholarship in the field. In the latter case we would be more likely to consider that the student is actually taking on the social role of a scholar.

Three forms of discourse identity can be gathered together under the heading of social roles. First is Gee's notion (1989, 1990) of a Discourse (with a capital $D$ to distinguish his meaning from the more common one). By a Discourse, Gee means a way of speaking which comes to express the identity of participants who are members of some sub-cultural group in society. He sees such ways of speaking as what he calls an "identity kit" which one can use to express one's identity as a member of the group. Truckers come to talk like truckers (Philipsen 1990), historians like historians, and sociology students like sociology students. In each case, one's social role as laborer, scholar, or student is relatively permanent and displayed through forms of discourse.

A second form of social role has been discussed by Ting-Toomey 1988. She argues that we must distinguish societies organized around individuals vs. societies organized around collectivities. By her argument, the person standing behind the communicative roles we have discussed up to this point would be a very different person in individualistic societies from the person found in similar roles in collectivistic societies.

For the sake of argument here, I propose that this apparent cultural difference may not, in fact, be a cultural difference after all. All societies have both individualistic and collectivistic aspects, and the differences we might note between such societies are not at some fundamental level, but rather at the level of how a society conceives of itself (Markus & Kitayama 1991). One would consider North American society highly individualistic by TingToomey's categorization. At the same time, however, one would have to recognize the inherent interdependence of individuals on each other. By the same token, although Ting-Toomey categorizes Chinese society as collectivistic, one must recognize many individualistic aspects of Chinese society.

I give an example which may help to make this more concrete. In writing this article, and in giving the lecture on which it is based, I write as an individual, however that role may be fragmented among authorship, principalship, and animation. That is, the author named above, Ron Scollon, has drafted this wording in the first instance - although, by the time the public sees this article, other readers will have read it and made suggestions for editing. A single person has referred to himself as I throughout this article, and in doing so has taken responsibility for its positions. I have also animated the first drafts of this article by means of a word processor; but again, by the time the public sees it, the article will have involved other animators.

Even this last paragraph might be seen as a change in footing because of the reference to the author as a person - i.e. as a writer of articles, in addition to being the author of this article. Furthermore, the text makes reference to itself as text. In all this shifty footing, I continue to present myself as an individual writer. Nevertheless, I also write from the position of a social role within a Discourse, in Gee's sense of the term: I write as a placed and ratified member of the Discourse of English teachers at City Polytechnic of Hong Kong. This social role is indicated in my language, in the references I make, and the purposes to which I address my writing. This social role Iends to my individual effort a social and institutional legitimacy.

A social role, in this sense, is one provided to an individual by society: it carries with it both privileges and responsibilities for performance. Clearly, the social roles from which one speaks or writes carry with them aspects of both collectivity and of individuality. I write as a member of a particular professional group, and this lends me the authority of that group. At the same time, I speak for myself; I cannot expect colleagues to accept responsibility for outrages to sense that I commit here.

Finally, there are social roles which are somewhat more commonly understood as such: teacher, parent, son or daughter, student etc. Suzanne ScolIon's research in Taiwan (1989) indicated that patterns of discourse in classrooms are strongly constrained by patterns of discourse assumed between the social roles of teacher and student. These hierarchical patterns of teacher/student discourse in Taiwan contrast with the more horizontal patterns assumed in North American classrooms. The result is that individuals who find themselves in these roles depart from them at their own discursive peril.

From these three viewpoints, social roles provide patterns or templates governing discourse; these may be seen either to facilitate or to inhibit the choices which individual participants can make in interpersonal discourse. As regards the problem of plagiarism, the most significant aspect of these social roles is that they lay templates on social interaction that specify which participant frameworks will be legitimated for discourse within those roles. From this point of view, as we see later, the notion of finding one's own unique voice within such discourses becomes problematic.

# Face

Goffman's ideas about the complex structure of roles taken by participants in communications were strongly influenced by the Chinese concept of "face"; Goffman indicated this by citing Hu 1944. One can trace a lineage from that original article to Goffman's article on footing (1981). Nevertheless, Hu's original insights remain to be explored in the study of intercultural discourse.

Scollon & Scollon 1992, 1994, 1995 suggest that differences in face, as understood in Asia and in the West, account for many problems in AsianWestern intercultural discourse. For present purposes, it is sufficient to point to Hu's distinction between mianzi and lidn, between an "outer" or social face and an "inner" or personal character face, to see that the plurality of roles which Goffman discussed really never addresses this particular distinction. All three aspects of the production format - author, principal, and animator - may be taken on as outer roles without saying anything about one's inner character. The concept of the principal, who stands behind the positions taken and the words presented, might appear to indicate something more inner than the concept of author; however, one can easily present oneself as taking the principal role as a matter of convenience, if not outright deception.

Another Chinese scholar, the psychological anthropologist Francis Hsu, wrote a long series of articles on the problems of comparative studies of face and of the person (some of them are collected as Hsu 1983, 1985). In his analysis, the domain over which the concept of the self applies in China is somewhat larger than in the West. Hsu argues that the Chinese concept of the person, in contrast to the Western concept, includes the intimate social relationships of the family. This idea is further supported by Markus & Kitayama, who argue that a distinction can be shown between what they call independent vs. interdependent self-construal.

As regards problems of identity in discourse, it should be clear that identifying the person who stands behind the multiple roles of authorship will be no simple matter if that person includes intimate members of the family, or other "interdependent selves," in one case but not another. Attributing ownership and responsibility cannot be separated from an analysis of such relationships. From the viewpoint of defining plagiarism, we have here a serious problem in interpreting recurrent phrases such as another person and one's Own.

# Politeness pragmatics

The concept of the self in discourse has been at the center of Brown & Levinson's concept of politeness pragmatics (1978). The central concern of Brown & Levinson was to account for some of the variability among referentially or propositionally equivalent forms. Following on Robin Lakoff's work (1973, 1974) they demonstrated that, in any interaction, participants must take into account two opposing needs of speakers and hearers: that for involvement, and that for independence.' In their theoretical framework, each participant in a discourse must, in each utterance, take into account the relationship(s) between or among participants. They must show neither an excess of independence nor of involvement, since either of these is a threat to the other participants' need for both independence and involvement.

My point is that, when a self takes on any of the multiple positions outlined here, it must present itself to others in the discourse within a rather narrowly confined range of pragmatic options, to avoid posing a risk to its own face or the face of others in the discourse. Brown & Levinson show that, in any discourse, the (always multiple) roles of speaker and hearer can never operate independently of each other. However complexly these roles may be constructed, speakers and hearers are constructed in a mutual give-and-take of politeness pragmatics.

On first analysis it might appear that Brown & Levinson's framework would apply only to the texts produced by authors in Goffman's sense, not to the roles of principals or animators. However, even forms of animation must be taken into consideration in pragmatics, if one is to take such interplays of politeness seriously in the analysis of discourse. A wedding invitation, for example, normally has a rather conventional wording in which the principals play a relatively minor role. What may be most crucial in projecting the pragmatic relationship among participants is in fact the animation - whether formally printed, calligraphed, or scribbled on scrap paper.

The point I wish to draw from politeness pragmatics is simply that the construction of identities in discourse is a process of mutual interactive negotiation. However complex the roles of production and reception may be, they are never independent of each other.

# Metaphors of self and communication

A series of studies, beginning with Reddy 1979, has pointed out the underlying metaphorical nature of language use. Reddy points out, for example, that everyday use of English displays an underlying conceptual metaphor which he calls the "conduit metaphor." In this underlying conceptualization of communication, ideas are treated as objects; language is treated as a form of creating packages or containers for those objects; and communication is seen as a problem of successfully packaging and sending those objects to their receivers. We speak of putting our ideas into words, of giving someone an idea, of words seeming hollow, of the contents of an essay, or of trying to get an idea across to someone. In each of these and the many other cases illustrated by Reddy, the underlying or conceptual metaphorical structure of the container and the conduit govern our conceptualization of the process of communication. This underlying metaphorical structure can be summarized in three statements:

IDEAS ARE OBJECTS.   
LANGUAGE CONSISTS OF CONTAINERS FOR THOSE OBJECTS   
COMMUNICATION IS SENDING THOSE CONTAINERS WITH THEIR OBJECTS TO RECEIVERS.

Lakoff & Johnson 1980 have built on this original insight of Reddy's to show that, however free of surface metaphor our communications may seem, our language operates from an underlying metaphorical structure which reproduces, again and again, a conceptual orientation to the world, to language, and to our communications with each other. Carbaugh 1989, in an analysis of the language of the American television talk show "Donahue," found a systematic conceptual metaphorical base on which a concept of the self and of communication was constructed. Suzanne Scollon 1993 rephrases Carbaugh's analysis as implying two major metaphors of self and of communication: the self as an abstract concept, and the self as a colonized nation. The first of these metaphorical structures is much like the conduit metaphor in considering the self to be an idea (43).

THE SELF IS AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT.   
THE PERSON IS A CONTAINER (FOR THE SELF).

As in the conduit metaphor for language, the "self as an idea" is taken to be an object, and the person is taken to be its container. Carbaugh 1989 cites examples which illustrate this metaphorical conception of the self.

I'm concerned about your identity as a human being, as a person, and as an individual, and as a woman. (93: quoted from Bellah et al. 1985:159)   
I thought it was a lifelong process in search of myself. (81)   
Now that I have a part-time job I feel much more secure within myself. (79)   
I am relatively self-contained. (78)   
I have got my self together. (78)   
I am trying to put the pieces back together again. (78)   
The person inside me. (79)

These and many other examples cited by Carbaugh, and by Suzanne Scollon 1993, reflect a concept of the self as something "inside" the person, something which might easily be lost or not found, and something thought of as different from and separable from the person. In one case, a writer has even felt it necessary to coin a new word for this highly abstract internal self. This writer, Nancy Nordhoff, uses the word writerself to describe the self she felt had been fostered in a woman's writing retreat center in the Seattle area called Hedgebrook. "Experiencing Hedgebrook may be dangerous to our life as we knew it before Hedgebrook. Time - unstructured, unplanned, but hanging heavy because we always say, If I only had the time ...' - time we now have! Time to devote to me, to my work, to my writerself" (Nordhoff 1993:3).

In talking about the relationships between this self and others, as that relationship is played out in communication, the metaphor shifts somewhat paradoxically to the colonized nation. This underlying metaphor could be phrased as follows:

THE SELF IS A COLONY.   
THE COLONIZERS OF THE SELF ARE BIOLOGY AND SOCIETY.   
INDEPENDENCE IS ACHIEVED THROUGH COMMUNICATION.

In this metaphorical structure, the self is taken to be oppressed by, exploited by, or imprisoned by two main colonizing enemies, the biological person and what are called "traditional social roles"; and freedom is achieved through "self-expression." Thus Carbaugh gives examples such as these:

I think we are the victims, the women, the female is the victim of society who has programmed

us to accept this role. (91) I don't care what it is, as soon as the majority has the power, it is dangerous. (31) The emphasis from this viewpoint is on the freedom of the individual self from any form of oppression, even the self-induced oppression of having to carry out what one has planned for oneself.

Perhaps, for my purposes, the most important insight of Carbaugh's work is that this metaphorical system of communication involves a compulsion to communicate. Suzanne Scollon (1993:45) has rephrased Carbaugh's rules on communication as follows:

(a) The colonized self must be freed through communication, by express  
ing unique opinions independent of the biological person or society. Thus,   
statements of personal opinion that are idiosyncratic and anti-social are the   
best demonstrations of the freedom of the colonized self. (b) Listeners must assist in the liberation of the colonized self. Otherwise,   
they are contributing to the colonization of the self. (c) Therefore, listeners must be non-judgemental collaborators in the pro  
cess of freeing the self. (d) All obstacles to the first three rules must be overcome. That is, state  
ments about norms having to do with tradition, society, culture, social role,

and even biological characteristics such as gender contribute to the colonization of the self.

It should be clear that the metaphorical structure underlying our day-today conceptualization of communication - as analyzed by Reddy, by Lakoff & Johnson, and by Carbaugh - is very much the same as the set of common assumptions given by Goffman 1981. Both in Western communication theory and in our ordinary language about communication, there are underlying assumptions that communications originate in the deeply internal minds of individuals; that these individuals and their ideas are contained within persons; that language objectifies both ideas and selves through self-expression; and that listening, i.e. assisting in this self-expression, is the full immediate concern of the listener.

The studies of the conceptual metaphors underlying contemporary English usage, at least in North America, have begun to develop into a relatively extended literature on the subject; however, little has been written about the metaphorical bases of other languages or other speech communities. Suzanne Scollon 1993 has undertaken a preliminary study of the metaphorical base of Cantonese, and found it to differ in many ways from the underlying assumptions found for English by Reddy, Lakoff & Johnson, and Carbaugh. She outlines that metaphorical structure as follows:

COMMUNICATION IS THE HUMAN BODY IN ACTION. (50)   
SPEECH IS ANALOGIZED AS BODILY SECRETIONS. (51)   
TRUTH IS FOUND IN THE HEART AND GUT. (52)   
WHEN HEART AND MOUTH AGREE, THERE IS TRUTH; WHEN THEY DISAGREE, THERE IS FALSEHOOD. (53)   
IT IS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND A PERSON'S INTENTIONS, BUT DIRECT UNDERSTANDING CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH EMPATHY. (54)   
VOLUBILITY IS A PROBLEM; THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. (55)

In this Cantonese view of the self and of communication, the human body is the primary metaphor for the self. This body, however, is thought of as defined primarily through its connections with other humans, not as an independent entity. Speech and language are analogized as bodily secretions. In general it is felt that it is very difficult to understand a person's intentions through the activities of language. However, our common experience as humans gives us belief in the power of direct, non-linguistic intuition of the truth of the realities and experiences of others. In this metaphorical system, taciturnity is rarely seen as a problem; but volubility, because speech or language is seen as questionable, is taken to be a problem.

At least three problems must be faced in order for us to understand intercultural discourse involving speakers of English and of Cantonese. First, the self who "speaks" or "writes" is conceived of very differently. Second, communication itself is conceived of as a different kind of human process. Third, a different value is placed on language as an instrument of communication.

The person who speaks or writes in discourse is conceptualized differently in these two societies. The "self"' is metaphorized in contemporary North American discourse as an abstract, even Platonic entity. Its biological and social placement are considered to be problems or corruptions of a deeper, higher, or somehow more abstract reality. There is an impetus in discourse to show that one is seeking independence from this physically and socially embedded reality; thus negative valence is associated with gender, age, race, health status, or any other purely physical circumstances of the biological placement of the self.

Similarly, the social placements in which one finds oneself - whether by birth, or even by one's free choice - are seen as potentially negative and restrictive limits on the expression of the perpetual process of de-colonization. One must show oneself to be constantly seeking ever greater degrees of freedom from the oppression and exploitation of social roles.

In contrast to this, the "self" is metaphorized in contemporary Cantonese discourse as a solidly and humanly placed biological organism. One's status as a biological person - complete with a specific age, race, gender, body weight, physical condition, and mental acuity - is taken as a positive, or at least an inevitable, aspect of one's self-definition. Similarly, one's placement in society as a son or daughter, as husband or wife, and as teacher or student is a self-defining connection to other members of society. They are all aspects which give comfortable placement and definition to the self in discourse, not limits and restrictions to be constantly evaded.

Further, in these contrasting metaphorical systems, communication itself is conceived of as a different kind of human process. In the North American metaphorical system, communication is seen as essential to the process of self-definition. By contrast, in the Cantonese metaphorical system, the self is defined quite independently of communication; the focus is not on originality of expression, but rather on ratification of pre-existing self and social placements (Scollon & Scollon 1992).

This leads to the third consequence of these differing metaphorical structures: that a different value is placed on language as an instrument of communication. In the Cantonese system, language is not taken to have such a strongly constitutive role as in the North American system. In the Cantonese metaphorical system, one is who one is, whether or not one expresses it freely, openly, and frequently to others. In the North American system, by contrast, there is a compulsion constantly to re-create the self (and to assist others in their task of self-creation) through communication, especially through talk.

# Innatist/social concepts of knowledge

As Goffman has pointed out (1981:129), the more or less standard contemporary view of communication is based on the assumption that at any particular moment "one will be speaking his own thoughts on a matter and expressing his own feelings." Definitions of plagiarism that are commonly given are also based on the idea that a person, the rightful owner, has expressed his/her own thoughts or feelings, and that another has wrongly appropriated them for some other use. Underlying both of these views is a concept of knowledge and communication which takes ideas, as well as their wordings, as capable of being originally crafted by individuals.

It is interesting here to look at John Locke's position; he is famous for the assertion that the mind starts out as a tabula rasa, a blank slate on which nothing is written. What comes to be thought of as a person's mind is produced through experience. Locke's extended argument against any form of innate ideas was advanced in his essay Concerning human understanding (1690), in which he described the human mind as being at first an empty cabinet, devoid of contents or ideas.

The senses at first let in particular ideas, and furnish the yet empty cabinet, and the mind by degrees growing familiar with some of them, they are lodged in the memory, and names got to them .... In this manner the mind comes to be furnished with ideas and language, the materials about which to exercise its discursive faculty. ([1690] 1990:98-99)

The quotation provides the gist of Locke's position, which is that, in fact, nothing is original to the individual mind. Everything in it comes from outside, from experience in the world. That is his position on the originality of ideas.

On the question of language, Locke is equally unimpressed by claims of individual originality.

Men having been accustomed from their cradles to learn words which are easily got and retained, before they knew or had framed the complex ideas to which they were annexed, or which were to be found in the things they were thought to stand for, they usually continue to do so all their lives; and without taking the pains necessary to settle in their minds determined ideas, they use their words for such unsteady and confused notions as they have, contenting themselves with the same words other people use .... Men take the words they find in use amongst their neighbors; and that they may not seem ignorant what they stand for, use them confidently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning; whereby, besides as in such discourses they seldom are in the right, so they are as seldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong. ([1690] 1990:292)

The obvious fact that we all, in fact, speak a language learned from others has been taken by a number of philosophers since Locke to indicate the falsehood of the taken-for-granted position of original self-expression. Cazden (1994) outlines the dilemma that we all face in struggling to express ourselves in new Discourses, especially where those Discourses are ideologically in opposition to those of groups of which we are members. A Yup'ik Alaskan woman and an African-American man, learning to write academic prose at Harvard, are two examples she gives of the conflict in Discourses which arise in such circumstances. In this study, Cazden makes reference to the Soviet critic Bakhtin.' Not unlike Locke, Bakhtin argued that our language - our "voice,"' to use his term - is not our own; it is the voice of our society.

We know our native language - its lexical composition and grammatical structure - not from dictionaries and grammars but from concrete utterances which we hear and which we ourselves reproduce in live speech communication with people around us. We assimilate forms of language only in forms of utterances ... [They] enter our experience and consciousness together. ([1952] 1986:95)

Cazden also quotes Bakhtin where, in another place, he pointed out that there is never any voiceless communication. Any individuality or originality we may achieve comes from a long struggle with our language, and with the voices we have taken over from others.

Language is not a neutral medium that passes freely and easily into the private property of the speaker's intentions; it is populated - overpopulated - with the intentions of others. Expropriating it, forcing it to submit to one's own intentions and accents, is a difficult and complicated process. ([1934-35] 1981:294)

Or, as he put it a little later:

One's own discourse and one's own voice, although born of another or dynamically stimulated by another, will sooner or later begin to liberate themselves from the authority of another's discourse. This process is made more complex by the fact that a variety of alien voices enter into the struggle for influence within an individual's consciousness (just as they struggle with one another in surrounding social reality). (1934-35] 1981:348)

Locke's position, some 225 years before Bakhtin, was advanced within the context of his arguments on behalf of the newly developing philosophy of empiricism. Although he stated that our knowledge and our experience as well as our language come from outside, it is clear (if we consider Locke's work overall) that he considered this domination by experience as something to be overcome through philosophical argument. In the best of cases, men come to articulate original thoughts, though the language in which they are phrased comes from society. By comparison, Bakhtin's position seems to be that originality or authenticity of voice arises from a necessary and desirable struggle with the "alien" voices presented to one by society. In this he was, I argue, not unlike Locke in believing that originality of expression is ultimately possible. Cazden's position is motivated by problems of teaching in general, and of teaching English academic literate discourse in particular, especially where the students are not already members of the groups socially associated with that discourse. She focuses on the struggle for/of identity in the voicing of students of academic literacy.

What is shared by Locke, Bakhtin, and Cazden is the understanding that achieving originality of voice, if it is possible at all, is possible only as a struggle to achieve that voice in an internal discourse of voices borrowed from society. In this viewpoint, the self underlying our discourses is only occasionally able to achieve anything like originality or autonomy of voice.

# THE TRADITIONAL VIEW AS IDEOLOGY

I can now summarize the eight reasons I believe it is problematic to take at face value standard definitions either of communication itself, or of the person(s) involved in communication:

(a) Production format: Speaker (and writer) roles must be more finely analyzed as author, principal, and animator. None of these can be expected to line up in a one-to-one and unique relationship with any biological person. (b) Footing: Stepping out of one's stance is a common, not an exceptional, occurrence. (c) Enactment: We frequently take on temporarily enacted roles of a greater permanence than changes in footing, but of lesser permanence than social roles: teachers read papers as naive readers, parents pretend they do not know what their children mean, students are expected to write in the style of professional scholars. (d) Social role: We may be simultaneously a parent, a child, a teacher, a musician, a man or woman. We borrow authority for speaking or writing from our social positions; we become who we are by how we speak. (e) Face: Our selves have both internal (character) and external (social) faces; any of the communicative roles can be played out in either inner or outer configurations. (f) Politeness pragmatics: The selves we communicate in discourse are jointly constructed, maintained, and legitimated among participants. Negatively stated, we do not unilaterally construct or present our selves in discourse. (g) Metaphors of self and communication: The language we use to talk about communication produces a metaphorical blindness to other conceptualizations, and to these deeply multiple realities. (h) Innatist/social concepts of knowledge: Our language comes borrowed complete with the voices of our society. Originality is only achieved with difficulty.

The first conclusion I draw from this review of concepts is that it is very difficult to find contexts in which the simple paradigm of speaker or writer is actually manifested in communication. The self which is constructed in discourse is a highly pluralistic and interactionally contingent conceptual entity, even where intercultural discourse is not considered. Thus I believe that this review supports calling into question the usefuIness of terms like "speaker, hearer, writer, reader." This review suggests that the use of such commonsense terms actually obstructs our understanding of intercultural discourse.

# RE-EXAMINING PLAGIARISM

By a rather circuitous pathway, I have arrived at a point where I can face up to the problem of plagiarism with which I began. I started with a dictionary definition which put it that plagiarism was to "take and use (the thoughts, writings, inventions, etc. of another person) as one's own" (Allen 1990:909). We might be able to retain here, without much question, the meanings of take and use; but we would have to recognize the implicit conduit metaphor involved. Thoughts are being understood as objects, which can be first possessed, then taken and used. We now see that thoughts, writings, person, and one all pose nearly insurmountable problems if we treat them seriously from the viewpoint of the multiple discourse considerations I have raised. A closer analysis of the concept of plagiarism shows that, in fact, it disguises these complexities by masking them in the idea that animators, authors, and principals speak and write as unified biological persons who always represent themselves in a straightforward and sincere way, as fully legitimated social actors within authorized roles. In other words, the concept of plagiarism is a shorthand compilation of a rather hefty set of assumptions about who should or should not have the right to use discourse to create individual, autonomous voices in a society. In yet other words, the concept of plagiarism is fully embedded within a social, political, and cultural matrix that cannot be meaningfully separated from its interpretation.

What underlies the concept of plagiarism is that communication must be thought of as originating in the private thoughts and private linguistic formulations of what Moerman calls the "potent private self" or the "Romantic and Bourgeois actor" (1988:67). This self is thought of as undertaking private productive activity in the creation of objects for which value must be returned by society, if these objects are to be used by any other than the authorized creator of these objects. At the very least, no other individual may profit from this potent private self's activities.

The concept of plagiarism is not, of course, separable from the concept of copyright. While we tend to think now that the purpose of copyright is to protect the creative work of an author, this contemporary concept underwent a period of considerable evolution, starting in the first concerns with ownership of discourses in the 16th century. The concept of copyright in English and hence American law originally arose, according to Patterson 1968, not as a means of protecting the rights of authors, but through a more complex restructuring of the concept of discourse as a form of property: "Copyright was not a product of the commonlaw. It was a product of censorship, guild monopoly, trade-regulation statutes, and misunderstanding" (1968:19).

Patterson's history of the development of copyright begins with the spread of printing. By the 16th century, the British government began to exert control over what might be printed (1559, Fifty-first Injunction, and 1566, The Star Chamber Decree, both under Elizabeth I). The Stationers' Company, established on May 4, 1557, organized into a single company printers, binders, and sellers, but not authors. While other independent printers still continued to operate, only the Stationers' Company was granted the rights to the most profitable books. This company achieved what was, in fact, a nearmonopoly over publishing in England. To be sure, ownership of the works themselves were retained by the authors, and a stationer could only copy (i.e. animate) works; however, the author had no means of publishing anything written. In effect, the author's ownership was of no commercial value.

Copyright, then, first developed within this context of the commercial use of discourses by publishers - not as a concern with plagiarism, if by that we focus primarily on the ownership of discourses by authors. The word plagiarism first came into use in 1701, according to Patterson, in the records of the Stationers' Company. The purpose of the concept was to limit competition among members of the Company, not to protect the commercial rights of authors. It was not until the Statute of Anne (1709) that authors were given copyright; and because publishers retained former rights for 21 years following that date, it was 1731 before the first copyrights to authors were granted.

No less a writer than John Milton found himself bound into a contract designed to protect his publisher, more than his own creativity. Patterson (1968:74) quotes the contact for Paradise lost as follows:

And the said John Milton ... doth covenant with the said $\mathsf { S a m } ^ { \parallel }$ . Symons, ... that hee ... shall at all tymes hereafter have, hold, and enjoy the same, and all Impressions thereof accordingly, without lett or hinderance of him, the said John Milton, ... And that the said Jo. Milton, ... shall not print or cause to be printed, or sell, dispose, or publish, the said Booke or Manuscript, or any other Booke or Manuscript of the same tenor or subject, without the consent of the said Sam". Symons ...

The common-sense view of texts as commercial products, and of the person of the author as the manufacturer of those texts - as well as the view of communication which underlies the concept of plagiarism -- represent the economic/ideological system which arose in Europe at the time of the Enlightenment. The forms of discourse associated with this system have been called "essayist" discourse (Scollon & Scollon 1981). Scollon & Scollon 1995 argue that it might be more accurate to refer to this system as the Utilitarian Discourse System. This ideological system places a high value on individual autonomy, rationality - and, in discourse, on what Lanham 1983 has called the C-B-S ("clarity, brevity, sincerity") style. Along with these go a now familiar group of characteristics, often inaccurately attributed to literacy, of analysis, originality, decontextualization, and objectivity.6

As this value system has come to prominence through economic and political internationalization, it has also promoted its own preferred forms of discourse. The common-sense expressions of the nature of the self and of communication can be taken not as objective descriptions of discourse practices, but as ideological assertions of values of this system of discourse, beginning with Locke 1690, Bentham 1776, Kant 1788, and Mill 1836, and continuing down through the television talk discourse of the "Donahue" show as recorded by Carbaugh 1989.

I argue that it is difficult if not impossible to maintain that any clear understanding is ever possible of just who might stand in the role of the private authorial self. In the absence of such clarity, I believe we can see the Utilitarian Discourse System as granting such privilege not by means of simple linguistic expression, but through an historically established system for the distribution of social power and privilege.

# DURAnTI'S DILEMMA

The tone of the preceding paragraph comes easily enough within the framework of an article like this one. I readily admit to being culturally and economically embedded within the international Utilitarian Discourse System; but I believe it is nevertheless my responsibility to understand the roots of that discourse system, and to avoid the easy acceptance of an ideology which is at odds with much of what I would say, as a scholar, that I know about the nature of discourse. Nevertheless, what remains is the question asked me by virtually everyone who has read drafts of this article, and to whom I have lectured on the topic: What would I do if someone plagiarized my work?

The problem has been posed both elegantly and with much human grace by Duranti 1993, who found that having his own work plagiarized struck him with a human force which was unexpected in one who had taken a scholarly stance of relativistic ideological critique toward problems of plagiarism. The dilemma is that, while in general we would like to call into question our own ideological underpinnings, in particular we do not like people to steal our work.

The first draft of this article was, in fact, a response to the plagiarism of

# RON SCOLLON

work done by me and Suzanne Scollon. In working through multiple drafts, the article has steadily spiraled upward away from the concrete levels at which it began, until now what remains are the theoretical issues at stake - with little, I hope, of the sense of rancor which permeated the earlier versions. This article is the answer to the question of what I would do if my work were plagiarized: I would assume that the scholars in question have done so from within a conceptual frame which I do not yet fully understand. I intend to say nothing further about the case in point; however, my own experience has convinced me that my personal sense of anger has contributed little to understanding the ideological and conceptual issues at stake. At the same time I believe that the simple assertion of legal rights would only further legitimate an ideological system which I feel intellectually motivated to challenge. This article is written with the hope that we can begin to open up, as a subject for scholarly and not just personal or legal discussion, the culturally and ideologically complex question of plagiarism.

# NOTES

I There is a further question of how long a term can be used before it should be considered part of the public domain, and no longer attributable to the scholar who has coined the term. I have taken up this question in another article (Scollon 1994), with regard to the term "communicative competence," first coined by Hymes (1972 is one common attribution) but widely used now without attribution.

2 These definitions themselves seem acutely aware of how closely they are following upon the definitions given in other sources which are normally not referenced.

3 In this article I separate the arguments of Goffman from those of Mikhail Bakhtin. It is interesting to recall that Goffman 1974 cited an indebtedness to Boris Uspensky's ideas concerning point of view in discourse (cf. Uspensky 1973). Uspensky, in turn, frequently references his indebtedness to the ideas of Bakhtin for his ideas on multiple voices in discourse. Thus, indirectly at least, it seems clear that Goffman's work in this area is more than accidentally consonant with Bakhtin's, which I reference later.

4 Brown & Levinson use the terms "positive and negative politeness." The terms "involvement" and "independence" are now, perhaps, more widely used as the work of Tannen 1986, 1989, 1990 has extended and reframed Lakoff's original three-part system.

5 Cazden uses the term "Soviet" in making reference to the school of psychologists and philosophers which would include Bakhtin, Vygotsky, Voloshinov, Medvedev. Others might use the term "Marxist," though that term would be far too broad to encompass just this particular group of thinkers. Others might want to use "Vygotskyan" if the reference were intended to emphasize psychology, or "Bakhtinian" if literary criticism were the focus.

6 Gee 1989, 1990 offers insightful critiques of the relationships between the attributes often claimed for literacy and the social-discursive systems which he refers to as Discourses.
