# ABSTRACT

Handling Editor: Guangwei Hu

In response to mixed perceptions about the digital multimodal composing (DMC) approach to conceptualizing and teaching second language (L2) writing, the purpose of the current study is to compare students' linguistic performance on traditional monomodal writing and DMC tasks, as well as writing development over time under traditional and DMC instructional conditions. A total of 41 Korean university English as a foreign language (EFL) students were randomly assigned to two instructional groups: traditional writing and DMC. Over one semester, both the DMC and the traditional writing groups completed TOEFL-style independent writing pretests and posttests, and depending on their intervention condition, they completed either monomodal writing or DMC tasks for two elemental genres (causal analysis and argumentation). For the first research question, focused on output of traditional writing and DMC tasks, the two groups' language use on each of the two assigned genres (causal analysis and argumentation) was analyzed separately, and their linguistic performance was compared using independent t-tests. For the second research question, the pretest and posttest essays were scored using an analytic rubric focused on content, organization and language, and the two groups' timed writing performance was compared using linear mixed effect models. The findings indicated that students produced longer texts for DMC tasks, and that there were significant gains in writing development over time for both DMC and traditional writing instructed groups. The DMC-integrated group, however, showed greater gains. Pedagogical implications for the use of DMC in L2 writing instruction are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Decades ago The New London Group (1996) argued for the need to teach, as well as view as leaner resources, multiliteracies - thal is, not only multiple inguistic codes but also extra-inguistic mods use in and t of school. Similarly, Kes and J (2003; Jewit. 2011; Kress, 2010) have long argued for the need to teach design, the use of multiple semiotic resources, which together can be more powerfully communicative than any ingle mode alone. More recently, Haner (2019) has pointed out that \*ffective participation in a globalized society now depends on mastery of the practices asociated with ..digital communication tools (p. 902). A life lived primarily online has particularly since the pandemic, become our new normal, as we work and meet on screens and find ourselves, as educators, enlisting an array of semiotic resources to engage and instruct our online students (Folse, 2020). Even with resumption of more face-to-face instruction, much of our communication with students will likely continue to be supported by digital semioticll-enhanced content and interaction (Russll & Murphy-Judy, 2021). One outcome of our recent pandemic-propelled mass migration online has been heightened awarenessof the digital divide (Oskoz & Smith, 2020), a phenomenon that may be seen as at least two different but related divides. Perhaps most conspicuous is the digital acces divide, seriously disadvantaging those whose only digital acess, hence digital experience, may be a smart phone, with or without Wi-Fi (Bancroft, 2016; Oskoz & Smith, 2020), which can cause a "participation gap" with \*unequal accessto opportunities" (Jenkins, 2009, p. xii; se also Darvin, 2018). Less immediately conspicuous is what can be described as a digital literacies divide. Functional digital literacy, with a digital too skillset can be viewed as neessry but not sufficient for academic (r critical) dital literac, i.., citical and crtive gagement indital social practices (for a variety of perspectives on the later see Bancroft, 2016;Belcher, 2017; Haner, 2019; Jiang, 2023; Jiang & Gu, 2022; Weninger, 2022). As various permutations and interactions of these divides become harder to ignore, so too does the urgency language and literacy educators may feel to find ways to bridge these divides.

The move toward digital pedagogies in language and literacy class, in fact, egan a while ago, as evidenced by entire journals dedicated to reporting research on such efforts (CALico Jounal, Computers and Composition, Computers and Language Teaching, and Language Learming and Technology) and the growing number of studies alerting us to the benefits of teaching digital multimodal literacies, such as increased language learner autonomy and motivation (e.g, Jiang & Luk, 2016; Lam, 2000). Yet digital-hesitancy among language and literacy instructors has ingered (see Belcher, 2017; Casanave, 2017; Hafner, 2019; Zhang, Akoto, & Li 2021). Such reluctance is understandable given the challenges instructors face keeping up with developments in digital technologies, finding room for anything extra in already-crowded curricula, and overcoming the resistance of learners themselves, who may belie that the only realacademic writing is traditionalessay writing (Tan & Matsuda, 2020). Even those instructors committed to adding digital multimodality to ther agenda may do so with a \*weak" versin in mind, viewing it as a"crutch or temporary scaffld' (p. 33) for language development (Grapin, 2019). Grouling and Grutsch McKinney (2016) have noted too the now fairly common practice in college-level writing clases of assgning one digital multimodal project as an expedient \*checking off of a program's new multi. modality requirement (p. 8). Reluctance to more fully commit to digital multimodality (beyond inclusion of asingle multimodal project), or to a writing-as-design agenda, is also understandable absent compelling empirical evidence that digital multimodal tasks willfaciltate students navigation of the ften-step rajectory f lening to writ aadmicall in a languag other than thir first. As Lim (2020) and others (Zhang et al., 2021) have pointed out, despite the burgeoning body of literature on the affordances of digital literacie, th is sill relatively lil empiricl rch on how or if leers actuall enefit from dital poects in tes of their development a second language-learning writers. Itis the goal f our study tohelp address this reearch gap by exploring the impact of use of more than one digital multimodal composing (DMC) task in more than one genre on the linguistic performance and writing development of learners in an L2 writing course in an English as a foreign language (EFL), or non-English-dominant, stting, where both learning to write (in an L2) and writing to learn (the target language) (Manchon, 2011) are critical goals.

# 2. Literature review

In what follows, we provide a brief review of the case for and the case against integration of digital multimodal composing in L2 writing classes. In doing so, our goali not to suggest that there is a simple inary of supporters and non-supporters of DMC use, but to highlight many of the reasons that have been given for incorporating or questioning the pedagogical use of DMC. After this overview, we zoom in on empirical studies that address isues raised by those on the continum from DMC advocacy to wariness or more specificall, isues related to the linguistic and academic literacy (particularl, writing) development of learners engaged in multimodal composing in a second language.

# 2.1. The case for DMC

The case for inclusion of multimodal composing in L2 writing pedagogy stresses the many diffrent affordances provided by digital multimodal composing. Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons, especially now, for including DMC in the L2 writing curriculum is, as previously mentioned, that it enables us to prepare students to engage in an increasingly digitlly-mediated world Haner, 2015, 2019; Hyland, 2019), where they need to learn to function not only as students but as workers and global and local community members. n Lim's (2020; seeaso Lim & Polio, 2020) study of DMC asignments across the curriculum at one US university, she found DMC assignments to be common in courses from the humanities to engineering. A number of (geneally small-scale) studies, as we shal soon see have found that including DMC assgnments i L2 academic literacy claes appears to equip learners with the strengths they will need when they face such assignments as Lim describes across the disciplines.

Studies reporting on the affordance f learning to negotiate DMC in the context of L2 academic literacy class suggest a surprisingly wide range of benefits. As novice L2 writers, students learning to marshal the support of multiple semiotic resources may strengthen their authorial voice, agency and sense of identity (Cimasko & Shin, 2017; Jiang, Yang, & Yu, 2020). The experiences of remediating an assignment, whether moving from monomodal to multimodal task or the reverse (Bloch, 2021a; Hafner & Millr, 2011; Kang, 2022), may enhance awarenes of audience and purpose, as wl as foster the rhetorical lexbility needed for composing across the curriculum (Tan & Matsuda, 2020). Audience awareness is especially heightened by the ability to address and intract with au. diences beyond teachers and classmates (Hafner, 2014). As many DMC tasks are collaboratie, per support in these tasks can boost confidence and sef-fficacy (Jiang et al., 2020). Whether working collaboratively or solo, however, DMC tasks can encourage attention to content development (Bloch, 2021b; Hafner & Miller, 2011; Smith, Amgott, & Malova, 2022) and curated use of Internt sources (Lim, 2020) along with multipl semiotic resources. Searching for and composing with visual images,in particular, may bost idea generation and, i turn, strengthen rhetorical strategies for argument construction (Bloch, 2021b), one of the most challenging foundational written genres for novice academic writers (Hirvela & Belcher, 2021; Hirvela, 2017).

As language learners, L2 writers may find in DMC tasks the means and motivation to develop learner autonomy, as they have the opportunity, especially with out-of-clas assgnments, to rehearse, notice, and redo parts of their projects until they themselves are satisfied with how they willbe perceived by authentic audiences (Hafner & Miler, 2011). Both motivation (Henry, 2019) and in estment (Jiang et al., 2020) may benefit from the readily shared observable outcomes of DMC tasks. With such easily-observed results of their effrt attitudes toward language learning may become markedly more positive (Chong & Reinders, 2020; Jiang et al., 2020).

# 2.2. The case against DMC

Casanave's (2017) balanced look at critiques of DMC in the writing pedagogy context offers reasons to \*refrain from .. uncritical enthusiasm' (p. 84) for digital technology in the writing classrom, whether L2 or L1. What impact, Casanave encourages us to consider, will our "growing love affair with digital litercies' (p. 81), especill immersion in social networking, often in chosen affinity spaces with like-minded others (Jones & Hafner, 2021), have on serious, sustained attention to a line f thought or argument, the type of atention that monomodal writing (and reading) can facilitate (for a counter-argument to this "deficit view" see Lea & Jones, 2011, cited in Casanave, 2017, p. 81, and on DMC tasks as means of promoting serious thought, including social investigation and problem solving, see Jiang, 2021, 2023; Jiang & Gu, 2022). For L2 writers, the concens are further complicated, f not heightened, given the need to learn language and writing in that language concurrntly. Polio 2019) has succnctly articulated this concern, noting that attention to language, already attenuated in writing clases by attention to other topic, such as composing strategies, may be further diminished by focus on DMC. In EFL sttings, where writing to learn language may take priority over learning to write in an L2), the possibility of lessened atention to language due to the incusion of other semiotic resources could pose a serious liability for learners, as Qu (2017) observed in an opinion piece on DMC.In her own commentary on DMC, Manchon (2017) has pointed out that such decreased attntion to language could indeed lessen the likelihood of second language acquisition (but se Hafner and Miller [2011; Hafner, 2014] on enhanced attention to language among DMC users).

Students themselves may have similar misgivings about DMC as a means of promoting their L2 writing and language learning. Some case study students have reported viewing DMC project as inefficient and ineffective means of improving their written language (Jiang, 2018). Student doubts about the value of DMC project can be particularly challenging for novice writing teachers o refute, as Tan and Matsuda (2020) found in a culturall diverse US university writing program (on the need to resist \*the dichotomous mindset that isolates traditional writing and DMc,' see Jiang, 2023, p. 15).

# 2.3. Empirical investigations focused on DMC and L2 writing development

As noted earlier, Lim (2020) and others have pointed out the relative dearth of empirical research, especiall large-scale studies focused on multimodality and writing performance. So far thereis also no empirical evidence, Lim has observed, toconfirm that a focus on multimodality impedes language learning, as assumed by Qu (2017) and others. Zhang et al. (2021) have aso noted that, although there has been an upsurge in the umber of empirical DMC studies in the past dade, limited atention has so far been paid to linguistic performance, and "experimental research has just started to emerge in this [DMC research] domain'" (p. 20).

Among those studies that have addressed the issue of attention to language among DMC users in L2 clases, several have looked specifically at the extent to which (or whether) students are distracted by other semiotic resources at the expense of attention to language. Kim and Kang (2020) found in their study of 60 adolescent Korean learners of English that they paid more attention to language than to other semiotic resources when working on their DMC projects, and the majority viewed the project as an opportunity to improve their English. Lim (2020), to0 in a study of 31 EFL writers at a Korean universt, found that the students paid more attention to language than to visual images in the DMC composing process especially to words for scripts and evaluation of Internet resources and their own text development. Lim's findings underscore the \*importance of writers good command of language for highly rated multimodal writing performance (p. 120). The fact that Lim's participants were engaged in a writing-for-speaking task (Rubin & Kang, 2008), with writing on slide notes serving to scaffold spoken narrative, may have increased motivation to attend to language use in their detailed [wrtten] plan for reheared speech (oral narrative of slides) (p. 120) Lim and Polio (2019) have noted that alphabetic texts ofte scaffld multimodal tasks, serving as scripts fr speaking, a relationship that Rubin and Kang view as not at all uncommon, given that speaking ofen serves as the teleological end or outcome of writing (p. 21). Lim (2020) has conjectured that when students give language short shrif in DMC proceses, it may well be because of limited time for the proect, suggesting that fewer time constraints may promote attention to language in such tasks.

Skeptics of the value DMC in L2 writing classes may nevertheles wonder: So, even if language may be attended to more often in DMC projects than previously thought, how does attention to language use in a DMC task compare to that given to language in traditional essay writing tasks, in which writing isthe sole mode and text the sole medium? In a within-subjects study of 18 Korean EFL undergraduate writers, Kim and Belcher (2020) found that the same students produced more syntactically complex language when relying solely on written text than in thir scripted language use (scripted speaking) for a DMC task, but there was no significant difference in the accuracy of language use in the writen essayist texts and scripted DMC narratives. These equally accurate products suggest that attention to language in the DMC task was not les than that given to accuracy in traditional writing.

Another lingering question in the minds of L2 writing pedagogists may be: But what happens to L2 writing growth if students focus solely on digital multimodal composing over consecutive wees? Would exclusive focus on DMC disadvantage such students as developing L2 writers? In what i perhaps one of the most ambitious empirical studies so far on the impact of DMC on written language development, Vandommele, Van den Branden, Van Gorp, and De Maeyer's (2017) study of 84 adolescent learners of Dutch, the researchers looked at the performance of in- and out-of-class DMC users versus that of non-DMC-using language learners. Vandomelle et al. were particularl interested in improvement in traditional essyist writing over time, hence employed a pre/posttest design. What they found was that not only did the writing of the DMC users not exhibit slower growth in development, but on the same postest timed monomodal writing task, the DMC users outperformed non-DMC users, outpacing them most notably in syntactic complexity and written fluency. Vandomelle et al. hypothesize that the multiple semioticresources of the DMC task may have increased the confidence and willingnessto communicate (in writing) of the DMC users. Thus, compared to the DMC users, those not given the opportunity to engage in DMC appeared to be the ones who were relatively disadvantaged as developing L2 writers.

Yet another lingering question among DMC skeptics may be: What happens if a teacher makes a major commitment to DMC use. viewing it as a significant means of learning and incorporating it throughout an entire course? In Dzekoe's (2017) study of 22 ESL writers, with six focal participants, at a US university, every assgnment in a semester-long writing course included computer-based multimodal activities. More specifically, students integrated text and images at the composing stage of tasks, and engaged in oral/aural activities at the revising stage, facilitated, for example, by NaturalReader, a text-to-speech program, which was found to enhance noticing, a vital component in second language acquisition. While Dzekoe did not examine writing development over time using a pre- and posttest deign, he did see evidence of strngthned self-revision abilitie, both rhtoriclly and inguisticall, in the students' written drafts and found significant correlation between revision frequency and text qualit. The participants themselves reported that the multimodal activities helped them discover language and voice to convey ideas that they were sruggling to expres' (p. 73).

# 3. The current study

Encouraged by the findings of the work of Vandomelle et al. and others on the apparently promising impact of DMC on written anguage development, the goal of ths current study has bee to follow up on severa of the implications of prior rearch as well as to explore the validity of citicism of DMC as unhelpful to L2 students as learners of language and writing (e.g., Qu, 2017). More specificall, we have aimed to investigate how engagement with more than one out-of-class DMC task, using two dfferent elemental academic genres (Hyland, 2002; Rose & Martin, 2012; see also Kang, 2022 for a DMC study of two genres but with a knowledge transfer focus), causal analysis and argumentation, may advantage or disadvantage L2 DMC users, compared to non-DMC users, with respect to both linguistic performance and development as writers. The current study was guided by the following two questions.

1. Are there any significant ifferences in amount and quality (complexity and accuracy) of language between traditional monomodal writing and DMC in two genres, causal and argumentative?   
2. Are there any significant differences betwen traditional monomodal writing and DMC groups in their writing development measured using pre and post timed essays?

# 4. Methods

# 4.1. Design of the study

The current study is a quasi-experimental study conducted at a public university in Korea. I compared a traditional paragraph. format writing course curriculum and a DMC-integrated currculum. The study focused on both processes and outcomes of both approaches to teaching L2 writing by analyzing students' within-course ask performance as wellas pretest/postes scores. For both the first and second research questions, the independent variable is a curriculum type (traditional vs. DMC-integrated). The dependent variables of the first question were text length and the linguistic complexity and accuracy measures of the two writing task outcomes with two diffrent elemental genres (causal analysis and argumentation), and the dependent variables of the second question are pretest and posttest timed essay test scores.

# 4.2. Participants and instructional context

A total of 41 undergraduate Korean students : ${ \bf \tilde { n } } = 2 3$ for DMC-integrated and ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 1 8$ for traditional monomodal group) who were enrolled in thre sections of an English class etitled \*Intermediate Reading and Writing" participated in the current study (3 females and 38 males a gender ratio reflective of the student population at the study site). Two instructors with graduate degres in Applied Linguistic followed exactly the same course curricula. The first instructor taught one traditional section and one DMC-integrated section, while the second instructor taught one DMC-integrated section. To ensure the comparabilit of the course content, both instructors met weekly to discuss lesson plans together. The mean student age was 20.33 $\mathbf { \nabla } \mathrm { S D } = 3 . 8 3 $ , and the majority of them were freshmen. They had not decided their majors as the universty did not require them to declare their majors until sophomore year. All sections met twice a week for $7 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , and students received two credits. The required textbook of the course was Longman Academic Writing Series 3: Paragraphs to Essays (Oshima & Hogue, 2013), and the main goal of the course was to help students graduall progress from single paragraph to multi-paragraph essay writing.

# 4.3. Materials

Writing task prompts. Two genre-based writing prompts (causal analysis and argumentation) were developed for the study. Table 1 shows the two prompts, which both the DMC and traditional monomodal writing groups used. For composing, the traditional writing group used the Microsoft Word program, whereas the DMC group used the Filmora video editing program (https:/filmora. wondershare.net/video-editor/). The traditional writing group was given a planning shee, while the DMC group used a storyboard to plan their DMC. The traditional writing planning shet asks for atopic and details about causes or efect for the causation paragraph, and a thesis, topic sentences, supporting points for each body paragraph, and a conclusion for the argumentative essay. The DMC students planned what multimodal tools they would include in their project, and also wrote any scripts that they needed using the space in the storyboard as shown in Fig. 1.

Timed-essay test. Allstudents taking English classes at the universty are required to take a pretest and posttes to keep track of students progres ater taking the course. Several prompts that follow a similr structure are available, and we chose (ee Table 2) two parallel versions of the timed-essay prompt for the pretest and posttest of the study.

Rubric. We used an analytic rubric which focused on the following three traits: content, organization, and language, to assess students timed-essay responses. Each trait has six bands (0-5), and the sample analytic rubric is provided in Appendix A. This rubric was adapted from the rubric that was used by instructors at the university at the time of data collection.

# 4.4. Procedure

On the first day of the semester, students took the irst timed-essay in clas. Following the in-house program policy, students were given 40 minutes to respond to the writing prompt on the response shee. Throughout the semester, four genres of writing were introduced: narrative, cause/effect, summary and argumentative writig. Both groups followed the exact same daily lesson plans. As shown in Fig.2, in the DMC-integrated curriculum, two major composing tasks (causal analysis and argumentation) were implemented in a DMC format. All tasks were completed outside cass. In order to capture students' composing proces, students were asked to record their computer screen using MovavI (www.movavi.com). Since the current study does not focus on the process f composing, MOVAVI data are not included in this article.

During the first two weeks, the instructors used the textbook to go over the introduction to English writing. During weeks 3-4 and weeks 10-12, both groups completed the narrative paragraph and summary paragraph, respectively. The two major writing tasks that were implemented differently were carried out during weeks 7-9 (cause/effct paragraph) and during weeks 13-16 (argumentative essay) for both groups. For the DMC-integrated group, these two composing tass were implemented following the same procedure. First, the instructors provided a short introduction to DMC tasks by going over the importance of orchestration of various semiotic tools to create meaning, and showed an example DMC task outcome using narratives. The instructor then introduced the prompt i clas. Students worked on the task outside clas individually and completed  journal entry whenever they worked on the task Students were given 14 days for the cause/effect task, and 20 days for the argumentative task. There was an in-class peer review session $7 5 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } .$ prior to submitting the final draft of each task. Students spent 5-7 days revisig their writing or DMC task before submitting the final outcome. Both groups followed the same schedule, but their task outcomes were evaluated using different versions of the analytic rubric. Whil rubrics for both groups incude content, organization, language use and process writing, there was an addtional criterion for the DMC tasks: Effectiveness of multiple modes.

# 4.5. Data coding and analysis

For research question 1, which focused on the quantity and quality of language for each task, traditional or DMC, students' writing was analyzed in terms of text length and the quality of language in terms of complexity and accuracy. While the traditional writing group's written output can be found in the final version of their papers, the DMC group's writing on storyboards might not be the final version as the leaners could stil make changes as they were recording thir narration. Thus, transcription of the oral narration, hich is ofen the cript that they wrote on the storyboard, was use for the analysis Fig. 3 shows a writing sample for both traditional writing and DMC. For DMC, as stated above, students' use of language, one of the multimodal tools, was used for linguistic analysis.

Once language data were compiled, students' writing was analyzed in terms of text length (total number of words produced per task), syntactic complexity (the number of clauses per t-units and the number of words per clause), and accuracy (error-free clause rate). Independent samples t-tests were used to compare the two groups writing performance with respect to language use. We used

For the second research question, which focused on writing development measured on pretest and posttest timed essays, allthe essays were rated using the analytic rubric, which was described above, focusing on content, organization and language. A total of three inear Mixed Effects Models were created - one each for content, organization and language These models were used to compare pretest and posttest scores between the two groups. For these models, students scores for each category were entered as the dependent variable, and the following predictor variables were used: time (pretest vs. posttest) and group (traditional vs. DMC-integrated). We also fit a two-way interaction between time and group. For each model we report a marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ (i.e., the variance accounted for by the fixed effects only) and a conditional $R ^ { 2 }$ (i.e., the variance accounted for by both fixed and random effects).

# 5. Results

The first reearch question asked whether there are any differences in amount and quality (complexity and accuracy) of language between traditional writing and DMC in two genres. This question focuses on three aspects of students' task output (i.e, amount complexity and acuracy of lingustic output). Table3 reports the descriptie satistics of the amount of text produced in two genres by two groups. Independent $t$ test results showed that the DMC-integrated group produced a significantly larger amount of text than the traditional writing group for the cause-effect genre for all measures: $t = 2 . 5 7$ $p = . 0 1 6$ for the number of t-units (cohen's ${ \sf d } = 0 . 9 0 $ $t =$ 2.36, $p = . 0 3$ for the number of clauses (cohen's ${ \tt d } = 0 . 8 3 { \mathrm { \ : } }$ $t = 2 . 1 7$ 3 $p = . 0 4$ for the number of words (cohen's $\mathbf { d } = 0 . 8 3$ . For the argumentative genre, the DMC group produced significantly more t-units than the traditional writing group: $t = 2 . 4 2 , p = . 0 2$ (cohen's ${ \dot { \mathbf { d } } } = 0 . 8 5$

The independent t-tests showed that both groups produced a similar level of complexity and accuracy for both genres and no significant difference was found: Cause-effect (number of clauses per t-unit: $t = 0 . 1 6$ A $p = . 8 8$ , number of words per clause: $t = - 1 . 1 5$ $p = . 2 6$ accurate clause rate: $t = - 0 . 5 9$ $p = . 9 5$ Argumentative (number of clauses per t-unit: $t = 0 . 0 4$ $p = . 9 7$ , number of words per clause: $t = - 0 . 5 1$ A $p = . 6 2 $ accurate clause rate: $t =$ -0.15, $p = . 8 8 \mathrm { \AA }$

To illustrate the language output quality, we share two samples below, which present the first mentioned causes of their chosen issue (i.e, climate change, pollution). Fig. 4 displays a screenshot of a DMC task focusing on the causes of climate change. This participant uses visuals to explain what biotic proces, solar radiation, plat tectonics, and volcanic eruptions are while providing oral narration. He grouped these causes together in a category that he called \*national causes." He might have meant natural causes, and without visuals the audience might have a dificult time understanding the content. This student produced a total of $4 8 \ \mathrm { T } .$ units, 68 clauses, and 467 words in the DMC task. The accuracy rate was about $6 0 \%$

Fig. 5 presents an excerpt from a causality paragraph focusing on the causes of pollution. This participant produced 23 t-units, 30 clauses, and 209 words. The accuracy rate was about $5 0 \%$ . These examples illustrate how the use of images, rather than discouraging use of words, may actually scaffold and promote text generation, or at least not constrain it.

The second research question addresses whether there are any significant differences between the DMC-integrated group and the traditional monomodal group in terms of content, organizatin and language using pre and postest timed-essays. In other words, this question considers how or to what extent traditional writing ability is afected, over time, by experience with traditional paragraph. format or DMC assignments. Table 5 shows the descriptive statistics of writing development.

For content, the LME model included a significant interaction between time and group $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 1 ] = 7 . 2 2 1 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ . Specifically, the model predicted that the multimodal group cores between the pretest and the posttest incresed on average by .58 units more than the traditional group (see Table 6). This model reported a marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.44 and a conditional $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.66. For organization, there was a significant interaction effect between time and group $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 1 ] = 4 . 5 9 2 , p = . 0 3 2 )$ . The multimodal group scores between the pretest and the postest increased on average by .64 units more than the traditional group (see Table 7). This model reported a marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.35 and a conditional $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.48). Similar effects were found for language, in that there was a significant interaction between time and group $( \chi ^ { 2 } [ 1 ] = 5 . 9 6 0 , p = . 0 1 4 )$ . The effect was almost identical to the organization model, with multimodal group scores between the pretest and the posttest increased on average by .64 units more than the traditional group (see Table 8) (a marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.43 and a conditional $R ^ { 2 }$ of 0.53).

To summarize, the results of the first research question indicate that students tended to produce more text in the DMC projects than traditional monomodal writing. However, interms of the complexity and accuracy of language production, both groups did not show any differences. With regard to the writing development, i.e., the second research question, both groups showed significant improvement over one semester. However although the DMC-incorporated group had lower pretest scores for al three measures, they showed more improvement for all areas (content, organization, language) when compared to the traditional group.

# 6. Discussion

The value of a DMC approach to conceptualizing and teaching L2 writing, as mentioned earlier, has been the subjec of much debate (Belcher, 2017; Caanave, 2017). Digitl-hesitant pedaggists wonder ifstudents intense engagement with digital, especially social, media and use of various semiotic toos other than language (e.g, images, music) may impair abilit to engage in serious academic writing and attention to language, and hence hinder actual L2 writing development (e.g., Qu, 2017). Proponents of DMC, on the other hand, suggest that it failitates idea generation and willingnes to communicate, in writig as wellas speaking, and hence prepares students for thoughtful, literate engagement in a digitally mediated world (Bloch, 2021b; Hafner, 2015, 2019; Jiang et a., 2020) Although such mixed perceptions about the value of DMC for L2 writers have ben expressed, to date litle systematic empirical research has compared the impact of a traditional writing currculum and a DMC-integrated curriculum on L2 writing development Furthermore, to what extent linguistic performance in text generated in different media (traditional monomodal alphabetic versus digital multimodal) dffers betweenthe two task condtions, .. traditional andDMC, and wth dferent elemental gre has not been closely examined. The purpose of the current study, thus, was to analyze and compare the qualit of DMC and traditional writing in terms of inguistic performance on analogous topics for two genres (Research Question 1) and to compare students' writing devel. opment, with regard to content, organization, and language use, over time under traditional paragraph-format writing and DMC

I will introduce about three causes of pollution in our usual life in this paragraph. First of all, use of air conditioners causes air pollution. Air conditioner uses much electricity than other home applications. So, if we use air conditionals it increases use of oil. Therefore, it causes air pollution.

instructional conditions (Research Question 2).

The findings of the first question showed that DMC promoted more text generation than traditional writing, particularly for causal analysis, and that there were no significant ifferences in complexity and accuracy between the two conditions for both genes i. causal analysis and argumentation. Such findings provide some evidence that students sill used language as a primary mode of meaning making with DMC, and language quality did not suffer. Therefore, Qu's (2017) concern that DMC lures students' attention away from the language in a text" and shfts conscious monitoring . to other modes of representation' (p. 93) did not appear to be supported by the current study. Also, the fact that more text was generate for DMC than for traditional writing tass suggests that DMC may wellencourage rather than, asome have worried (ee Caanave, 2017), curtal sustained engagement with deas. f we view writing as a means of discovering meaning, as Zamel (1982) posited decades ago, then DMC, with its assemblage of images with text, which appears to facilitate idea generation (Bloch, 2021b; Smith et al., 2022), can be seen as particularly supportive of writing as a processof meaning making. The apparent dfferential ffect of gere, with DMC appearing to aford a significantl greater advantage for text generation for the elemental gere of causal analys than for argumentation, may suggest that argumentation i fairl equally challenging for digital multimodal composers and traditional writers, and that both may need similar levels of instructional support with this critical elemental academic genre (on the challenges of teaching and learning argumentation, again see Hirvela & Belcher, 2021; Hirvela, 2017; as well as Pessoa, Mitchell, & Miller, 2017).

The second research question focuses on whether a DMC-integrated curriculum disadvantages students with respect to writing development. The current study suggests that it does not seem to disadvantage students compared to traditional writing. The pretest and posttest results real that students in both groups improved on timed writing over one semester, but significant interaction effects point to the DMC group as having improved more than the traditional group. Such results align with Vandommele, Van den Branden, Van Gorp, and De Maeyer (2017), who found significant gains in communicative efectiveness content, lexical diversity, and especial text length and syntactic complext, on posttest traditional writing, for DMC groups over a group of non-DMC language learers. Vandomelle et al. postulated that such gains might be attibutable to learners' enhanced motivation for writing in the L2 through multimodal composition' (p.33), or, more specificall, as earlier mentioned, illingnessto write and confidence in writing. In their research on the motivational capacity of multimodal composing (though not on its long-term impact on writing in general), Jiang and

Luk (2016) found a multitude of motivational factors to be involved, but they cautioned against assuming DMC is inherently motivating for learners, that is, that it would motivate learning without a supportie instructional context. Instructional support was an integral part of the classroom context in the current study.

There are several imitations that need to be discussed and addressed in future research. Firs, with ecological validit in mind, we asked students to complete the DMC and traditional writing tasks outside the classroom, as s common in many language and literacy courses. Thus, many factors such as actual writing environment were not controlled in the study. Secondly although the main theme (i. e., environmental isues) was controld, topics were slightl varied (., water pollution, trash pollution, light polution), so there is the possbility of some degre of topic efect among students' task outcomes. But the variabilit is consistent between the two groups. Additionall, we used only two measures of syntactic complexity and one accuracy measure for determining the language quality of written outcomes. Thus our resuls need to be interpreted with such a condition in mind and future rearch is warranted to explore different measures of the linguistic qualit of written output such as lexical sophistication (Kim, Crossley, & Kyle, 2018) and phrasal level complexity (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011).

The findings of the study suggest several pedagogical implications. Given that students produced longer texts with DMC, particularly for causal analysis, and that writing development in the DMC-integrated group was on par with the exclusively traditional writing group, instructors who wish to foster digital iteracy in L2 writing classes can now be cautiously optimistic about the value for L2 learners of incorporating DMC into writing curricula. When integrated with traditional writing, DMC projects wil not likely impede L2 writing development progress, and they may, as Vandommelle et al's (2017) findings also suggested, promote motivation to write more than do traditional tass alone. Instructors, however, should anticipate a possible genre efect, and not assume that the DMC process itelf will be equally efecive at promoting greater text generation than traditional writing for all genres, especially for as challenging an elemental academic genre as argumentation (for non-DMC-related suggestions for argumentation pedagogical support, see, for example, Mitchell & Pessoa, 2021).

# 7. Conclusion

The current study was, to our knowledge, the first quasi-experimental study to compare the impact of a traditional writing cur. riculum and a DMC-integrated curriculum on students linguistic performance on tass diffring in medium (traditional monomodal alphabetic writing and DMC) and genre (causal analysis and argumentation), as well as on writing development over the course of one semester. Beause this was a classrom-based reearch project using intact universt-eel Enlish classes, the sample size is relatively small $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 1 \right)$ I, and the findings cannot be generalized to other contexts. Additionally, it i important to note that the students' writing development can also be attributed to the course curriculum that they followed, and possbly some unexamined confounding variables such as out-of-cass elf-sponsored litracy activities, that is, not just to the two writing tasks that we focused on in the current study. Keepingall the course materias for both grous equivalent allowed us to compare theffetivenes of the traditional writig and DMCintegrated conditions in classroom contexts. I i our hope that the current research shows some evidence that a DMC-integrated writing curiculum has potential value for L2 writing instruction in terms of both of the critical L2 writing goals mentioned earler: learning to write (in a target language) and writing to learn (a target language) (Manchon, 2011). Because we wanted to directly compare the quality of writen outcomes of the two conditions i response to some existing concerns regarding a lack of L2 writing development opportunities for DMC tasks, we only focused on written texts (or cripts) in this study (Research Question 1). However, as a growing body of empirical research has shown evidence of the benefit of DMC in various aspects of L learning, future language and literacy acquisition-oriented DMC studies could focus not only on the linguisic quality of writen-text task outcomes and on L2 writing development oer time based on pre- and postest timed-essays but also on what additional learning outcomes DMC could offer to L2 lener. Aditionally, although the proces data were collected using MOvviI, they were not included in the current article t is our future plan to analyze the composing process data in order to understand how leaners created meaning and how instructors could guide such processes effectively.

Finally, in light of the findings of our study, suggesting that DMC can be supportive of language learning and writing development as well a the encouraging findings of other studies such as Vandomelle al.'s (2017), we find ourseles in agrement with Haner's (2019 cal for uture reearch to contine to elaborate understandings of . afordances of digital tols and \*find was o integrate these understandings into the [language and literacy lening crriculum (. 915). ur findings lend suport as well to Zhang, Ako, and Li's (2021) observation that further intervention (or treatment) reearch focused on the effct of DMC on L2 writing performance and development, linguistic and otherwise, i warranted and could help addres concerns instructors have about adopting DMC intheir L2 classrooms.
