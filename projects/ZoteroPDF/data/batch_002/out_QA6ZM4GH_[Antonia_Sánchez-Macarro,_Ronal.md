# FOREWORD

This volume is based on a selection of the papers originally presented at the VIIth International Systemic Functional Workshop held in Valencia, Spain, in July 1995, which have been revised for publication. The main purpose of the workshop was to explore the nature of the linguistic choices open to speakers and writers for the expression of meaning in different socio-cultural contexts. The workshop reflected current work on the social constructs and dynamics which influence linguistic practices. It provided a diverse array of different aspects and perspectives contributing much to a better understanding of the different expressive options which language offers as part of the processes through which we amplify, modify and modulate our social and cultural frames of reference. Throughout the workshop there was a continuous reflection on the use of language as a social semiotic from the perspective of power relations, individual interests, professional and institutional contexts, and the reproduction of ideology. The notion of language as 'choice' as a set of alternatives for individual, social and cultural expression, was seen as a principal site for the study of the linguistic problems confronting contemporary society on the threshold of the twenty-first century.

The papers brought together in this volume relate organically and centrally to these perspectives, examining in particular the potential for spoken and written language use and the constraints on such language use which the term 'choice' implies. Many of the papers draw inspiration from models of language developed by Michael Halliday and his followers and in particular recent theories of variation in relation to texts and genres explored by Halliday and others. There is an emphasis on the interdependence and interaction of linguistic choices across sentence boundaries and speaking turns and a consistent focus across many papers on the importance of lexicogrammar in the construction of texts. Several papers consider pedagogical issues and examine differences and distinctions between native-speaker and non-native-speaker choices in speech and writing.

The papers in the volume also contribute to our understanding of the central significance of interpersonal functions in the communication of messages and underline the importance of a more systematic description of differences in interpersonal language use in different contexts of practice. By drawing on naturally-occurring data collected in a wide range of different genres as diverse as academic philosophy articles, scientific research papers, emergency telephone calls and casual conversation, contributors to Linguistic Choice across Genres offer numerous new insights and analyses of the relations between text and context.

Within these domains the papers collectively provide a sense of present achievements and future directions. The book opens with Gunther Kress's consideration of meaning as the outcome of social-semiotic work -an opening which forms a natural introduction to the entire volume. The remainder of the book is divided into two parts: the first being devoted to written texts, and the second to spoken texts. The papers in both parts offer specialised textual analysis, raising significant issues for description and application and setting clear research agendas for the field of language variation, in both theory and practice.

Each paper is introduced by an abstract which presents the main issues and places the paper in context; at the end of the volume there is an index of subjects and names which has a special relevance for both the present volume and the field in general. It is our hope that these selected papers constitute a varied and stimulating collection and that they will be read with great interest by all those students, teachers and researchers with a commitment to theoretical and applied research in the field of language variation.

As editors of the volume we are conscious that many people have contributed to its production, including many whose names do not appear in the list of contents. But we should like to first and foremost thank all the contributors for their hard work and cooperation and for patiently submitting to editorial requests. Particular additional thanks must go to the organising team in Valencia for their invaluable assistance: Patricia Bou; Rosana Dolon; Barry Pennock; Ma del Mar Marti Viano and Carmen Gregori provided stimulating discussions which helped to define the objectives of the workshop, helped to convene it and have subsequently offered unstinting moral support, together with invaluable comment and opinion, during the preparation of this volume. Juan Carlos de Miguel provided meticulous support in proofreading and preparing the manuscript. Pilar Garces offered sound judgement and advice throughout the process. John Hall helped with his incisive views on English usage.

Special thanks must also be reserved for Konrad Koerner, our series editor, and Ms Anke de Looper, our in-house publishing contact at John Benjamins, Amsterdam, for their unfailingly positive approach, constructive criticism and practical guidance.

Many people and institutions, too numerous to mention, contributed, both directly and indirectly, to the organisation of the VIIth ISFW in Valencia, out of which this volume has grown. For their generous institutional and financial support our thanks go to the following: the Spanish Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia, Direccion General de Investigacion Cientifica y Ensenanza Superior; to the local Institutions Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria de Cultura, Educacio i Ciencia; Universidad Internacional Menendez y Pelayo (UIMP), and to The British Council.

INTRODUCTION

# MEANING AS WORK INDIVIDUALS, SOCIETY AND THE PRODUCTION OF REPRESENTATIONAL RESOURCES

GUNTHER KRESS University of London

# Abstract

In this article I want to move from 'choice' to 'work', a move which is implied but not specifically addressed in Systemic Functional Grammar. The effect is to introduce history back into the 'linguistic system', together with humans as social actors, as workers who are makers of the systems of representations which are there in their cultures. In the process, I will problematize and extend the concept of 'choice', but also pose, I hope, some challenges to theories of semiosis.

# Thoughts in the context of the relation of languages, semiosis, and the English curriculum\*

The effect of the world around us on the formation and developments of individuals and cultural groups can become starkly apparent in special moments. I recollect my utter surprise in seeing Canadian paintings of the 19th century and of the early part of this century in the Art Gallery of Ontario a few years ago: these were paintings by people quite at ease with and in their world. Looking at the early attempts by the new arrivals in Australia to represent their new environment -whether in literary forms as in poetry, or in visual forms such as landscape painting-- shows by contrast and in shocking form the stark mismatch between the perceptual and representational models which they had brought with them, and the shapes and textures with which they were faced in their new environment. It took a hundred years, literally, before artists in Australia could produce representations of their environment which appear to us somehow close to realist representations: the same people who had the most sophisticated techniques of landscape painting --whether of the Norwich School, or the painters of the romantic period who found inspiration in the landscapes of the Lake District found it impossible to draw or paint the shapes even of the trees which they saw, and were forced back into a painstaking process of re-making their vision, and producing new means of representation.

The contrast with Canadian paintings of the same periods, and particular in this century, is instructive. In Canada the difference in the environment could be accommodated within the existing frameworks: the landscapes, though grander, and perhaps less influenced by human work than in Northern Europe, did not present the same perceptual challenge to artists working there. The effects of that challenge are even more telling in this century: Australian mainstream painting in the twentieth century has a distinctiveness which makes it entirely unmistakable; it is the result of human intellectual and artistic work in the face of the challenge of the initial shock of incomprehension and the impossibility of understanding. It is innovation as the result of human work in the face of stark differences. Of course, by the time this art had come to be produced, the forms and models of perception had been changed fundamentally: and in that process humans there have remade themselves; now, as people who are more at home, and more nearly at one with that environment. The work done by humans in their effort to understand, interpret and represent their environment has remade the people themselves, in the process of that work.

This example may seem far-fetched, but I wish to suggest that it describes a situation which is now commonplace. It is the experience of hundreds of thousands of young people in the schools in poly-cultural societies; and through their experience it has become the experience of all children in all schools in Britain, in Germany, in Australia, or in the US. This is now an entirely usual aspect of the contemporary world. It is a world in which the experience of confronting fundamental cultural difference, and dealing with it, constantly, is an everyday and commonplace demand. It does pose a fundamental challenge to society, and therefore for all of us, who are, as I am, interested in education, whether as parents, academics, teachers, politicians, or as administrators. It poses a particular problem for the English curriculum in England. At the moment the subject English is the only place, in secondary schools, where the issues entailed in pluri-culturalism can be faced and dealt with in a sustained form. It poses at least an equal problem in Primary Schools, although it presents itself there in a somewhat different form: not in a particular subject, but in all aspects of work in the primary class-room.

Figure 1. Snow White

Figure 1 is an image which encapsulates for me that experience: it shows the Queen from the fairy tale of 'Snow White and the seven dwarfs'.

It was painted by an eight year old Nigerian boy, who had at that time been in England for one year. His teacher had read the story of Snow White to the class, and had then asked them to write it, and to draw a picture to go with it. I will return to this image again, somewhat later; here I simply wish to draw attention to that foundational fact of DIFFERENCE --the products of one culture encountered by a (young) member of another culture, who has the task of making sense of it. His experience confronts us with a new and strange object, of which we in our turn have to make sense. I have never before seen an image of the Wicked Queen from that tale that resembled anything like this: it is, for me, genuinely new. Difference, in the right context, has led to innovation.

Here I come to the central point of my own interest: it is that complex and dynamic interaction between an individual in a situation which is new to him or to her, and their attempt to deal with that difference. It is the moment in which individuals experience change, and in that moment change themselves; it is at the same time the moment when they effect a change in the world around them through their making of a new representation -whether as an image, or as a written or spoken text, or as a gesture, or as anyone of a myriad of other meaningful actions. I will devote this paper to a brief exploration of that moment, and of the wider contexts of which it is one instantaneous, part.

The project I wish to develop is ambitious. It consists of an attempt to bring together three intersecting concerns: the role of the curriculum; speculations about social futures; and a serious consideration of the kind of human being we envisage in our curriculum and in its modes of presentation in pedagogy. It is a project focused on a vision of productive, fulfilling futures for the human beings now in our schools. This project requires the use of much which has formed the core of English teaching, but it also demands the development of new ways of thinking, new theorizing: about education, about English, and about the role of teachers and academics involved in this area. Above all, it demands a rethinking of our theories of language, or, more broadly, our theories of semiosis: how we as social humans make meanings, and in making meanings make ourselves. I see my own contribution as lying in the development of such necessary theoretical frameworks. I happen to think that we are in a period of truly epochal change; and it may be that existing ways of thinking will no longer serve, and that new ways of thinking may be called for in some crucial areas.

What can we know about our futures? This is not the place for a detailed exposition of such evidence as we may have, but let me say something in relation to three or four points. I assume that the globalization of economies will not be reversed, but will, if anything, increase. Over the next two decades or three, the pace of technological change will not slacken, if anything it will intensify. The cultural diversity of societies -pluri-, multi-, or polyculturalism- will not be reversed, because it cannot be reversed; it too, if anything, will increase, and with it, the pressures to develop or evolve newer modes of sociality, of new conceptions of equity in particular.

The present conception of equity is still one which comes out of past understandings of society which has not understood the reality of multi-cultural societies, -it sees equity as a moral issue largely-- one of being nice to a less privileged other, of admitting them to the economic and cultural riches of the privileged centre. A newer understanding of equity will be based on the realization that all groups in the society have goods, cultural and semiotic goods, to which all others will need to have access as an absolute prerequisite for producing a culture of innovation. Equity will need to be seen as a matter of reciprocity between all groups in a society. But this requires new theories of semiosis, which make equitable interaction entirely usual.

What I think is new is a demand that a full acceptance of these developments forces us to think quite specifically about the kinds of knowledge, skills, dispositions which will be required of those who will lead their lives in a future of continuing change. What kind of English curriculum do we need in order to give to children now in schools the personal wherewithal, and the dispositions to act confidently and productively, in the world of ten, twenty and thirty years from now. We know that notions of education have already begun to change, and will continue to change: we know that learning has always been and will be much more a lifelong activity. But these are realizations with which children need to become familiar: they do not, as yet form an ordinary, usual part of schooling. What kind of curriculum will it be that will make humans feel at ease with continuous, intense change; comfortable with sharp differences of culture and of social values met everyday; treat them as normal, as unremarkable and natural; and above all, as an essential productive resource for innovation rather than as a cause for anxiety and anger? For that we need a new commonsense about social individuals as constantly productive -of forms of texts, and meanings, and as producers of the means of making meanings.

But what theory is needed to allow us to develop a curriculum adequate to these demands?

I will attempt, as much as I can, to proceed by examples, in the hope that they are both more memorable, and more immediately persuasive, than a more detached discussion. Allow me to consider what seems a very simple issue, and to explore its implications. It is the matter of lettershapes. By a coincidence one of my doctoral students works as the designer for a publishing house which is producing a new reading scheme. These are enormously complex projects with predictably significant amounts of planning and research -consumer-testing by and large. They are immensely interesting, for a reading scheme is much more than a set of materials made to 'teach reading'. In all of its many facets a reading scheme encodes notions of society, of education, and above all, of children: of what a child is; of what children are like. Because this is among other things first and foremost a commercial venture, publishers are caught in the dilemma of seeking to innovate, in order to achieve an advantage over the competing reading-schemes of other publishers, and on the other hand, of minimizing commercial risk. One small issue is that of lettershapes; the question of 'readability'; what letter-shape is most easily recognized by a child; what gives the child least difficulty in recognition/perceptions. The point centres on the issue of whether to use serif or sansserif shapes. Here is an example of each one. First the lettershape with the serif "Nor will I!" Mrs Wilkin looked at Gyp again, and she smiled as she remembered. "Poor old lad. Eight years old and only one woof!"

Figure 2. Only one woof

And here is an example of the sans-serif lettershape

Soon everyone in Pontypandy was out looking for Rosa. But there was no sign of her.

Figure 3. Fireman Sam

You may not be surprised to learn that this publisher has decided to adopt the sans-serif style: as indeed do most--perhaps all-- early reading schemes. The weight of teacher opinion favours, it seems, the 'simpler' form; the form which seems clearer; and which offers less visual information.

Is this doing children a favour? Is it a plausible view of the abilities and capacities of children? What implications does this have for the kind of person we think we are preparing for that future of difference and change? Here, as a means of establishing in some way the actual competence of children, are some images which I think indirectly reflect the perceptual abilities of children, and which show their productive capacities. All three are produced by girls of about 31/2 years of age.

Figure 4. Tyrannosaurus Rex

This is a drawing of a wooden model of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, standing on a shelf in the girl's bedroom. Are the powers of observation, the engagement with detail, such as to suggest that a year later she cannot deal with the serif lettershape? Do they indicate an anxiety about an excess of information?

Figure 5, on page 10, is the other example. It is the 'writing' of a girl from Taiwan, Sarah, the daughter of a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Education. Is there a sign here of an inability or an anxiety to deal with the complexity of lettershapes? Is the serif, I ask myself, really too much for a five-year old to cope with?

![](img/03ec7cbcf43a0f5151adbb591b94b06c058fe3a1edd6cfd194bb179c9886219d.jpg)  
Figure 5. Early Chinese writing

I have a number of other questions: whose problems are we here dealing with? Whose anxieties are we protecting? But above all, what theories, what theorists have led to the production of this commonsense about children? This is the kind of evidence which convinces me that we urgently need different theories, a new and quite different commonsense. For out of this present commonsense come curricula and pedagogies which transplant our anxieties over to the next generation; which limit rather than open up; which are reductive rather than productive or innovative. Both children are perfectly happy, it seems to me, eager even, to engage with the complexities of the world around them: they attempt to make their sense of that world, actively and not merely in a narrow sense of reproduction as copying. In this engagement with the world they transform it, in relation to their own intellectual, cognitive, and cultural means.

The point about the challenge posed by the world --the world of communication and representation in this case, for the child-, is worth pausing on. What we make available to the child is a central factor in what the child will and can do. Compare the writing of the Chinese 31/2 year old, with that of the three and a half year old who drew the dinosaur, and whose communicational context is that of alphabetic writing.

![](img/6a98089fd716fb751843eca3f227c267724b0ecc1d83531a36de4aaca40e9f26.jpg)  
Figure 6. "Early alphabetic writing"

Here we see, in the sharp contrast between the logographic and the alphabetic models, the effect of the external world on the transformative work of the child. It is not, as the Tyrannosaurus Rex drawing makes clear, I hope, a matter of different aptitude -complexity is not a matter for anxiety for either child-- but it is directly a question of the challenge posed by the structure of the world for the child. The visually simpler world of letters produces one response; the visually richer world of ideograms produces quite another.

Are we doing children a favour by presenting them with the simplified sans serif letter form, or are we limiting the scope of their potential intellectual and cognitive engagement and work?

There are two further points worth making here. One is the clearly apparent point about cultural difference and its effects. The other is a perhaps less clearly apparent point about the deep 'meaning' of both forms of representation -letters on the one hand, and ideograms on the other. Let me say something about the second point first. The children, in engaging with \*writing', have to uncover for themselves the deep logic of each script. In the case of the girl learning alphabetic writing, four bits of that logic are apparent here as far as she is concerned: linearity, sequentiality; connectedness; of relatively simple, repeated and repeatable shapes.

This is, however implicitly it is learned, one of the most fundamental aspects of writing which she seems to have deduced from the model here. I do not wish to maintain, even for a moment, that this is THE settled truth for her; rather her engagement with writing is a constant, incessant, relentless analytic enterprise -as I will show in a moment, and the truth about it will not be settled for many years. But it is one early, fundamental truth, and it is established by her, for herself, early on.

In the case of the girl learning ideographic writing, another kind of logic --again as far as she is concerned-- is learned here: linearity yes; but of discrete elements, which are not connected; each of which is highly complex in itself and is clearly bounded; not repeated or repeatable. As a logic about the deep meaning of written language it is fundamentally different, and must have -though I am merely speculating here- the most far-reaching effects on notions of what language is, and what writing does. Out of this learning both girls will make, for themselves, particular kinds of rationality: in both cases rationalities so deeply embedded that they will not be available for the writer's own inspection, and rationalisation which are deeply different for the learner of the alphabetic and the ideographic forms of representation.

There is another foundational difference here, which plays quite differently into a child's move into writing. Alphabetic writing is, in as far as it is connected with spoken language, a transliteration of the sounds of language into discrete graphic elements, letters, representing those sounds. It is only at a second step an association of ideas with these letters. Ideographic writing on the other hand represents not sounds but ideas in the form of (highly abstracted and conventionalized) images. It is only at a second step that there is an association of sounds to these ideas. In a sense, Chinese invites the child to continue on the same path as the 'writing' of the Tryrannosaurus Rex, and makes that the path into writing; whereas alphabetic writing systems interpose the analysis of sound as a first step into reading and writing. My own assumption is that the former, putting the representation of thoughts and ideas (in the form of pictures) first, must accord with the child's own meaning -making disposition much more closely than the alphabetic system does.

The issue of cultural difference, and the different dispositions produced by these distinct forms of representation, is clear enough I feel. Although my example here may seem unusual, in that it focuses on sharply differing forms of representation, and their consequently differing dispositions, it can, I think, stand as a metaphor for the issues faced in a multi -or polycultural society, in a school-- system where children with quite different dispositions come together in the one class-room: another instance, less visible perhaps though no less important, than the image of the Wicked Queen.

So far I have tried to point to the active engagement on the part of the child with the communicational and representational environment. In many ways my ideas here are entirely within the mainstream of learning-theory, especially theoretical work following Vygotskian lines. As notions of the 'active learner' they have found their way into debates and practices in curriculum and in pedagogy. My own view is that this idea needs to be pushed further, beyond the idea of the child's active 'engagement' with the environment, and the child's action in making relevant aspects of that environment its own. Both of these can amount to an understanding of "people acquiring skills" --whereas it seems clear to me that the acquisition of skills, as of knowledge, actually amounts to a transformation of the individual who has \`acquired' that skill. More, in my envisaged theory of the making of meaning, the makers of meaning transform not only themselves but also transform the means of making meaning. Putting it simply, in speaking or writing I am not simply using language, I am remaking it. Users of so-called language are in fact the re-makers of language.

Let me refer briefly once more to the two examples of 'writing'. Anyone who has watched children of that age drawing or writing, cutting out or glueing --making representations which require manual skills- cannot fail to have noticed the intense 'physicality' of the activity, the intense involvement of the body: the drawing of a line is an intensely physical, bodily activity, just as much as it is an intellectual cognitive one. 'Writing' is the embodiment, the coding into muscular memory of meaningful action. This is not unknown to sportsmen and women, who practise a particular move 'to perfection': until mental and physical/bodily activity are as one.

But in these terms, the writing of the Chinese script entails a very different kind of bodily action: what is embodied here is not the regular succession and sequentiality of the alphabetic form of writing, but something quite different.

So far I have tried to demonstrate that the materials which the child encounters in her or his learning have the greatest significance in their possibilities of engaging in cognitive, intellectual, semiotic and cultural work. The richer the materials in their informational content (within limits of course) the greater the possibilities of productive engagement. The examples I have shown so far (alphabetic vs logographic writing) show that the materials affect, 'guide' the child's activity. I now wish to show evidence of the child's intense analytic and transformative activity in dealing with the materials of her environment.

My next series of images show a child's gradual development of the representation of her name, over a period of 13 months, from the age of 4 years and 1 month, to the age of 5 years and 2 months.

![](img/e2d3b615abc1921fc4ee982e0372a5e8820c2fd569b6f22a844c133b70e98d4e.jpg)  
Figure 7. "Emily"

The sequence reveals an intense analytic engagement with print/writing as a multi-semiotic medium. It is analyzed by the child into at least the following features: (letter) shapes; spatial orientation of elements; ordering of letters;

sequence of letters; overall configuration of 'units', 'words'; directionality; and 'style'. In each of these there is a period in which usually more than one of these comes under analytic scrutiny. In 1 for instance, 1c has the 'correct' number of elements (letters) in the configuration, while 1b and 1a do not. The spatial orientation of letters is an issue, particularly in the case of $\cdot _ { \mathrm { E } } ,$ ; so are the lettershapes (how many 'bars' are there on an 'E'?). Sequence of elements in the unit seems less of an issue: the important issue seems rather to be that of the presence of an adequate number of these characteristic elements/letters; because of this, too, it is difficult to know whether 'directionality' -left-right or right-left is an issue at this point. However, both sequence (what follows what) and directionality are (seemingly) settled issues in (2), one month on. Here 'appropriate number of elements' is also an issue, though having the 'correct' elements is not. The bars on the 'E' range from six to four: it seems that at this stage it is sufficient to signal 'multiplicity', 'plurality'.

These are evidence of 'reading' as much as of writing. That is, the child attempts to assimilate, come to terms with, construct her signs from cultural resources which have (been given) great significance for her. Hence her reading of 'E' implies, (as just one instance of the principles and features involved in the analysis), that there is one single, lengthy line, to which a multiple of lines are attached at rightangles. Here, in (2), 'spatial orientation' is 'correct' in adult terms. By instance (6), six months on, 'E' is established; though example (5), contemporaneous with (6) shows that this is still a relatively transitional stage as far as linear sequence and lettershape are concerned, it can be unsettled. In (5) the name appeared in the top left side of a painted self-portrait, and it may be the confined space which leads both to the interruption of linear sequence, (though it is very likely that in writing the name the child has written the letters in the correct sequence but has felt free (or constrained) to break the spatial, linear, configuration of the 'word') and to return, temporarily, to the former 'E'.

Both (6) and (7) show the settling of lettershapes, and the issue of 'style' -- which is a feature at all stages (e.g. (1) and (2)). In (8), where the appropriate leftright sequence, and directionality are established, there is a problem with 'orientation': the 'flick' on the '1' goes in the same direction, to the right, as does the 'flick' on the 'y' (as it does in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, except that they point left). By (9) that is sorted out; the briefly experienced problem of orientation' of the letters 1' and 'y' in (8) shows just what complex achievements are coded in these superficially simple structure. In (9) too, a stylistic 'problem' has been solved: the three successive left-orientated flicks' of i', '1', y', in (7) and (6) are now sorted out: '1' points right, 'y' points left, both correctly, and i' has been deprived of its 'flick', by using the capital form of the letter. It is important to point out the complexity of the semiotic analysis performed in this sequence, by this child over a period of eight months. From (3) to (8) the principle at work is that the 'flicks' go in the same direction as the direction of the letters first to the left, and then, when the child has discovered the conventional directionality of writing, to the right. This is quite an achievement, as all of these are written left-handedly. In (9), finally, there is (a) left-handed writing, (b) left-to-right directionality, and (c) variable directionality of the 'flicks'.

There tends to be a period of relative stability for a particular style, so much so that one can date particular forms of writing by a child quite precisely: the style of(1) and (2); of(3), (4) (5), (6) and (7); of (9), (10), (11). I say 'relative stability' because there is constant transformative activity. During (9), (10) and (11) for instance, there is experimentation with the $\cdot _ { \mathbf { m } ^ { \prime } }$ . And during this period, while certain features are stable, others are relatively fluid: when writing accompanies a drawing, as in (5), the spatial linear horizontal orientation goes, and is supplanted by vertical orientation here; and left-right horizontal directionality is replaced by vertical directionality.

Figure 8. Newspaper

It is clear, I hope, that much more is happening here than simple copying; not one of these is a copy; and more is happening than simple language acquisition. This child is engaged in an intensely analytic activity, in which she completely re-reads and re-makes for herself this sign which is so significant to her. It is an act of constant transformation on her part, in which she transforms this sign in her world, in order to understand its complex principles of constitution. In that process she actively transforms herself, and makes for herself -out of existing cultural, representational resources-- her own means of representation.

This is a far remove from 'copying', a metaphor which treats the individual engaged in copying as a relatively inert and passive participant.

If my first point was to show that the structure of available resources and materials guide the transformative activity of the child, here I have attempted to show the child's intense analytic engagement with and transformative action as the means for making meaning. This is neither random activity nor mere passive copying.

Another brief example may make the point about the child's production of her own resources of representation.Here is a four and a half year old's production of a"newspaper". The text, as 'read' by the child to her parent was "In John Prince's street someone got dead".

No newspaper looks like this. The child has abstracted what she regards as the most important features from this object, and from the genre: the large, prominent (letters of) Headlines, and the image at the bottom of the page; as well as the "generic form' of the text "read" by her--news content, and news language. This is her assessment of what, at this stage, she sees as the criterial aspects of a newspaper ('news-discourse'; headlines and image, in a specific order) and she has represented them here in this form.

A curriculum is a design for a future. That is one of its central features: it represents, explicitly or implicitly, an image, a vision of what kind of human being is envisaged here, and, by a further implication, what kind of society is imagined and projected in the curriculum. We cannot therefore proceed to a rethinking of the English curriculum without at the same time engaging in a debate about the kinds of social futures which we imagine, and which we wish to see brought about. In my own imagination I am certain that that future should offer the generation of children now in school the possibilities of productive and fulfilling lives: no less fulfilling than my life has been for me. This may not necessarily mean a life with the same material benefits; these might be compensated for by other factors. There is no particular formula which guarantees human happiness; yet humans are always able to understand when their lives have dignity and fulfilment, and offer them the possibility of some happiness.

But for our society to offer that as a possibility for the generation to follow it is essential to construct the conditions for it now. In so-called post-industrial societies, the primary factor for a productive future is the possibility of a deeply entrenched culture of innovation. Innovation can be wished for; it cannot be legislated or ordered. Innovation cannot happen in one discrete domain alone; it depends on the richest possible environment across all cultural domains. It is a possible result of active decision and real work. And the condition for that is the imagining of humans who are at ease with change, and who are not anxious in the face of difference, who see difference and change as the necessary preconditions for the production of the new.

The curriculum which may achieve such a goal is a curriculum which sees humans as actively creative, in the making of their own modes of representation, and of their texts. This points away at once from forms of the curriculum which seek to confine, limit, restrict; which see conventions as rules which must be followed rigidly, which must not be tampered with; which see difference as a threat. It points towards views which see socially formed individuals as constantly productive of their meanings, which are made by them out of their interests, with their meanings, in a full understanding of possibilities, and of boundaries, of the strength of boundaries, and of the possibilities of changing boundaries. Above all it requires a view of semiosis in which humans are seen as constantly remaking their means of making meaning -whether of language, or of images, gestures, music, and so on.

The central assumption which I believe will have to underlie new conceptions of the curriculum is that of the individual as the maker of her or his means of representation, in the hurly-burly of daily interaction, of the making of meaning in a situation where difference is normal, and change is taken for granted. If and when that has become the pillar of the curriculum, has become a new commonsense, then we can be confident that we will be educating young people for a naturalized culture of innovation.

When we have come to understand that in our making of signs we remake the world around us, that we remake the means of making signs, and that in that process of making signs we make ourselves as human beings, out of the resources of the cultures and societies in which we live, we make ourselves as social subjects, both social and individual, and when the English curriculum is founded on that as its commonsense, then we will know that we have the curriculum that has the possibility of shaping futures.

I will move by a giant step, to a partial consideration of how such thinking might affect our choice of materials in the secondary class-room.

To assist in thinking about this I propose to use three categories of text: the aesthetically valued (and valuable) text; the culturally salient text; and the mundane text. Each has a specific function in the curriculum. Each text takes on a quite specific significance, different to that which they have at the moment. In each case my touchstone for inclusion is aptness of purpose for the society of two decades hence: aptness both in providing skills, knowledge, understandings and dispositions, sets of values which can lead to productive ways of being in the world. But aptness also in helping to shape a world which offers the possibilities I mentioned earlier.

Let me start with the category of the culturally salient text. The culturally salient texts is not measured by the criteria of the aesthetically valued text -even in the culture in which it originates. It is measured not against criteria of 'beauty' but against criteria of significance: what significance does this text have in its own cultural domain? what significance can or perhaps should it have therefore for members of other cultural groups in this polycultural society? What are the features and characteristics which give it salience in its culture of origin and therefore lend it particular force and significance as a means of our understanding of that cultural group, and of the pheonomenon of culture generally. Aesthetically valuable texts may be among these: but that is not a relevant or telling criteria from this point of view.

A shift from aesthetic concerns to those of salience, proves essential and liberating, not just within the curriculum but within broader cultural politics. In the context of the latter, it avoids and obviates unproductive debates about 'qualities of writing'; in the context of the former it makes available the materials which are essential to the development of a curriculum for a productively multicultural society.

In this new curriculum there will be therefore culturally salient texts which speak of as many of the cultural groups in the society as is pedagogically sound; but in any case, there will be a collection of texts from a range of cultural groups, sufficient to establish ways of reading such texts, and to be able to establish an ease with cultural difference through the study of such texts and to illustrate the contents which are central to the concerns of cultural groups. This collection of texts will include texts from groups which are socially and politically "dominant" and from groups which are not. That fact will be one aspect of their salience. All of these texts will speak of the histories of their cultures, and, through this, point to possible cultural/social futures.

The question of the aesthetically valued texts is, in my view, best treated as a matter both of culture and of politics. That is, each cultural group has texts which it treats as valued for aesthetic reasons, and these should be represented in the curriculum. The question of what criteria enter into the definition of aesthetic value is, for me, a social matter largely -that is, a question of the operation of power over long periods, which has become mystified as the a-historical, a-social category of taste. Hence what is treated as most valued in a society can be discussed as a reflection of both histories of power within one cultural group and at the same time as histories of taste, as well as of histories of power and domination between cultural groups.

So when Dickens, or Shakespeare, or D H Lawrence, are presented as naturally and neutrally as 'what is best' in English Literature, we have a conflation of complex histories of power and taste within one society: so that within elite groups certain sets of values have become dominant, and the bases of these valuations have been obliterated by being 'naturalised'. Within the society overall, the values of that one group are entrenched as neutral values for all groups. A discussion of aesthetically valued texts thus becomes amenable to comparative, historical and social analysis, without in any sense diminishing the notion of value, as the value of the aesthetically valued text, or diminishing the set of cultural values embodied in and accreted around these texts.

In my envisaged curriculum there is a further point in relation to the selection of kinds of texts. Although my approach may seem excessively -perhaps depressingly-- utilitarian and pragmatic, as it happens I believe strongly in yalue, whether in the aesthetic or in other domains. I believe that there are exceptional human achievements; even though I prefer to seek a social/cultural explanation of these. Hence for me the aesthetically valued text has at least a number of functions in the curriculum: to show what a cultural or a social group has, in its histories, regarded as exceptional human achievement; to attempt to relate this to broader social and cultural histories; and lastly, and for me crucially, to make such texts have real effects, via their effects on individual lives, in the broadest set of social practices.

For this to happen, the characteristics of any text must be clearly understandable and relatable to all other texts in the society. I therefore use a third category, namely that of the mundane text. In my envisaged curriculum, the mundane texts must be amenable to contact and influence by the aesthetically valued text: putting it starkly, the office-memo (never mind The Sun feature article, or the episode of EastEnders) must be amenable to effective influence by features of the Shakespeare play; or of the 19th century novel; or of the Augustan epic; as indeed amenable to the effects of the aesthetically valued texts of all other cultural groups in this society. In an effective curriculum all of these texts will be treated within a single, coherent, social and historical theory of text, and not, absolutely not, as discrete, unrelated phenomena. Let me give a brief example. Mundane texts are overlooked; yet they are the texts which are most telling, in many ways, in our everyday and working lives. They form the bedrock of social and economic life. Without an understanding of the mundane text, and without the confident ability to use it for one's purposes in whatever domain, we cannot be fully effective participants in the economic, social and political life of our group. More, without a deep understanding of the mundane text, we are cut off from a full appreciation of the aesthetically valued text. Perhaps most significantly from the point of view of the curriculum, without that understanding, the aesthetically valued text cannot be brought to bear on the everyday. This last point is part of educational debates, but it provides the decisive justification for the inclusion of the serious study of the mundane text in the English curriculum -together with the equally serious study of the culturally salient and the aesthetically valued text.

A text, any text, is a microcosm of the social world in which it is made. It encapsulates in an irrefutable form a cultural truth about the individual/s who produced it --be it a film, a letter, any text written in a place of work, a newspaper editorial. Here is an example of the mundane text. To make it safe and harmless, but also to make it strange, by making you share my upside down world, I'll choose a text from another culture, in that other hemisphere. It comes from the back of the entrance door to a holiday flat in a small town somewhere on the north coast of New South Wales, in Australia. I saw it in August 1988.

On the face of it, this humble text provides nothing more or other than useful and necessary instructions for the holidaymakers who rent this flat for a few days or weeks. Pause over it for a moment, however, and you get a sense of considerable unease on the landlords' part. They know, all at the same time, that their tenants are very likely to be nuisances; careless and abusive of property; deceitful even; yet they are also a necessary evil, paying rent. And somewhere, at the back of their minds is the uneasy realisation that yes, these people ought to be treated as visitors, as guests even.

These unpractised constructors of rules and regulations convey, more accurately than any treatise ever could, a deep sense of unease about their place in the world: an unease about tourism, and its role in a changing social, economic and cultural world. They reveal echoes only of acquaintance with the discourses of the enterprise culture which, just a few miles up the coast, produces stunning brochures advertising the new (Japanese owned) luxury resort. This small text captures with absolute precision that moment when an older cultural form, of the world exemplified by English postcard seaside landladies of the thirties and forties -is about to be swept away, to be replaced by the polished world of holidays as commodities, and holidaymakers as customers or clients, a world dominated by the brilliantly edged discourses of contemporary advertising and marketing.

The unease of this text betrays its makers' lack of knowledge about the nature of this change, and about this new world. It betrays an inability to control the formal resources which would permit them to make a different text, which would respond to that change with full understanding, either by rejecting the glib new world, or by embracing it, or perhaps by forging some position that they could feel comfortable about.

As a teacher this mundane text allows me to talk about the uses of language in response to social demands, and in attempts at shaping the social world in response to clearly understood wishes. It allows me to engage in a discussion about change, the pace of change, and the linguistic resources -a full knowledge of grammar, a deep understanding of text and the forms of texts- that will be essential for my students to be able to write the texts that they will both need and wish to write in a time of perplexing uncertainties.

But it also speaks of social and cultural values: of the kinds of cultural and economic shifts that have turned landlords into hosts, and tenants into guests (or, which allow the manager of the underground station I use everyday to address me as "one of my customers" when I stubbornly want to see myself as a passenger). Out of an understanding of this text can come productively useable knowledge about language -securely founded on knowledge of grammar of a relevant kind-, about change and how to respond productively, innovatively, and agentively to change. And yes, out of this text can come a deep understanding of the history of a culture -in this instance working-class cultures of the thirties, forties and fifties and of their contemporary counterparts.

But out of this text can come another realization, at least as important in giving students a textual theory which can make them truly productive users of their language. Consider this other text here. It is separated from the one you have just seen by 20 years and by 14000 miles. It comes from Norwich, in England, in 1974.

# Swimming club rules

1 Parents must accompany and take responsibility for their children at all times, unless the child is in the water in an instructed class. Note - In most cases this will mean one adult enrolling with one child, or, if they so wish one adult with more than one child provided it is understood they are responsible for them.   
2 Being absent for more than three consecutive sessions without explanation to the membership secretary means automatic expulsion.   
3 No outside shoes will be worn when in the pool area.   
4 Please respect the facilities and equipment, and take particular care with untrained children.   
5 The age limits of the club are six months to eight years. For the six to eight years old instruction will be provided. Children may remain members for the completed term in which their eighth birthday falls.   
6 There must be no more than twenty-four bodies in the pool at any one time.   
7 Membership cards must always be carried and shown on request.

The similarities between the two texts are, to me, astonishing: The content is different, though certain kinds of anxieties are common to both --whether about fish or sanitary pads or untrained children-, as are certain fears of a world of lawlessness -whether about the wearing of improper shoes or about the 25th body in the pool, or about "extra persons", or "unwelcome pets".

But what is stunningly similar is the social uncertainty, the unsureness about how to represent the relations between the writers and the readers, in their social roles. Should these be clear and unambiguous rules? Should they be authoritative. perhaps authoritarian, or should they be relatively friendly demands or statements?

The reasons for this fundamental problem of 'address' are the same in both cases: a confusion about social relations which does not permit a clear generic form (rules or regulations, or 'invitations', or information) to emerge. In the case of the swimming-club rules, the situation was one where a group of young mums, who knew each other well socially', had got together to form a babies' swimmingclub. Consequently the relations as friends interfered with their other set of relations as rule-makers.

This approach to text gives a student insight into the reasons for the (generic) form of a text, and at the same time equips her or him with knowledge, principles and skills on the basis of which they can understand their own text-making, and shape it successfully to their ends.

However, this has not answered two points: one is the point about the connection between the mundane text, and the aesthetically valued text. The other is the more fundamental point about a new conception of meaning making. Let me give the briefest answer of what I have in mind in relation to the first point, within an over arching textual theory which accommodates texts of all kinds, and does not separate the mundane from the aesthetic.

Take the opening lines of Shakespeare's King Lear. On stage are Kent and Gloucester, both Earls. Gloucester uses the "royal plural': we, us, -in the 17th Century, the form of pronoun used by the powerful of themselves, or to each other, to signal power rather than solidarity. Kent uses the singular form $\underline { { \mathrm { I } } } _ { \mathsf { \Omega } }$ my: the form used by the powerful to signal solidarity (and absence of power), used to intimate others of the same rank or downward, to the lower orders. Shakespeare establishes for the audience, through this minute but precise device, an immediate distinction between the two Earls: Kent as plain and straightforward, Gloucester as pompous, and a buffoon. It also allows him to deflate Gloucester, for when his bastard son Edmund comes on stage, Gloucester, embarrassed by his past misdemeanour starts to use the singular form of himself: his pomposity is pricked.

An unevenness, a fluctuation, an unease in the text -here deliberately used-- has been produced by the playwright to signal exactly the same meaning as is produced unintentionally in my mundane examples above, -even if at a very general, abstract level- namely an uneasiness, a shiftingness, a confusion of social relations.

This is a slight example, admittedly, though I think the point is not. It will allow a connection, once the principle is recognized, of texts across centuries, as here; and a connection of the most highly valued with the most ordinary text and enable students to imagine themselves as manipulators of these very devices of meaningmaking. It allows for the influence, the flowing in, literally, of the effects of the valued text into an understanding, at least, of the everyday text.

Such a theory of text presupposes an explicitness of the English curriculum about matters of language form, language use --in the widest senses-- which is not available in English curricula at the moment, either to students or to many of their teachers. This includes an explicitness about practices of writing and reading. Out of such an explicit curriculum, constituted not only around a selection of texts, but importantly, constituted as a means of reading --comes the possibility of productive use of the kind and range of texts I have indicated. It encompasses, in its scope, all the questions around language: language use, change and development and, at a particular point, a necessary focus on issues of 'value'. A curriculum which deals adequately with this range of texts in this way is also a curriculum which develops essential practices (and theories) of reading and of writing.

Of course, such a theory and such practices rest on an understanding of a whole text, with an understanding of the complex contexts of its production and of its usual contexts of reading/reception in considerable detail. This will demand of the English curriculum a fully and explicitly developed social and cultural theory of text, within which a linguistic theory of text is one component. Crucially for both this socio-cultural theory and for the linguistic theory, text has to be seen as the product of many voices, from many places in society: an object with a multiple producership and a multiple readership.

This brings me to that second point about new conceptions of meaning making. In the English classroom the expression of the meanings of students has always been valued; creativity has been an unquestioned value. The meaningmakers of the two texts which you have just seen do not, however, have the resources to make the meanings which would express adequately the complexity of their situation. The answer to that has usually been to attempt to supply more resources, give students more means.

My conception goes beyond this. It says that my expression of my meaning, here in this place, in this complex, dynamic world, of sharp difference, is my making for myself out of what is culturally available, my own new, different means of making meaning. That is a different, a more foundational kind of innovation. It treats the individual not just as the creative user of the available means of making meaning, but it treats her or him as the (re)maker of new resources for the making of meaning. More than that it suggests to students that they should see themselves involved in the process of design, of texts as the result of designs arising out of the perceived needs and wishes of makers of meaning acting in a particular environment. That is a power of quite a different kind.

It treats meaning as the result of social-semiotic work. Let me return to the image I showed you first of all. That, I think, is the meaning of the image of the Wicked Queen, coming from a classroom in which difference is valued, and the creative potential of all children is acknowledged, is fostered, supported and sustained. It is the kind of classroom which enables children to make themselves into humans who have the dispositions, and the confidence to insist on taking their part in the making of productive social futures. It values the semiotic resources which children bring into the classroom and treats their actions as the meaningful work of their design.

It is here that my interests in education and in theories of semiosis come together again. What I consider as essential for the new curricula turns out, I am certain, to be essential for our thinking around language. It takes us from theories of use (choice from existing resources) to theories of the transformative action of meaning-making in the context of available semiotic resources. It is a conception which puts the action and work of meaning-makers at the centre, and so restores history to its essential place in linguistic theorizing.

# RESONANCE IN TEXT

GEOFF THOMPSON University of Liverpool

# Abstract

Linguistic choices in text are not made independently: not only are a number of choices made simultaneously at any point in an interaction, but choices may influence each other even across clauses or over longer stretches of text.

Halliday (1973), amongst others, points out that prominence in text may be achieved by the establishment of an instantial norm through the deliberate repetition of similar choices. This paper deals with a similar phenomenon, but one which involves less conscious exploitation by the text producer. This is the setting-up of a kind of harmonic resonance in choices: certain potential aspects of meaning in a lexico-grammatical choice, which may be backgrounded or even irrelevant in some contexts, make that choice more likely or explicable than another in a particular context because those aspects resonate with other similar choices in the text. There may be clear 'key' choices, which establish an aspect as dominant and with which other less clear-cut choices resonate; or there may be no individual clear choices, but a number of choices which share the same potential resonance and which incrementally reinforce each other's effect.

In the paper, I present an analysis of two texts illustrating different ways in which lexicogrammatical resonance may function. I relate the phenomenon to Fries' (1990) componential approach to text, and explore the implications of choosing the prosodic metaphor of resonance rather than the more atomistic one of components.

# 1. Introduction

It is generally accepted that linguistic choices in text are not made independently in a purely linear, incremental fashion. One of the basic assumptions of Systemic Functional Grammar is that a speaker's choice of wording at any point in an interaction will typically be expressing three main kinds of meanings simultaneously (see, e.g., Halliday, 1994:33-5), each of which plays a part in a different strand of meaning in the clause, so that the wording will be chosen in order to fit in with all the strands at the same time. If we focus on the syntagmatic perspective, a choice of wording at one point will be determined or influenced by, and determine or influence, the choices around it: for example, the interdependence of lexical verbs and grammatical patterns is familiar to all teachers of English as a Foreign Language (e.g. prevent N from V-ing vs. protect $N$ from $N$ -for an exhaustive survey, see Collins Cobuild Grammar Patterns: Verbs). If we move beyond the clause or clause complex, the kind of mutual influence is less predictable, but in choosing a wording the speaker will still, for example, be influenced by other lexical choices in the text, to reflect the fact that there is intended to be a particular pattern of coherence in the message (Hasan 1984; Hoey 1991a).

The issue of the interrelationships between choices within a whole text or a stretch of a text originally arose for me in carrying out transitivity analyses with students taking courses in Functional Grammar. Practical difficulties in coding regularly arose that seemed to derive from the fact that the Hallidayan view of transitivity consciously reflects a view of the clause as a 'segmental type of structure, with clearly separated constituent parts' (Halliday 1994:36). We felt that simply identifying the processes and participants involved clause by clause missed an important aspect of the experiential meanings that were being constructed in a text: we wanted a reasonably systematic way of exploring the effect created by the repetition of certain types of meaning, and of showing that a lexico-grammatical choice at one point in the text could be at least partly explained by reference to choices elsewhere in the text. It was an attempt to deal with these practical difficulties which provided the motivation for the perspective on text discussed in this paper.

# 2. The tone of a text

The aspect that we were concerned with might informally be called the 'tone' of the text: the overall cumulative effect of the way in which certain transitivity choices seem to reinforce each other by repeating a particular facet of meaning. In some cases, the effects are reasonably easy to capture, since they involve choices at the first level of delicacy, using the major categories of process and related participants (for a summary, see Halliday 1994: 143). For example, in certain kinds of educational text, there is a high frequency of relational processes, reflecting the generic convention that the function of such texts is to describe and identify phenomena, with the final goal prototypically being the explicitly signalled identification of the key feature in question, such as the cause of an event (Martin 1991). In advertisements, there is often a pattern of the addressee (the potential buyer) being talked about as Senser in mental processes, contrasting with the addresser (the hopeful seller) being talked about as Actor in material processes: the seller is mainly projected as producing a product which the buyer contemplates and subsequently enjoys -typically without being projected in the text as the Actor in a process of buying (Thompson & Thetela 1995).

In other cases, however, the aspects of meaning that are repeated are less salient, in that they rely on more delicate distinctions. As Halliday (1988) points out, in formal scientific prose, there is a strong tendency for material processes to function as metaphorical encodings of logical relationships such as cause and effect (e.g. 'lead to', 'bring about'). Tourist brochures and other similar types of texts frequently describe physical location in terms of material rather than relational processes (e.g. a building 'stands' or 'overlooks'; a street 'runs' or 'passes through'). These particular uses are so familiar that they might be thought of simply as dead metaphors, and taken for granted; but when they are consistently repeated through a text they give it a distinctive tone which largely disappears if they are rewritten congruently. Tourist brochures, for example, lose the (admittedly faint, but unmistakeable) tone of dynamism if the metaphorical material processes are rewritten as relational processes. In analysing a text which shows such features, it is possible to set up instantial categories ('material-logical' for scientific texts, 'material-relational' in the case of tourist brochures) and look at the function in the text of the instances in that category as a whole. The assumption is that the writer, however unconsciously, is working with a specific image in her mind -e.g. the city as a dynamic and therefore attractive place for the tourist to visit-- and consistently opting for wordings, amongst the available options, which maintain the tone of that image. As the two examples above suggest, the tone and the options for conveying it are likely to be determined by the type of text that she is writing. Not surprisingly, therefore, these instantial categories frequently turn out to be typical of a particular register, and are found across a range of texts from the same or related genres.

Once the notion of text-instantial categories is accepted, it is possible to extend it beyond processes and to include other aspects of the experiential meanings of the text (or indeed of other types of meanings). What such categories allow us to identify are particular features of a text which contribute to making it distinctive as a text or text-type. This may appear at first sight to be related to the phenomenon of foregrounding, which is often invoked in studies of literary text. This phenomenon clearly relies on the interrelationship of different choices --most crucially, as Hasan (1985) emphasizes, a meaning can only be foregrounded in a text in contrast to other, backgrounded meanings that form the norms of that text. However, the aspects of text that I am discussing seem to be more aptly described as part of the background of the text: they are not particularly highlighted, and there is no contrast with other norms established in the text- if anything, they are the norms.

A more closely related concept is that of prominence in the sense in which it used in Halliday (1973). In his analysis of the language of William Golding's novel The Inheritors, Halliday focuses on the effect of repeated choices which encode actions as non-directed, in intransitive clauses, even where the reader might more naturally expect transitive clauses (e.g. 'A stick rose upright' rather than The man raised a stick [i.e. his bow and arrow]'). Halliday argues that these choices are designed to evoke a world without cause and effect -the world as seen by the focalizer of the main part of the novel, a Neanderthal man. He points out (p. 113) that prominence may be regarded either 'as a departure from or as the attainment of a norm' (emphasis added); and, in his conclusion, he underlines the link between repeated linguistic choices and the meaning of the text as a whole:

In the study of the text, we have examined instances where particular syntactic options have been selected with a greater than expected frequency... and have suggested that, by considering how the meaning of these options, taken in the ideational context of the language as a whole, relates to the interpretation of the meaning of the work, one can show that they are relevant both as subject-matter and as underlying theme. (Halliday 1973:133)

This formulation is very close to the view of how 'tone' is conveyed that I have briefly outlined above; but there are two elements that do not entirely fit. First, Halliday is dealing with a consciously crafted literary work, in which it is legitimate to see the writer as deliberately exploiting the resources of the language in a way which is intended to draw attention to itself. The approach could, of course, be easily adapted to suit less self-conscious and self-publicising texts, and this objection could therefore be overcome. However, the second objection, though related to the first, is more serious. A term like 'prominence' (or 'foregrounding') gives a misleading impression of what is going on. The effect of the repetition of aspects of meaning that I am interested in is, I would argue, not specifically meant to be noticed: the writer may not be aware at any conscious level of the factors influencing her choices. It seems to be more that choices will present themselves 'naturally' as toning in with the image that she wishes to project, and she will therefore simply feel that those choices are the 'right' ones.

Rather than thinking in terms of prominence, the metaphor that I find most appealing for this phenomenon is that of resonance: given that at a particular point in the text there are several different wordings potentially available to construe the meaning that the writer is aiming at, she is likely to choose a wording which resonates with the tone of the text. This is partly just a question of tone in the ordinary sense: for example, if I am writing comments on a student's draft essay and wish to maintain an encouraging tone, I am more likely to talk about 'polishing' and 'bits we need to talk through', rather than the equally truthful 'rewriting' and 'clear evidence of misunderstanding'. However, one important aspect of resonance that is not clear from these phrases out of context is the way in which it is often possible to identify specific components of meaning which the different choices share, and which are the real source of the resonance.

Words may have potential components of meaning which in some contexts are not evoked as relevant, but which in others may be activated, at however subliminal a level, and resonate with the other choices that share the same potential component. For example, 'standard' (as in 'a standard procedure') can be defined as 'usual and normal', but can be seen as having a potential component or connotation of dismissiveness ('no more than one would expect') which can be activated in a context such as 'a standard evasion' or (attested example) 'Hogg [a British Government Minister] gave the kind of evasive answer that is completely standard for him'. If, as in this case, we only look at the immediate context of the group, clause or clause-complex in which the two choices occur, what I am calling resonance is similar to Louw's (1993) concept of semantic prosody. This refers to the way in which a word such as 'utterly' is statistically far more likely to cooccur with negative right-collocates (e.g. ' $\sim$ ridiculous') than with positive ones (e.g. ' \~ dedicated'), and thus in itself sets up the expectation that the term that follows will be negative. However, apart from the fact that Louw is mainly interested in his paper in cases where collocational expectations are deliberately subverted, he grounds the concept on collocation over short stretches of text; whereas I see resonance as typically operating over relatively long stretches of text (and as activating harmonies to establish and maintain a tone rather than subvert it).

In the texts to which the analysis of resonance has been applied, I have found that there may be certain key choices which establish a particular tone overtly, and with which other choices tone in less overtly; or that the tone may be built up indirectly by a series of choices which all share the same potential component of meaning. I am particularly interested in the choices where the resonating component of meaning is less obvious; but in all cases, I would argue that the idea of resonance helps us to understand why a specific wording suggests itself to the writer as 'right' in preference to other possible choices: it is precisely because it has that component of meaning.

# 3. Resonance in text

To illustrate this in action, it will be useful to analyse a complete short text.

# Example Text 1

Providing magnificent views of the historic town of Frodsham, this split-level detached house has been carefully maintained and preserved. Features include dormer windows, double glazing, a patio and gardens. The ground floor of 1 Keswick Drive boasts a large entrance hall, dining room, lounge, kitchen and bathroom. There is also a bedroom. Upstairs are three more bedrooms. The fourth bedroom on the ground floor is available for conversion into a second bathroom or shower room if required. The rear garden offers a large patio area, and a useful timber shed. Frodsham is well serviced with local shops and leisure facilities, the M56 motorway is a few minutes drive away.

This is immediately recognisable as an estate agent's description of a house. If we set out to explain why it is so recognisable --why we know, for example, that it is not a description of a house from a novel, or from a personal letter-- there are certain points about the text which aid identification. Students with whom I have looked at this text normally pick out, amongst other things, particular lexical choices: apart from semi-technical lexis such as 'dormer windows', they see words such as 'features', 'boasts' and 'offers' as typical of the register. This is certainly true, but it begs the question of why they should be typical --after all, they could each equally well appear in other types of text. Part of the answer is that we need to look at the whole configuration of meanings around them: these are 'features' of a house (not, for example, of a person, or of a text); it is the house which 'boasts' the rooms and which 'offers' the patio. But beyond that, there is still the question of why it should be these words which have become conventionally associated with houses in this register.

To answer that question, it is useful to trace specific components of meaning which are shared by various lexical choices in the text. First, there are a number of words whose meanings inherently include a role that we can informally describe as the Beneficiary (in a more general sense than that used by Halliday 1994:144, but recognisably of the same kind). The most obvious are the verbs \*providing' (something for someone) and 'offers' (something to someone). Other words where the same implied feature is relatively easy to perceive are 'available' (for someone) and 'useful' (to someone). Perhaps less obvious are 'leisure facilities' (the difference from an alternative such as 'sports clubs' is that 'facilities' includes the meaning that they are there for people to use); and 'serviced' (it is to the people of Frodsham that the services are provided, not to the town itself).

A second component of meaning is that of Sensers in a mental process. Again, these are on a scale from obvious to less easily perceived. There must clearly be someone who may 'require' the conversion of the fourth bedroom; and the nominalisation 'views' includes at some level the notion of a human viewer. In addition, boasts' as it is used in the text can be divided into two main components: 'have/contain' $^ +$ 'be impressive (to someone)'. The person who feels impressed at what the ground floor contains cannot be made an explicit participant with this wording of the process (compare The ground floor will amaze you with its large entrance hall, etc.'), but is nevertheless present as a component available to resonate in the appropriate context. Finally, at a very implicit level, the word 'features' implies a Senser who judges that these are worthy of note (compare 'attributes' or simply 'the house has dormer windows, etc.', which would not have this component of meaning). These last two, 'boasts' and 'features', are particularly good examples of the way in which the phenomenon of resonance can draw on components of meaning that are so subsidiary that they may generally be overlooked: out of context or in a different context (cf. my own use of 'feature' in the paragraph above), the implication of the Senser would not necessarily be evoked; but in combination with the other choices in the text that component of meaning resonates, and contributes, even if only faintly, to the overall tone of the text.

The final component that belongs in this group is that of the Actor in a material process. Two nominalisations provide the clearest examples: in both 'conversion' and 'drive'there is an implied Actor (the converter and driver). But there is also a distant echo of activity in 'useful' (someone is using it), and perhaps in facilities'. The fact that these last two have already been included under the Beneficiary component is not a drawback -it is clear that words may have more than one component of meaning, any of which can be evoked depending on the context.

The three separate components of meaning outlined above all share the fact that they relate to a person who is never explicitly mentioned in the text: the person who potentially owns the house, who will benefit from its facilities, enjoy looking out of its windows, etc. I would argue that this person is at some level intended to be understood as 'you' -the reader. Advertisements frequently exploit an empty slot' in the transitivity roles, which the reader is invited to fill (Thompson 1996:73); and it appears that other persuasive texts -such as estate agents' descriptions-- tend to use the same device. The reasons why the slot is left empty can be partly understood if we rewrite such texts to make 'you' an explicit participant -for example:

# Example Text 1'

You could convert the fourth bedroom on the ground floor into a second bathroom or shower room if you required one. The rear garden offers you a large patio area, and a timber shed that you can make use of. You will have access to many local shops and leisure facilities in Frodsham; and it will only take you a few minutes to drive to the M56 motorway.

Apart from the inevitable clumsiness of some of the wording, imposed by my desire to keep as close to the original as possible, the rewriting makes it clear that taking the option of making you' an explicit participant creates a relatively crude effect in this context: the writer comes across as pushing a more insistent line, in a way that would seem more appropriate when the estate agent is actually showing the prospective buyers over the house (i.e. when the latter have already taken the next step of signalling their interest in the property).

As a whole, therefore, the text could be described as being descriptive in content but 'you'-oriented in tone. The links between this configuration of meanings and the purpose of the genre are fairly obvious: the writer is attempting to describe the house in a way which will attract the reader. It is worth stressing that this does not imply that the writer of this text set out consciously to create a way of conveying a particular view of the world, as Golding presumably did in writing The Inheritors. The choices for the estate agent were to a large extent already made by the previous house descriptions that s/he had read: these represent existing solutions to a communicative problem which s/he would call on, more or less consciously. Nevertheless, the likelihood is that the individual writer (and readers) would still recognize the wordings as hitting the right tone, because of the resonance set up by the meaning components analysed above.

With the estate agent text, it is relatively straightforward to recognize what is going on and why. In other texts, however, the tone, and the means by which it is created, may be less obvious. The following text comes at the start of the annual report of an international company, and is the open letter from the company chairman to the shareholders.? (The sentences are numbered for ease of reference in the analysis following).

# Example Text 2

# CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE

[1] Valeo took a decisive step forward in its international expansion in 1989 with the acquisition of Blackstone Corporation, Delanair Ltd. and G. Cartier Systemes. [2] These new members of our corporation have broadened our positions in the strategic markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, the United States and Mexico. [3] At a time when the global automotive industry is redeploying its forces worldwide, these acquisitions demonstrated Valeo's determination to meet the changing needs of its customers wherever they make cars and trucks.

[4] Today, over thirty thousand Valeo people are working in one hundred plants and technical centers in fifteen countries on four continents. [5] Their professional skills, entrepreneurial drive and dedication enable all of us to enter the new decade with confidence in our ability to seize emerging opportunities.

[6] Valeo also enjoyed sustained organic development over the year, led by remarkably firm demand in the automobile and truck markets.

[7] Capital outlays for productivity enhancement and capacity extension remained high, totalling nine per cent of sales. [8] To strengthen the Group's strategic capabilities in starters, security systems, clutches, friction materials and engine cooling systems, modern production units were brought on stream in France, West Germany, Brazil, the United States and South Korea. [9] We also stepped up our research and development efforts, particularly in automotive electronics. [10] More than two thousand Valeo employees now work in R&D, which had an operating budget of some FF800 million.   
[11] When combined with acquisitions, this internal growth helped drive a $1 9 \%$ increase in consolidated sales to FF19.5 billion. [12] Despite inflationary pressure on costs and aggressive price competition, consolidated net income was maintained at five percent of sales.   
[13] Although the continued implementation of our acquisitions-driven growth strategy increased our leverage over the year, growth in interest expense was limited by refinancing a portion of the debt through the April 1989 ssue of FF800 million in bonds with warrants attached. [14] As inflation increases worldwide and automobile demand begins to level off, 1990 should mark a year of consolidation that will allow Valeo to integrate its recent acquisitions, reduce its net debt and improve the competitiveness of its products. [15] By marshalling its strengths, your company will be better positioned than ever to rise to the challenges of the years ahead.

The primary purpose of this kind of text is not overtly persuasive in the same way as the estate agent's text, but is more broadly promotional: it is a \*public relations' text in which the writer seeks to construct a particular corporate image of the company. If we think of the context of the letter, one aim is likely to be to show that the company affairs are being managed as effectively as possible in the prevailing circumstances. An intuitively useful option for the writer is therefore to present the company as essentially in control -that is, acting with a purpose, which is achieved. However, things also inevitably go wrong at times-- inflation, falling markets, etc.; and the writer may well want to present those events as beyond control --not only the company's control but anybody's control. Thus we might expect resonances to be set up in the text concerned with control, with bringing about desired events or justifying a lack of control.

Halliday (1973, 1994) has argued that it is possible to view the experiential content of any clause from two perspectives. From the transitivity perspective, we look at whether the process expressed in the clause carries through to, and affects, a second participant or not. Thus, in a (simplified) clause from the text: 'Valeo will improve its competitiveness', the process of 'improving' is construed as produced by Valeo and affecting its competitiveness. From the other perspective, which Halliday calls the ergative perspective, we look at whether the event is construed as happening by itself or as caused by another participant. In ergative terms, its competitiveness is now seen as the entity in the clause through which the process of improving is realized (Halliday's term for this is the 'Medium' --see Halliday 1994:163), while Valeo's role is that of external causer (Agent). If a passive clause were used-- Its competitiveness will be improved--the event would still be represented as caused from outside, but with the Agent left unexpressed. However, the \*same' event could be represented as happening by itself, with no Agent involved: 'Its competitiveness will improve'. Many verbs in English are like 'improve' in that they can be used to refer to the same kind of process in either pattern ('X improved Y' or 'Y improved'); these are now generally called ergative verbs (see e.g. Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary 1987).

There is a good deal of controversy over the precise nature and extent of ergativity in English (e.g. Davidse 1992 argues that it has a much more restricted scope than Halliday allows). However, the underlying concept of agentiveness and non-agentiveness relates usefully to the potential components of meaning that I suggested above would be likely candidates for resonance in the example text. Ergative verbs such as 'improve' may be seen as inherently including the meaning component of $+ / .$ -agentiveness (even though this may not necessarily be evoked in certain contexts). Other verbs which do not have the same possibilities of alternation may nevertheless share the same potential component: to take a well-worn example, kill' is only used in the pattern 'X killed Y' but this can be analysed semantically as $^ { \mathfrak { \bullet } } \mathrm { x }$ acted as Agent in the process of Y dying'. Such verbs are thus available to resonate, in the right context, with those verbs which are more clearly agentive or non-agentive. (It is important to note that there are also verbs which do not share this component--see the discussion of 'work' below-- and which therefore cannot contribute to the resonance.)

It is immediately evident that the chairman's letter contains a number of ergative verbs with both agentive and non-agentive meanings: 'broadened' [2]; 'redeploying' [3]; 'strengthen' [8]; 'increased' [13]; 'increases', 'level off', 'integrate', 'reduce', ^improve' [14], \*marshalling' [15]. The list shows that there is a cluster of such verbs in the final paragraph. We can also include the final verb 'rise' [15], since it is so closely twinned with the agentive verb 'raise' that the two verbs together form a kind of ergative pair ( $^ { \circ } \mathbf { X }$ raises $\mathrm { Y } ^ { \bullet } = { } ^ { \bullet } \mathrm { X }$ acts as Agent in the process of Y rising'). We can begin the analysis with this final cluster.

The paragraph begins with two non-agentive clauses (^inflation increases' and 'demand levels off'). In both cases, the Medium ('inflation', 'demand') is something beyond the company's control: unwelcome events are happening by themselves in the world outside, providing the context in which the company must operate. It would be possible for these events to be presented as caused by external forces -e.g. \*the worldwide recession increases inflation'. However, this would weaken the effect constructed in the rest of the text, where Valeo appears as the only active causer of events in a largely hostile world of natural (i.e. not deliberately caused) events.

There is then a marked shift to processes which share the component of agentiveness, with the company as Agent (Valeo integrates acquisitions, reduces debt, improves competitiveness, marshals strengths'). Against the background of the unwelcome events, the writer here presents the company as controlling its own affairs through purposefully causing beneficial states to come about. It is worth noting that the change from non-agentive to agentive clauses is marked by the verb 'allow'. The outside events do not 'cause' Valeo to act in certain ways --the company is definitely not controlled by these events; they merely provide a context in which the company can exert its agency and control.

In the final sentence of the text, the last process ([your company]... to rise') is non-agentive. It presents a future in which the company no longer needs to control events: having successfully exerted its controlling agency in the present difficult situation, it will be in a position to let events happen by themselves, because those events are certain to be beneficial.

The image presented in the last paragraph, of purposeful control by the company in adverse, self-generating conditions, in fact resonates through the whole text, gaining strength as the text proceeds. However, much of the construction of the image is done by slightly less obvious means than in the last paragraph. As noted above, there are only a few ergative verbs in the other paragraphs. However, there are other verbs which have a potential component of agentiveness which is activated, albeit unobtrusively, by the context: 'brought on stream' [8] $\left[ = \right.$ 'caused to come on stream'); 'stepped up' [9] $\mathbf { \zeta } = \mathbf { \zeta } \cdot \mathbf { \zeta }$ caused to go up'); 'drive' [11] $^ { \prime } =$ 'cause to come about'); maintained' [12] $\stackrel {  } { = }$ 'caused to remain'); 'limited' [13] $\stackrel {  } { = }$ 'caused to not grow'). In all of these, the company or aspects of the company may be seen as Agent (explicit or implied) causing desirable results to happen. In pursuing the analysis, it is also necessary to take account of agentiveness as a meaning component of other forms apart from verbs: in particular, nominalisations. There are a number which are metaphorical expressions of ergative processes with Valeo as the explicit or, more often, implied Agent: 'enhancement', 'extension' [7]; implementation', 'growth' [13]; 'consolidation' [14].

In each of the cases mentioned above, the Medium is connected with the reason for Valeo's existence: its capacity to produce and sell goods effectively. (In the nominalisations, the wording needs to be unpacked to show this meaning: e.g. 'productivity enhancement' is understood as '[we] enhanced productivity'). The general tone of the text is therefore of the company as acting purposefully to bring about the desired results.

As the counterpart to this main resonance, there is a less sustained contrasting tone of non-agentiveness which is mostly associated with a different type of Medium. Apart from the instances in [14] mentioned above, in [7] a non-agentive verb --'remained' (compare agentive 'maintained')- is used. The Medium in this clause is 'capital outlays': although the outlays were for a good cause (for 'productivity enhancement' and 'capacity extension'), they were nevertheless outlays --an inherently unwelcome event in business. It is noticeable that the outlays are not presented as deliberately caused by the company. This is highlighted when we compare 'remained' with the agentive 'stepped up' in [9], where the Medium is the more positive 'research and development efforts'; and even more strikingly with the agentive match for 'remain', 'maintained' in [12], where the Medium is the highly desirable 'income' (and the understood Agent is, of course, the company). The contrast between 'outlays remained high' and income was maintained' (note the effect if the verbs are swapped around) is strong evidence in favour of the analysis presented here: they suggest fairly clearly that the writer is working with an agentive image of the company and reflecting that in his choices of wording.

There are also a few non-agentive nominalisations with Valeo as Medium: 'expansion' [1]; 'development' [6]; growth' [11]. These near-synonyms can be seen as preparing unobtrusively for the final non-agentive verb of the text ('rise'). One effect of nominalisation is to treat the nominalised process as a fact and no longer open to challenge (Hodge and Kress 1993:26-27); a process encoded as a verb, on the other hand, is in essence a new claim about the world and therefore challengeable -compare [Valeo's] international expansion' in [1] (a fact) with 'Valeo has expanded internationally' (which would be a claim by the writer). The process in the final clause of the text is encoded as a verb, but it is made less easy to challenge by the fact that the positive view of what is happening to Valeo (it is expanding, developing, growing) has already been encoded at three points in the text by nominalisations.

The two complementary components of agentivity and non-agentivity thus resonate through the text. Before discussing the general implications, however, there is one further aspect of the image of the business world being constructed in this text which is worth commenting on. In some ways, sentence [4] seems oddly inconsequential in the text. Why are these 'Valeo people' mentioned in this way as 'working'? The main function of the sentence seems to be to inform the reader of the size of Valeo's workforce; but a more 'normal' way of expressing this might be to use an existential sentence: 'Today, there are over thirty thousand Valeo people...'. The clause actually used is genuinely intransitive --i.e. it does not include a component of (non-)agentiveness. The presence of 'enable' in the following sentence points to a possible explanation of what is going on. The verb 'enable', like 'allow' in [14], is in some senses the opposite of 'cause'. It is used to present one event as providing a context in which it is possible for the other to take place but not directly causing it to happen: indeed, it signals that the relationship is definitely not causal.

What is happening here is that the individual people working for the company are being excluded from the purposeful agency which is being attributed to the company as a whole. It is noticeable that this is reinforced by the fact that the only other time the individuals are mentioned --'employees' in [10]- the same verb, 'work', is used again. The propositions relating to the employees therefore do not contribute to the resonance associated in the rest of the text with the company as a whole. The people carry out an activity which is not encoded as having a direct effect on the world around them (let alone as causing other things to happen). However, their purposeless activity does have a beneficial result (though the language does not ascribe to them any intention to produce this result): it places the company in a position to act agentively on the world.

At this point, we can return to [15], the end of the text, and note the sudden appearance of the first and only direct reference to the reader (your company'). This leads us to see that the text is identifying a set of three participants in the success of Valeo: the workers ((they'), the company management ('we/Valeo') and the shareholders (you'). Each is assigned a different role in the world being constructed. The workers in the company toil blindly, without conscious purpose. On the basis of their work, we', the company managers, are in a position to act purposefully on the world and cause beneficial things to come about despite the potentially harmful things which happen around us. And you', the shareholders, are the final beneficiaries, owning a company to which good things happen (it 'rises to challenges') because of 'our' successful actions.

With the discussion of 'people working', and, to a lesser extent, of nonagentiveness contrasted with the main tone of agentiveness, we are close to the concepts of prominence and foregrounding outlined at the start of this paper: the effect of excluding the employees from purposeful agentiveness depends on the contrast of the choices in [4] and [10] with the textual norms established by the other choices. However, though we are recognizably dealing with the same kind of phenomenon, it seems clear that the effect is not consciously worked for, as the terms 'prominence' and 'foregrounding' imply. It is, I would argue, more plausible to see the effect as arising from the writer's intuitive feeling that certain wordings contribute to a tone that is appropriate in this kind of text. The overall image of successful agentiveness is an understandable aim for this writer, as is the fairly systematic presentation of a hostile self-generating environment. On the other hand, the way in which the economic status quo is fairly brutally reflected in the roles assigned to workers, managers and shareholders seems most likely to be unintended. The term 'resonance' has the advantage that it is neutral as to the degree of conscious exploitation of language choices. Another advantage is that it rests on the idea of potential meaning components being activated in particular contexts (with the likelihood that in similar contexts similar components will be activated). This provides a more concrete and generalisable approach to analysing how and why writers make particular choices of wording.

# 4. Resonance and a componential approach

Having looked in detail at examples of resonance in action, it is worth examining how the phenomenon of resonance fits in with other ways of looking at how texts are worded. On the whole, interrelated lexical choices in text have been seen in terms of their role in establishing cohesion, either through entering into different types of patterns of repetition to indicate continuity of topic (see e.g. Hasan 1984, Hoey 1991a, 1991b, on lexical repetition and cohesive harmony), or through signalling different types of connection and patterning between parts of the text (see e.g. Hoey 1983, on lexical signals of the Problem-Solution pattern). Resonance, on the other hand, relates to aspects which permeate the experiential meanings of text: these contribute to the perception of the text's coherence, in that they provide a consistent tone, but they do not have a textual meaning in the way that cohesive signals of repetition and conjunction do. If anything, resonance seems to be a prosodic feature and thus related to interpersonal meanings, in that it is a 'continuous form of expression, often with indeterminate boundaries' (Halliday 1994:35): just as, in the expression of modality, evaluation and other interpersonal meanings, the 'same' meaning can appear at a number of different places in the clause, so resonance is essentially the expression of the 'same' meaning at different places in the text.

This formulation links the present discussion with the approach taken by Fries (1990). In his analysis of an argumentative text, Fries elaborates on the concept of components of meaning in a text which influence the wordings at various points across the whole text. The writer of the text which Fries analyses is arguing that the pressure group of which he is a member should concentrate its efforts on restricted, focused issues rather than a broad range of issues. Fries shows that this argument is not evoked explicitly at any point, but influences a number of the writer's choices including, for example, the determiners in certain nominal groups: when the writer refers to the issues that he thinks the pressure group should concentrate on, he chooses those issues... that have formed the core of our agenda for years' rather than the grammatically acceptable alternative the issues' precisely because those' is more restrictive than 'the' and thus corresponds to (tones in with) his general message about the need to restrict the number of issues that the group takes on.

Fries focuses explicitly on nominal groups, since he is interested in the way that writers evoke arguments through 'the choice of wordings they use to refer to the referents mentioned in the text' (1990:364); but the approach could easily be extended to other parts of the text. He describes the phenomenon that he is examining as a non-exhaustive patterning of widely interspersed realizations of principled choices' (p. 377), a description which could well be applied to resonance. In both approaches, there is a move away from relying solely on the usual oversimple but appealing view of meanings as unfolding linearly through the text in parallel with wordings as shown in Fig. 1.

![](img/2e176731495b647b7bba559240d2eee737b99204a4ab84b3d5ee25d91c01c10b.jpg)  
Figure 1. Linear unfolding of meanings in a text

Instead, this is supplemented by the (equally oversimple but appealing) view of meanings also being expressed by wordings at various points in the text, with different meanings being expressed by the same wording and the same meaning being expressed by different wordings, as in Fig. 2.

![](img/05a3845924da3f874efa109060e0e4a7c1f2677ead17810807db7e2af8c5b805.jpg)  
Figure 2. Non-linear expression of meanings in a text

Thus both approaches appear to have a great deal in common. The main difference in substance between Fries' componential approach and my concept of resonance is that Fries is working from the meanings and attempting to explain the wordings that can be chosen to express them, whereas I am starting from the wordings and attempting to explain what meanings they have been chosen to express. This results in differences in methodology and emphasis, but the outcomes are broadly similar. However, there is another important difference, in the kind of metaphor that we have each chosen as a basis for exploring the phenomenon. Fries, perhaps because his insights were inspired by work that he was doing on a project to generate text by computer, has opted for the idea of a componential analysis. This involves seeing meanings as discrete elements (which would therefore be more easily manipulated automatically by a computer), rather as they are shown in Fig. 2 above. The componential approach provides a relatively static, synoptic view of the text which privileges the relationship between each individual choice of wording and the pre-determined meaning that it is expressing. Such a visualisation has its attractions $- \mathrm { I }$ myself have resorted to talking about components of the meaning of lexical choices. However, while the meanings of individual wordings which contribute to the resonance may usefully be seen in componential terms, I feel that at text level, as I have suggested above, the effect is more prosodic. Resonance relies on cumulative repetition and reinforcement: it is not the individual choices which are important but the relationship of the choices to each other as they appear through the unfolding text. The analyses of the two example texts above have inevitably obscured this to some extent, because I was concerned to group the choices that shared common components in order to illustrate my argument. Nevertheless, the metaphor of resonance between choices is deliberately intended to reflect a dynamic, process-oriented view of the text (see Ravelli 1995, on arguments for adopting a dynamic perspective on lexicogrammatical choices): this perhaps becomes clearer if we go back to the texts and try to imagine their effect on first-time readers for whom the tone builds up progressively as they read through the text. The two perspectives are therefore complementary; but both are needed for an understanding of how the choices are interconnected.

# 5. Conclusion

As Figures 1 and 2 above suggest, albeit in simplistic terms, meanings get construed by texts in a variety of ways. Resonance is, I believe, a useful metaphor for looking at the phenomenon in texts whereby a certain aspect of the meaning of a choice of wording, which may in other contexts be muted or unnoticed, makes that choice more likely for the text producer because in the context it resonates, or tones in, with other choices which together construe one of the messages that the text as a whole is intended to convey. Resonance is not a lexicogrammatical system, in the way that transitivity is: rather it is a communicative strategy at discourse level (it would seem to fit comfortably into the discourse semantics stratum as envisaged by Martin 1992). It is also important to emphasize that it is only one aspect of experiential meaning in text: the propositional meaning associated with the clause-by-clause approach shown in Figure 1 remains central in experiential terms. However, since resonance has a direct effect on how lexicogrammatical choices are made and understood, it is an aspect that needs to be considered in a full account of how texts go about the business of construing meanings.

# CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS MEANINGS AND REALIZATIONS IN TWO GENRES

THOMAS BLOOR Aston University, Language Studies Unit

# Abstract

This paper examines the nature of conditional expressions using data sources from two genres which have a predictably high incidence of conditionals: economics forecasts and linguistic philosophy research articles. The paper's main focus is on the lexicogrammatical and textual realizations of conditionals and the range of semantic options available, expressed systemically. This involves a consideration of the conditional's overlap with modality (hedging) and, less significantly, clauses of purpose. Also examined are extended hypothetical constructs, which, though generally neglected in discussions of conditionals, are shown to parallel conditionals within the clause-complex and are strikingly common in the philosophy articles under examination. A discoursal text-management explanation is offered for this phenomenon. The paper builds on a model of conditionals first outlined in Bloor and Pindi (1987) and Pindi (1988).

# 1. Introduction

Conditionals have attracted extensive discussion in the field of philosophy (for example, Jackson 1991) and some in ESP-oriented discourse analysis (for example, Horsella & Sindermann (1992) on argumentation in scientific discourse).

It is well known that there are register variations in the use of conditionals. Legal texts have long been the focus of many studies along these lines. Crystal and Davy mention the frequent occurrence of the form $i f X ,$ then Z shall do Y in legal statutes (1969:203); Hiltunen (1983) observed that $71 \%$ of dependent clauses in legal text were if-clauses as against $5 3 \%$ in science and $3 5 . 6 \%$ in journalism; this ties in with the findings of Hare (1993), who identified if as the sixth most frequent lexical item in a legal textbook corpus. Other scholars have focused on economics texts: Mead and Henderson (1983) comment on types of conditional in economics texts; Pindi (1988) and Pindi and Bloor (1987) examined economics forecasts in terms of how predictions are modulated by hedges, conditions and attributions. To the best of my knowledge, no analysis has been done on the use of conditionals (as opposed to the discussion of them) in philosophy articles though they loom very large there.

This paper does not attempt any statistical analysis, nor is it concerned, except indirectly, with the issues addressed by philosophers with an orientation towards formal logic, in particular the problem of truth-values of counterfactuals; it is concerned with conditionals and related hypothetical meanings in natural language and, particularly, in written text. The data discussed come from two disparate genres: economics forecasts and philosophical research papers. What these two genres have in common is an abundance of hypothetical constructs.

Bloor (1996) discusses extended hypothetical structures in philosophy articles. The present paper focuses mostly on more straightforward conditionals in the same corpus with some references to the economics forecasting corpus of Pindi (1988). The emphasis in the numbered examples here and in all the cited data is mostly my own. Sources throughout are given as 'Pindi' referring to the economics forecasting corpus and ML' referring to Mind & Language. Where I have invented an example to make a point of comparison or to 'unpack' the meaning, the item is labelled 'constructed'.

# 2. Conditionals in economics forecasts

Pindi and Bloor (1987) identified the following types of condition as playing an important role in a corpus of economics forecasting texts in English. The emphasis in the numbered examples here and in all the following data is mostly my own. Sources throughout are given as 'Pindi' referring to the economics forecasting corpus and ML referring to Mind & Language.

A The sufficient condition, where the fulfilment of the prediction follows from the realization of the condition but could result from other conditions (typically if p).   
(1) At the same time the economic recovery now underway may not be sufficiently vigorous if real rates of interest persist. (Pindi)   
B The necessary condition, where the fulfilment of the prediction needs the condition to be met (typically only if p, i.e. the logicians iff).   
(2) Therefore, a fall in Dutch money rates or the dollar can be affected only if US interest rates fall further or the dollar starts its long awaited downtrend. (Pindi)   
C The enhancing condition, whereby the realization of the condition would

increase the chances of the prediction's fulfilment, but is not necessary for it (typically especially if p).

(3) From their present level of around $1 1 \%$ , some further modest easing in long-term rates is possible especially if the election result leads to a further strengthening of the exchange rate. (Pindi)   
D The concessive condition, where the realization of the condition would fail to block the prediction's fulfilment, notwithstanding its contrary force (typically even if p).   
(4) Even if they ease in the first half of the year, US rates are unlikely to show a downward trend [...]. (Pindi)   
(5) Even if some deterioration in the payments occurs, the Treasury will have no difficulty in the next few months in financing its deficit in the capital market. (Pindi)

This is not meant to be a full taxonomy of conditionals. There is for example no consideration of the counter-factual condition, which so preoccupies philosophers working in this area; for example, if I had known (but I didn't). Counterfactual conditions do occur in the forecasting data, but they are rare and, selfevidently, they never occur as conditions on predictions. A professional forecaster cannot make a prediction contingent on something known not to be the case. I have nothing at all to say about conditions in formal logic, which are probably different from conditionals in text. As Levinson says,

[...] there is now good reason to think that natural language if... then cannot be equated with logical $ { } _ { : }$ the material conditional. (Levinson 1983:141)

Though no doubt the items categorized by Pindi and Bloor are widespread in various text types, the list is rather a classification in terms of the conditionals which have a bearing on predictions in that particular corpus. Since the game played by the authors of those texts is prediction rather than logical argumentation, there is rarely any clause corresponding to minor premise (i.e. assertion of p) or conclusion (therefore q) because in a prediction both p and q are by definition in the future and hence hypothetical. The prediction is simply the major premise. It seems likely that this is the usual form of conditional in natural language as opposed to formal logic. Any use of logical formulation in this paper is therefore only a borrowing from formal logic or an analogy with it.

It is not always possible to distinguish the B-type (necessary condition) from the A-type (sufficient condition) since in natural language only is often omitted, but the distinction can usually be inferred from the linguistic context or the context of situation. Levinson (1983:144) claims that if-conditionals \*invite' the inference 'if and only if' but, since he is talking about pragmatic implicatures, presumably he would allow for defeasibility. Also, the choice of the word 'invites' is significant in its calculated vagueness.

The enhancing condition (C) simply adds to the probability that the prediction will be fulfilled. Thus its effect is very different from that of the A-type and Btype, for the implication is that the prediction will ( $+ / -$ epistemic modality) be fulfilled regardless of the condition, but if the condition is met, then the certainty of the prediction is increased. The term 'enhancing' was an unfortunate choice, given that in Systemic Functional Grammar terminology all these types of conditional clause are enhancing (Halliday 1994:232 ff.). Perhaps a better term might be supplementing or reinforcing; the point is that the condition here is explicitly not essential to the fulfilment of the prediction expressed in the consequent, and the writer signals that the prediction can stand without the condition, even though the condition might be expected to help in the fulfilment of the prediction.

The concessive condition (D) is the least like a logical conditional. It suggests that the prediction is secure and that the proposition expressed in the condition clause cannot affect it even though it might be expected to do so.

Pindi and Bloor posited a fifth type, the antithetical condition, where the condition is sufficient to cancel or endanger the prediction. This was to accommodate the following type of utterance in the text.

(6) Because of this, the Belgian franc may see its position strengthen somewhat against the D-mark, thus allowing some reduction in the excessively high 5-6 point rate differential. However, there would be little scope for a decline in short term rates $i f$ Eurodollars were to rise further. (Pindi) (Analysis: Probably p, but if q probably not p).

It seems to me now that this may not be fundamentally distinct from the first or second type. There is some discoursal significance, no doubt, in the fact that the prediction is first presented unconditionally, and then, in a separate clause complex, a counter-prediction is made with the condition attached. Grammatically, the if-clause is dependent on the dominant clause in the second sentence, and so is a straightforward sufficient condition. Discoursally, though, the whole of the second clause complex is adversely set against the first (the major prediction). But a similar message could be conveyed by the following paraphrase:

(6a) [...] the Belgian franc may see its position strengthen somewhat against the D-mark, thus allowing some reduction in the excessively high 5-6 point rate differential unless Eurodollars rise further. (Constructed)

Such structures with unless are frequent in the corpus. For example:

(7) German money rates could, therefore, ease somewhat again in the course of the next few months unless the recent improved monetary situation in the US proves shortlived. (Pindi)   
(8) Additional monetary relaxation and thus a further easing of German money market rates in the next few months is, therefore, improbable unless US interest rates come down from their present high levels [...]. (Pindi)

These are alternative forms for negative if-clauses and there is no particular reason to place them in a separate category. Either or both the condition and the consequent can be negated, and clearly the difference between negative and affirmative is crucial, but the clause relation is not fundamentally affected by negation.

# 3. Mind & Language: the register of philosophical argumentation

Bloor (1996) looks at a set of related research articles in the journal Mind & Language, which address the topic of the nature of beliefs, and more particularly the notions of 'narrow content' and 'broad content' as constructs for explaining mental states and/or behaviour. The discourse leans heavily on certain extended hypothetical constructs, which I shall return to below. These articles represent an ongoing debate among a group of philosophers -a fairly small group to judge from the citations. There is relatively little exploitation of formal logic notation, in fact none in most of the articles examined, and the articles bear little resemblance, at least superficially, to scientific genres of the kinds examined by analysts such as Swales (1990) and Halliday and Martin (1993) or economics research papers (Dudley-Evans 1993; Bloor and Bloor 1993, inter alios).

As one might expect, however, there are plentiful examples of if-then structures of the same kind as those found in formal argumentation, compare Sufficient Condition and Necessary Condition (above).

(9) For if we infer from 'rattling snake' to 'dangerous', then this inference is part of the inferential role of 'rattling snake'. (ML) (10) If narrow content is to be of any psychological use, then statements about narrow content should support counterfactuals. (ML)

Sometimes we find grammaticaily and conceptually simple instances, like the two examples in the next text fragment:

(11) Weight is a property which varies from one situation to another: if I were on Mars, I would weigh less than I do; if I were on Venus, I would weigh more. (ML)

More frequently, they contain clause complexes or embeddings or are themselves embedded or part of a dependent structure. The following is a fairly straightforward example of paratactic if-clauses:

(12) If induction plays a role in belief change, and induction depends on the semantic properties of the beliefs involved, then content is central to the explanation of changes in belief. (ML)

But more typical in its complexity perhaps is the following:

(13) For unless the characteristics the expert uses to distinguish water from XYZ are the very characteristics that make the two substances water and XYZ, there will be a possible world in which the characteristics the expert associates with water and uses to distinguish it from XYZ are possessed instead by XYZ (and vice versa), and in which a doppelganger of our Earthly expert believes that lakes contain XYZ (which he, of course, calls 'water'). (ML)

Hard though it may be for the average reader to process this extract, it is nevertheless a straightforward conditional of the $i f$ not $p$ then $q$ pattern, the 'necessary condition' type (if and only if not p then q).

The issue of complexity has implications for the choice of realizations of condition, which will be returned to in Section 6 of this chapter.

# 4. Modality and conditions

The insertion of the Modal Adjuncts in my gloss on the earlier example (probably not q but if p then possibly q) is unlike formal logic models but is, unsurprisingly, very typical of the semantics of economics forecasting texts in English, where hedging is commonplace and $i f .$ -then arguments are less likely to take the unmodulated form ifp then q than something like: if p then probably $q$ or if p then possibly q.

Unsurprisingly, hedging of this kind is very much in evidence in economics forecasting in English but is rarer in the philosophy data, and conditionals themselves, as Pindi and Bloor (1987) argue, have much in common with hedges in that the conditional expansion typically places limitations on the certainty of the proposition expressed in the dominant clause. (See also Pindi 1988:211). Halliday and Hasan make this point very explicitly and indicate the connection with the alternative realization of the conditional through inversion in the Mood: F^S, where F is a modal finite:

Likewise we can interpret if he's right as a modality, similar to 'possibly he's right: in that case...'; and again there is a modalized form or the expression of a conditional: should he be right, ... (Halliday and Hasan 1976:135-136)

There are in English some exceptional conditionals which more overtly realize a kind of modal function, conveying the meaning if I'm right. In conversational English, these are fairly common. Formulaic conditional clauses frequently express interpersonal meanings of a modal kind: epistemic modality in such forms as: if I'm not mistaken, if my eyes don't deceive me, unless I'm barking up the wrong tree (compare the paratactic structure: I could be wrong but [...] or the effectively modal projecting structure: I think I'm right in saying [..J). Arguably, please is a vestigial form of the conditional if it please you. Deontic modality occurs in such expressions as if I may or if I might or if you must (often with no explicit Predicator). (In face to face interaction, some of these expressions may even occur, without a consequent or other co-text, relating to a physical action: e.g. If I may [opening the windowl).

Such expressions are not normally found in economics forecasts, where clausal modality is more likely to take the form of an expansion clause dependent on the conditional: Beta, Gamma, Alpha, where the Beta-clause is the conditional, i.e. If p, as we predict, then q. That is to say it is the conditional clause itself that is hedged. The modality is very explicit here, too, since it overtly expresses the writer's commitment to the probability of the condition (the latter being a prediction in the first instance below; a logical premise in the second).

(14) If, as we anticipate, the strike is not extended, prices will rise only slowly in the final quarter. (Beta<<Gamma>> Alpha)

However, such modalities are more frequent in my philosophy data. For example:

(15)  If, as we have claimed, the connection between compositionality and analyticity is internal, this result hardly comes as a surprise. (ML)

The expression of the condition in these instances is not always so overtly interpersonal as to use first person pronoun, but, as in the following example, the import is similar.

(16) Narrow content, ifthere is such a thing, ought to say what my Twin-Earth counterpart and I share [...]. (ML)

The epistemic modality here is focused on the presupposition that narrow content' exists. Its effect is to play around with the information structure of the clause on which it is dependent by casting doubt on the existence of the entity presupposed -or at least, indicating that its existence is not to be taken as a given. Philosophers are no doubt especially alert to the dangers of rash presupposition in light of the historic disputes on this issue, involving such luminaries as Russell and Strawson and the non-existent 'King of France'. The co-operative principle, relevance considerations or common sense lead us to assume that an entity referred to in an utterance exists unless we are explicitly operating in a fictional world or we explicitly cancel the presupposition. The conditional expansion here supplies that cancellation; it says, in effect, that the writer is not committed to the truth of the presupposition, but is tentatively going along with it for the purposes of the argument.

More difficult to construe is the following utterance:

(17) [..] beliefs, if they play a role at all, should be individuated syntactically rather than semantically; [...]. (ML)

Clearly, this has some epistemic force, but this time the writer indicates his non-commitment to the otherwise assumed relevance of the entity (beliefs) to the issue under discussion (explaining behaviour). Suppose we paraphrase it as:

(17a) I am not sure that beliefs play a role at all: if they do, beliefs should be individuated syntactically rather than semantically. (Constructed data)

This changes the weighting of the propositions and thus alters the meaning though it does capture the modality to some extent. The thematic structure of the original with the Nominal Group beliefs as Theme, and the doubts about relevance expressed as a dependent clause placed parenthetically after it, almost put the condition on a par with an Adjunct. It is a less straightforward case, but it seems that this too has some of the meaning normally identified with modal finites or Modal Adjuncts.

A more striking example of a modally-charged conditional, with the clause in Theme position, is to be found in the following example. The conditional clause in question expands on a further conditional clause complex.

(18) If what I have been saying so far is correct, then if we were to explicitly formulate a theory of narrow content, we would need a psychosemantics explaining wide content in order to ground the notion of narrow content. (ML)

The modality here operates in two directions: anaphorically to the previous text indicating epistemic reservations about the truth of the observations and cataphorically towards the clause complex which dominates it, indicating the epistemic certainty (logical inevitability) of the dominant clause complex (its consequent), given the correctness of the observations in question.

# 5. Realizations

Most of the examples given above involve the conjunction if. In an article of twenty-three pages Brown uses twenty-three if-clauses and three unless-clauses. Block uses forty-six if-clauses in a twenty-five-page article. I have not yet done any sort of computational analysis, but this indicates a very high incidence of ifclauses in the data.

But many alternative realizations of conditions can be found. In both types of text we find a few (very few) instances of the $\mathsf { F } ^ { \wedge } \mathsf { S }$ modality referred to above as mentioned by Halliday & Hasan (1976).

(19) Should the D.Mark strengthen by less against the dollar than we are expecting over the next six months, the pressures for an adjustment will be reduced. (Pindi)   
(20) Should they pull back from a commitment to it, they would have to show how, without it, they can derive the analyticity of the inference from \*rattling snakes' to "dangerous" [...]. (ML)

Many grammars list assuming and provided along with if as conditional clause subordinators. In the forecasting corpus, we find the lexical item assume and its derivations substituting for if, sometimes with a finite projection clause, sometimes with a non-finite clause (P-bound) and sometimes with nominalization of assume and/or of the process in the condition, as in the second and third examples below (compare Halliday and Martin (1993), Halliday (1994) on grammatical metaphor in scientific writing):

(21) Assuming that current labour disputes in German industry are satisfactorily resolved, money market rates can be expected to stabilize around present levels or even ease slightly [...]. (Pindi)   
(22) On the assumption of a continuation of present policies, GNP growth is currently forecast at 4 per cent [..]. (Pindi)   
(23) Assuming unchanged policies, GDP growth may continue at about the same rate [...]. (Pindi)

Provided is perhaps usually an essential condition (if and only if), as it is in this example:

(24) Over a medium term horizon, the consequence of providing some extra support for a short period may not loom large in terms of the trends of inflation, provided the extra support is withdrawn in a timely fashion. (Pindi)

Given (that ) often seems to be paraphrasable as $i f ,$ as a large number of grammars attest. In terms of hypotheticality, an $i f .$ clause can express a proposition that is (i) a true fact, (ii) a hypothetical (in the sense of the truth being uncertain) or (iii) a counterfactual (the last of these involving a different kind of hypotheticality).

accepted truth conditional possible hypothetical counterfactual (impossible)

Clauses with given, in my data, seem to correspond exclusively to the first kind. Here, they have the meaning since $p$ is the case; that is, they relate to a clause of reason. More often than not, the clause does not involve an embedded fact-clause, the prototypical structure, but consists of Given $^ +$ Nominal Group. (A case could be made for analysing it as prepositional phrase at Adjunct, with given regarded as a preposition; given that in finite clauses could be analysed either as a verb or as a binding conjunction).

(25) Given that I accept wide contents, if Boghossian is right, I will have to accept facts of the matter about analytic relations [...]. (ML)

(26) Given the fall in real earnings and employment and the higher tax burden, real household disposable income may decline slightly. (Pindi)   
(27) Given the need to finance the large public sector deficit, the private sector will bear the brunt of monetary restraint [...]. (Pindi)   
(28) On the proposal we are considering, however, given the usual semantics for counterfactuals, it will turn out instead that [...]. (ML)

Sometimes a hypothetical (possible) condition is realized by a prepositional phrase as Adjunct.

(29) With no further fall in the saving ratio, private consumption could rise by 1.5 per cent. (Pindi)

There is a clear parallel here with an if-existential-process clause:

(29a)  If there is no further fall in the saving ratio, private consumption could rise by 1.5 per cent. (Constructed)

A more oblique indicator of hypotheticality is the item any. In economics forecasts it functions in this way when (if and only if ?) it functions as modifier in a Nominal Group as Topical Theme:

(30) Certainly any premature reactivation of 'idled' capacity will dilute the benefits of a demand upturn and SDR-denominated prices are expected to rise by a fairly modest $12 \%$ this year. (Pindi)

The relation of this to a more conventional realization by an if-clause can be illustrated by comparing it with the following examples:

(31) If the battery market shrinks, this will affect the supply of scrap, most of which is derived from discarded batteries. (Pindi)   
(32) [...] and if there is a recovery in economic growth, it will be weak: under 2 per cent. (Pindi)

These can be comfortably paraphrased by exchanging the forms as follows:

(30a)  Certainly if idled' capacity is prematurely reactivated, this will dilute the benefits of a demand upturn [...]. (Constructed)   
(31a) Any shrinkage in the battery market will affect the supply of scrap, most of which is derived from discarded batteries. (Constructed)   
(32a) Any recovery of economic growth will be weak: under 2 per cent. (Constructed)

A more problematic type of conditional is the following:

(33)  Fairly clearly, if the notion of narrow content is to have any purchase, it should characterize belief states in this sense [...]. (ML)

The primary force of the expansion here is not as a parenthetical modality on the dominant clause (as discussed in Section 4 above) or an essential or sufficient condition, but, I suspect, primarily or saliently, ideational; it could be paraphrased as a modalizing clause (I am not sure if the notion of narrow content has any purchase etc.), but the discrepancy between the paraphrase and the force of the original would be greater than that between similar pairs in Section 4. In some respects this semantically resembles a purpose clause. Compare the paraphrase below:

(33a) (In order) for the notion of narrow content to have any purchase, it should characterize belief states in this sense [...]. (Constructed)

The last example suggests a degree of fuzziness between condition and purpose clauses. The if-clause in the next example bears this out in reverse:

(34) To say that someone must regard a certain sentence as true, if he is to mean this by that, is not the same as saying that the sentence is true. (ML)

If we simply examine the first projection, (34a)  someone must regard a certain sentence as true, if he is to mean this by that we find that the if-clause transposes easily into the purpose clause with little effect on the ideational meaning:

(34b) someone must regard a certain sentence as true in order to mean this by that. (Constructed)

We can perhaps go further and argue that the non-finite Predicator in the first projecting clause is semantically close to an if-clause. The following constructed example (ignoring the projected clause complex) is not a neat paraphrase but it is close.

(34c) If we say that {projection}, it is not the same as saying that the sentence is true. (Constructed)

I am not sure I would want to say that some if-clauses are purpose clauses or that some purpose clauses are conditionals, but there does seem to be an overlap.

The binder just in case seems to differ greatly in its technical use by philosophers and in its popular use. In logical discourse, it introduces a precise stipulation akin to if and only if.

(35) Now we can say that, for people $x$ and $y ,$ times $t$ and $t ^ { \prime }$ and worlds $w$ and w, $x$ at $t$ in $w$ is a doppelganger of y at $\pmb { t ^ { \prime } }$ in w' just in case TS $\mathbf { \Sigma } ( x , t , w ) = \mathrm { T S } \mathbf { \Sigma } ( y , t ^ { \prime } , w ^ { \prime } )$ (ML)

In non-technical English just in case seems to be rather vague and to mean something like on the off chance that, and even though the source is philosophical discourse, the next example from the same philosophy paper seems to realize the non-technical meaning.

(36) As Fodor asks before telling an abbreviated version of Putnam's Twin Earth story, 'Is there anyone who hasn't heard?' Just in case there is, I offer the reminder that Putnam's Twin earth is an imaginary planet far away, [...]. (ML)

This choice of an expression typical of an informal register is characteristic of much of the language in these papers, where colloquialisms, jokes and in-group references are rife.

Yet another realization of condition, the expression no matter how, is closely related in meaning to even if(concessive condition).

(37) [..] the motivation behind the notion of narrow content was to provide a sort of content all my replicas would share with me, no matter how differently all were situated. (ML)

The italicized clause could be paraphrased as:

(37a) even if they were all situated differently (to a greater or lesser degree)

Similarly the next example (38) could be paraphrased as (38a).

(38) [...] my beliefs would have had the same narrow content they do have no matter how different my environment was. (ML) (38a) even if my environment were (very) different. (Constructed)

(Compare also the lexical item regardless. No data).

One further realization I want to mention is the use of the lexical item suppose (or inflexions and derivations thereof). This is rare in the economics forecasting data (in contrast with theoretical economics texts), but a hot favourite for philosophers, especially to signal extended hypotheticals (see below). The first example of this is linked with a grammatically similar clause introduced by stipulating that. It is easy to convert these to if-clauses by simply substituting if for supposing that and stipulating that.

(39) Supposing that one cannot have beliefs about a substance without either being acquainted with it or knowing its essential nature [...] and stipulating that no one in $w 2$ speculates about the possible but unrealized substance H2O, we get the result that no one in $w 2$ has beliefs about water [...]. (ML)

# 6. Extended hypotheticals

The next example is close to an if-then complex, though it is presented as two sentences. The choice of the imperative suppose requires this.

(40) Suppose that on moving to London Pierre came to believe, not that London is not pretty but, again, that London is pretty. Then he believes the same proposition twice over. (ML)

The writer here might have opted for a clause complex with the -ing form, supposing. The reason for opting for the imperative is discoursal. This fragment occurs in an extended hypothetical construct in which alternative suppositions are posited. The reader is required to imagine a series of hypothetical situations within the same broad framework.

A striking feature of the Mind & Language articles is their exploitation of narrative structures, often involving a strong element of humour. I have referred to these elsewhere as tales, twin -Earth fantasies and imaginary conversations. (Bloor 1996) All of these are hypothetical constructs, explicable in two distinct ways: (i) practical considerations of argumentation and communicative pressures, and (ii) the sociology of this sub-community of academic philosophers. Discussion here is restricted to the items used to signal these extended hypothetical constructs.

When an if-then type of relation exists between larger chunks of text, incompatible with expression as a single sentence, the exploitation of the signal if is largely ruled out because of its word class (binding conjunction). The use of some alternative, non-binding signal permits more extended and complex conditions and consequents, which is not to say, however, that these non-binding items never occur with simpler combinations.

One option available is the one illustrated above (Example 40), using some lexical signal like suppose to introduce the 'condition' section and then to introduce the 'consequent' section in a separate sentence or text chunk. The writer signals the hypothetical status of the immediately subsequent text by explicitly inviting the reader to suppose or imagine some state of affairs (the 'condition'). Hence we find, often in the imperative mode (as well as suppose, which is by far the most frequent) such items as imagine, pretend, and consider Sometimes the signals are doubled up.

(41)First consider the case of the waterless world. Pretend that our world, $w _ { I , }$ contains an actual Twin Earth. (ML)

Here, both consider, and, more explicitly, pretend serve to indicate the hypotheticality of the proposition. The 'consequent' here is not particularly extensive, but it does consist of two sentences, with considerable embedding, starting with the adjunct then.

(42) Then in our world, those who believe that [lakes contain water] include not only those (like me) who believe that lakes contain water, but also my Twin, who believes that lakes contain XYZ. My Twin is included by virtue of being a doppelganger of someone, namely me, who believes that lakes contain water. (ML)

If all the above were presented in a clause complex with the \*condition' as an if-clause, it would be considerably harder to process. This is even more obviously true of the pairing which immediately follows the above.

(43) Now consider another world, $w _ { 2 , }$ which contains Twin Earth just as it is in $w _ { r } ,$ but does not contain Earth at all, and in which there is no water, only XYZ. (ML)

What follows this is an extended argument consequent upon the supposition of the hypothetical situation represented in the imperative clause. Not only is it lengthy and grammatically complex, but it also contains an embedded condition, grammatically a non-finite dependent clause complex signalled by the participle supposing.

(44) Supposing that one cannot have beliefs about a substance without either being acquainted with it or knowing its essential nature, and that you cannot be acquainted with what does not exist, and stipulating that no one in $w _ { 2 }$ has beliefs about water, so in particular no one believes that lakes contain water. Now, to determine the extension of 'believes that [p]' in w,[...]. (ML)

Most readers would gladly concede that the addition of an if-clause (Based on 43 above) in Thematic position could prove the last straw.

Another strategy for dealing with complicated conditions is to exploit metatextual nouns of the type labelled anaphoric nouns (Francis 1986), and also discussed as prospective and retrospective labels (Francis 1994). I do not claim to be adding anything to Francis's insightful analysis, but, as an ad hoc label, I prefer here the term metatextual noun (MN) because it is neutral with regard to anaphora and cataphora though, admittedly, the term is potentially open to a much wider interpretation. A MN is a lexical item which enables the writer to deal in a flexible way with a chunk of text by providing, as it were, a counter, an unanalysable substitute or stand-in for the relatively complex ideas of the chunk to which it refers (compare Halliday and Hasan's (1976) inclusion of idea in the broader category of general nouns). Typical MNs in the philosophy data are: account, apparatus, condition, example, explication, interpretation, notion, point, reading, thesis. They are by no means unique to conditionals, but they often enable the writer to express a much more detailed 'condition' than would be possible in an if-clause.

(45) The second thesis is that those features of mental states which play a genuine role in explaining behavior must be intrinsic features of the individual: they must supervene on the current internal physical states of the agent, which is to say they must not depend on the agent's environment, situation or context (except insofar as the environment causally affects the agent's intrinsic states). [...] If the second thesis is correct, then any feature of my mental states that, like the truth of known propositions, does not supervene on intrinsic facts about me will not be a feature that explains what I do. (ML)

The strategy used here is first to establish by means of a relational clause the labelling of the complex of ideas as the second thesis, making the label thematic and the argumentation rhematic (and new). The label the second thesis is then available for the construction of an easily processed conditional clause. In terms of purely theoretical structural possibilities (discounting discourse considerations, Chomsky style), one obvious alternative is to omit the first sentence altogether and present the content of the thesis as a discontinuous (extraposed) clause (or as a Nominal Group with embedded clause) as Subject (Theme) of the if-clause as in (45a) below. However, as can be seen from the constructed example below, this is a poor option as far as communication with the reader goes. These writers do not seem to put ease of reading at the top of their agenda, but there are limits sometimes.

(45a)  Ifit is correct that those features of mental states which play a genuine role in explaining behavior must be intrinsic features of the individual, and they must supervene on the current internal physical states of the agent, which is to say they must not depend on the agent's environment, situation or context (except insofar as the environment causally affects the agent's intrinsic states) [...], then any feature of my mental states that, like the truth of known propositions, does not supervene on intrinsic facts about me will not be a feature that explains what I do. (Constructed)

A less lexical example of the same phenomenon has been cited earlier and is repeated here.

(46) If what I have been saying so far is correct, then if we were to explicitly formulate a theory of narrow content, we would need a psychosemantics explaining wide content in order to ground the notion of narrow content. (ML)

In this case the embedded clause 'what I have been saying so far' serves the same function as what I am calling MNs, standing in for a very extended stretch of argumentation.

MNs can also be used in prepositional phrases as a kind of conditional Adjunct:

(47) On this reading, to find to find the people who actually believe that [p], we take all the people who actually believe that p and add all their actual doppelgangers; [..]. (ML) (48) On this reading, Stich's proposal clearly will not do. (ML) (49) On this second interpretation, x believes that [p] at t in $w$ [..]. (ML)

# 7. Conclusion

In spite of their long-standing appeal to philosophers, logicians, grammarians and other scholars, conditionals constitute a still relatively unresolved aspect of English grammar and use. Difficulties abound with regard to the proliferation of both lexicogrammatical realizations and the semantics that these realize.

It might be argued that the sensible way to approach the problem(s) is to hold one aspect constant, say the lexicogrammatical if-(then) structure) and then identify the meanings which it realizes. Or, alternatively, to take a given meaning such as the essential condition and pursue its various manifestations. This paper has wandered casually between the two approaches. Without making any excuses for this, except to say that this is an early days report on the work in question, it can be said that, in order to make any progress in describing these phenomena, the consideration of meaning must constantly inform any discussion of the lexicogrammatical realizations and, for anything approaching a comprehensive treatment, examination of actual occurrence in text is crucial.

That there is a significant gap between conditions in formal logic and in natural language is by now a given, which is not to say that useful parallels cannot sometimes be drawn. What we want to see is how 'conditional' meanings are created in text, how they make manifest the purposes of speakers and writers and how the lexicogrammatical choices realize them. This is quite a tall order. It requires not only macro-corpus work but, perhaps more significantly, detailed functional description at the micro-level. This paper has only hinted at variation between different genres and registers. The extent to which the meanings and forms discussed here are common to many varieties of English or restricted to the specific genres and registers -or even to the small group of writers- that provide the data awaits investigation, and there is no doubt a wealth of interesting work still to be done on conditionals across text-types.

# PRAGMATIC, STYLISTIC AND GRAMMATICAL LIMITATIONS ON CHOICE A STUDY OF CAUSE-EFFECT SIGNALLING IN ENGLISH

MICHAEL P. JORDAN Queen's University at Kingston, Canada

# Abstract

Based on earlier work which defines cause-effect as one of the three main logical relations of language, this analysis demonstrates how the signalling devices for cause-effect are used in different registers and in a variety of grammatical and textual situations. These situations range from causation within bank-shifted anaphoric and non-anaphoric nominals, to use of the "causer" in the simple clause, and to connection between sentences and larger stretches of text. The signals discussed include null indications, propositions, time adverbials, -ings and clausal which as well as the more-recognized methods of This, cause, effect, thus, hence, because, due to, etc. Many factors are found to limit the signalling possibilities for the relation in any given textual environment. These include the register, sentence length, emphasis, presupposition, knownness, signalling variety, cohesion and associative semantics, grammatical complexity, and the need for a new theme.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1 Aims and signals

Although the signals of the cause-effect relation in English are quite well known, we know less about how and when they are employed in actual language use. As one of the "logical' relations, cause-effect provides meaning between almost any two epitomizable groupings of text and operates in a wide variety of grammatical and textual environments. The large number of signals used to indicate this relation means that writers and speakers often have a bewildering choice of signalling devices for any given instance of the relation. This choice, however, is frequently limited by factors involved with the language circumstances of the relation, and this chapter investigates the signals and the grammatical and textual parameters that affect their choice.

Much of the background for this analysis is published elsewhere (Jordan, 1997) and is not repeated here. That article (a) defines and discusses the meaning of "logic" used here as being the binary relations of cause-effect, basis-assessment and purpose-means, (b) distinguishes especially between the first two of these relations, showing that items such as cause may indicate basis-assessment and not cause-effect whereas consequence may do the opposite, and (c) discusses the work of Halliday and Hasan (1976), Martin (1992) and others in connection with the signals of logical connection in English.

Although we now know that the items such as cause and result do not always signal the presence of the cause-effect relation, obviously they often do. They are used for this purpose in a variety of ways. For example, cause can be used as a main verb or as a noun (This is the cause of...) to signal a cause-effect relation, or as an associative noun ("The cause (of this)...) or rhetorical question ("\*What is the cause?") to signal an effect-cause relation. In contrast, the main verb results in and also This results in, Resulting, As a result, The result is all usually indicate a causeeffect relation.

Less obviously perhaps, some cause-effect relations are not signalled at all, the speaker or writer leaving the relation implicit in the total meaning of the discourse or text. Many other cause-effect relations are communicated quite subtly as prepositions; in, after, when, with, and others provide locational or time indications which, within the total meaning of the communication, can be perceived to intimate cause-effect connection as well as time. This is especially typical of some news reporting (Jordan 1997).

The relation of cause-effect can be communicated with rhetorical questions, repetition or marked punctuation to signal the relation in a marked way in informal registers. In contrast, the formal inter-sentential "adverbial' connectors (Consequently, Thereby, As a result and the like) are often found in more formal registers. Because (of), due to and other subordinators are found in all registers, providing special meanings within the complex sentence.

# 1.2 Combining clause relations and inner-clause semantics

An important premise of this paper is that the semantic notion of cause-effect occurs between almost any two components of language: between sentences or groups of sentences, between subject and complement, and between any combination of units of communication in language. As I point out (1978:142- 145) under "Referent Control by Logical Compatibility", thematic pro-clausal or pro-nominal This re-enters a clause or nominal group into a new clause to create a logical relation between the referent and the predicate of the new sentence. We

see this in:

(1) The fact is many vitamin formulas aren't properly balanced. This can hinder their absorption. (Advertisement, Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:42)

We can see that the cause-effect relation is between the main part of the first sentence (epitomized as the sole nominal This as subject of the second sentence) and the predicate of the second sentence. By rank-shifting the first sentence into nominal form, we can create a cause-effect relation between the subject and predicate of a simple clause:

The fact that many vitamin formulas aren't properly balanced can hinder their absorption.

The "Causer" as subject has been discussed by a number of scholars, including Longacre (1972:80), Butler (1985:167-168), Halliday and Fawcett (1987-143), Davidse (1992:116-121) and Dixon (1991: 292-297).

The semantic relationship is clearly unaltered by the rank-shifted version, but the two versions differ in nominal group and clause complexity, sentence length, presupposition of the first statement, emphasis and style. The choices are thus dictated, in this instance, partly by the register of advertising of the original, and also by audience appreciation and other stylistic elements of the communication.

Thus the choices writers and speakers make in expressing the cause-effect relation involve, not merely lexical choice, but basic meanings inherent in the use of nominal group, clause and sentence as well. The choices go way beyond the concept of emphasis; they also include register, presupposition, knownness, continuity, clarity and conciseness, to name a few. These, then, are the sorts of criteria we must use in determining the limitation on choice of the cause-effect relation in English.

The remainder of this analysis is structured according to general types of signalling. First we will examine the implicit and subtle connections found predominantly in informal speech and news writing. Then the overt and marked forms of connection typical of advertising are discussed, followed by the main body of formal and informal connections and special considerations of subordination. The final section explains the inter-sentential cohesive elements of sentences with causer as subject.

# 2. Implicit and subtle connections

# 2.1 Implicit signalling

As Mann and Thompson (1986) note, some relations between parts of text are not signalled at all: we just have to deduce the connection from the meanings of the statements offered. This is not as difficult as it sounds. I show (1989:104) that even quite formal registers can include such connections, as in:

(2) In the early evening of October 21, 1974, the 93,000 tons dwt tanker Universe Leader began taking on a cargo of crude oil at Gulf's Whiddy Island terminal. By next morning, 2500 tons of it was in Bantry Bay instead of in the ship's tanks. Someone had apparently overlooked an open valve for half and hour. (Pollution Monitor, February-March 1975:13)

The cause-effect relation is between the second and third sentences. The writer could have signalled the relation with "This accident was caused by someone..", but the understatement of the original has a dramatic effect which would have been reduced by the addition. There is no need for "clarification"' in this example, and any attempt would have at least been less concise.

An example of cause-effect signalling in simulated speech is discussed by Jordan (1984:26):

(3) A You look tired. B Yes. Peter's teething. I've been up all night. (Anbesol cartoon advertisement)

The chain of cause-effect relations here is:

Peter's teething.   
This caused him to cry.   
His crying kept B up all night.   
Being up all night resulted in her being tired.   
Her being tired caused her to look tired.

B does not offer this precise chain of relations; nor does she even signal the information she does provide as sharing cause-effect relations. For the register of conversations between friends, this \*incomplete" communication is not only adequate, but is a requirement of the register. We would regard a fully signalled response from B (as in the five sentences offered as a paraphrase) as totally inappropriate for the circumstances (see Crystal and Davy 1959:103-105, for example) and incongruent in the register.

Implicit cause-effect relations are also common in news reporting:

(4) UN is bankrupt, Boutros-Ghali says United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali says the United Nations is bankrupt. "I am bankrupt-the UN is bankrupt. This is one of my greatest frustrations", Boutros-Ghali told a National Press Club luncheon in Canberra, Australia yesterday. The UN's 185 member states were supposed to pay their levies in January, but only 25 to 30 paid on time and some had not paid at all, Boutros-Ghali said. (The Kingston Whig Standard, April 29, 1995:1)

Obviously the cause of the bankruptcy is the failure of member states to pay their levies on time. The relation is unsignalled.

# 2.2 Prepositional indicators

Also typical of news reporting registers is the use of prepositions to convey the (usually) effect-cause relation:

# (5) Palestine died of brain injury

A Palestine mourner (above) kisses the forehead of Abda Samed Harizat, who died under Israeli interrogation. Derek Pounder, a Scottish doctor who determined that the Palestinian died of torture, said yesterday that the forceful jerking of the man's head caused his death. (The Kingston Whig Standard, May 1, 1995:13)

The prepositions of (in the title), under, and again of are the indicators of three effect-cause relations here. Their use is perhaps partly dictated by the generality of the causes (brain injury, Israeli interrogation and torture). The prepositions are more subtle signals than because of, as a result of, and the Palestinian's death had been caused by, which could have been used instead. The final (cause-effect) relation is specifically signalled by the verb caused.

The preposition from is used to intimate effect-cause in:

(6) The elderly also face special harm from smoking. (Scientific American, May, 1995:49)

The meaning is that smoking is the cause of the special harm to the elderly. This is a topic sentence given specific detail in the following four-paragraph span of information; it is perhaps the vagueness of the term special harm which makes the prepositional indicator ideal here.

A common indicator of the basis-assessment relation, and also occasionally purpose-means, is the nominal subordinator with. We see it in the following example as an effect-cause indicator:

(7) For instance, the formerly robust New England fishery for Atlantic cod has shrunk dramatically with the cod's decline. (Popular Science, May, 1995:68)

The meaning here is not just that the fishery shrank along with or at the same time as the decline in fish stocks; it shrank as a result of their decline.

# 2.3 Time indicators

Time subordinators are similarly used in news reporting to convey a meaning of cause-effect without overtly saying so. Use of when is common, meaning more than the literal simultaneity (Hoey 1983:43-44). Here is an example:

(8) Two killed in separate accidents EIGHTY-TWO-YEAR-OLD Kenneth Gibson was killed Thursday evening when his westbound 1992 Oldsmobile missed a curve and left County Road 2 near Mallorytown, striking a hydro pole. The accident occurred shortly before ${ \mathfrak { s p m } }$

A 53-year-old North York man died Thursday afternoon when the car he was driving struck a rock cut on Highway 401 and rolled several times...   
One person is in hospital with serious injuries following a single-vehicle rollover yesterday afternoon on Highway 401, one kilometre west of the Joyceville turnoff. (The Kingston Whig Standard, April 29, 1995:11)

Clearly when in the first paragraph means more than mere simultaneity. He was not killed somewhere else by something else at the same time as his car missed the curve and struck the pole; he was killed as a result of his car missing the curve and striking the pole. The accident described in the third paragraph makes the connection closer by placing the man in the car at the time of the accident. In the final paragraph, the use of following must be taken as meaning effect-cause, not merely a time sequence. For all these examples, the time indicators are subtle indicators of the effect-cause relation.

Cause is similarly signalled by after, when, and before in:

(9) 14 killed after overcrowded viewing platform collapses THIRTEEN COLLEGE STUDENTS AND A park guide plunged 30 metres to their deaths when a wooden viewing platform on a cliff collapsed onto rocks below... Police are investigating claims that 18 people crowded onto it before it collapsed. (The Kingston Whig Standard, April 29, 1995:10)

Certainly the 14 were killed after or when the platform collapsed, but also as a result of that collapse; effect-cause is clearly intended, though not specifically signalled. In the final paragraph, the indication is that the overcrowding caused the platform to collapse, not just that the overcrowding preceded it.

As prepositional indicators, time indicators and implicit connections occur frequently in informal genres and reporting, we might expect to see them used together as we saw in Example 8 and in:

(10) One worker was killed, and six others became ill after they were exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide. An investigation found that ventilation on the site was not sufficient to exhaust emissions from the gasoline powered machines. In a separate incident, a worker was asphyxiated after climbing up an unventilated walkway in an underground mine. The atmosphere in-the rise did not contain enough oxygen to sustain life. (Source, Spring, 1995:10)

For both incidents, the following sentences contain information about the causes of the problems, but the relations are not overtly signalled.

The time subordinator As is also seen as a cause-effect indicator in:

(11)  As the wheel brake strikes the ground, internal disc- and drum-brake systems go into action and apply pressure to the wheel brake's vertical and horizontal rotating surfaces. (Popular Science, May, 1995:91)

The As really means "at the same time as and as a result of', and is a causeeffect as well as a time indicator.

See Jordan, 1997 for a more detailed analysis of the subtle signalling of both cause-effect and basis-assessment relations in news reporting.

# 3. Comparing inter-sentential and inter-clausal connections

# 3.1 Variety and sentence length as limitations on choice

We have already seen (Example 1 and discussion) how we can rank shift a clause into a nominal group to convert a cause-effect relation between two sentences into one between the subject of the sentence (the causer) and its object. We now need to examine the choices between the use of two sentences or two clauses.

A clear signal of the cause-effect relation is This causes, This results in, etc. as in:

(12) To change transmission, hydraulics either push the sides of the pulleys together or pull them apart. This forces the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove, thus effectively shrinking or expanding the diameter of the pulleys. (Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:30)

The main clause of the first sentence is re-entered by the pro-clausal This as subject (and causer) of the main clause in the second sentence. As there is another cause-effect relation in the second sentence (signalled by , thus ...shrinking or expanding), that technique could hardly also have been used between the two first main clauses. When, however, no such limitation applies, writers use This + yerb between the larger pairs of connection and ,..ing between the smaller pairs (Jordan 1989:110):

(13) Additional test facilities are available from some suppliers offering frequency translation on the line output. This allows total modem testing when connected to 2- wire lines. Lower frequencies are translated up to the higher receiving frequencies allowing an effective analogue line loop to be achieved. (Telecommunications, July, 1977:445)

As there are two pairs of cause-effect relations in a short passage of text, a limitation of avoiding the same method twice is imposed. The choice here is determined by the length of the clauses, the writer choosing This for the larger pair.

Length is a factor even if there is no other factor to consider, as the . ...ing signalling is only appropriate when the total sentence length is acceptable for the register. Here is another pair of cause-effect relations, again with the writer using ....ing for the shorter pair and This for the larger pair:

(14) Both the steam and the combustion gases could be injected into the reservoir, avoiding problems of atmospheric pollution due to the combustion. The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International are working on a similar idea in which the steam is generated in "downhole" heat exchangers, rather than by direct contact, and the exhaust gases are vented to atmosphere. This avoids the possibility of "plugging" the reservoir with particles during combustion of the fuel. (Chartered Mechanical Engineer, December, 1978:25)

The lengths of the last two sentences impose a pragmatic limitation on the choice here.

# 3.2 Specific signalling and non-contiguous elements

While This (and ...ing) are useful and common methods of signalling the cause-effect relation, they do not "say"' that they are signalling the cause-effect relation, and there are occasions when writers need to do that. For the ..ing method, we can use what Winter (1977) calls a"Vocabulary $3 ^ { \mathfrak { s } }$ word that actually signals the relation we need to indicate. Examples for the cause-effect relation of course are cause, result, effect, and consequence. Thus the use of, resulting in or, causing clearly conveys the relational information:

(15) Typically, untreated particles collect in the downstream pipeline/ditch, causing a gradual increase in pH as the wastewater traverses the line. (InTech, February, 1995:38/39)

Alternatively (conceivably in addition, but it would be rather marked), writers include thus or thereby to give additional clarity to the type of relation being conveyed. This is often helpful when the ing verb is not a Vocabulary 3 word, as not all ing clauses at the end of the sentence indicate cause-effect. Here is an example where thereby is useful:

(16) The use of integrated and smart sensors will increase in factory environments where more and more parameters are being measured and controlled, thereby overloading the process controllers, buses, CPUs and other shared resources. (Sensors, January, 1992:34)

While perhaps not absolutely necessary in this text, thereby is a useful addition as it avoids the reader having to wonder whether a cause-effect relation is intended.

Between sentences, the need to use a specific Vocabulary 3 word to clarify that a cause-effect relation is being communicated is rarely if ever necessary. The connection is just as clear between sentences as it is between the causer and the object of a sentence. This is seen in:

(17) To flatten the powerband, both exhaust ports are fitted with a RAVE (Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust) valve -a spring-loaded guillotine-shaped device that moves up as backpressure in the exhaust increases. This raises the top of the exhaust port and changes the port timing. (Popular Mechanics, May 1, 1995:75)

The referent for This is the device moving up, and this causes two effects included in the two co-ordinated clauses with the causer elided in the second. As the cause and its effects are non-contiguous, we cannot use the ing form of signalling here, because ing only has the power to connect the immediately preceding element of text into a relation with the following element. We could use the ing form here by re-arranging the text as:

.. a spring-loaded guillotine-shaped device. As the backpressure in the exhaust increases, the valve moves up, raising the top of the exhaust port and changing the port timing.

This method of connection is now possible because the cause and effects are contiguous elements in the text. The order of information is thus seen as another limitation of the choice of cause-effect signalling.

# 3.3 Modals and variety

Clausal which can perhaps been seen as a compromise between the This and ing forms, to be used when the This form would be too abrupt (creating short sentences) or when the ing form is inconvenient for some reason. One such reason is when a modal is needed:

(18) Components of cigarette smoke damage the inner lining of blood vessels, which can lead to the development of atherosclerosis. (Scientific American, May, 1995:49)

The referent for which is the preceding predicate, and for such a short sentence, we might think of using the ing form. But the need for the modal can would mean we would also have to include possibly, which might appear awkward. The clausal which seems ideal for such circumstances.

We might regard the ing form of connection the normal unmarked method for connecting short clauses in a cause-effect relation. Like any method, however, it cannot for stylistic reasons be used repetitively in close proximity to other ing forms. Where this occurs, clausal which may the preferred choice:

(19) Field-programmable level-to-flow rate conversions are now a standard feature, which makes it easier to use a flowmeter at various sites. Many flowmeters feature additional inputs such as $\mathfrak { p H }$ and temperature, reducing the number of instruments needed at each site. (InTech, February, 1995:35)

The length of both sentences makes the This form unsuitable for mature readers, and the pairs of cause-effect relations in this short passage would make two ing forms stylistically undesirable; so one of the pairs is signalled by clausal which.

In a chain of cause-effect relations of short elements in a single sentence, again clausal which may be the preferred choice where an ing form has already been used:

(20)  Should the temperature of the system rise for some reason, the resistance of the heater increases, causing the heater wattage to drop, which results in a limit on the heater's temperature. (Materials Engineering, March, 1983:13)

The use of and resulting would be technically wrong of course, and , resulting perhaps confusing or even ambiguous.

# 4. Providing grammatical freedom

# 4.1 Competing anaphors and new themes

The methods described in the previous main section (This, ing, and clausal which) re-enter the first element of the cause-effect relation into the new clause or sentence as its theme, or implicit theme for ings. This means that the writer has already made an essential choice regarding the nature of the new sentence or clause, as the theme is already determined and also the verb is quite limited semantically as being one relating to cause and effect. Such a limitation often does not matter, and indeed may often be ideal. However, on other occasions, writers need complete grammatical freedom to start a new sentence with another theme and verb, while still indicating a cause-effect relation between the new sentence and an element of the preceding one.

One of the difficulties with This, for example, is that it is anaphoric, and thus any other anaphoric (nominal or clausal) element in the new sentence could cause confusion:

(21) Because Costar optics must fit into a confined space, the FOC M1 and M2 mirrors are positioned close to each other and on line with the optical axis. As a result, this instrument required two suspension arms, one for each mirror. (Aviation Week, February 24, 1992:135)

The inter-sentential nominal connection by the generic noun instrument, especially as subject of the new sentence, makes the other forms inappropriate. Quite tortuous syntax would be required to make the connection work with This:

This results in this instrument requiring two suspension arms, one for each mirror.

The use of this for the clausal and nominal connections is rather awkward, whereas the original avoids the complexity by allowing the nominal connection to become subject of the new sentence.

Competing anaphors is an example of the more general case of the need for a new theme in the second sentence of a cause-effect pair. This need, and also the intervening subordinate clause, determine the need for grammatical freedom in:

(22) Even a color camera does not reproduce colors accurately enough to reveal subtle variations. So, while excellent for imaging the process, closed-circuit television cannot give the operator useful indications of brightness and intensity. (Sensors, January, 1992:41)

Use of This makes or making here is out of the question because of the subordinate clause and the need for the new theme.

Where there is a pragmatic choice between a continuing or new topic as theme, the latter often yields a simpler structure and is thus more appropriate for less formal registers:

(23) Also contributing to the mower's quality is a dome-shaped plastic deck that tilts to the rear, so the blade cuts in a slight shearing action. (Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:100)

Although we could use making the blade cut here, it is syntactically more complex. The original is more straightforward and thus more appropriate for "plainer" forms of expression in registers suitable for the informal prose used for this publication.

# 4.2 Referent clarity

A feature of the ing and clausal which forms of connection is that there is rarely if ever any difficulty in identifying the first element of the cause-effect binary pair: it can usually only be the main clause of the sentence. The same can be said for and so, as we see in (Jordan 1989:105):

(24) The temperature of fuel stored in ships' bunkers or double bottom tanks approximates the sea temperature, which rarely exceeds $3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ , and so the SOLAS requirement is readily satisfied in respect of the $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ flash point fuel. (Marine Engineering Digest, April, 1983:19)

As coordination naturally connects the two independent clauses, the first element cannot extend further back in the text, and is thus readily identified.

Other forms of cause-effect connection (e.g. This $+$ verb, as a result, thus, because of this) do not have such a grammatical unity between the two elements of the cause-effect pair, and we might think that referent clarity might often pose a problem. This rarely occurs, however, as there are numerous ways by which writers indicate what the first element of the logical pair is. Jordan (1978) identifies over 20 methods used with nominal this. As other forms such as The result and Thus can be paraphrased as The result of this and It is concluded from this that, they too must rely on these other contextual clues to allow readers to identify the referent, i.e. the first element of the binary pair.

# 4.3 Using the matrix clause

When the referent for the cause-effect indicator is the immediately-preceding part of the text (nominal, clause, sentence, etc.), we rarely need to worry about whether the reader will be able to determine what the referent is. We can therefore use, for example, an "untriggered" form of nominal associated with the referent (Hawkins 1978; Jordan 1992), such as The cause or The effect. By including such devices as subject of a matrix clause, we again achieve complete grammatical freedom in the main clause dominated by the matrix:

(25)  As we now look to 1995/96, the funding situation remains constrained. The recent federal budget will result in major reductions in research funding from the granting councils, and the loss of \$2 to \$3 billion in Ontario government revenues by 1997/98. It is clear that provincial grants to all universities will be reduced further but the full extent of the reduction over the next few years is still unknown. In the meantime, the provincial government is carrying through with its multi-year plan of expenditure reductions and the University's operating grant will be reduced by a further $1 \%$ for 1995/96. The end result is that provincial grants to Queen's will be reduced by a further \$11 million since the introduction of the ECP. (Queen's University, letter from the Principal, April, 1995:1)

We know the referent for The end result is only the preceding clause, as only that is compatible with the subject provincial grants to Queen's. The orthographic break for the paragraph also assists readers in making this instant connection between cause and effect. Use of the matrix clause The end result is that allows the writer to restart the grammar of the following clause using a new subject, thus providing the necessary grammatical freedom to create the desired sentence.

# 4.4 Untriggered and triggered associated nominals

As a marked form, The result: is used as an abbreviated matrix clause followed by a full clause. Alternatively, when its referent is clear, it can be used as a marked form with verbal ellipsis:

(26)Kaiser Electro-Optics plans to sharpen the picture with a wall-of-TVs tactic. Kaiser is developing displays that arrange multiple LCDs in front of each eye. The result: a wide field of view with crisp images. (Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:24)

The limitation here is primarily the register, as such a technique would only be used in informal texts. Jordan (1985a) shows the cline of markedness for such cause-effect relations:

What is the result? The result?

The result: The result is...

Separate paragraphs are also used to add to the markedness of the signalling.

When the first element of the cause-effect pair is not clearly only the immediately-preceding unit of language, it becomes necessary to specify exactly what it is. For this we may need to use a post-triggered form of associated nominal:

(27) Before commenting on the new revenue item (Unrestricted Donations and Bequests) it is important to note a change in the funding of the Advanced function. In the past, the Advanced function was financed from three main sources; [sic] the operating budget, a portion of annual unrestricted giving, and unrestricted bequests. Due to the increase in restrictions on private giving and concern about unrestricted donations and bequests being earmarked to help finance the Advancement function, the deans and viceprincipals have agreed to a change in the funding mechanism. Each Faculty/School will now be credited with a portion of the University's annual unrestricted donations/ bequests and will report on the use of the funds to the donors/estate. In exchange, the Faculty/School will help contribute to the Advancement function. At the same time, it is proposed that a fixed percentage of the annual income from the pooled endowment fund be used to help finance the Advancement function - thus providing an incentive for the Advancement function to increase endowment giving. The end result of the proposed funding change should be greater interest in the level of private giving, more emphasis on endowment growth, greater accountability to donors, more internal interest in the Advancement activity and the provision of a more comprehensive picture of the major revenue flows to the Operating Budget. (Queen's University Operating Budget, 1995/96:14/15)

The first element of the major cause-effect pair (underlined here) is the change in funding mechanism, and we are informed of five expected results. The causeeffect signalling could not be any of the methods discussed so far, as none of them would indicate what the first element of the logical pair is. For this situation, we need to repeat the first element as post-triggering in the logical association to Start the new paragraph.

# 5. Rank-shifting methods and subordination

# 5.1 Non-thematic nominals

When there is a need to de-emphasise the cause-effect relation and/or to compress information into complex structures, we might need to use nominal groups with restrictive elements containing cause-effect relations. Here is an example in which the complex final nominal group is a rank-shifted effect-cause pair signalled by resulting from:

(28)He says the payoff is calculated in reduced injuries and compensation costs resulting from a host of changes made through committee structures. (Source, Spring, 1995:5)

The nominal group injuries..structures is rank-shifted from the effect-cause clause:

Reduced injuries and compensation costs result from a host of changes made through committee structures.

the final nominal of which itself includes a restrictive -ed clause dominated by the -ed form made. By using this form of connection, the writer was able to include several interconnected pieces of information into a single sentence. A register limitation of course is that such writing is only suitable for formal writing for mature readers (Jordan 1993).

Theoretically, such complex structures pose quite difficult problems of analysis, as they combine several "statements" in compressed form. See Jordan 1995 for a method of analyzing such sentences within a clause-relational framework. A restrictive -ed clause is used in a similar way in:

(29) Another 6,000 die from work-related illnesses and thousands live with injuries or debilitating diseases caused by toxic chemicals. (Source, Spring, 1995:5)

The lack of the repetition of the preposition with probably indicates that the restrictive -ed clause applies to both elements of the coordinated pair, i.e. both the injuries and the debilitating diseases are caused by the toxic chemicals. Again we have a rank-shifted cause-effect clause rank-shifted into a complex nominal group.

Non-thematic rank-shifted cause-effect nominals rely on the cause or the effect element being known or readily accepted by readers. This is clearly seen in:

(30)  Japan's three major air carriers have overcome low passenger loads and high fuel prices resulting from last year's Persian Gulf War and have resumed vigorous growth. (Aviation Week, February 24, 1992:69)

Readers would be well aware of the Persian Gulf War at the time. So, rather than announcing that as a theme, stating the result (the high fuel prices) and then including it into a sentence structure, the writer chose to use a cause-effect nominal instead.

# 5.2 Thematic complex nominals

As theme, rank-shifted cause-effect nominals are useful when writers wish to make a topic out of the cause-effect combination. These frequently occur as anaphoric nominals as in:

(31) Sensor validation involves comparing a sensor's output to its process dynamics and normal response characteristics; the failure detection capability thus created improves the overall reliability of a monitoring or control system. (Sensors, January, 1992:14)

Rather than stating the cause-effect relation between the first clause and the creation of a failure detection capability and then using that as theme of another clause, the writer here chose to compress the cause-effect information in an anaphoric thematic nominal.

Both anaphoric and non-anaphoric rank-shifted logical nominals appear in:

(32)  Process control instrumentation includes systems and equipment used in continuous and batch processes. Many developments are now coming of age, and advancements derived from many years of development are enlarging the market. Two areas of technology which have had a very significant effect on the process control instrumentation market are computer technology and communication, which play increasingly important roles in the field of control and automation technology. (InTech, February, 1995:35)

The restrictive relative clause in the final sentence includes the key item effect to signal the cause-effect relation within the complex rank-shifted theme. This theme is clearly anaphoric, as the effect element of the relation is lexically repeated from the untriggered associate the market (for process control instrumentation) in the previous sentence. The writer here is choosing to use the two areas of technology as theme, and to relate it to a previous topic in a cause-effect manner within a complex nominal.

Thematic cause-effect nominals are not always anaphoric or co-referential, however, as we see in the previous sentence of Example 32, and in:

(33) By squeezing one or both levers during high speed descents, you can feather your speed by making hard squeezes. Sudden shifts in weight caused by panic squeezes may be difficult to control, but once you get the hang of it, you have the option of skating hands free by clipping the handles onto hip clips. (Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:90)

The connection between hard squeezes and panic squeezes is co-hyponymic. Clearly an option here is:

Panic squeezes can cause sudden shifts in weight, and these may be difficult to control...

But to continue into a new sentence, the writer is stylistically rather restricted as to the linking necessary (However would be stylistically too formal) in this informal register --especially as there is a but in the next clause. The rank-shifted clause overcomes this difficulty.

# 5.3 Verbless clauses

A need often arises to compress the cause-effect information into a nominal group when defining a term in a verbless clause:

(34) Had he been wearing standard Scuba gear, Pippin could descend to about 350 feet before suffering "rupture of the deep", a narcotic like stupor caused by compressed nitrogen. (Popular Science, May, 1995:101)

Due to is a common indicator of the cause-effect relation in such circumstances:

(35) The so-called Coriolis effect-a rightward deflection of the water in the North Atlantic due to the Earth's rotation and the curvature of the planet's surface-- makes the northward flow narrower and swifter than that of the water heading southward. (Popular Science, May, 1995:99)

Here the effect-cause pair is a non-restrictive appositional verbless clause between the subject and main verb. This rank-shifted nominal allows the information to be presented very economically, and in a manner appropriate for mature readers.

Nominal groups used in a clause-relational manner may contain cause-effect pairing. When they do, the signalling needs to be compatible with the nominal group structure, and again due to is ideal:

(36) Japanese air freight volume will continue its strong growth through the end of the decade despite a slowdown due to the current world recession. (Aviation Week, February, 1992:126)

The cause-effect indicators due to and because of are also used as clause subordinators, in which the clause or nominal they dominate has a cause-effect relation with another clause in the sentence. We now need to recognize the circumstances under which these and related signals of cause-effect can be used.

# 5.4 Subordination

Subordination at the start of the sentence is suitable when the information contained in the subordinate clause is "known" to the reader, as explained by Winter (1982:49-158) in great depth. We must, however, take a broader view than the original Given-New pairing on the Prague School (Danes 1974), by recognizing that "known" to the reader may be as a result of just having been informed by the writer (i.e. "Given'), or by virtue of prior knowledge. This is hinted at by Chafe (1974):

Given information is suggested to be that which the speaker assumes to be already present in the addressee's consciousness at the time of the utterance. (111)

and more clearly by Dahl (1976):

The criterion is whether some piece of knowledge is assumed by the speaker to be known by the addressee or not. (47)

Knownness, rather than givenness, is seen in:

(37)  Unfortunately, because of carbon gases (mostly $\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 } ^ { \cdot }$ ) and water vapor in the air, some energy will be absorbed in selected wavelength bands. (Sensors, January, 1992:18)

The presence of carbon gases and water vapor in the air is not mentioned earlier in the text. As the writer nevertheless assumes that readers will be aware of their presence, the information is included in a subordinate clause linked to the main clause by the cause-effect indicator because of.

On the other hand, the information is clearly given in:

(38) The color-ratio pyrometer measures temperature by ratioing radiant intensity at two different wavelengths. Because a ratio is used, this method is not affected by the smoke and dust that can obscure portions of the flame. (Sensors, January, 1992:44)

The knowledge that a ratio is used is given in the compound attributive adjective and the means clause of the preceding sentence. It would thus have been insulting to have stated:

A ratio is used, and so this method...

Subordination is necessary here because the information in the subordinate clause has just been given.

# 6. Lexical connection of the causer

# 6.1 Newly-introduced nominals

The methods of indicating the cause-effect relation discussed so far have been essentially clausal, that is the information of one logical element (whether in nominal or clausal form) has been related to the other element of the binary pair through means which are outside the boundaries of the clausal grammar. In contrast the use of the causal element as subject of a clause includes the cause-effect relation within the grammar of the clause, and we will now examine the conditions under which this technique is useful or advisable.

A large proportion of nominals used as the causer/subject of a sentence are anaphoric (including basic and associative connections), where their function is to indicate the cause of something already introduced into the text. There are, however, occasions when the causer is an introduced term, as in

(39) Ocean warming may be shrinking the size of Pacific salmon (Scientific American, May, 1995:21)

Obviously ocean warming is something readers are aware of, and so it can be introduced as the causer in this way.

Titles are obviously an ideal place for the use of introduced causers, where the writer introduces a topic already known to readers. We see in the following title an introduction which is a partial repetition connected to a later nominal:

(40)Toxic chemicals kill two hydro workers Two people are dead after they were exposed to a toxic chemical used to clean PCBs from transformers at a London hydro compound. (The Whig Standard, May 18, 1995:1)

The causer in the title is obviously introduced there, although it is connected to the more-detailed following nominal a toxic...transformers. The title is a clearer statement of the cause-effect relation than the first sentence of the main text, which uses the typical time indicator.

Perhaps a bridge between introduction of the causer and the overtly anaphoric connections are instances of an example of a general statement, as illustrated in:

(41) We're also a pioneer in center-of-gravity management. Our Fuel Control and Monitoring System (FCMS), built in cooperation with Hercules Aerospace, means savings in jet fuel costs for operators. (advertisement, Aviation Week, February 24, 1992:54)

The FCMS is presumably an example of this company's pioneering centre-ofgravity management, a connection which could have been made overt by "An example is our..., which means...

# 6.2 Basic lexical connection

Although introduced, expanded and exemplifying connections of the causer are used, causers are usually lexically connected to another nominal or clause already mentioned in the text. Nominal connections are clear in:

(42) Alenia S.p.A represents the merger of premier aerospace manufacturer Aeritalia and industry leader Selenia... Bringing together the multiple talents and energies of both forces has resulted in powerful creative synergy. In practice this means a widespread sharing of knowledge on every level of the company. The assembled experience of Alenia's engineers also means flexibility to move forward quickly into new markets. (advertisement, Aviation Week, February 24, 1992:1)

The complement of the first sentence is paraphrased as the causer in the next sentence, and the nominal powerful creative synergy is re-entered by the substitute This as causer of the next sentence. Another paraphrase of the main topic is used as causer of the final sentence.

The use of substitute nominals and substitute items as causers is shown in:

(43)  Many have OHV visible on the engine and perhaps mentioned on their shipping box. These letters, of course, stand for overhead valve. This valve configuration has a nice high-performance ring to it, and it does make engine exhaust cleaner while also improving fuel efficiency. (Popular Mechanics, May, 1995:98)

The nominal overhead valve is re-entered first as the substitute nominal This valve configuration and then as the substitute it, which is the causer of the final two clauses.

The substitutes This and it are clear examples of the lexical connections of causers. As this is generally used as a clausal substitute, we can see instances of This results in, This creates, etc. as examples both of intra-clausal cause-effect connections and also of causer-predicate connections within the clause.

The occurrence of co-hyponymic connections as the causer help to show us that causer anaphora covers a wide range of lexical connection:

(44) The airlines are concerned traffic will erode further when the railway introduces a faster train next month. It will cut travel time between the two major cities to 2.5 hours from 3 hr. A further improved train, scheduled for introduction by the year 2000, will reduce the trip to 2 hr. and may force a halt to air services. (Aviation Week, February 24, 1992:71)

The causer of the final sentence is a co-hyponym of the first train mentioned; it is the causer of both clauses by ellipsis.

It would be reasonable to expect that all methods of basic intra-sentential lexical connection (full and partial repetition, synonym, acronym, substitution) are methods used to connect the causer to earlier nominals in the text. Here is an example using a partitive topic:

# (45) NOISE

Noise performance is often a critical issue for high-speed digitizing systems. A high noise level will cause unwanted variations in DC voltage readings and corrupt dynamic signals, preventing accuracy at low voltages. (Sensors, January, 1992:26)

Under the overall topic of NOISE, the sub-topic A high noise level is used as the causer of the first two co-ordinated clauses of the next sentence. The second of these clauses is then made the cause of the final effect, signalled by ing.

# 6.3 Associative lexical connection

Many causers are lexically "associated' to other nominals in the text. If the topic is a book, for example, associated nominals are the author, its cost, and the number of pages in the book (Christophersen 1939). The first of these is "untriggered' (Hawkins 1978) as there is no mention of the book, the second in "pre-triggered' as the mention precedes the new head noun, and the last is "posttriggered' as the mention follows the new head noun (Jordan 1992). Both postand pre-triggering are seen in:

(46) While $\mathbf { M g ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ is more expensive, it has a higher hydroxide content. Thus, as shown in the foregoing chemical mass balance equations, less $\mathrm { { \bf M g } ( O H ) } _ { 2 }$ is required to neutralize and less salt product is made. The higher hydroxide content results in economie in the quantity of reagent purchased and in reduced landfill costs for the product of neutralization. The hardness of the $\underline { { \mathbf { M g } ( \mathrm { O H } ) } } _ { 2 }$ particle, and its very low solubility in water, result in very low dynamics of dissolving. (InTech, February, 1995:41)

The first causer (The higher hydroxide content) is a repetition of the final nominal of the first sentence. In the last sentence, however, the causer has two elements: the first is a post-triggered associated nominal, and the second is a pretriggered associate.

Untriggered associations are common in advertising registers:

(47) Unlike old fashioned vaporizers, this Steam Inhaler won't injure delicate membranes adding to your discomfort. Its unique design creates a controlled, gentle stream of steam. And the scientifically designed soft hood allows air to mix with the steam allowing comfortable, natural breathing. The patented grille design lets you control the flow of steam precisely, making it safe for both adults and children. (advertisement, Popular Science, May, 1995:95)

The pre-triggered associate is followed by two untriggered associates (lexically recoverable by adding of the inhaler) as causers of the enablement (Mann and Thompson 1986, 1987) relations, which are here arguably special forms of causeeffect.

Several types of associative connection of the causer are'seen in:

(48)  Smoking also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke, sudden death, heart attack, peripheral vascular disease and aortic aneurysm. Cigarettes caused almost 180,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. in 1990. Components of cigarette smoking damage the inner lining of blood vessels, which can lead to the development of atherosclerosis. The toxins can also stimulate occlusive elements in coronary arteries, thus promoting clots to form and triggering spasms that close off the vessels. In this regard, the smoking of a single cigarette can profoundly disturb blood flow to the heart in patients with existing coronary artery disease. Furthermore, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of pulmonary illness and death in the U.S. In 1990 smoking caused more than 84,000 deaths from pulmonary disease, mainly resulting from problems such as pneumonia, emphysema, bronchitis and influenza.

Passive smoking...poses a similar health risk. (Scientific American, May, 1995:49)

As the initial topic is cigarettes, cigarette smoking is pre-triggered associate and the gerund smoking an untriggered associate. Components of cigarette smoking is a two-stage associate (an associate of an associate) and The toxins is a threestage associate (see Jordan 1985b and 1992 for discussion of three-and fourstage associates). Passive (cigarette) smoking is a partitive of cigarette smoking.

# 7. Summary and conclusions

While this analysis is not an exhaustive study of the choice in signalling the cause-effect relation in English, it nevertheless outlines some of the important methods we must include in such a task. In broad outline, the register, formality, variety, cohesion, emphasis, presupposition and lexical continuity are perhaps the most important criteria to consider.

Clearly there is enormous choice in how we signal this one relation in language. Yet within the pragmatic, grammatical, textual and sociological circumstances of any particular occurrence of the relation, the choice is severely limited. There is rarely if ever a free choice of signalling method from all those possible. The research challenge is to seek to understand the circumstances which dictate freedom of choice and which constrain that choice under various conditions. For only when we have real choice in a given linguistic situation are we able to impart elements of style, emphasis or idiolectic preference.

We are now closer to a real understanding of the full signalling system of one of the important relations of logic in English: cause-effect. Further detailed work for this relation is still necessary, and we also need to do similar work for all the logical and other relations of English and other languages.

# FUNCTIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE NG PREMODIFIERS IN WRITTEN ENGLISH

VICENTE LOPEZ-FOLGADO Universidad de Cordoba

# Abstract

One persistent aim in SFG (Systemic Functional Grammar) has been to extend the metafunctional analysis as exemplified in the clause unit into the domain of smaller units, such as the NG (Nominal Group) which seems to be amenable solely to structural considerations. As is often acknowledged in the SFG literature (Martin, 1992), lexical relations cannot simply be accounted for by appealing to grammatical structure alone (Bache, 1978).

The purpose of this paper is to discuss this important issue and, more specifically, to focus on the NG premodifier variation in function so as to explore shifting areas of meaning.

Halliday (1985) has already suggested a tentative distinction between the experiential and the interpersonal character of Epithets, while reckoning that there is no hard and fast line between these two.

I have provided data from various written English sources in order to account for crossgenre variation.

# 1. Introduction

The all but unvaried position of English adjectives inside a nominal group structure has always been a major problem for those learners of Romance languages like Spanish, French and Italian where the semantic character of the adjective has proved to be an acid test for placement in the syntagmatic chain.

But if this positional distinction may appear at first blush as a structural advantage in those languages, analysts seem to encounter problems, however, in such orderly structural constituents. In Spanish, for instance, E. Alarcos Llorach (1994) finds that the value of anteposition and postposition of adjectives 'often depends on the intention of the speaker rather than on objective criteria'' To back up this thesis he argues that many fixed collocations in Spanish vary the order of categories. Some of them are:

sentido comun (common sense), buena suerte (good luck), alta mar (high sea), a largo plazo (in the long run), ideas fijas (fixed ideas) etc.

In a similar way, L.A. Waugh (1977) argues for French that an overall principle can be established which suggests that the postposed adjective lends a general quality to the noun. Thus in the following examples from French:

(1) une eglise pauvre (a poor church) (2) une pauvre eglise (a poor church)

In example 1) the quality should be taken as absolute meaning 'lacking money', whereas the anteposition in 2) signals an evident inherent dependence on the noun, so that in this latter case the church is poor only relative to its 'churchiness'. According to this view then, the preposed adjective tends to lose much of its independent meaning as a category.

However, these semantic criteria, though explanatory in many particular cases, do not seem to capture rigorously the whole spectrum of the varied adjectival category. In particular, Waugh's proposal seems to govern frequently-used adjectives, like bon, grand, nouveau and their antonyms, but it tends to fail with most not so habitual adjectives. In fact, many examples can be relevantly adduced, which seems to contradict the above-cited criteria. For example, la nouvelle maison certainly means something different to la maison nouvelle.

# 2. The contrastive pair

F. Klein-Andreu (1983) has also sought a simple basic criterion that would account for adjective placement in Romance languages as exemplified in Spanish. She claims that the general key notion for a correct semantic interpretation of the adjective position is the functional pair 'contrast vs. non-contrast'. Under the heading contrastive she includes 'focus' as well as 'emphasis'. The notion of FOCUS in the Columbian linguistic terminology is that element in the utterance that is prominently placed so as to be worth the hearer's attention. For instance, a nominative case is supposed to be an attention caller to the topic and so does the negative and emphatic DO. As it happens, the prominent place for an adjective is after the noun, thus concentrating all the force of the stress on the last element.

The term non contrastive includes such cases as those denoting measure' as well as those expressing 'an opinion' or 'a value'. For example, in 'Les gourmets adroites mangent d'oignons' the order of the first semantic elements cannot be reversed if we do not wish to introduce profound changes in the meaning of the group. In traditional Spanish grammars' two classificatory terms have has come to be accepted as a common description: calificativo (qualifying) and determinativo (determinative).

(3) un precioso libro (a nice book) (4) un libro pesado (a heavy book)

The former expresses a somehow inherent property that does not seek to contrast with other possible, expected or inferred adjectives, whereas the latter implies that the adjective in question has been chosen in competition with other possible candidates.

Predictive as these criteria might seem to be, it can be argued, however, that quite a few examples could be quoted in Romance languages that happen to contradict the general formulation of the cited criteria.

One reason for this taxonomical failure is that most categories tend to reveal their flexible nature once they are used in communicative discourse. In effect, many adjectives behave in such a manner that can only be couched in gradable terms on a plus and minus scale. As Givon (1993:174) has aptly put it: \*the grammatical notion of contrast depends on the more general cognitive dimension of informational predictability or its converse, counterexpectancy'.

Now this view is totally coherent with Halliday's (1973) textual function, which we shall be dealing with below. A long time ago Jespersen (1924:110-112) coined a pair of terms that have been widely accepted by English grammarians ever since: restrictive vs. nonrestrictive. He then attached a functional value to each, so that the nonrestrictive adjuncts '...use is generally of an emotional or even sentimental, though not always complementary character, while restrictive adjuncts are purely intellectual'. Though it is not always easy to draw a distinctive line between the 'emotional' and 'intellectual' regions in cognition, however we do understand what Jespersen meant by setting this pair of concepts in contrast. In his view, restrictive adjectives were more definite and hence more identifiable by the hearer in informational terms, whereas the nonrestrictive were more accessible or ornamental.5

Halliday, drawing on this essentially functional tradition, suggests that 'there is no hard and fast line between these two; but the former are experiential in function, whereas the latter, expressing the speaker's attitude, represent an interpersonal element in the meaning of the nominal group' (1985:163). The main difference between the two lies in the fact that many Epithets can fulfill the potential role of expressing both experiential meaning as well as interpersonal meaning. The former has a defining function and the latter an attitudinal Epithet, in Halliday's own terminology. Further still, Halliday also recognizes a relatively fuzzy frontier that splits up Epithets and Classifiers: 'the line between Epithet and Classifiers is not a very sharp one, but there are significant differences' (1985:164). An important fact that I would like to stress here is that in many cases the hearer is at a loss to interpret the message as it was intended by the speaker. So she often has to count on such pragmatic factors as situational factors and background knowledge in order to access to the relevant message. Let us consider, for instance:

(5) a critical voice (6) an abstract goal

Quite typically, here one is bound to decide, drawing on contextual variables deduced from the global meaning of the utterance, whether the epithets are or are not, in fact, defining.

# 3. The functional choice

Since the publication of Halliday's first important work (1967), we have been able to approach the clauses of any natural language from three simultaneous sets of systemic meanings, which are relatable to three major components of grammar. The options selected in transitivity, mood and theme by the speakers are realized as structure with linear ordering, as a chain of constituents of the clause. Thus in

Halliday (1973:42) we read the following claim:

What we know as 'grammar' is the linguistic device for hooking up together the selections in meaning which are derived from the various functions of language, and realizing them in a unified structural form... A clause in English is the simultaneous realization of ideational, interpersonal and textual meanings. But these components are not put together in a discrete fashion such that we can point to one segment of the clause as expressing one type of meaning and another segment as expressing another.

According to this view, it can be argued that the functions involved are also realized both structurally and lexically by the smaller constituents of the clause, like the group: In principle, there should be no objection to this being allowed to happen, since the parts could also share the overall features of the whole. This line of thought actually agrees with the systemic rank of delicacy which would imply that 'lexis is a most delicate grammar'.

Martin (1992:315) also seems to support this subclause analysis: Similarly, whereas Classifiers elaborate the Thing, Epithets add qualities. These may be of an experiential or attitudinal kind'. As can be seen, reflection of the two metafunctions are envisaged here so as to express the difference of the Noun group premodifiers. Consider in this light two of the examples proposed by Martin:

(7) round ball (8) ugly cat

Now the epithet round strikes us as more objective and not likely to be subject to negotiation, whereas ugly has a decidedly subjective and evaluating meaning.

A major snag, however, is that, as I have suggested above, it is not always possible to draw a clear line between that contrastive pair of meanings. So that classificatory distinction can hardly work as a general criterion. This leaves perhaps too much leeway to the speaker's selection of systemic options which should ensure a correct uptake on the part of the hearer. The hearer in discourse is supposedly guided by the signals of linear order in this particular case, as is the case that 'attitudinal Epithets tend to precede experiential ones' (1985:163).

# 4. The English hierarchical relations

Halliday (1981) rejects the purely structural view of linear order, as a simple mechanic bearer of syntactic arrangement, favouring instead the functional hierarchical relations introduced under the headings of 'univariate' and multivariate' structures. This is comprehensible enough, since a human grammar considered as a combinatorial word string device, alias a Markov chain', is fundamentally wrong. If that were the case, a speaker would have to undergo lengthy processes to make the string grow word by word by means of unwieldy estimates. So linear relations here should mean a combination system of classes of words governed by dependency relations. The nominal group is a case in point. As a multivariate structure with different variables, the nominal group 'is a configuration of relations involving a determinate set of distinct elements' (Halliday 1981:31) The functional terms are then 'modifier' and 'head', which clearly reflects the hierarchical organization of grammar.

In Halliday (1985) the Modifier is presented as undergoing a subdivision into smaller chunks of functional elements, as is usual in the traditional systemic approach. The Pre-Modifying elements may not just be a simple modifier>head binary relation but also a complex multiple relation in a chain of dependencies, one element conditioning the others like in clause structure. Halliday suggests there that describing a sentence as a construction of words is rather like describing a house as a construction of bricks, without recognizing the walls and the rooms as intermediate structural units' (1985:159). This argument entails and justifies the existence of groups midway between clause and word.6

Now take the following couple of examples:

(9) a pretty young girl (10)  a light blue dress

The English class system allows us to combine them into three possible hierarchical structures:

# (11) internal social changes

The three underlying meaning structures can be represented symbolically as:

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { [ g [ b [ a ] ] ] } } \\ { { [ g [ b a ] ] } } \\ { { [ [ g b ] a ] } } \end{array}
$$

If, as Halliday often suggests, there is no clear-cut line between the potential defining and undefining meanings of a single epithet, the matter gains a degree of complexity when we introduce an additional epithet. Following Bache (1978) we find two main types of formal patterns: parataxis and hypotaxis which can be combined together with a further division into the purely linear types of broken and unbroken. The former's elements are separated either by commas or by conjunctions, the latter's appear with no such interruptions. Thus let us first consider the examples of broken type:

(12) audial and visual media (13) syntactic or semantic rulers

They are in fact parallel structures where one element has been ellipted in the parataxis. Here the adjectives are attached to different referents in the world. However this is not always the case, as can be inferred from the examples:

(14) an ironic, disturbing look (15) that quick and honest arrangement (16) it was a neutral or unmarked accent

Here both paratactical broken adjectives qualify the same referent in both cases. As can be presumed, there are cases of actual ambiguity, where the hearer has to count on the context for interpretation:

(17) there were tall, dark men in the street (18) we saw white and blue vessels on the lake

Bache (1978) suggests that, in cases of more than two adjectives (poly-adjectival nominal), the ordering of the elements can be shifted, although, in my view, such placement shifts can easily become a matter of dispute whenever there is a conflict as to which was the actual communicative goal intended in that particular context of situation:

(19)  the whole sickening, unresolvable mess

Here we have a hypotaxis plus a parataxis whereas in the next example we have the converse case, namely, a parataxis plus a hypotaxis:

(20) strong, sweet black coffee

Furthermore even more complex construction can be considered which are insertions or parenthesis in the linear ordering:

(21) her strict, rather than flexible, attitude (22) the critical, if necessary, appraisa! (23) inferrable, contextually bound, meanings

Where two epithets occur various ordering solutions can be contemplated. To resort to an easy norm that states that a certain class (Numeratives) should precede Epithets and these in turn should precede Classifiers is circular and not very satisfactory. It would be nearer the truth to say that a given adjective is able to appear in different places of the Nominal Group. Thus we may say either 24) or 25) depending on discourse context.

(24) some northern popular tunes (25) some popular northern tunes

# 5. The meaning of epithet ordering

Now, is there any principle that accounts for order preference in human language? According to some functional linguists (Haiman 1985; Givon 1989), grammatical norms like, for instance, those governing linear ordering, far from being arbitrary, tend to follow certain natural iconic principles. It follows from this that likeness or isomorphism requires that attitudinal Epithets be placed nearer the initial position, marked for informatively more accessible coding.

And this same principle seems to be at work in the linear arrangement of elements in the clause sequence, where the subject as the topical theme seems to be the rule in most languages.

This line of thought totally agrees with the organization of informative texts as proposed in Rosch (1973) inter alia,' which also coincides with the ground concept of communicative dynamism of the Prague School. In their view, a text is well-formed if and only if it begins with the least informative message and proceeds gradually along the informative axis whereby each message is more informative than the preceding one. Admittedly, propositions as well as clauses and phrases in discourse tend to contain some given (presupposed) information and some new (asserted) information. As Firbas (1974:23) noted: "(theme)... expresses something that is known or at least obvious in the given situation..."

Halliday's (1985:316) textual function seems to be in complete agreement with this. For him a clause proceeds like a wave with peaks of new prominence and troughs of given non prominence. In an unmarked way, the initial thematic trough is followed by a rhematic peak of information. Therefore the least accessible item is the least probable or marked informatively. But, as Halliday also suggests elsewhere, there is inherent scalarity from given to new information. This has been empirically tested by means of a great deal of prosodic evidence that attest to it. As Givon (1987:212) aptly put it: "But is it (in his quoted examples) $^ { a }$ gradation in the degree offocus? Or, a gradation from 'topic'to focus'? The two seem to be, somehow, the extreme points on a single scale".

If we now extrapolate clause communicative dynamism to the coding of a nominal phrase, we find a parallel scalarity of unfocused, leading to focused, information, which is also backed up by prosodic means. Thus the end-weight focused member is the last on the scale, namely the classifier+noun:

(26) rather nice wild cherry Chinese watercolour pictures (27) Two large Northern European industrial countries

Here the stress falls on the last and most restrictive modifier which, in the role of classifier, quite frequently forms a kind of collocative meaning together with its respective noun, i.e. both lexical items show a habitual tendency to co-occur in the discourse.

# 6. Use in discourse

In Rhetoric (III,iii,3) Aristotle voices his prejudices against long-winded poets and warns us to keep away from their deceitful, redundant gabble:

Those who employ poetic language by their lack of taste make the style ridiculous and frigid (by piling ornament upon ornament) and such idle chatter produces obscurity; for when words are piled upon one who already knows, it destroys perspicuity by a cloud of verbiage...

However harshly the epithets have been critisized as being idle, worthless chatter', we would like to argue that they do contribute to the noun fullness of meaning. Only in extreme cases of really redundant, unnecessary their shades of meaning can be scornfully ignored as gratuitous.

The gradient, non-discrete nature of the function of nominal modifiers has been contested by Newmayer (1983:112) who has critisized functionalists from the vantage point of categorial reductionism, by stressing that they 'attribute whatever structural property is being discussed to informally described human states, drives, needs, abilities, and such that have no basis in any existing formalized theory of human behavior or cognition'.

In Spanish, Italian and French where we find a pre- and postposition of modifiers the assignment of tonic prominence is all left to the speakers, depending on the interpretation of particular cases. So gradience is a feature that readers cannot get rid of without a certain amount of decoding effort.

Speakers do know that certain epithets are more likely to occur in one position than in another. In English a morphological classification can be set up: the derived and the underived. The former can be broken down into:

a) denominal: chilly, fussy, rainy, terrible, fan-like, forceful, light-coloured, short-sighted, right-handed.   
b) deverbal: hesitant, amusing, lovable, evasive, ill-formed, well-shaped, goodselling.

In the following fragment of a poem by Antonio Machado (Soledades, 1903) non-defining adjectives are located on both sides of the head noun. However, the translation into English by R.A. Cardwell (1989) is forced to place or even pile up, when needed, the adjectives before the verb:

(28) el limonero languido suspende una palida rama polvorienta sobre el encanto de la fuente limpia   
(29) the languid lemon tree suspends a pale dusty branch over the enchantment of the limpid fountain

We could argue at this stage that it is precisely those describing epithets that lend the poem as a whole some of the most relevant meanings of 'symbolistic' style, as Cardwell himself suggests.

# 7. Conclusion

There seems to be, however, considerable variation across written genres, as can be seen in the figure below:

Epithets across written genres   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Texts</td><td>non-restrict epithets</td><td>restrictive epithets</td><td>Total words</td><td>frequency</td></tr><tr><td>news</td><td>83</td><td>31</td><td>5025</td><td>0,0202</td></tr><tr><td>fiction</td><td>138</td><td>29</td><td>5102</td><td>0,0302</td></tr><tr><td>science</td><td>28</td><td>47</td><td>5096</td><td>0,0104</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>249</td><td>107</td><td>15223</td><td>0,0203</td></tr></table></body></html>

We can draw some conclusions from the data which, I must admit, met our expectations. First, the most numerous adjectives of fiction are mostly describing and therefore non-restrictive. However, we must allow for a wide variation within this genre, since some are more descriptive and others more narrative in character. My corpus here was a short story by R. Dahl in which there is a considerable amount of description. Second, daily news reports strike a balance between the two types. Lastly, scientific writing has less adjectives and the most frequently used are those which are restrictive.

We should observe, though, that in many cases we were at a loss to decide whether they actually belonged to one type or the other as set up categorically.

The data suggested the conclusion that the communicative goal we as speakers have to face when making avail of the above discourse genres somehow determines, and to a certain extent anticipates, the type of modifying adjective one is bound to use.

# INFORMATION PROGRESSION STRATEGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE FORMS A CROSS-LINGUISTIC STUDY

ANGELA DOWNING & JULIA LAVID\* Universidad Complutense de Madrid

# Abstract

This paper presents a contrastive study of the varying thematic progression pattens which organize information in a multilingual corpus of administrative forms (English, German and Italian) dealing with pension benefits, disability and other kinds of allowances. The analysis showed that the three languages make use of the rhemic (simple linear), the themic (constant), and the derived hyperthematic patterns for the organization and development of information, but they differ in their distribution: the primary method of information development in the English forms is the derived hyperthematic and the themic TP patterns. These also predominate in the sections which the user has to fill out in the Italian and the German forms, while the instructional notes which accompany them make use of both the rhemic and the derived hyperthematic TP patterns fairly evenly. The paper explores the influence of several factors which may account for these differences: the discourse purpose, and its realization through the corresponding text type depending on the the social distance and the social role between text producers and receivers, and the rhetorical structure of the passage. These factors are shown to apply cross-linguistically through selected text extracts of the multilingual corpus.

# 1. Introduction

The notion of information progression in discourse has received considerable attention within Prague School linguistics (Danes 1974; Firbas 1992) and systemicfunctional theory (Fries 1981, 1995; Fries and Francis 1992; Martin 1992a, 1992b). Danes ' theory of Thematic Progression (TP) studies "the choice and ordering of utterance themes, their mutual concatenation and hierarchy, as well as their relationship to the hyperthemes of the superior text units (such as paragraph, chapter..), to the whole of text, and to the situation" (Danes 1974:114). He identifies three major patterns of Thematic progression: simple linear progression, constant progression and derived hyperthematic progression which can be diagrammatically represented as follows:

1. Simple linear progression: an item from the rheme of the first clause becomes the theme of the subsequent clause: $\mathrm { R h } ( \mathbf { x } ) ;  \mathrm { T h } ( \mathbf { x } ) + \mathrm { R h } ( \mathbf { y } ) ; \mathrm { T h } ( \mathbf { y } ) . . .$   
2. Constant progression: an item in the theme of the first clause is also selected as the theme of the following clause: $\operatorname { T h } ( \mathbf { x } ) + \operatorname { R h } ( \mathbf { x } ) ; \operatorname { T h } ( \mathbf { x } ) + \operatorname { R h } ( \mathbf { y } ) . . .$   
3. Derived hyperthematic progression: the particular themes in subsequent clauses are derived from a "hypertheme": $\mathrm { T } =$ [Hypertheme]; $\mathrm { T h } ( 1 ) + \mathrm { R h } ( 1 ) ; \mathrm { T h } ( 2 ) + \mathrm { R h } ( 2 ) ; \mathrm { T h } ( 3 ) + \mathrm { R h } ( 3 ) . . .$

Certain combinations of these TP types \*may be considered as TP types of a higher order, representing a formal frame for the employment of the basic types' (op. cit.). The most important of these frames is held to be that of 'split Rheme', a combination of Types 1 and 2, illustrated below as (4):

4. Splitting progression: the rheme of the first clause is split into two items, each in turn being then taken as a theme element in the subsequent clauses:

$$
\mathrm { T h } ( \mathbf { x } ) + \mathrm { R h } ( \mathbf { x } ) \left( = \mathrm { R i } + \mathrm { R i } \right) ; \mathrm { T h } ( \mathbf { y } ) + \mathrm { R i } ; \mathrm { T h } ( \mathbf { w } ) + \mathrm { R i } \mathrm { i }
$$

This typology was reformulated by Dubois (1987) who proposed to integrate the simple linear, the constant and the derived hyperthematic progressions into two main types: a) themic progression: when a theme that is not new derives from a previous theme or themes; b) rhemic progression: when the theme derives from a previous rheme or rhemes. Each of these types can be simple, i.e. from a single source, or multiple (from more than one source). If the progression is simple, the possibilities are contiguous or gapped. If it is multiple, the subtypes are (re)integration and separation. This reformulation allowed Dubois to subsume Danes' derived hyperthematic progression as an indirect subtype of either the themic or the rhemic progression.

Danes' theory of Thematic Progression (TP) has been extensively applied to the descriptive study of textualization strategies in different English genres (Giora

1983; Weissberg 1984; Maynard 1986; Curzon 1984; Taylor 1983; Nwogu and Bloor 1989), while Dubois' reformulation of Danes' theory has been limited to her own analysis of 52 biomedical slides taken from an academic meeting of the Federation of American societies for Experimental Biology.

In this article, we present the results of a cross-linguistic analysis of the thematic progression strategies used by technical writers when designing administrative forms in three languages: English, German and Italian. The corpus analysis revealed differences in the distribution of TP patterns which may be accounted for by several factors such as the discourse purpose, the social distance and the social role between producers and receivers in the different language communities, and the rhetorical structure of the passage.

The article is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the material and methodology used for the corpus analysis; section 3 presents and discusses the results of the analysis, illustrating through selected text extracts the different TP patterns found in the three languages, and exploring the relationship between these patterns and several discourse factors. Section 4 provides a summary and some concluding remarks on the work reported in the paper.

# 2. Analysis methodology

The multilingual corpus used for this study contains 61, 248 words and consists of twenty two administrative forms: eight English, twelve bilingual (Italian/ German) and two bilingual (Italian/English) forms. The forms deal with pension benefits, disability and other kinds of allowances.

The theoretical tools used for the analysis of the thematic progression patterns in the multilingual administrative forms was Danes' theory of Thematic Progression as reformulated by Dubois (1987). However, Danes' derived hyperthematic TP pattern -which Dubois subsumes under the more general themic patternwas kept as a distinct pattern in our analysis, given the different variants of information progression that it presented in our corpus. For example, we found many instances, especially in the Italian and the German forms, where the pattern of progression does not derive from the hypertheme to subsequent themes, but to the rhemes of subsequent utterances. It is also noticeable that, when the hypertheme is complex, or is a clause, the pattern of derivation can come from the thematic or from the rhematic part of the hypertheme.

Using the above mentioned tools, we carried out a cross-linguistic analysis of the multilingual corpus addressing the following issues:

1. Determining the types of TP patterns which appear in the three languages.

2. Determining the distribution of each type across the three languages.

3. Exploring the relationship between the types of TP patterns which appear in the three languages and different factors such as the discourse purpose, and its realization by the corresponding text type, depending on the the social distance between the interlocutors, and the rhetorical structure of the passage.

# 3. Results and discussion

This section presents and discusses the results of the three issues addressed in the analysis phase. We start with the types of TP patterns which appear in the three languages.

# 3.1 Thematic progression patterns across languages

An interesting result of the cross-linguistic comparison of types of TP patterns is that all three languages make use of the rhemic (simple linear), the themic (constant) patterns, and the derived hyperthematic pattern for the organization and development of information. Below are brief instances of the use of these TP patterns in each language:

# A/ THE RHEMIC TP PATTERN

As we explained above, both the themic and the rhemic TP patterns can be simple, and if so, contiguous or gapped; or multiple, with at least two subtypes: (re)integration and separation. Below are some examples of each type in the three languages (themes are underlined):

(RHEMIC MULTIPLE SEPARATION)

The fact that the three TP patterns are present across the three languages is an indication that they are basic universal patterns of information progression in administrative forms. Further analysis of the same genre in other languages should confirm or invalidate these preliminary results, but in our corpus the three TP patterns seem to be fundamental features of discourse organization.

# 3.2 The distribution of TP patterns across languages

In a first phase of analysis our approach was originally quantitative, based on the frequency distribution of TP patterns in a restricted selection of administrative forms. From the Italian/ German forms we analysed the following selection:

: (ANF/ dip) Domanda di assegno per il nucleo familiare : (ANF/prest) Domanda di assegno per il nucleo familiare : (V01) Domanda di pensione di vecchiaia e di anzianita : (EC02-93) Estratto conto assicurativo $\mathbf { \nabla } ( \mathbf { L D 0 } 2 / \mathbf { s } )$ Cartolina per la correzione di dati errati su un versamento

These were supplemented with two Austrian forms:

: Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Angestellten (PVAng) : Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Arbeiter (PArb)

From the English forms we selected the following:

: (BR1) British Retirement Form. Form BR 1.Department of Social Security. : (BR19) Retirement Pension Forecast. Department of Social Security. : (DLA1) Disability Living Allowance. Benefits Agency. Department of Social Security.

We also analysed two bilingual English-Italian forms:

: (Italo-Australia) Accordo Italia/Australia in materia di sicurezza sociale.   
(Italo-Britannica) Convenzione Italo-Britannica sulle assicurazioni sociali. Domanda di pensione per ritiro dal lavoro.

The quantitative analysis of the distribution of TP patterns in the selected sample showed that, though the use of the different TP patterns is common to the three languages, some patterns predominate in each of them. Thus, it was observed that the primary method of information development in the English forms is the derived hyperthematic and the themic TP patterns. These patterns also predominate in the sections which the user has to fill out in the Italian/German forms, while the instructional notes which accompany them make use of both the rhemic and the derived hyperthematic TP patterns fairly evenly.

In a second phase of analysis, we observed that a purely quantitative approach did not provide us with enough information about the motivations for the distribution of TP patterns across the three languages. This fact led us to undertake a qualitative analysis on a larger sample of administrative forms, and to explore common relationships between the distribution of TP patterns and several discourse factors across the three languages. The factors we explored were the discourse purpose, and its realization by the corresponding text type, depending on the social distance and social role between the interlocutors, and the rhetorical structure of the passage. The results of this analysis are discussed in the following subsections.

# 3.3 Thematic progression patterns and contextual factors

This section presents the results of the analysis of the relationship between TP patterns and contextual factors such as the discourse purpose and its corresponding text type, depending on the social distance and social role between text producers and receivers.

The discourse purpose refers to the communicative function of a passage and tends to be associated with a specific text type.' Thus, information in the forms was grouped as reflecting different discourse purposes: expository or explanatory, procedural, and information-seeking. In this respect, our analysis revealed that these general discourse purposes were not always realized by the corresponding text type. For example, it is very frequent to find procedural information in the Italian/German forms realized by an expository or descriptive text type.

Our hypothesis is that this mismatch is probably due to the influence of sociocultural factors such as the social distance and the social role between text producers and receivers which differs in the communities where the forms are produced. The British forms are issued by the Document Design Unit (DDU), a special section of the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS), a public institution in Britain responsible for various kinds of benefit, including pensions, unemployment, and sickness. The DHSS has considerable expertise on the design of forms and letters, based on the viewpoint of citizens rather than officials. The forms are tested by independent market researchers who interview typical users in their homes, recording their reactions as they fill in the form. As a result, the DDU has developed specific guidelines for writing forms (the Good Forms Guide 1983; the Letter Writer's Kit 1992) which place strong emphasis on producing forms which are warm and non-intimidating in tone, with the purpose of increasing their acceptability by reducing the social distance and the hierarchical roles between the Administration and its users. It also recommends the use of clear, simple language to achieve effective communication.

By contrast, the Italian and German forms -produced at Istituto Nazionale Previdenza Sociale (INPS) and at PAB, the bilingual province of Bolzano- have not been subject to the extensive user testing, and only some of the most recent ones follow the new Italian guidelines for improving administrative language (see Codice di Stile 1993). As a result, Italian/German administrative forms sound officious and unfriendly.

Example (1) below illustrates the contrast in textualization strategies employed by the Italian and the British versions of the same procedural information.

Example (1):   
Italian   
AVVERTENZE (NOTES)   
Completata la compilazione del formulario si deve firmare la dichiarazione all'ultima pagina. Il presente formulario, debitamente compilato, deve essere presentato o inviato al piu presto possibile alla Sede provinciale dell'Instituto Nazionale della Providenza Sociale. (I.N.P.S.) English   
When you have filled up the form you must sign the Declaration on the last page. Send or take the completed form to your I.N.P.S. local Office as soon as possible.   
(Italo-Britannica)

The English version requests action from the user in a direct way (send or take the completed form to your INPS local office), and addresses the user directly by using the personal pronoun "you". By contrast, the Italian version does not tell the reader directly what to do but explains what has to be done in an impersonal way. It uses an expository strategy to express procedural information. The TP pattern varies accordingly in the two languages: the English version presents a themic TP pattern based on the addressee (you),while the Italian version uses a rhemic TP pattern to develop information from the rheme of the first clause (la compilazione del formulario) to the theme of the second (il formulario).

Example (2) is another illustration of the use of the rhemic TP pattern in a passage where the discourse purpose is procedural but the text type selected is expository:

# Example (2):

Il lavoratore -dopo aver indicato i propri dati anagrafici- deve dichiarare, barrando 1'apposita casella, se intende chiedere I'assegno per il nucleo familiare o se vuole segnalare una variazione nella situazione del nucleo   
-In caso di richiesta dell'assegno per il nucleo familiare e da tenere presente che 1'assegno decorre dal $1 ^ { \circ }$ luglio di ciascun anno fino al 30 giugno dell'anno successivo. Qualora il diritto all'assegno per il nucleo familiare sia sorto dopo il $1 ^ { \circ }$ luglio, va indicata la data di decorrenza del diritto. Se il diritto cessa prima del 30 giugno (ad.es per rapporto di lavoro a tempo determinato) va indicata la data di scadenza.   
-Se il lavoratore intende segnalare la variazione nella situazione del nucleo familiare gia dichiarata deve indicare la data nella quale la variazione stessa si e verificata. In tal caso il modulo deve essere presentato al datore di lavoro entro 30 giorni. (ANF/Dip)

# (English translation:

The worker -after having filled in his personal details- must state, by crossing the appropriate box, whether he wants to apply for a family benefit or whether he wants to declare a change of family situation.   
-If applying for a family benefit, it should be noted that the benefit runs from the 1st of July of the current year to the 30th of June of the following year. If the entitlement to family benefit began after the 1st of July, the date from which it began must be indicated. If the entitlement ends before the 30th of June (for example, because of a fixed term contract), the date on which it ends must be indicated.   
-If the worker intends to declare a change of family situation already given he must indicate the date on which the change occurred. In this case the form must be handed to the employer within 30 days).

In this example, information is developed in a linear way from the new information in the preceding rheme which is picked up again as given information in the thematic conditions (underlined) which apply to the following utterances. It starts with a complex clause composed of a main clause, interrupted by an embedded temporal clause, and a split rheme which captures the two options available to the worker (apply for family benefit or declare a change in family situation). The information presented in the split rheme is repeated again in the two conditional clauses which function as the point of departure for the warning and the request that follow. The rest of the information conditioned by these two options is also presented using a rhemic strategy.

The English forms do not present a mismatch between discourse purpose and text type as the Italian/German do. As shown above, when the discourse purpose is procedural, the English forms prefer the themic TP pattern, which is based, in the main, on the addressee, expressed as you, as the agent of a series of actions. This reference to the addressee is explicit in active clauses (as in Example (3) below) or implicit in imperatives (as in Example (4)):

Example (3):

# How you can get a Retirement Pension Forecast

You can get a Pension Forecast if you are.. All you have to do is fill in the attached form and send it to us at.. If you want more information about Retirement Pension generally, ring Freeline Social Security -a free and confidential service. Just ring 0800 665 555. (BR19)

Example (4):

# What to do now

Check that you have answered all the questions that apply to you. Send the form to us at [...] (BR19)

When the discourse purpose is expository, the English forms tend to use the rhemic TP pattern, which often happens when making a clarifying insertion or providing a definition, as illustrated below:

Example (5):

You will normally get your money from the Retirement Pension payday on, or after, the day that you tell us that you want to claim your Retirement Pension from. This payday is a fixed day of the week when you get your money for that week. (BR1)

The theme \*this payday" in the second sentence picks up information presented in the rheme of the preceding utterance with the aim of providing a definition for the term.

When the discourse purpose of the writer is to obtain information from the user (information-seeking), both the English and the Italian/German forms favour the use of the derived hyperthematic pattern, where a series of text entries are semantically derived from a more general concept, generally mentioned in the section heading. Example (6) below illustrates this fact:

Example (6):

About you   
Please tell us about yourself. Please write or tick in the answer boxes   
Surname   
Other names   
Title   
Date of birth   
National Insurance (NI) number   
Address   
Daytime phone number (CH2 (CP)

In this example, the text entries (surname, other names, title) are semantically derived from the concept "you" in a composition relationship (meronymy): each of the text entries is a descriptive part of the form-filler's identity. In other examples, the relationship between the hyperthematic element and the text entries is one of superordination, that is, several text entries are subclasses of a more general concept. Example (7) below illustrates this relationship.

Example (7):

# About Benefits

We need to know if you are getting any of the benefits listed here.   
Please tick any that you are getting. Dependant's War pension (this is sometimes called War Widow's pension) Industrial Death Benefit Statutory sick pay (SSP) Invalidity Benefit Severe Disablement Allowance Invalid Care Allowance Job Release Allowance Unemployment Benefit Child Benefit (BR19)

In this example, each ticking box is preceded by a subclass of benefit (unemployment benefit, child benefit, etc...) hyponymycally related to the superordinate concept (Benefits) captured in the section heading. Note also that the first two sentences inserted between the hypertheme and the derived items are an explanatory insertion which sometimes appears in the English forms, probably with the aim of reducing the distance between the user and the administration by directly mentioning the Security Department with the first person pronoun "we' (See Scott & Power 1994).

The Italian/German forms also employ this pattern of progression when requesting information from the user. Interestingly, though the pattern of derivation tends to progress hyponymically or hyperonymycally from a more general concept, the derived information tends to coincide with the rhematic part of the derived sentence, or is just a concept to which we could only assign a rhematic status in an elliptical clause structure. Example (8) below illustrates these two types of derived information:

Example (8):

Stato civile e particolari condizione del richiedente   
celibe coniugato/a vedovo/a separato/a divorziato/a  abbandonato/a legalmente   
ledig verheiratet verwitwet gerichtlich geschieden verlassen getrennt   
-e cittadino italiano?/ Ist der Antragsteller italienischer Staatsburger? SI NO: Indicare lo stato estero di cittadinanza Den Staat angeben

-e (o ha titolo di essere) iscritto negli elenchi dei lavoratori agricoli dipendenti? Is der Antragsteller in die Verzeichnisse der Landarbeiter eingetragen oder hat er Anrecht darauf?

NO SI Comune di iscrizione: Eintragungsgemeinde: (ANF/Prest)

Each of the derived items (celibe, coniugato, etc..) at the beginning of the section are subclasses of the superordinate concept "stato civile" (Engl.: marital status) in the section title. They could be assigned rhematic status as part of elliptical clauses such as: "are you single?", "are you married?" and so on. The sentences which follow these fields contain rhematic sections which are derived from the general concept "particolari condizioni del richiedente" (Engl.:particular conditions of the claimant) in the section title. The thematic sections in each of these derived sentences do not contribute to developing the communication forward but act just as the expression of the mood structure (interrogative) which typically realizes the questioning speech acts.

# 3.4 Thematic progression patterns and rhetorical structure

This section presents the results of the analysis of the relationship between TP patterns and the rhetorical organization of the different sections in the administrative forms. Our analysis revealed that the different rhetorical organizations which appear in the various sections (contrasts, elaborations, sequences, disjunctions) tend to be signalled by certain thematic selections which develop information according to certain patterns.

For example, when the section is globally organized by means of elaboration, the natural progression pattern is the derived hyperthematic pattern, as in examples (6) and (7). Therefore, this pattern predominates in the sections which request information from the user, since most of the fields in each section elaborate in one way or another the main topic"' or hypertheme presented in the section heading. But it also appears in the expository sections of the instructional notes in the Italian/German texts when the information presented is organized hierarchically, following the structure of the corresponding graphical part. Example (9) illustrates how the global organization of the section, based on a hierarchy of concepts which are semantically derived from the section heading, creates a derived hyperthematic progression pattern at a global level.

Example (9):   
ANNO CUI DEVONO ESSERE RIFERITI IL REDDITI [.]   
IL REDDITO DA DICHIARARE [...] SEZIONE A: REDDITI ASSOGETTABILI ALL' IRPEF [...] -REDDITI DA LAVORO DIPENDENTE E ASSIMILATI [..] -REDDITO COMPLESSIVO [...]   
SEZIONE B: REDDITI ESENTI DA IMPOSTA O SOGGETTI A RITENUTA   
ALLA FONTE A TITOLO DI IMPOSTA O A IMPOSTA SOSTITUTIVA [...]   
REDDITI DA NON DICHIARARE (ANF/Dip)

We have created an artificial indentation which does not exist in the original text to show more clearly the hierarchical structure of the section. The three elements (anno cui devono essere riferiti il redditi; reddito da dichiarare; redditi da non dichiarare) (Eng: year when the income must be declared; income to be declared; income not to be declared) are sub-hyperthemes which elaborate the information of the higher hypertheme from which they derive and which is presented in the title of the graphical part (Dichiarazione dei redditi del nucleo familiare dell'anno 199...). (Eng: Income declaration of the year 199..). The second sub-hypertheme (Il reddito da dichiarare) is further elaborated by two more sub-hyperthemes (redditi assogettabili all'IRPEF; redditi esenti da imposta o soggeti a ritenuta alla fonte a titolo di imposta o a imposta sostitutiva). The former is again further elaborated into two kinds: redditi da lavoro dipendente e assimilati; and reddito complessivo.

When the section is organized as a contrast between two options, this tends to be signalled by initial (thematic) conditionals in a themic simple pattern whereas their main clauses (rhematic) pick up information from a previous rheme or derive it from a hypertheme. Example (10) below illustrates this:

Example (10):

The date from when you want to claim your Retirement Pension   
If you are a man If you are a woman   
you can claim your Retirement Pension you can claim your Retirement Pension : when you are 60 : when you are 65   
or : any time between your 60th or : any time between your 65th and and 65th birthday 70th birthday   
or : when you are 65 or . when you are 70 (BR1)

The information derived from the hypertheme (The date from when...) is picked up in the main clauses which function as rhemes of the contrasting themes which are presented as two conditional clauses (if you are a woman, if you are a man). The contrastive rhetorical organization of the passage is reinforced by the layout of information in two columns. The rhematic information is also clearly marked by bullets.

When the section is organized rhetorically as a disjunction, the most frequent TP pattern is rhemic (linear) multiple separation. Example (2) above illustrates this fact. The two alternative options presented in the rheme of the first sentence are further explored in the disjunction relation which is signalled by each of the thematic conditions which follow.

# 4. Summary and conclusion

As the analysis results have shown, the three languages represented in our corpus of administrative forms make use of the themic, the rhemic and the derived hyperthematic TP patterns to develop information. This lends weight to the conclusion that these are basic patterns of information progression in this genre.

The analysis has also shown that there exist differences in the distribution of TP patterns: thus, while the British forms prefer the derived hyperthematic and the themic TP patterns, the Italian and the German forms show a different distribution of TP patterns: the derived hyperthematic and the themic TP patterns predominate in the sections which the user has to fill in, while the rhemic and the derived hyperthematic TP patterns are preferred in the instructional notes which accompany the sections to be filled in by the user.

Adopting a qualitative approach to account for these differences, we have illustrated through selected text extracts how TP patterns are related to factors such as the discourse purpose, and its realization by the corresponding text type depending on the social distance and social role between text producers and receivers. Furthermore, the rhetorical structure of the passage also seems to play a role in the distribution of TP patterns in the three languages. Thus, the derived hyperthematic TP pattern was preferred when the discourse purpose and the text type is information-seeking. This also seems to be the tendency when the section is rhetorically organized as an elaboration. The rhemic TP pattern is preferred when the text type is expository or when the section is organized as a disjunction. The themic TP pattern is normally associated with a procedural discourse purpose in the English forms, or when the section is organized as a contrast. This is also the tendency in the Italian/German forms when the text type is likewise procedural.

# INTERPERSONAL CHOICES IN ACADEMIC WORK

EIJA VENTOLA Martin-Luther-University, Halle-Wittenberg

# Abstract

Juxtapositions Consensus/Conflict or Cooperation/Confrontation are terms that are used in sociology when discussing social order and social unity. Following the consensus-cooperation viewpoint, the members of the society supposedly work together for the common good and find cooperation fruitful and rewarding. The conflict-confrontation viewpoint claims that due to conflicting interests a state of consensus cannot remain for long, and in order to achieve societal progress, confrontation between various interest groups in the society is necessary.

These juxtapositions of Consensus/Conflict or Cooperation/Confrontation can also be found operating in the discourse of linguistics. New theories emerge and challenge earlier theories, but soon they, in turn, will be confronted. In the objective world of academia, it may appear that only the theories are battling against one another -that intellectual arguments are not personified. Yet, we all know this is not the case.

The purpose of this paper is to examine some of the linguistic mechanisms, here labelled as strategies of Alignment and Bashing, that operate in juxtapositions of Consensus/Conflict or Cooperation/Confrontation in academic papers. The paper illustrates the functioning of Alignment -and Bashing-- strategies and shows how the resources of the interpersonal function of language are utilized for the realization of these strategies. Awareness of the linguistic workings of such mechanisms is necessary if linguists aim to enhance cooperation rather than confrontation in their work.

# 1. Introduction

As communicators, we all play various roles. J. R. Firth (1964:90, 91) described us as "a bundle of personae"' and as having a " 'set' of the personality". From childhood to adolescence we accumulate social roles and become members of various social groups, members of which "behave rather alike". The activities of these social groups fill our work and leisure time. We participate in these activities, because we are part of the group; others recognise us as members of certain groups.

The 'sets'/roles, characterising group members, are manifested and sustained, as Firth says (1964:91), "with many ear languages, one or more eye and hand languages, and one or two tongue languages'. Language plays a major role in the accumulation of roles and in their manifestation.

Firth saw a great deal of good coming out of this socialization into roles. We are social beings, we enjoy each other's company, and we like to engage in a conversation with one another. When people with the same 'sets' meet, their conversation is easily flowing, because "you generally say what your fellows one way or the other expect you to say" (Firth 1964:94). Language creates a sense that one belongs to this or that group, a sense of unity, a sense of conformity.

Sociologists have also discussed this aspect of human life, calling it a consensus viewpoint.

The consensus view stresses the essentially social nature of the human animal, the fact that the individual only becomes truly human through socialization and through membership in society. They stress the essentially co-operative nature of society itself... Co-operation not only makes possible the completion of complex and elaborate tasks, it is itself rewarding; men appreciate the company of others, their approval, and want to participate with them in common enterprises. (Worsley 1970:374)

But there is also another side to the coin capturing the social nature of human beings, of which Firth also reminds us. He (1964:93) points out that \*the \*sets' vary enormously". Since we as humans are all not socialized into exactly the same groups, language is bound to manifest differences as well. Firth (1964:91) notes that by the age of six, children are "fully alive to submission and dominance in the child group"'. They learn the language of"inequality, superiority, inferiority, snobbery"' at the same time when they learn the language of cooperation and fellowship (Firth 1964:95).

When social groups as a whole have very different 'sets', clashes of goals, of power, and so on arise. In sociology this viewpoint has often been labelled as a conflict viewpoint. According to it, different interests lead to different opportunities for different groups.

Most societies are so organized that a given arrangement of relationships which benefits some will deprive and discomfort others; people placed in different positions in society, therefore develop quite different interests, for any action or policy intended for the benefit of one group or category will threaten the well-being of others. (Worsley 1970:375)

The sociological viewpoint makes us consider the manifestations of the struggle for power. The group membership becomes interpreted in its confrontative sense (and mostly also in a negative sense). Societies, groups and even individuals are seen in opposition against one another. The disagreements can become very vicious.

The area of Consensus/Confrontation is enormously large as a topic for discussion. Therefore, I shall have to limit myself here to a certain degree and only merely indicate some trends. I shall do so only in regards to one area: the discourse that we linguists produce ourselves. To differentiate my topic from the larger area of Consensus/Confrontation, I shall refer to the manifestations of Consensus/Confrontation in the discourse of linguists as strategies of Alignment and Bashing. We tend to align ourselves (a) with linguists who think alike and (b) we tend to bash linguists who think differently.

If I were a sociologist, like Worsley whom I have quoted earlier, the differences between the strategies would probably be all I would discuss in this context. But the purpose of my paper is not to show 'the sociology' of groups of linguists; my purpose is not to show that 'such and such a group' uses more vehement language and is 'nastier' to other people than 'some other group'. Rather, I am interested in raising our consciousness about the kind of Consensus/Confrontation ideologies that are involved in the area in which we are working. Perhaps such consciousness will ultimately make 'doing linguistics' more pleasant.

Since I am a linguist, like Firth, I am interested in exploring the relationship of these strategies and the language that realizes them. I am particularly focussing on whether or not these strategies of Alignment and Bashing can be captured by using the systemic-functional linguistic model, i.e. my interest is whether we have in fact developed sufficient analytical tools in order to see what is going on in these opposing strategies in texts produced by linguists. The potential area where explanations for the realizations of these strategies can be found is that of the interpersonal function of language.

# 2. Consensus/Confrontation in academia: Alignment and Bashing

It has been claimed, and academics themselves claim, that Consensus and Confrontation do not operate within academia --that specifically written academic language is devoid of such contrast. Gilbert and Mulkay (1984) say that scientists, microbiologists in their case, are more open to admit in conversation rather than in their writing that they follow certain schools of research. In writing researchers claim to write objectively, using what Gilbert and Mulkay call an empiricist repertoire. But when the same scientists have been interviewed, Gilbert and Mulkay say that they use a contingent repertoire, telling the interviewer about the rivalry between research groups when experiments are carried out, and so on.

Perhaps members of 'hard sciences' are more eager to hide their membership to a particular research ideology behind a curtain of 'objectivity'. Linguists, being representatives of 'soft sciences', seem to have less scruples about showing their membership cards, as I shall shortly demonstrate by showing some examples. These examples illustrate two kinds of strategies among linguists: that of

Alignment and that of Bashing. (Naturally the distinction is not a clear either-or but rather a cline).

# 2.1 Alignment

The analogy we can make is that a social group is like a beehive. We as academics, for instance as systemic-functional linguists, are a social group, and thus, form a beehive. We work together -like bees in a beehive do-- for the common good-for making linguistic honey'. We appreciate each other's talks and papers at conferences and publications. We get papers published in 'sympathetic journals and books', and generally our cooperation in the beehive is fairly rewarding. Members of other schools of linguistics are likely to feel in the similar way amongst themselves. But between different schools there is actually relatively little interaction. It is hard for the bees from one hive to participate in the honey production processes of another beehive.

Yet, within a beehive, we as bees do not have to have exactly the same genes or carry out the same tasks. Beehives allow differences as well. For example, within each beehive there are workerbees and a queen. All schools of linguistics as social groups have their head figures who have AUTHORITY because they are considered the experienced experts (however, only very infrequently we see queenbees' as figureheads of linguistic schools). Usually these leaders also have PROMINENCE in the school's publications and because of this, they may perhaps also exercise some CONTROL or POWER either overtly or covertly over their domain and the work of the other bees in the beehive (for a discussion of these variables, see Martin 1992a:527). Also workerbees differ; some have simply been around longer than others; some have some other differentiating characteristics. But with effort within a beehive, individuals can maintain unity, conformity, consensus within the social groups of linguists -we learn to disagree politely with those who think alike. Even though we might not always agree with the fellow linguists, we still find ourselves aligning ourselves with them. Example (1) and (2) show some alignments within systemic-functional linguistics.

(1) The claim that 'language ability is a product of social structure' is made in strong terms by 'functionalist' linguists, notably M.A.K. Halliday. We follow Halliday in requiring that social meanings and their textual realizations be included within the scope of a grammatical description. (Fowler et al. 1979:187)   
(2) He [Firth] said that he found it unnecessary to operate with mind/body, mentalism/ mechanism, word/idea and 'such dualisms'. I would agree with Firth --again, always saying that it depends on the purpose for which you are looking at language. (Halliday 1978:51)

I could have continued the list and shown how Firth further aligns himself with Malinowski's views. The alignments in Examples (1) and (2) are relatively straightforward. Let us take one further example. It is from Ian Robinson's The New Grammarians' Funeral. A Critique of Noam Chomsky's Linguistics, published in 1975. As the title shows, it is more about Chomsky than Firth, but Robinson makes his alignment to Firth's way of thinking quite clear in this passage.

(3) Meaning is not a component of language, but a characterization. When language is itself it is meaningful, and the meaning is whatever makes language language. Hence grammar is indeed the study of meaning. This was well said, in a quite different way, by J. R. Firth, a writer of not much transatlantic repute. Firth's levels of linguistic inquiry are an ascent towards a full picture of meaning that will be the same as a full understanding of language... [a quote from Firth follows]... This has the great and (in linguistics) unusual merit of seeing that meaning is the high level controlling all the rest; all the aspects of language are thus aspects of meaning and the 'component' and 'interpretation' fallacies are avoided. It also has the equally unusual virtue of taking for granted that linguistics is the study of language, in contrast with which semantics is not of the first concern to Chomsky, who has scarcely gone much further than Carroll here. (Robinson 1975:139-140)

The tone of Example (3) is already considerably \*stronger' in alignment, mainly because here Firth is juxtaposed with Chomsky, a representative of another alignment. Firth's writings are presented as 'well said', although they are coded differently from the ones in the quote. By following Firth and his views, we can all be mountaineers, climbing up the mountain of meaning and conquering it (an ascent towards a full picture of meaning that will be the same as a full understanding of language), whereas Chomsky [with Carroll] is still traipsing along on the foothills, not getting to the essentials: semantics is not of the first concern to Chomsky, who has scarcely gone much further than Carroll here. Whereas Chomsky gets lost in certain fallacies, Firth is provided with the great and unusual capacity of seeing. Firth's path leads to a 'victory', whereas Chomsky's leads to a 'defeat'. These kinds of juxtapositions will be analysed in detail shortly, but first a few summarizing words about the benefits of such alignments.

We all want to show our intellectual history through these kinds of alignments. In many cases, it may open doors for us: we get our papers published more easily, we get invitations to congresses, we can get into important positions more easily --that is, if the journals, the congress organizers and the universities align with our alignments. It is only when we try to enter the boundaries of another beehive that trouble occurs. The other bees seem to sting us for various reasons, as will be demonstrated in the next section.

# 2.2 Bashing

Often we hear the claim that it is the issues, not the people that are in confrontative positions in academic writing. In my view, however, it appears that in our writing at least we very frequently seem to forget this, and our writing about the theories of others becomes extremely personal and attacking.

I have chosen the word bashing' deliberately as a label for this kind of writing. Bashing to me means the other is in a pretty defenceless situation. In real situations where, for example, wives and children get bashed, the victims are often physically weaker than the basher. In academic writing, the victims are also in a relatively weak position; they cannot respond to the criticism immediately. The confrontations cannot be sorted out then and there. There is always a delay in explanations and clarification, and frequently these attempts for consensus are not noticed and read by the basher and his/her supporting group. Let us look at two examples of what I consider 'bashing a linguist'.

The first example, Example (4), is from D. Terence Langendoen (1968) and is directed against Firth, but also Halliday and others get their share of bashing in it. The focus is on Firth's views on syntax.

# (4) 3.4. Views on Syntax

During this later period of Firth's work, neither he nor his colleagues in the London school made any substantive theoretical contribution to the study of syntax or morphology, and as we have already remarked..., practically no further work was done to refine the notion of "context of situation'. Only an article by T.F. Mitchell (1957) can be cited as an attempt to describe the meanings of words in terms of context of situation, but upon examination of this paper, it will be seen that it properly belongs to the realm of ethnography and not of semantics.

In syntax, P. Postal has shown that the grammatical theory of M.A.K. Halliday amounts to a slot-and-filler variety of phrase structure description.., and the same can be said of the somewhat earlier theoretical proposals by Robins... The only means by which we can evaluate Firth's view of syntax is by studying the terminological suggestions he made, since he published no syntactic descriptions during his lifetime...

[Then follows a discussion of Firth's and Halliday's use of ' colligation'--Halliday's was crudely dismissed...

The notion of "colligation" was also used by M.A.K. Halliday, in his dissertation The Language of the Chinese 'Secret History of the Mongols' (1959), in a characteristically ad hoc manner to define such entities as 'sentence'... The futility of attempts to provide definitions in terms of superficial formal characteristics, such as word occurrence in connection with punctuation marks, should be apparent...

[The extract ends with an evaluation of the work in morphology]

In morphology, the London school has produced at least two important descriptive works, one by R. H. Robins on Sundanese (1959), and the other by F.R. Palmer on Toigre (1962), but both of these works are strictly within the item-arrangement descriptive framework already established in American morphological descriptions. (Langendoen 1968:65-67)

We see that the work on syntax of a whole school of linguists is thrown into the wastepaper basket on a bit more than two pages. The bashing is achieved by claiming that the school has produced no relevant and comprehensive work and that some work which has been marketed in its name really belongs to another field (ethnography). The syntactic theory is just a 'slot-and-filler' technique, ad hoc linguistics, and the work done in morphology has merely been done by following the prevailing American traditions, anyway. Thus nothing has been achieved. These lines make the reader to dismiss the years of work by others in just a few minutes.

The second example, Example (5), is from Robinson (1975) and is directed against Chomsky, but of course ultimately it is also pointed against those who follow Chomsky. The discussion concerns Chomsky's understanding of Wittgenstein's discussion of 'what it is to expect somebody to tea'.

(5) By using the word we see putting the kettle on as expecting somebody to tea. So too one might expect somebody trembling, changing one's shirt and so on. Chomsky misses the point when he says 'alongside of expecting B to come to tea, I may also be expecting innumerable other things' (e.g. that B will be less than twelve feet tall, that he will greet me warmly, that if admitted to Harvard he will accept, etc.) (p. 278). These, are, indeed, other things. All that needs to be said about the last is that it is another expectation not relevant to the discussion. The expectation that he will greet me warmly is perhaps part of or closely related to the expectation that he will come to tea, and could be expressed by a similar range of thoughts or activities. It is Chomsky's first example that is interestingly confused, the expectation that B will be less than twelve feet tall.

... [A paragraph left out, concerning Austin's view to the matter]

Chomsky will not have this sort of discussion of a word's meaning, whether it makes any sense or not, because for Chomsky, as we have seen, meaning, independent of use, is a word's intrinsic conceptual structure that remains fixed whatever is done with the word.

Above all, Chomsky simply can't understand Wittgenstein's objections to the idea of 'science' which is the only notion of discipline Chomsky can entertain: he can't even see that they are objections. (Robinson 1975:152)

I shall postpone the discussion of this example until later, when I shall demonstrate what the linguistic analyses can bring forth about the realisations of this kind of language use. I now want to turn my attention to the situations where these strategies meet, i.e. when they are juxtaposed, in a text.

# 2.3 Juxtaposing strategies - fights and battles emerge

I have already indicated that the strategies of Alignment and Bashing tend to co-occur. I shall now discuss some such juxtapositions and discuss their effect.

# 2.3.1 Linguistic fights

The first case I take up is the situation where the bashed actually hits back. The use of strategies develops into a linguistic Fight. As you may have noticed, I have so far chosen my examples from relatively dated material --but in (6) I have given a history' of a relatively recent 'fight'. The readers can check themselves from the references given how the 'fight' is created, how 'hitting back' (both parties) takes place, and that these kinds of strategies are very much part of our daily lives even today. The fight that I am referring to concerns M.A.K. Halliday (1985; 1994) and has been conducted between Huddleston and Martin and Matthiessen.

The end of the written fight. As far as I know, Halliday did not participate in this discussion in writing by defending his views (whether he did so in conversation is not known to me). Perhaps he should have, as he was the person responsible for the original text. Perhaps the nature of the discussion would then have been different too, not as personalized, more subtle like in his criticism of Chomsky in Halliday (1961) and in Halliday's interview in Halliday (1978). But generally I believe him to favour cooperation rather than confrontation. He and Fawcett have, for example, quite clearly stated that:

... we make most of our progress not by attacking each other, but by BUILDING cooperatively on each other's ideas -by standing on each other's shoulders. (Halliday and Fawcett 1987: 1-2)

Strategies of alignment and bashing are juxtaposed also for other reasons. I refer to these occasions as battles -battles for occupying intellectual territory, battles for securing territory. I shall give some examples of these kinds of texts.

# 2.3.2 Battles for occupying intellectual territory

The battles for territory are conducted specifically by new approaches to linguistics, and they involve bashing those whose theories the new approach challenges. In 1983 Leech wrote at the beginning of his book Principles of Pragmatics:

The subject of 'pragmatics' is very familiar in linguistics today. Fifteen years ago it was mentioned by linguists rarely, if at all. In those far-off-seeming days, pragmatics tended to be treated as a rag-bag into which recalcitrant data would be conveniently stuffed, and where it could be equally conveniently forgotten. Now, many would argue, as I do, that we cannot really understand the nature of language itself unless we understand pragmatics: how language is used in communication. (Leech 1983:1)

He further remarks that "A unified account of what language is has, I believe, been lost"; thus he sees his opportunity for occupying some of the territory left unclaimed after the previous fights and battles. He does so by presenting seven postulates, one of which, Postulate 7, is a confrontation of Leech's ideas against Halliday's about functions of language: "Grammar is ideational; pragmatics interpersonal and textual' (Leech 1983:5). Leech goes about occupying this territory very cleverly. He invites the readers to align themselves with him rather than with Halliday by continuously juxtaposing his views to Halliday's views.

(7) From Popper's four language functions, I move on to those of Halliday, to which they bear a strong resemblance. However, whereas Halliday treats all his functions as being intrinsic to grammar, I interpret them differently: P 7: GRAMMAR IS IDEATIONAL; PRAGMATICS IS INTERPERSONAL AND TEXTUAL The ideational function is an amalgam of two subfunctions which Halliday calls 'experiential' and 'logical', and which correspond to Popper's descriptive and argumentative functions. The interpersonal function corresponds to Popper's expressive and signalling functions, which are based on similar functions... distinguished by Karl

Buhler (1934). Halliday has explained that he finds it unnecessary to maintain this distinction which Buhler, Popper, and also Jakobson (1960) have drawn between functions oriented towards the speaker's and hearer's ends of the communicative process: he sees the expressive and signalling function are being merged in a single interpersonal function. For the purposes of pragmatics, I agree with him...The third function of Halliday, the textual function, is of a very different status from the others. Halliday gives it the special status of an 'enabling function', and says that it is instrumental to the other two... I shall argue that although the textual organization of language plays an important part in an overall functional account of language, it is misleading to call the textual function a 'function' at all: there is something back-tofront about saying that language has the function of producing instantiations of itself. It is not language that has the function of transmitting itself through texts, but texts that have the function of transmitting language.

My main disagreement with Halliday, however, is over his wish to integrate all three functions within the grammar. I maintain, in contrast, that the ideational function belong to grammar.., and that the interpersonal function and the textual 'function' belongs to pragmatics... Although Halliday insists that the three functions are of equivalent status, he does drop one or two hints as to the special importance of the ideational function. While he deprecates, for example, the popular view that language is vehicle of ideas, he concedes that ideational function.. is a major component of meaning in the language system which is basic to more or less all uses of language' (1973:38-9). My own opinion, in contrast to this, is that the popular view of language is essentially correct: that it is the ideational language... which makes human language what it is: an extraordinarily powerful instrument of thought and communication...

I have criticized Halliday elsewhere (Leech 1980:22-5) for what I regard as a tendency to overgrammaticalization': .. It is notable that recently, however, Halliday (1980:66- 70) has presented an altogether more flexible concept of grammar.. It is also notable that he has drawn attention to a factor shared by the interpersonal and textual functions --namely, the fact that they each have a speaker-oriented and hearer-oriented aspect. In these respects, Halliday seems to be moving closer to a conception of language in which the ideational component is grammatical in an orthodox sense..., as distinct from the interpersonal and textual components, which are more pragmatic in conception. (Leech 1983:56-58)

Again, I postpone the detailed discussion of this example until later when I actually look at its linguistic realisations.

A similar strategy is actually used some years later by Fairclough (1989, 1992). Fairclough is trying to win intellectual territory for his 'critical language study' and bashes all other approaches, in order to get the readers to align with him (see the discussion of this example in Ventola 1995).

(8) There are many existing approaches to the study of language, so why do we need CLS? [=critical language study] Because, while each of the approaches which I review below has something to contribute to CLS, they all have major limitations from a critical point of view... Linguistics The term linguistics is used ambiguously within the mainstream:

it sometimes refers to...   
Linguistics has won widespread...   
It has done so by developing...   
However, the achievements of linguistics have been bought at the price of a narrow conception of language study... Sociolinguistics Sociolinguistics has developed...   
Sociolinguistics has shown systematic correlations...   
It is thanks to sociolinguistics that..   
But sociolinguistics is heavily influenced by \*positivist' conceptions..

Pragmatics

Anglo-American pragmatics is closely associated with analytical philosophy...   
The main weakness of pragmatics from a critical view is its individualism...   
Pragmatics is also limited in having...

Ultimately, CLS is probably best understood not as just another approach to language study which complements those I have referred to by highlighting issues which they tend to ignore, but as an alternative orientation to language study which implies a different demarcation of language study into approaches or branches, different relationships between them, and different orientations within each of them. (Fairclough 1989:6-13; the bold letters and italics are mine)

Examples 7 and 8 are demonstrations of how to occupy intellectual territory, but the gained territory has to be kept as well, and this is what we shall focus upon next.

# 2.3.3 Battles for securing territory

For any school of linguistics to survive, it is highly essential that the school has some 'Nachwuchs' (younger followers), and the older members of the school have to try to make sure that the younger generation gets into social positions that enable the continuation of tradition and the spreading of the ideas of the school. We all know what this means. Our work is constantly subjected to evaluations. Previously I mentioned how Gilbert & Mulkay (1984) said that natural scientists frequently believe their discourse, especially their writing, to be free of subjective views. We may also believe that the evaluations of our work are totally objective, based merely on the subject matter and its scientific handling. This is at least what the evaluators themselves would like to believe. But their writing is not always so convincing. Let us consider the following case. An XXXXX university is seeking a new professor. It advertises the post in the manner presented in (9):

(9) XXXxX University hereby announces the vacancy of the following post: PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE at the Department of English The subject area covered by the chair has not been specified in further detail..

The impression given by the advertisement is that the applicants' area of specialisation does not play a role in filling the post. Yet, in the experts' statements, which in this case were public documents, it became clear that in fact the university was looking for someone who would continue a previously established tradition in the department. This is, for example, clear in the manner in which one of the experts, a sociolinguist and a variationist, wrote her statements about Applicants A and B, displayed in (10). (It is not difficult to guess which of the candidates got the nomination for the job).

(10) The studies which make up the thesis...[the Ph.D. thesis of the Applicant A] have been carried out from a modern variationist perspective using a corpus of texts totalling nearly a million words... [The applicant A] is also the candidate who is most likely and able to continue the English Department's reputation for diacronic work of an international standard. [The Applicant B]'s interests lie mainly in the field of modern English language, applied linguistics, in particular, discourse analysis within a systemic linguistic framework.. The systemic linguistic framework is also not widely practised outside Australia and Britain (and even in those countries it is confined largely to a few institutions), which limits somewhat the impact of [the Applicant B]'s work... [the Applicant B]'s research is not as central to the field of English as the Applicant A's...

Note that both of the applicants are not described as individuals, just representing themselves, but rather their work is being evaluated from the point of view of a membership in a linguistic social group. For the Applicant A, the group membership (variationist, diacronist) is seen as a positive factor, for the Applicant B (applied linguist, discourse analyst, systemicist) it is seen as a negative factor. Note also that the advertisement did not specify the subject area of the candidates for the job. Yet, the expert saw it necessary that the post be filled with someone who secures the territory for variationist and diacronic studies.

This example is an illustration of how we all as individuals can at some stage in our professional lives be pulled into this Alignment-Bashing game --when we try to get jobs, when we try to get our writings published in journals or find publishers for our books. We are set in confrontative positions whether we want it or not, because that serves such purposes as e.g. securing the 'Nachwuchs'. No one asks us, the individuals, if we want to be treated like this.

I have used a lot of space in order to establish two ideological strategies, Alignment and Bashing, and to show that they are frequently employed in linguists' academic discourse. These strategies are used to show with whom we cooperate, at least to some degree, and with whom we see ourselves in disagreement and even at war -with whom we establish Consensus and with whom we find ourselves in Confrontation. I have also tried to demonstrate how the strategies ofAlignment and Bashing when set in juxtaposition are part of our daily struggle for power, a fight for intellectual space and dominance. If I have so far been (or at least pretended to be) a sociologist interested in social groups and their ideologies, I now want to become primarily a linguist and want to examine how we linguists can analyse this kind of language use, how our tools of the trade can display the construction of these kinds of ideological realisations in texts. Analytical work of this kind is important if we strive for cooperation rather than confrontation. If we want to learn to avoid destructive uses of language, we have to understand how these strategies make meaning in our discourse. These kinds of meanings belong to the interpersonal function of language. In the next section, I shall demonstrate how a systemic-functional analysis displays explicitly the strategies used for alignment and bashing.

# 3. Exemplifying systemic-fuctional analysis: capturing the Bashing strategies

The basic premise of the systemic-functional theory is that the genre, the social activity type we are involved in, and the context, i.e. the register in terms of the variables Field, Mode and Tenor, largely determine the kinds of structures that will be realized in the texts. These factors set us on a track of making certain kinds of choices from all the possible choices available for us from the whole potential of the language. A certain economical principle is perceived as functioning here. We do not have to operate constantly with the whole of language, its whole ideational, textual, and interpersonal potential of it, but rather with some sections of this potential--the sections that are relevant to that particular context where the discourse is being created. The situationally motivated parts of the metafunction are then realized by certain of choices of grammar, lexis and phonology/orthography. By using two examples presented earlier, Examples 5 and 7, I want to demonstrate what kind of alignment-bashing meanings can be filtered out from the examples with the help of systemic-functional analysis.

Let us first consider Example 5, here reproduced for the sake of convenience. Here Chomsky 'gets bashed' by Robinson. I have highlighted and numbered the points to be discussed in detail.

(5) By using the word we see putting the kettle on as expecting somebody to tea. So too one might expect somebody trembling, changing one's shirt and so on. (1) Chomsky misses the point when he says 'alongside of expecting B to come to tea, I may also be expecting innumerable other things' (e.g. that B will be less than twelve feet tall, that he will greet me warmly, that if admitted to Harvard he will accept, etc.)' (p. 278). These, are, (2) indeed, other things. All that needs to be said about the last is that (3) it is another expectation not relevant to the discussion. The expectation that he will greet me warmly (4a) is perhaps part of or closely related to the expectation that he will come to tea, and (4b) could be expressed by a similar range of thoughts or activities. It is Chomsky's first example that (5) is interestingly confused, the expectation that B will be less than twelve feet tall.

... [A paragraph left out, concerning Austin's view to the matter]

(6) Chomsky will not have this sort of discussion of a word's meaning, whether it makes any sense or not, because for Chomsky, as we have seen, meaning, independent of use, is a word's intrinsic conceptual structure that remains fixed whatever is done with the word.

Above all, (7) Chomsky simply can't understand Wittgenstein's objections to the idea of 'science' which is the only notion of discipline Chomsky can entertain: (8) he can't even see that they are objections. (Robinson 1975:152)

When in (1) Robinson writes Chomsky misses the point, he uses the process metaphorically. The implied meaning is naturally a mental: thinking - process: Chomsky does not understand Wittgenstein's point. Note that Robinson's view of Chomsky is in no way modalized. Robinson is certain of Chomsky missing the point; he does not, for example, modalize his message as Chomsky perhaps misses the point... or Chomsky may have missed the point. Robinson's certainty naturally convinces the reader of Chomsky's incapacity to understand the point. In (2), Robinson echoes Chomsky's own wording other things, but through the use of an intensifying modal adjunct indeed Robinson highlights his differing interpretation, implying that Chomsky's examples are not at all fitting the context in question. These are, indeed, other things'shows that the arguments Chomsky brings forth in the quoted clause are obviously out of the place here. The last of Chomsky's examples is, in Robinson's view, utterly out of place and not relevant to the discussion, as shown in (3). Again, we have no modalization here. Negative polarity choice, is not, indicates Robinson's unshaken view that Chomsky's last example is utterly useless for the discussion. The second last of Chomsky's example is the one that Robinson seems to concede to Chomsky's views to a certain degree. The concession to Chomsky is rendered in terms of modalization: in (4a) the possibility that Chomsky's example may be suitable is coded by a modal adjunct perhaps and in (4b) in the selection of 'low' modalization form of could. Robinson's sharpest critique is directed towards Chomsky's first example: It is Chomsky's first example that is interestingly confused... Chomsky's example is nominalized as a Verbiage. The cleft pattern (it is..) gives the informational emphasis to the whole of Robinson's view of Chomsky's Verbiage, and of course his view is marked by the choice of negative lexis, i.e. 'what Chomsky says is confusing'. The use of an attitudinal adjunct, interestingly, gives the message a sarcastic aftertaste.

Later, Robinson contrasts the kind of discussion Chomsky is willing to carry out to the one Austin has conducted on the same example by Wittgenstein. A very disfavourable view of Chomsky is presented to the readers. In the wording Chomsky will not have this sort of discussion, we have a metaphorical coding of a verbal process: discuss has been nominalized into have a discussion. It is, however, the choice of {modulation: inclination: median} in (6), will not have, that renders Chomsky as a non-cooperative person who is not keen on discussing issues of interest. In (7) Robinson continues to interpret Chomsky's abilities of carrying out mental processes. Through the choice of can't understand, {modulation: inclination: low}, Robinson suggests that Chomsky is not willing to understand. The adjunct of mood, simply, intensifies the reader' impressions of Chomsky's capabilities of understanding the issue. Further enforcement about Chomsky's limited mental capabilities for comprehension is given in (8), through the choices of {modulation: inclination: low}, he can't see, and the intensifying modal adjunct, even.

The bashing in Example (5) is started by showing that what Chomsky says --the Quoted-- is mostly out of place: his first example is totally confusing, the second can barely be considered within the bounds of the argument at hand, and the last is totally irrelevant to the discussion. The fact that Chomsky speaks/writes in a confused manner has to do with his mental capacities --he has missed the point-- he can't understand. Chomsky is reduced to the mental state of an obstinate child that simply puts his foot down and 'will not eat his vitamin pill' --will not have this sort of discussion. Chomsky is full of tantrums.

As can be seen, the systemic-functional analysis can highlight the bashing techniques, by pointing out the kinds of choices that are made from the interpersonal component of the grammar and the lexis.

Let us now see how the systemic-functional analysis copes with Example (7), Leech's text on Halliday. The nature of Leech's bashing is somewhat different in nature; at first it seems milder. It does not seem as direct and personal as Robinson's treatment of Chomsky. Leech is one of those amazing linguists who actually has been able to divert his fairly harsh earlier position against contextual analyses towards a more sympathetic view towards Firth and Halliday. In 1974 in his Semantics, he still criticised " 'contextualists' very severely by saying that 'contextualism'... has shown itself to be a relative failure"' (Leech 1974:71). In 1981, in the second edition of Semantics, the clause had been changed into: "contextualism'... has a superficial attractiveness for anyone who aspires to the ideal of scientific objectivity" (Leech 1981:61). In 1983, his writing is relatively cooperative:

We should not overlook independent thinkers such as Firth, with his early emphasis on the situational study of meaning, and Halliday, with his comprehensive social theory of language. (Leech 1983:2)

My analysis will shortly, however, show that he is not at all convinced by all the facts Halliday presents. Example (7) is reproduced below for the sake of convenience. (The points for the discussion are again marked by numbers and bold letters.)

(7) From Popper's four language functions, I move on to those of Halliday, to which they bear a strong resemblance. However, (1) whereas Halliday treats all his functions as being intrinsic to grammar, (2) I interpret them differently: P 7: GRAMMAR IS IDEATIONAL; PRAGMATICS IS INTERPERSONAL AND TEXTUAL The ideational function is an amalgam of two subfunctions which (3) Halliday calls 'experiential' and 'logical', and which correspond to Popper's descriptive and argumentative functions. The interpersonal function corresponds to Popper's expressive and signalling functions, which are based on similar functions...distinguished by Karl Buhler (1934). (4) Halliday has explained that he finds it unnecessary to maintain this distinction which Buhler, Popper, and also Jakobson (1960) have drawn between functions oriented towards the speaker's and hearer's ends of the communicative process: (5) he sees the expressive and signalling function are being merged in a single interpersonal function. For the purposes of pragmatics, (6) I agree with him.. The third function of Halliday, the textual function, is of a very different status from the others. (7) Halliday gives it the special status of an 'enabling function', and (8) says that it is instrumental to the other two...(9) I shall argue that although the textual organization of language plays an important part in an overall functional account of language, (10a) it is misleading to call the textual function a function' at all: (10b) there is something back-to-front about saying that language has the function of producing instantiations of itself. It is not language that has the function of transmitting itself through texts, but texts that have the function of transmitting language.

(11) My main disagreement with Halliday, however, is over (12) his wish to integrate all three functions within the grammar. (13) I maintain, in contrast, that the ideational function belongs to grammar.., and that the interpersonal function and the textual  function' belong to pragmatics... Although (14) Halliday insists that the three functions are of equivalent status, (15) he does drop one or two hints as to the special importance of the ideational function. (16) While he deprecates, for example, the popular view that language is vehicle of ideas, (17) he concedes that 'ideational function... is a major component of meaning in the language system which is basic to more or less all uses of language' (1973:38-9). (18) My own opinion, in contrast to this, is that the popular view of language is essentially correct: that it is the ideational language... which makes human language what it is: an extraordinarily powerful instrument of thought and communication... (Leech 1983:56-58)

We get to know from the beginning of the section in (1) and (2) that Leech's views differ from Halliday's: whereas Halliday treats all his functions as... I interpret them differently. Here contrasting conjunction and contrasting adjunct make the adversative positions of the two scholars clear. When we read on, it at first seems that Halliday is a person with whom one can carry on an intellectual argument. Halliday is presented as an observant, perceptive, thinking person: he sees (a mental process in (5)) the expressive and signalling function are being merged in a single interpersonal function. Halliday categorises what he observes in an orderly manner: he treats (a material process in (1)) all his functions as being intrinsic to grammar...; he gives (a material process in (7)) it (the textual function) the special status of an 'enabling function'. Halliday also labels things and explains his perceptions and categorizations verbally to others: The ideational function is an amalgam of two subfunctions which Halliday calls (a verbal process in (3)) 'experimental' and logical; Halliday has explained (a verbal process in (4)) that he finds it unnecessary to maintain this distinction...; (he) says... (a verbal process in (8)) that it is instrumental to the order of the other two.

Yet, in spite of these characteristics of Halliday, Leech can only agree with Halliday on one point --the expressive and signalling functions being merged into an interpersonal function: For the purposes of pragmatics, I agree with him... (6). Little by little, Leech brings out his own disagreements forth and presents counterarguments to Halliday's views and different categorizations: in (1&2) whereas Halliday... I interpret them [the functions] differently...; in (9) I shall argue that..., in (11) My main disagreement with Halliday, however, is..; in (13) I maintain, in contrast..., in (18) My own opinion, in contrast to this, is that...

Leech's thinking is expressed either in mental processes, or verbal processes, or as Verbiage (disagreement, opinion). The contrast to Halliday is achieved in the major part through contrasting conjunctions, whereas, however, in contrast, in contrast to this, and also through lexis: different, disagreement.

Leech states his disagreement at the beginning in a relatively neutral manner. As the statements about his disagreements with Halliday increase, so do also the bashing expressions he uses. Although Leech's bashing of Halliday is not as overt as Robinson's of Chomsky, the means are basically the same. Firstly, Halliday's thinking is in Leech's view also illogical. Leech finds Halliday's explanations (i.e., Reports and Verbiage) misleading and back-to-front: in (10a) it is misleading to call the textual function a function' at all; in (10b) there is something back-to-front about saying that... Secondly, Halliday's Reports and Verbiage are in Leech's opinion basically like a child's: Halliday insists on certain views, rather than argues for them (cf. the 'I want to' function of language; Halliday 1975). Halliday seems to insist persistently on his views without fully giving grounds to his reasons. His actions of categorization are irrational, based merely on wishes: in (12) his wish to integrate all three functions within the grammar; in (14) Halliday insists that the three functions are of equivalent status... Finally, even Halliday's explanations are downgraded to the level of mere insufficient 'hints': in (15) he does drop one or two hints.

In Leech's text, Halliday is partly represented as an intelligent person who gives explanations to his thinking and actions, but ultimately one cannot agree with him because his thinking, actions and explanations are 'misleading, backto-front, mere hints and wishes'. He is capable of criticizing other people's views, but only grudgingly agrees with them on other points: in (16 & 17) While he deprecates..., he concedes...

So as the text progresses, we get a fairly negative view of the person Halliday', just as we got a fairly negative view of 'Chomsky'. Who would like to align themselves with the thinking of these men? Both persons are not according to these characterizations the kind of people by whom one really wants to be influenced. They represent competition; they are important rivals from another beehive.

It is interesting to note, how the two writers, Robinson and Leech, actually differ in ending the sections from which the example extracts are taken. Robinson sustains the 'bashing strategy' right to the end:

Chomsky's insistence on extra-linguistic 'explanation'is, moreover, the effective influence of linguistics on other studies; it bedevils not merely linguistics itself but also the attempts to bring linguistics to bear upon psychology, sociology and other subjects to which 'science of language' if there were one, would have obvious relevance. (Robinson 1975:155)

Leech, in fact, makes a 'magic trick'. As his text progresses, he makes his approach more appealing to the reader, by showing the inconsistencies etc. in Halliday's way of thinking. At the end of the section, he writes as if Halliday himself were convinced of Leech's arguments, and also Halliday, not just the reader, wants to align himself with Leech. Halliday has now adopted Leech's orthodox view of the grammar.

I have criticized Halliday elsewhere (Leech 1980:22-5) for what I regard as a tendency to 'overgrammaticalization': .. It is notable that recently, however, Halliday (1980:66-70) has presented an altogether more flexible concept of grammar... It is also notable that he has drawn attention to a factor shared by the interpersonal and textual functions -namely, the fact that they each have a speaker-oriented and hearer-oriented aspect. In these respects, Halliday seems to be moving closer to a conception of language in which the ideational component is grammatical in an orthodox sense.., as distinct from the interpersonal and textual components, which are more pragmatic in conception. (Leech 1983:58)

# 4. Conclusion

This paper has established the following sociological point': the language of Alignment and Bashing is used to make the sociological group boundaries clear. There are linguists with whom we want to align and with whom we feel we can establish the state of Consensus. And there are other linguists whose thinking we find different from our own thinking, and therefore, we are likely to find ourselves in Confrontation with them. The paper has also demonstrated the following 'linguistic' point: language of ideology can be used in a very personalised way, especially in the strategies of 'bashing of an individual', and we certainly need linguistic tools that bring forth awareness of these kinds of destructive strategies and how they are linguistically realized. The kind of bashing that has been demonstrated in this paper has, in my view, nothing to do with the issues themselves and certainly does not enhance cooperation and understanding within linguistics and among linguists.

The topic of this paper is a somewhat depressing one --Alignment and Bashing. It rose out of my interest in ideological discourse. Once you start to explore ideology, you see it everywhere, and where I saw a considerable amount of it, was in our own discourse, the discourse of linguists. Yet, we linguists hardly ever study our own discourse from an ideological point of view, although we eagerly expose ideologies in advertisements, in newspaper articles, and so on. When faced with our own ideologies, we should individually ask whether we want to take part in the realization processes of Bashing strategies or not.

I started this paper by pretending to be a sociologist. Those sociologists who are tuned into the functionings of social groups are aware that we all make these interpersonal meanings in our discourse, depending on who we are, to what beehives we belong. The sociologists try to make us more conscious of how the society works, and they try to indicate that it is up to us to choose the ways we realise our memberships in groups and whether we establish Consensus or Confrontation relations with one another.

But our task as linguists is to show sociologists and the laypersons how we build bridges or destroy them with language. We, as socially responsible linguists, must try to develop our descriptions of this area of Consensus or Confrontation, so that we can better train, for example, our students to avoid such Bashing strategies in which we have discovered ourselves to be trapped. I believe that Consensus rather than Confrontation will help us to build a better world of linguistics as well.

# THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHOICE DISCURSIVE POSITIONING IN AN ART INSTITUTION

LOUISE J. RAVELLI\* The University of New South Wales, Australia

# Abstract

In this paper, we examine the written texts used in a public art institution, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (the MCA). These are public texts, aimed at visitors, and the MCA has a wide range of choices available as to how these texts are constructed. The work arose in the context of a consultancy, whereby the institution itself requested advice on potential changes to their texts in order to better suit its public.

It will be demonstrated in this paper that the choices available are not simply questions of variation in wording, but of variation in meaning at multiple levels. The linguistic choices made often carry or encode the nature of the MCA as an institution; they both reflect and constitute its identity. This identity is not, however, monolithic; it is multi-faceted, and often the selection of one linguistic choice rather than another, equates with the foregrounding of one facet of this identity, rather than another. The various linguistic possibilities entail certain tensions in terms of the meanings being made, reflecting similar tensions between the multiple identities of this institution.

# 1. Introduction: the MCA as an institution

The origins of the MCA lie in a generous personal bequest by Sir John Wardell Power in 1943. Power was an expatriate surgeon, artist and collector, and his bequest, housed at the University of Sydney, was curated and expanded by University academics. It was available to view through the Power Gallery, a

University gallery, so while it was in some respects public, its location on a University campus meant that it remained a more academic institution. The collection was moved to a new, public site in 1991. This new site is located at Circular Quay, the tourist epicentre of Sydney, within view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, in a magnificently restored former government building. The move was facilitated by joint funding from the State Government, but the MCA is now largely self-funding. Its charter includes the following statement:

The charter of the MCA is to bring to Australian audiences the latest ideas and theories in the visual arts from many cultures around the world (including our own), as they are represented in artworks ranging from the traditional forms of painting and sculpture to design, performance and the moving image. Through its varied educational activities, the MCA seeks to make contemporary art engaging to a broad spectrum of public audiences... The MCA will explore new, and at times difficult, issues in the contemporary visual arts. It will maintain space for innovation and experimentation and focus on the art of the present and recent past. (MCA 1996)

The MCA is thus, on the one hand, a public institution in a prime tourist site, aiming to engage a 'broad spectrum of public audiences', and on the other hand, it is a highly prestigious institution, dealing with specialised material, and having an academic history. This is too crude a summary of the various discursive facets of the MCA, but will be used as a starting point for examining the consequences of linguistic variation in the MCA texts.

Advice was requested by the MCA on exploring the potential of their public texts, that is, those texts that visitors read, with a particular view to increasing their effectiveness. Existing texts from current and recent exhibitions were examined and evaluated for any potential linguistic problems, and then suggestions were brought to a staff-training workshop, attended by curatorial, educational, and visitor-service staff. The intention of the workshop was to raise awareness of the linguistic possibilities in the texts, to provide a forum to evaluate these possibilities, and to provide control of the relevant linguistic choices. This followed similar work undertaken at the Australian Museum, Sydney, wherein a strong educational agenda of providing text accessibility was foregrounded (Ravelli 1996; Ferguson et al. 1995). However, as will be explained in this paper, steps towards accessibility raise other questions for the MCA, and cannot be adopted without regard to their discursive consequences.

# 2. Typical texts in the MCA

Visitors to the MCA encounter written text in a variety of physical forms. The two most significant forms for the purposes of this paper are brochures, handed out or made available to the visitor on entry to an exhibition, and 'wall' texts, that is, extended labels of one to several paragraphs in length, found either at the entry to an exhibition, or accompanying an individual art work. Sometimes the visitor will encounter both brochure and wall text for the one exhibition, and the information therein may or may not be overlapping. At other times, only one form will be available. Both the brochures and wall texts serve the purpose of 'speaking' to the public, being important interpretative tools for the exhibition. These are the texts which provide a guide to and explanation of the exhibition for the visitor.

Several other written text types are also available, but will not be considered in detail in this paper. These include the minimal labels accompanying each art work, identifying the artist, title, date, and medium of the work, and extensive catalogues, providing more depth and background to the exhibition, usually available for sale in the shop. In addition, there are often handouts, called 'Adventure Trails', aimed at young visitors, which provide activities related to various works in an exhibition.

Interpretation of exhibitions also occurs via the spoken mode, in the form of guided tours, specialist talks by artists or curators, other specialist events, and videos. There is not space in this paper to consider the spoken texts, although it should be noted that there are strong contrasts in terms of what can be said in the two modes (see Ravelli, in prep). While it is perhaps somewhat unfair to evaluate an institution in discursive terms on the basis of only one form of its offerings, the written texts are typically the primary source of interpretation for visitors (only small groups elect to follow a guided tour, for example) and it is the mode in which professional expertise is invested (guided tours are usually led by non-professionals).

Thus, written texts are produced in a variety of physical forms. The nature of the language used within these forms exhibits considerable potential variation, as manifested in the examples below. These examples, all actually occurring within one exhibition, are deliberately sequenced to show a continuum of complexity/ abstraction, from the least complex, most concrete, to the most complex, least concrete.'

# LOW

The totems on Level 2 represent the people Bourgeois knows and how she feels about them. She uses simplified forms to express the strong feelings she has for her friends, family and acquaintances.

# MEDIUM

The abstract shapes of the sculptures recreate and represent Louise Bourgeois' relationships with others, both friends and family

HIGH

The earliest series of personages articulate Bourgeois's intense feeling of loss and isolation from the family and friends who remained in Paris after her departure, and with whom she had lost contact during the intervening war years.

The first example would typically be found in the children's Adventure Trail, the second and third examples would be found either in the brochure, as a wall text, or in the catalogue. Clearly, then, the MCA controls a range of writing choices, however, by far the most common choices fall into the medium-high range of complexity/abstraction. It is here that potential problems arise in the MCA texts.

# 3. Typical problems in the MCA texts

Within the MCA texts, three particular sets of linguistic choices were judged as being potentially problematic, in that they seemed most likely to interfere with the accessibility of the text. These judgements were made by the author of this paper, following discussions with MCA staff about their texts, and following related work at the Australian Museum. The judgements were strongly informed by recent work in Australia on writing in schools (Martin 1993b; Martin and Rothery 1980; Rothery 1989). The perceived problems pertained to issues of the register variables of Mode and Field (Halliday 1978; 1985), as will be explained further below. These problems will be explained and exemplified, and it will be seen that, in many respects, they are relatively simple to correct. However, it will also be seen that these 'simple' changes in linguistic style have discursively significant consequences.

# 3.1 Mode issues: density and thematic signalling

Mode refers to the role language plays in communication, whether it forms part of a social process or reflects upon it (Martin 1984; 1993a). The former equates crudely with very 'spoken' language, the latter with 'written' language, there being a continuum of possibilities between these endpoints. Importantly, it is the nature of the language which is in question, rather than the medium as such. Thus texts which are presented in written form, that is, printed or written on a page, can vary in terms of their Mode.

In the MCA, there is a strong tendency towards texts which appear at the very 'written' end of the Mode continuum; they exhibit all the features of highly written language, including extreme lexical density, complex nominal groups, a high degree of nominalisation, and specialised lexis (see Halliday 1985; Ravelli 1988). These features are exemplified below:

Key:2 complex nominal groups underlined nominalisations in bold specialised lexis in italics

The sensual morphology of this leonine figure's breast and penis forms collapses mundane separations between organic states and genders.

Mapplethorpe renders in modernist photographic form a classical approach to the depiction of beauty, favouring highly controlled and symmetrical composition.

In Huan Chin-ho's enormous painting Fire, grotesque, inflated figures are contrasted with an exuberant natural world, in a sharp look at irruptions of contemporary consumerism into people's lives and fantasies.

The rich complexities of the social and cultural references the artists draw upon, and the newly-found independence of their visions, have fostered a lively spirit of investigation in contemporary Taiwanese art.

The density of these examples makes them potentially difficult to process, and, for a general public, it might be more appropriate to re-express these texts in a more spoken style. It is feasible to teach writers how to move towards a more spoken style, by identifying and then unpacking complex nominal groups, complex nominalisations, and so on. As demonstrated in the opening examples, writers in the MCA already control a range of writing options, so a consistent push towards a more spoken style is not technically problematic.

As well as extreme density, a further problem related to Mode concerns textual organisation, both of individual texts and exhibitions as a whole. As the written Mode is partially defined by its reflection upon, rather than attachment to, a social process, clear textual signalling is needed in order for the reader to make sense of, and follow, the text. Consider the following example, which appeared as a wall label:

Dimension: Image

Video taped interviews and compilations: length $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$

Animated images reveal how we view the real world and how we categorise images.

Katsuhiro Otomo --director of Akira- introduces the visitor to these ideas. He clearly explains the technicalities of writing, designing and filming an animation.

A film compilation showing how cartoons have been treated culturally and socially. Real actors interact with a cartoon character, or actors watch cartoons on TV. In these cinematic moments the fundamental differences between a photographic reality and the imaginary world of cartoons becomes clear.

A compilation of advertisements using animation demonstrates how pervasive and persuasive a cartoon character can be in selling products for use in the real world.

Each video section is approximately 15 minutes.

This example provides commentaries on individual video segments, but this is not clearly signalled for the visitor. The second line ('Animated images...') seems to function as an overall commentary, but it does not function successfully to predict the organisation of the text, namely that there are three video segments. The simple specification of this would make the organisation of the text much more apparent. Martin (1993a), developing the work of Danes (1974), and Fries (1981), refers to this overall signalling of text development as macro --and hyper-- Themes (equating loosely with the more common terms of introductory paragraph and topic sentence in a paragraph). He argues that their inclusion is essential to the organisation of written text, and that they have to be "consciously constructed in writing, through a determined editing and planning process" (1993a:251). A knowledge of text structure, particularly thematic organisation at macro --and hyper-- Theme levels, will facilitate this planning and editing process, and contribute to improvements in the organisation of the MCA texts.'

A lack of signalling in a text, while problematic for the purposes of that text, does not on its own necessarily impact upon the whole exhibition. Imagine, however, an absence of appropriate signalling at the level of the whole exhibition, or indeed, at the level of the whole institution. The physical layout of the MCA almost demands the foregrounding of clear guidance and organisation. As a visitor, one literally steps 'in' to an exhibition. The galleries are entered through a large, square arch, and one steps in to a large, open, double-tiered space, with a broad staircase to the right, going up to the next level, and three medium-sized rooms beyond. There are rooms of various sizes and dimensions on the mezzanine and upper levels. At any one time there will be at least two ongoing exhibitions, and often three or four, depending on their size and scope. The first point of contact is, thus, both exhibition space and orientation point. A lack of clear signalling here can be very disorienting for visitors.

Yet it is frequently the case that whole exhibitions are left without macro Themes; there are always introductory panels or introductions in the brochures, but these may serve as art criticism, rather than as a guide to the exhibition. The visitor is not advised as to what to expect, or how they might proceed. Sometimes, when there is a prediction made at macro-Theme level, this is not reiterated at hyper-Theme level, so the overt signalling is only apparent, and does not function successfully. As elaborated below, one introductory panel seemed to suggest that different movements in contemporary art would be found in the exhibition. While such movements were represented, they were not signalled textually, again leaving the visitor to their own devices, in terms of identifying and recognising what was predicted in the introduction. Thus, visitors can be left with little guidance at a variety of levels: from what exhibitions are on in which section of the gallery, to the organisation within an exhibition, to the contents of a room, to the purpose of an individual text.

This is not to say that there is only one type of organisation appropriate for an exhibition, nor even that organisation per se is necessary: indeed, one exhibition (Kaboom! 1994) exploited a lack of (apparent) organisation in order to recreate the disorienting effects of contemporary animation. The brochure accompanying Kaboom! stated that:

... The Rooms on Level 1 are designed for fleeting, random and casual encounters: visitors are overwhelmed by sights and sounds, and experience the intensity and craziness of animation 'on-the-run'...

Thus, there are many different ways in which an exhibition may or may not be organised; the key is that this is signalled in some way for the visitor.' More recently, the brochure accompanying Photography is Dead! Long live photography! (1996) included this indication of the relation of the brochure to the exhibition: \*The following notes on each artist's work, ordered alphabetically, are intended not as an itinerary but an initial point of reference, available for visitors to chart their own course through the exhibition'. This suggests clearly that there is no intended pathway for the visitor to follow, that they should make their own choices, and that the.brochure serves as a reference point for the exhibition, but not as a determiner of the visitor's experience. Without over determining the exhibition for the visitor, this kind of signalling serves the purpose of structuring the exhibition so that the visitor can maximise their enjoyment and appreciation of the artworks.

# 3.2 Field issues: technical 'obfuscation'

In the specialist field of art criticism, there will understandably be many technical terms used. For an institution open to the general public, this technicality needs to be made accessible. Technicality is signalled in a variety of ways in the MCA texts, but a lack of clear signalling leads to an 'obfuscation' of the field for the visitor. Sometimes, technical terms are explicitly defined, as exemplified below:

What is a 'multiple'? Broadly speaking, a multiple may be defined as any two -or threedimensional object which has been produced in a limited or unlimited edition.

At other times, however, specialist terms are used without explanation or definition, making it difficult for uninitiated visitors to gain access to the technicality. Consider the following example:

A further sound element operates as a virtual musique concrete composition, suggested in the reader's (viewer's) mind as the texts are being read.

Here, the French term, 'musique concrete' (written without an accent on the 'e'), is not signalled as a specialist or foreign term (for example, by being italicised); it is certainly not defined.

At other times, technicality appears to be signalled, but is not necessarily followed through. The following example was part of an introductory panel to an exhibition:

Virtually every major movement in international contemporary art of the past thirty years is represented in John Kaldor's collection, including Pop Art, Conceptual Art, Minimal Art and Postmodernism.

Here, major movements in contemporary art are named, but the exhibition itself did not explicitly identify examples from each movement. Again, therefore, visitors are left to fill this information in for themselves. While it would not be possible, nor even desirable, to constantly define every art term that is used in public texts, attention needs to be paid to those terms that are used in such a way that denies access to the uninitiated visitor.

Aside from actual definitions, it is interesting that there are particular grammatical constructions which seem to characterise the technicality of art discourse. While the following is a tentative outline of one manifestation of technicality in this domain, it is interesting for what it reveals about the nature of art criticism as a discipline (see also Pittman 1995; and Rothery 1996). In the MCA texts, there is a frequently recurring pattern which seems to be a key to the transmission of the technical/professional interpretation of the exhibition. In broad terms, the 'how', or technical detail of the work, is linked to the 'what/why', or interpretation, of the work. For example:

the wafer-thin, delicate, ceramic clouds   
  
convey   
-)   
a sense of balance, beauty and dynamism

Here, the 'wafer-thin, delicate, ceramic clouds' are the 'how' of the work: the actual technical component of the work being highlighted for the visitor. The 'sense of balance, beauty and dynamism' is the 'what/why' of the work, the effect produced by the 'clouds'. In terms of transitivity (Halliday 1994), the construction in question centers upon a relational process (convey), that is, a process which connects the two parts of the 'equation' to each other. In this case, it is not simply that the two parts are linked with each other, but that there is a sense of causality in this connection, namely that the first part 'causes' this connection with the second part. Halliday refers to this type of process as a circumstantial: identifying type (1994:132). The first part is consistently a technical aspect or component of the work (e.g., the clouds), an actual physical detail of the work. Its function in this equation is to be the Token, the outward form of the sign, somewhat like a label or a name. The second part is typically an interpretation of the content, impact, effect of the work (e.g., a sense of.. dynamism), carried or realized by an abstract nominalisation. Its function is to be the Value, or the meaning/content of the sign. This part of the equation may include appraisal, that is, elements of appreciation, as found in the example above (see Martin: 1996). The very choice of vocabulary connotes a sense of an evaluation having been made as to the quality of the work (more literally, that it is balanced, beautiful and dynamic). Appraisal is not, however, a necessary feature of this part of the \*equation'; consider the following example:

The abstract shapes recreate and represent Louise Bourgeois'relationships with others, both friends and family.

Here, the Value is 'Louise Bourgeois' relationships with others...'. The absence of appraisal suggests that this is the 'content' of the artwork; the example is saying what can be seen in the artwork. Thus, this version typically functions to describe what can be seen in the artwork, what it represents.

This linking of the how' to the 'what/why' creates a particular rhythm or equation, and is found repeatedly in the MCA texts. This rhythm can also be seen at clause complex level, in the following example, where the first clause acts as Token, and the second, non-finite clause acts as Value. The process, 'suggesting' (an intensive relational Process), links the two clauses:

these multiple viewpoints disrupt a unified perspective of the mother's body suggesting a subjective rather than purely documentary approach.

The prevalence of this pattern in the MCA texts suggests that it might be an important component of art discourse more generally, but further work would be needed to establish this. Nevertheless, it is clear from the MCA texts that inconsistent use of the pattern can lead to some odd and amusing results. Sometimes, it seems that the 'technical' side of the equation is used, without reference to interpretation. The following appeared in the last paragraph of a larger panel, and is the total of 'interpretation' provided:

... The installation consisted of 75 opened and arranged wool bales, and two truck loads of wrapped wool bales.

A not uncommon response to this might be, 'so?' Without interpretation, there seems little point in this technical detail: what purpose do the wool bales serve? While this is not the place to engage with negative responses to contemporary art, the absence of any interpretation here leaves open the possibility of questioning the artistic value of the piece. This suggests that the very role of the interpretative side of the equation is to fulfil the function of providing artistic justification.

It is also the case that the \*interpretation' can appear without technical access being provided. Thus, the interpretation appears to come from 'thin air', either leading to confusion, or inviting trusting agreement.

Yang Ming-huy is another practicing feminist who challenges existing images of women in Taiwan society. Her work asserts that women can and should take control of their own symbolic representations.

This example explains 'what/why', but not 'how'. How are existing images challenged? How does her work assert what it does? Without explicit specification of the means by which these effects are created, the visitor can only agree trustingly, or be bemused.

Occasionally, both the technical side and the interpretation appear to be present, but the relationship between them is unclear:

.. in Lin Horng-wen's non-figurative works, emptiness and spiritual quietude work through a dialogue with the materials themselves.

This example contains elements of technicality ('dialogue with materials'), and elements of interpretation ('emptiness, spiritual quietude'), but what is the relationship between them? Somehow the 'dialogue with the materials' has resulted in a particular effect, but what is this 'dialogue' and how did the effect arise? The relational process, 'work through', is somewhat vague as to causal connections between the two Participants. It may even be the case that the Process is just 'work' (as in something akin to 'signify'), but this analysis leaves the role of the remaining clause elements equally unclear.

Thus, when parts of this 'equation' are missing, or the relationship between the parts is confused, then potential problems arise for visitors, in terms of their ability to access the interpretations and evaluations being provided by this kind of 'equation'. There is nothing problematic about this construction in its own terms; indeed, it seems to be important for the carriage of technicality in art discourse, but again, it needs to be used with care. The construction certainly merits further consideration as an interesting component of art discourse.

In terms of Field issues as a whole, many problems will be obviated by sensitivity to clear definitions and by explanations which are followed through. As was the case with Mode, problems are usually easily identified and rectified. However, as we shall see, apparently 'simple' linguistic changes have other consequences, and may not, indeed, be so 'easy' to adopt.

# 4. Accessibility as a source of tension: the consequences of change

An illustration of the way in which problems of density, organisation, and technicality can be overcome will quickly reveal the consequences of changing these linguistic patterns.

In order to address problems of extreme density in the texts, it is possible to use knowledge of nominal group structure and nominalisation to achieve a less dense style. For example, the following nominal group, containing the nominalisation:'preoccupations', could be expressed in a more spoken style:

more 'written': Bourgeois' continuing preoccupations.. more 'spoken': Bourgeois continued to be preoccupied (by..)

The first example is one nominal group, acting as Participant in a larger clause; the second example is itself a clause. Clearly, one consequence of this 'unpacking' process is that human agency is immediately foregrounded. While the name of the artist is present in the first example, as possessive Deictic, the agency in that clause actually pertains to the 'preoccupations', rather than the artist herself.

The consequences of consistent unpacking can be illustrated with a larger example. Take the following clause:

The earliest series of personages articulate Bourgeois's intense feeling of loss and isolation from the family and friends who remained in Paris after her departure.

If this were to be unpacked to a much more spoken form, it might look like the following. Note that this is not intended in any way to suggest that this is the form in which the MCA should produce text; it is included here as an example of a contrasting position:

Bourgeois left Paris   
but her family and friends stayed behind and after this   
she felt very isolated   
and she really missed those people   
and she made a series of personages   
to show how she felt.

Clearly, as well as having shifted the Mode, the Field has changed, too; the technicality of the original being lost in the second. Bourgeois as a person, rather than her work, is consistently foregrounded. Again, it should be emphasised that there is no suggestion for the MCA to imitate this particular style; however, any move away from the extremely dense examples will raise this problem to some degree.

Foregrounding the agency of the artist is highly problematic in the world of art discourse. It suggests the artistic equivalent of 'authorial intention', namely that the artist set out to deliberately create the effects or results which the curator is describing. Particularly in the context of contemporary art, where the artist may well be alive and, indeed, even working with the curator on the exhibition, this can be highly insulting. It is an effect which art discourse works particularly hard to avoid; the first half of the technical 'equation' described above is typically a technical component of the artwork itself (for example, the ceramic clouds), and not a human agent. Thus, as moving towards a less nominalised style typically does foreground human agency, this will be a problematic step for the MCA to adopt.

An additional effect of unpacking very dense texts is that the whole style of the text shifts towards the more spoken end of the Mode continuum. In this institution, the text, while entirely secondary to the artworks, is itself prestigious. It is one manifestation of the curator's professional expertise, and is a source of pride (and of critical evaluation). These texts are thereby saddled with all our culture's prejudices about the relative values of written and spoken language, with the greater prestige traditionally being attached to the written.' Removing the nominalisations and complex nominal groups makes the texts less written and more concrete. This might be interpreted positively as 'accessible', but also negatively as 'banal' or 'ordinary'.

We thereby begin to see how this institution positions itself discursively, in a Foucauldian sense (eg Foucault 1972). The minor changes suggested to the lexicogrammar immediately reveal a curatorial sense of responsibility to the artist, and their valuation of their profession as a source of expertise and pride, a demonstration of language as artistry. Hence, changing the language threatens the visible professionalism of the curators, in their role as art experts, at least in the eyes of some sectors of their audience.

However, the request to examine the texts in the MCA and to develop appropriate writing workshops for staff presumably derived from a sense of responsibility to visitors, and a need to make their institution more generally accessible, one in which language would function not so much as an artistic form itself, but as an overtly educational tool. Clearly, these two discursive locations are not entirely compatible.

Similar discursive tensions are revealed when the second problematic area, that of thematic structuring, is considered. The problem of having insufficient guidance as to the overall exhibition can also, in principle, be simply addressed, by giving careful thought to the informational structuring of the exhibition and ensuring that this is clearly signalled by the texts. Again, however, this is problematic. Aesthetically, there is a fear that 'too much' text will physically detract from the artwork; occasionally even, that any text will detract from the artwork. Considerable design goes into the installation of every artwork, and every physical element within a room -from light, plinths or other supports, possible traffic flows around the artwork, to labels- is considered to be part of the installation. As White (1994) notes, all these features contribute to the exhibition as a communicative event. Curators have no desire to foreground text at the expense of the art itself.\*

In interpersonal terms, there is a fear that overt informational structuring of the exhibition will be patronising to the already-educated visitor. The main demographic group visiting the MCA is in fact the thirty-something professional on a high income (MCA 1994); they will either already be familiar with contemporary art or wish to create the impression that they are. Indeed, could be argued that the process of successfully interpreting otherwise difficult texts provides a kind of badge of belonging' for such groups.' The texts exhibit what Kress and van Leeuwen (1996:170) would call an 'abstract coding orientation'. "Coding orientations are sets of abstract principles which inform the way in which texts are coded by specific social groups, or within specific institutional contexts", and the abstract coding orientation "is a mark of social distinction, of being an 'educated person' or a 'serious artist' ". Similar effects are manifested by the third problematic area, that of insufficient Field contextualisation, because it avoids patronising already-educated visitors, and provides a possible 'badge of belonging' for those who already share the language.

Associated with this aversion to excessive guidance to the exhibition, is a fear or loathing of interpreting artwork 'for' the visitor. Curatorial staff emphasised the need to generate an experiential environment within the MCA, that is, one which encourages the experience of art, rather than one which spoon-feeds information about it. Their primary aim is to "structure the situation to enable the viewer to achieve maximum self-interpretation" 1o This would seem to be part of the very Field of art discourse, namely to problematise interpretation, and not over-determine interpretations for the visitor. It thus becomes a challenge to produce texts which achieve this aim, without also simply being obscure in their delivery of information.

In Foucauldian terms, these reactions again reveal something about the discursive location of the institution. Text holds a contradictory position, being both prestigious, yet having the ability to detract from the artwork. The presumed subjects of the institution are already art-educated, and do not need to have works interpreted for them. There is an underlying presumption that art should, indeed, 'speak for itself', even though this profound and strong presumption is contradicted by the actuality of professional texts -that is, that the texts do, indeed, interpret and judge. As noted above, when interpretation is missing from the texts, it leads to some very odd effects.

This discursive location, as prestigious, as speaking to the initiated, can be substantiated by looking beyond language to the broader framework of which the institution is a part: the MCA regularly hosts highly exclusive events for patrons, it has a prestigious function centre catered by Sydney's pre-eminent chef, a highly exclusive shop, and so on and so on. Equally, the tension of this position with its alternative location, as a prime tourist site, in a very public location, with educational responsibilities, is clear. These represent different, and not.entirely compatible, regularities or systems of dispersions (Foucault 1972; Part II, Chap. I) which govern the object, namely art and the language and other practices used around it. Equally, each position constructs potentially different subjects. The predominant discursive framework of the MCA constructs a subject who is sufficiently comfortable in a cultural institution to move through it with little guidance, and who is sufficiently knowledgeable about contemporary art history to need little explanation of it in relation to the works under exhibit. The alternative position suggests a subject for whom clear guidance and strong contextualisation is entirely appropriate.

The linguistic changes suggested here, if adopted, would generally push the MCA much more strongly towards being an accessible, truly public institution, with a considerably broadened definition of its educational responsibilities. However this is not necessarily its preferred role. Interestingly, the competing institutional possibilities of the MCA were neatly encapsulated by a staff member attending the workshop, who asked: are we aiming for texts which are most accessible, most informative, or most brilliant?'

To a linguist interested in the accessibility of text, the linguistic problems in the MCA are reasonably clear, and experiences from other institutions would suggest that they are relatively easily overcome. However, the changes suggested at the lexicogrammatical level immediately reveal and challenge the institution's discursive positioning. The suggested changes would support their more open, more public educational role, but this contradicts and stands in tension with their position as an elite, privileged site for the art-initiated. It would be highly unlikely to find such multiple identities arranged horizontally, in parallel. Rather, it is to be expected to find them arranged vertically, in a hierarchy, even if that hierarchy can be varied according to the moment. The work of Basil Bernstein (1996) is illuminating in terms of explaining the sociological factors which might influence the arrangement of that hierarchy. At this moment, it would seem that it is the elite aspect of the MCA's discursive formation which predominates, being much influenced by their historical origins as an academic institution. Yet, their interest in and openness to the linguistic work referred to here suggests that the space exists for the fracturing and reshaping of their identity in the future, or at least, for the repositioning of their multiple identities in relation to each other.

Clearly, there is no such thing as 'simple' variation in language. Even an apparently isolated linguistic phenomenon, such as changing nominal group structures, or foregrounding the organisation of a text, carries choice and meaning at a variety of levels, including that of the very nature and identity of an institution.

# LEXICAL AND GRAMMATICAL CHOICES IN INNOVATIVE LANGUAGE USE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

MERIEL BLOOR\* University of Warwick

# Abstract

This paper considers the nature of the scientific register of English and the ways in which it is changing as a result of developments in computer science. Starting from a discussion of Halliday's (1993) account of scientific writing in the twentieth century as fixed and inflexible, it introduces recent innovations in the language and discourse of computer science and demonstrates ways in which they are closer to features of spoken discourse than more traditional scientific writing. Taking examples from emerging genres in the field (computer manuals, email messages, etc.), it demonstrates how the English of computer science has a high degree of flexibility with informal, interpersonal characteristics and a tendency to use colloquialisms. The paper then considers the creation of new terminology and claims that there is a move away from the influence of Greek and Latin in scientific terminology. In conclusion, it is argued that, in spite of these apparently more flexible and idiomatic choices being introduced into the language of science, computer science texts are not, as a result, necessarily more accessible to uninitiated readers.

# 1. Introduction

Every text unfolds in some context of use; further more, it is the uses of language that, over tens of thousands of generations, have shaped the system.

Halliday 1985, page I.

This paper addresses the question of how language change extends language choice. It looks at how the context of situation influences the linguistic choices made by writers and speakers, and suggests that contextual change widens the choices available as the language is re-constructed to fit the changing context. The theory that situational factors are determinants of the text (Firth 1964; Halliday 1978:61) would lead us to predict that, during periods of social change, it would be possible to observe movement in linguistic expression as language users struggle to create new ideational meaning, negotiate new interpersonal relationships or organise original ideas in texts.

A special case of social change is the development of new academic or scientific fields. It is well-known that the considerable developments in science and technology in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries had a marked effect on language development in English and other European languages. More recent innovation, in the field of Computer Science for example, has received less attention although it is apparent that rapid theoretical and technological changes have forced linguistic innovation on three counts: the development of new communicative events (or genres), the development of new styles of rhetoric and the development of new terminology with its concomitant lexico-grammatical variation.

What I also propose here is that, in English at least, the linguistic innovation taking place in the final quarter of the twentieth century as a result of scientific change differs in a number of ways from the innovation of previous centuries. That is to say that the linguistic potential of the language is being exploited creatively in ways significantly different from earlier periods of scientific growth.

# 2. Linguistic innovation in science

What then are the features of the scientific and technical registers of English as established over the centuries? At one time we might have simply answered this question in terms of the frequency of specialist lexis (as, for example, in Potter 1969:86-100), but the answer has been made more complex by the research that has taken place over the past twenty-five years since the publication of Huddlestone 1971, which surveyed some of the early studies of structure, tense and voice in written sentences in scientific texts. This research has looked both at the nature of innovation and the development of new modes of discourse, such as the research article, and at the reasons for the innovations.

During periods of scientific and technological development, there are typically large increases in the scientific word-stock of English (McMahon 1994:191), but as Halliday (1990:19-20, 1993:54-68, and elsewhere) points out, lexical change goes hand in hand with grammatical change. In the latter half of the seventeenth century, grammatical structures of specific types became increasingly frequent in scientific English, at least in written genres, even though scientists rarely intervened in grammatical evolution 'by design'. While scientists and observers alike were very much aware of lexical innovation as labels for new concepts, new discoveries or new inventions, they did not perhaps consciously recognise how far a distinctive register was developing, involving the grammatical structure of clauses and the whole form of communication.

Halliday demonstrates how the scientists of the time drew on the resources of the language to develop a characteristic technical, scientific register. He traces, for example, the use of abstract nouns as technical terms, the development of metaphorical nouns that are nominal representations of processes (as in evaporation, rise, prediction), and the increase in the lexicalization of clause relations (by the use of such expressions as result in, produce, depend on and lead to), which allow nominal groups to be linked by a verb expressing the relationship between the processes as in

All bodies by percussion excite vibrations in the air.   
Increasing responsiveness may be reflected in feeding behaviour.

Although, as is explained below, he is worried about certain aspects of the register, he concedes the advantages to science of the nominalization of processes as a device which allows greater density of information and the specification of tight logical connections between parts of text, to produce "a world of things, symbolically fixed so that they can be observed and measured, reasoned about and brought to order"'.

Halliday (1990:18-21) expresses some concern about the ways in which this form of discourse, even as it became an efficient means of communication between scientists, a way of 'objectifying reality', became increasingly arcane and remote from the \*common-sense construction of experience as embodied in the spoken language of everyday life.' Even allowing for the fact that Halliday is rightly concerned about the problems children at school have in entering the world of scientific discourse, his critical comments about the nature of 'scientific' English are somewhat surprising from a linguist whose theoretical position must support the view that the forms have evolved to suit the communicative needs of scientists in the contexts in which they work (see Halliday 1990:19-21). He describes the register of scientific language as being 'arcane and remote from... the spoken language', 'alienating - a world made entirely of things', increasingly elitist', 'contrived... rigid... and determinate'.

Since space prevents a detailed account of the characteristics of written scientific texts that lead to this so-called rigid and determinate' form, a brief summary of these characteristics is given below (most are discussed at some point in Halliday and Martin 1993):

1. The use of abstract nouns as technical terms e.g. experiment, result, electricity, magnetism (all 17th century).   
2. The use of nouns as causative agents (things which do something) e.g. thermometer, barometer, operator, conductor.   
3. The use of complex nominal groups e.g. the rate of crack growth, crack growth rate, the increasing lung cancer death rate, bond-rupture reaction time.   
4. The lexicalization of clause relations by the use of verbs which express relational processes e.g. lead to, result in, depend on, produce.   
5. A high level of lexical density (resulting in part from 3 & 4 above).   
6. A low frequency of human actors (agents) for material processes e.g. The clamping machine is designed to compensate for springback is preferred to Engineers design the clamping machine to compensate for feedback. (Constructed).   
7. A relatively high frequency of passive voice to active voice verbs (Huddlestone 1971:93- 127).

Halliday contrasts the scientific register with the spoken language which he sees as "non-settled, non-written, non-elaborated", full of "flux and fluidity, indeterminacy and a playful quality".

He notes that even scientists themselves have, at times in the twentieth century, complained about how, as they saw it, language could distort reality and make it seem fixed and determinate instead of 'fluid and probabilistic', but points out that, in fact, the linguistic resources for the expression of 'indeterminacy and complementarity' are easily accessible in the spoken language; it is only the socalled 'scientific language' that seems to have lost these qualities.

Of course, as Halliday fully realises, there are strong communicative advantages in the objectification of knowledge in stereotypical academic scientific discourse. These advantages are specifically functional in the grammatical sense in that the nominalization of processes (where the mention of personal agents is unnecessary) allows both for their thematization and for their qualification, the latter allowing for the development of extended fixed phrases (un-analysed nominal groups) so important in terminology. Together with verbs expressing logical relations, nominal groups can then be linked by verbs expressing the relationships between processes (as in "Evaporation causes cooling", an example every English school child learns).

Nevertheless, access to science is effectively denied to all but those who learn its elaborate language (which is probably the same thing as becoming scientists). While it is unlikely that the language can subjected to editing by members of the Plain English Society without the loss of meaning and force, it is valid to ask, as Halliday does, whether it has become disfunctional at least from some points of view'.

If the answer is 'yes', we would expect to see it replaced in the construction of the reality of new sciences and technologies. Halliday uses the word 'evolve' and expects both to see it shift further 'towards semiotic explanations' and, at the same time, 'to back off from its present extremes of nominalization and grammatical metaphor and to go back to being more preoccupied with processes and more tolerant of indeterminacy and flux'. In the rest of this paper, I try to offer evidence of types of innovation in the language relating to computer science and computer use. Some of these match up to Halliday's predictions; others are more difficult to classify. The data which are draw on here are from published works or were collected from the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, during a study of students' language needs, from 1994-1996 (a list is provided at the end of the paper).

# 3. Emerging genres in computer science

Of first importance in understanding the innovations in the language of computer science, is to recognise the emerging genres in the field. The most common reading texts are on-line although sometimes printed versions (hard copies) may also be available. They include (a) the computer manual and helplines (b) e-mail communication (including newsgroups, (c) information on the InterNet (c) textbooks (which tend to be different in nature from traditional science textbooks, not only in form but also in functions, see Beedham & Bloor 1990, since they are often collections of notes or reports on the development of different programs, systems, and so on) (d) research articles, which are often accessed online from electronic journals, very speedily produced and edited. The writing done by students in Computer Science also differs quite considerably from that in other departments. While most students communicate extensively but informally on the InterNet, they write few formal essays. Reports and projects are the preferred genres, usually introducing new programs or design exercises that the students have carried out under supervision (see Bloor 1996 for further details).

Not surprisingly, these genres, especially those communicating through the computer medium, have different structures and linguistic features from the standard traditional textbooks, essays and lab reports.

# 4. Distinctive features of the language of computer science

The data I have examined indicates that Computer Scientists have reintroduced a high degree of flexibility, informality and dynamism into the language and rhetoric of science. This almost certainly stems in part from the interactive nature of on-line communication and in part from what has been called the 'ephemeral knowledge' of computational research, --which is to say that it is constantly being updated while previous work is rendered obsolete. Writers in networked newsgroups frequently mix social chat, professional gossip, paperwork, formal structures, program writing, and appointments (Park 1985). Some of the language, written quickly for immediate reading, without much care or expectation that it will survive long into the future, has the quality of interactive speech. This extends to written texts, such as computer manuals.

# 4.1 New rhetorical styles and interactive qualities

Computer Manuals, like other instructional manuals, are prepared by experts for novices, but unlike technical manuals in Engineering or Mechanics, they use a style with many interpersonal features. In the early days of popular computing, they were often criticised for their obscurity and failure to communicate, but there is no doubt that there has been a recent improvement in their accessibility, which has come along with the change to an interactive style.

Typical features of computer manuals include distinctive non-linguistic codes, such as margin diagrams and illustrations which serve a textual function. These notes often take the form of indicative icons (for example, an exclamation mark for tips, a notebook and pen for 'notes', spilt ink for dire warnings), which lead the reader to the writer's intended purposive move. Headings and sub-headings also provide the reader with textual indicators (A closer look at DIR; Another DOS command; Tip). These features can be seen, for example, in Schildt 1994, the manual from which the data in this paper are taken.

We find some imperatives in all instructional manuals in English as far as I am aware, but, whereas car maintenance manuals, for example, also favour instructional forms with modal passive voice clauses (a slot drill must be used, the diameters can be checked with plug gauges; after the vice has been positioned, it should be checked for alignment as shown in Fig. 8), the computer manual alone uses the second person present simple tense with pronoun 'you' in place of the imperative or modal form for some instructions. This is interesting because the second person form is commonly found in English only in informal, spoken instructions for processes that are not taking place in the immediate context of situation, such as verbal 'recipes'. (You get a big bowl and you put 4 ounces of butter in it).

(1a) To format your disk, you use the FORMAT command.: NOT: Use the FORMAT command to format your disk.

We also find extensive use of 'let's', otherwise almost exclusively used in spoken English or in the written representation of speech in fiction:

(1b) Let's practise formatting a disk now.

Let was not attested in Huddlestone's (1971) scientific corpus except where an author was establishing a hypothetical mathematical problem as in Let u,v,w be the velocity components.., or Let us take the 3 axis in the direction of the magnetic field...

We also find the use of contractions and exclamation marks throughout, again usually used in print to represent features of spoken English: The negative imperative (don't rather than do not) is common for warnings, usually followed by an exclamation mark.

(1c) Don't format your fixed disk!

Sometimes writers set up imaginary conversations with the reader, along with the appropriate personal pronouns:

(1d) This question may have occurred to you: If I am logged into a floppy drive, what happens to the directory window if I change the diskette in that drive? The answer is that if your computer is...

Typical phrases are seen in 1.e:

(1e) Now that you have X, you will want to Y. Let's try an experiment. Before you can X, you need to know how to Y.

The interpersonal features of this style are also fairly typical of popular computer magazines, even those written for specialists such as Windows Sources. This style differs from more traditional popular science publications, such as New Scientist or Scientific American, where, in spite of a relaxation of the most rigid features of the scientific register such as the lack of personal actors, the style is still basically transactional rather than interactional. Computer magazines have more in common with gutter press journalism, having an extensive use of colloquial expressions as can be seen in (2) (growing pains, the wonders of, the good news, without a glitch, the trick is, to figure out):

# (2)Don't forget your enhanced BOIS

IDE is suffering its share of growing pains as it strives to match some of the wonders of ACSI. The good news is that most current IDE-based hard drives and host adaptors work together without a glitch... The trick when you buy is to figure out what capabilities you need. (my underlining)

There is a widespread use of first person pronouns and interrogatives addressed to the reader; there appears to be no attempt to reproduce the objectified reality of scientific prose. Thus we find these typical opening sentence of articles:

(3) I'm not happy unless I have hundreds of scaleable typefaces at my fingertips. (4) We'd like to state from the outset that we're big fans of 3D modelling and animation technologies. (5) How do you motivate programmers to create world-class software?

Informality extends to recent textbooks, which often seem to represent spoken discourse in their attempt to make ideas clearer and to explain formal terminology. The example (6) is from a programming textbook (Cooper 1993:xxxi, data from Handee 1996):

(6) Our operating system could be oriented towards a keyboard input, while another relies more heavily on graphical interface, which is a fancy way of saying that you use a mouse more than you type. (My italics)

Colloquialisms, and even slang (as in 4 above: we're big fans) also feature in student writing, where it is tolerated far more than one would expect from other academic fields. In student writing, the greatest degree of informality is found in the style of newsgroups, which are often very close to spoken discourse, full of colloquial expressions, jokes and references to popular culture. A relatively serious example is seen in (7):

(7) I may well be doing something silly but could someone who said that they had experienced the "Black Holes" error tell me how they obtained it? I tried to obtain one using the following script: [followed by a formula] Undergraduate Newsgroup, 1994

The newsgroup is a particular form of E-Mail communication established among contributors who have a special common interest or purpose. Many such newsgroups exist, but for convenience, I examined a students' newsgroup established within a department of Computer Science in the academic year 1994-95.

The newsgroup is particularly interesting because of the social flux and linguistic fluidity that can be observed in the interaction. We find in the newsgroup discourse a mingling of voices, influences and forces, not yet formalised in any strong direction.

Of network facilities, Park (1995) writes:

Bringing all this communication to the computer specialist's terminal means that he (sic) develops a very special relationship with the system, since almost every aspect of his career now turns on his interactions with it, and with his colleagues through it. Social chat, professional gossip, office paperwork, professional papers, program writing and debugging, program documentation, appointments and conference announcements all pass through the system.

Within departments of Computer Science, students are attached to semi-official networks designed to allow free communication, exchange of ideas on educational and social issues, and opportunities for cross-questioning. Officially, any member of the group (say all students on a particular course) may contribute and all contributions are stored (and can be printed out) for a given period and then discarded. In effect, newsgroups form an experimental type of interaction with a contextually unique structure with respect to field, mode and tenor.

Thus they are written texts that have major features of spoken language. They are not immediately lost to the world like unrecorded speech, but in discourse terms, the written contributions are similar to contributions to a conversation in that they are generally short and 'unprepared', contributors 'take turns', turns develop previous contributions, and contributors negotiate meaning, ask for clarification, respond to requests and so on. They resemble the 'dimension of structure' of conversation (see Lakoff and Johnson 1981:77-78). There is also a certain amount of phatic communion, a lot of slang and idiosyncratic features. Similar features, indicating the influence of spoken discourse, were observed by McCarthy (1992) in British football fan magazines. Yet, in spite of these features of 'talk', in the newsgroup messages, we also find formal scientific passages or even mathematical formulae juxtaposed without constraint.

Contributions to newsgroups concern social and organisational issues and also personal messages and replies to questions. The latter are often linked to a discussion of technical issues, as in the following example (8):

(8) SM will now verbally crucify you for a chainsaw type question $- \mathbf { I }$ have just been to see him and he spent a long time explaining that the representation on screen doesn't matter as long as it accurately represents the abstract maze model you are trying to solve.

The 'chainsaw type question' is a question that is considered so stupid that the questioner deserves punishment with a chainsaw (the reference is to a video game). SM are the initials of the lecturer who will 'verbally crucify' (heavily criticise) the questioner, who was foolish enough to put his question on a public newsgroup.

As in E-Mail the initial message can be re-printed on the reply, and contributors often intersperse their responses with the initial message or question. A typical exchange is re-produced in (9) (where C stands for Contributor):

(9) C1: I've just heard that the Functional Programming lecture which is currently on Monday has been moved to Friday at 5.05. This means that we will not finish until almost 6.00 on a Friday evening. The reason for the change is that LIB1 in not big enough. I don't know about anyone else but I would rather sit on the floor in LIB1 than have to go to a lecture until 6.00 on Friday. C2:  You must have more up-to-date information than me. I hadn't heard! C1: 1 feel more tempted to miss the lecture because of the time than I ever did because of the seating problem. C2: This sounds reasonable, I too would much prefer the lecture on a Monday.

This is as close as we can get to an electronic/graphic representation of spoken interaction at the informal end of the scale of communication.

One of the conventional features of student newsgroup discourse is that students develop their own logos which they print at the end of all their messages. Some of these are purely visual, a small animal, an owl, a diagram, exploiting the graphic potential of the computer, others also include mottoes. Many incorporate E-Mail addresses and nick-names (prefixed AKA for 'as known as'), such as 'Purple Tentacle', 'Cypunk' and 'Bughunter' and 'Ziggy', which show the influence of comics (spelt comiks and komix), computer games, science fiction literature and popular music. Sample mottoes are:

See you in my dreams Shee! You guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off You must understand Tao before transcending structure

Even in the most serious student writing and in published research articles, we find quite significant flexibility which is reflected primarily in aspects of the lexis and the nature of innovative language. It is also often observable in the humour and self-conscious word spinning of computer scientists.

Example (10) is from a final year project report; while being extremely technical and primarily descriptive, it manifests certain typical features of computer science discourse at the more formal end of the scale.

(10) RAID level five is slower than RAID level three for contiguous sector accessing. Given that RAID level five has the overhead of locating the parity sector for each data stripe, and accessing data around the parity sector, it will inevitably require more calculation and trickier buffering than level three. In contrast, a RAID level five system allows a greater bandwidth than RAID level three when small write accesses are executed. With this type of load the parity disk will be accessed for every write in a level three system, creating a bottleneck. In a level five system, there is no single parity disk so the extra load is spread out between all the disks. Level five will allow more writes to occur simultaneously. During reads there will be an extra disk available to share the data transfer requirements, which will increase the speed of small reads. Large reads are unaffected, because...

Hill, Mark. 1993. PC RAID: A PC Based Redundant Disk System, Project Report.

This text is less personal and interactive, but its technical quality is modified by the use of words like trickier and bottleneck which indicate a breaking with formal scientific register. Read and write are both technical terms for computer operations which were developed, by metaphorical extension from the human processes to the transfer of information by electronic signal to and from a charge storage tube. As we see illustrated in text (10), a further feature indicative of flexibility is apparent: the ease with which computer scientists utilise the grammatical potential of words by allowing them to switch class, as in the use of read and write, used as verbs in most varieties of English, as heads of nominal groups (every write, more writes, large reads, small reads) and as pre-nominal classifiers (write access). Class change (or 'category change' as it is sometimes called) of this type occurs in general English, as we can see from words like table, cloud, stone, machine, which can be used as verbs in certain contexts. In scientific writing, there has, until recently, been a preference for morphological markings to distinguish word class as in groups such as atom, atomic; category, categorize; analysis, analyse, analysable; electricity, electrocute, electrical; grow, growth. But in computer science, as an on-line document on computer language by computer scientists, The Jargon File states, All nouns can be verbed' (Raymond 1992). Although this may be something of an exaggeration, it is hard to see what the constraints might be.

# 4.2 New terminology

When computer scientists design innovative software or construct theories, they are obliged to create terminology for what are essentially abstract processes of digital number crunching. Example (11) illustrates this:

(11)  Action semantics is a high level notation for writing modular programming language definitions... The notation consists of combinator-like entities, called actions, which represent fundamental computational steps. Actions have semi-descriptive English names, which lets a novice semi-understand them. Kyung-Goo Doh & David A. Schmidt. 1993. Action Semantic-Directed Prototyping.

Traditionally, neologisms in science were coined from Greek or Latin roots, with or without the addition of affixes (Potter 1975: Chapter 5). The majority of new terms in computer science, however, are either coined from Old English roots (Anglo-Saxon') or are metaphorical extensions of the general stock of lexical items, such as action in (8) above or from terms in other fields, as in address, architecture, file, and this seems to be increasingly true at the so-called sharp end of research.

'Semi-understand' in (10) is a fairly well established term (it is acknowledged that complex computer systems are only 'understood' at a restricted level). 'Semidescriptive' is a serious joke by analogy with the former term. Computer Science, along with a few other fields has been the major area of terminological growth in the second half of the twentieth century.

It was not until the 1950s that computers were developed for commercial use but, by the time the first Penguin Dictionary of Computers was published in 1970, five years before the micro-computer, the development of the language was well underway. This dictionary already contained approximately 4,000 entries, including single word terms such as disk and fixed phrases such as visual display unit (VDU), but relatively few compound words. By the 1985 edition, the vocabulary had grown considerably (although many of the earlier terms are now only of historical interest) with the development of personal computing and microchips, and it is still expanding rapidly with the use of CD-Roms and the Internet.

How has this terminology developed? One thing only is clear and that is that there has been no consistent policy for the development of terms. It has, in fact, been random, haphazard and extremely flexible. The transfer of terms from other fields, particularly from Algebra, Linguistics and Philosophical Logic is very common, but where existing words have been given new meanings or where neologisms have been created, these have come largely from the native wordstock rather than borrowings from other languages, even though the latter method has been seen as generally the \*most favoured [method] in technical English' (Halliday 1978:195). In the eighteenth century, Linneus took the nomenclature of plants straight from Latin, and Lavoisier deliberately "chose Greek for his technical terms" in Chemistry (Potter 1975:87-89), computer scientists have tended to favour extensions of words attested in Old English or Middle English, as in the sample list below, especially when humorous connotations can be counted on.

bug (ME) n.v. - de-bug, debugging code (ME) n.v. - encoding   
cross-check (OE-ME) n.v.   
dump (ME) n.v.   
feed (OE) n.v. - feedback   
hack (ME) $\nu .$ - hacker   
line (OE) n.v. - online; offline   
link (ME) n.v. - linkage   
loop (ME) n.v.   
nest (OE) n.v. - nesting   
net (ME) n.v. - network   
noise (ME) n.   
path (OE) n.   
plant (OE) n.v.   
route (ME) n.v.   
scan (ME) n.v. - scanner   
scrap (ME) v.n.   
sort (ME) v.   
string (OE) n.   
tape (ME) n.

These words are not 'created' or constructed by combining other words, and neither are they 'borrowed' from other languages. They are real words with wellestablished  general' meanings that are chosen to carry new meanings by analogy or metaphor. Thus dump (a heap of rubbish, the place where one leaves rubbish or the action of throwing away rubbish) becomes a verb meaning to make unwanted information inaccessible. This propensity for what might be called every-day words' along with a desire for verbal display almost certainly carries features of an \*anti-language' (Halliday 1978:164-182). It is not merely lexicalized, it is overlexicalized since, as anyone who has tried to use more than one word-processing program will appreciate, there is often a duplicity of terms for the same function (see Bloor 1996).

But although words of English origin are favoured, other derivations appear, as witnessed by terms such as peripheral device, sub-routine, and processing system. We also find, as in many varieties of English, apparently synonymous terms derived from different languages as in the use of in and enter (as data entered is known as input) and out and exit (output).

The selection of terms from the English word stock is not entirely new, -a similar tendency was observed earlier this century in the field of mathematics. Rapoport (1959) commented that the key terms in the vocabulary of (then) modern algebra and physics were words like group, ring, field, trace, norm, simple, open, closed, etc, but that, although the words were frequent in everyday social interaction, they were used so distinctly in mathematics that it was "impossible to explain the meaning of a single one of these words to anyone who has not had literally years of certain kinds of experience". This, like the following quotation, also from Rapoport, rings very true for Computer Science terminology in the 1990s.

In many areas of science, far from using complicated words to denote simple notions (as many believe) the language of science uses very simple words to denote exceedingly complex notions.

In Computer science, we also find a wide use of acronyms: CD (compact disk), ROM (read only memory), Gif (graphics interchange format), Hippi (high performance parallel processor interface) and abbreviated forms: Fortran (formula translation), Pixel (picture element). The use of acronyms in computer science is mentioned by Adams (1973:136-7), but the examples she gives are not commonly in use today providing further evidence for he ephemeral quality of the language in this field. Clearly though, the creation of acronyms is a very useful was of 'simplifying' elaborate nominal groups which otherwise take up 'space'. (The magazine Computer Shopper, Spring edition 1994, gives a serialised list of acronyms, which includes abbreviated forms).

Affixation is given by McMahon as one of the "most common" techniques for making neologisms in English and by Godman and Payne (1979:viii) as being specially significant for scientific derivatives. This device is undoubtedly to be found in computer science but not as commonly as one might imagine, probably as a result of the tendency to allow words to change category without affixation mentioned above. In and out are the most common prefixes as in input, output, but micro and inter are also common (micro-processor; interface; micro-chip)

Compounding is seen (spreadsheet, software, helpline, newsgroup, spellcheck) but this is not as common as uncombined phrasal collocates (locutions) giving rise to new terms from a combination of older terms:

network architecture, information retrieval, knowledge-based system, binary digit.

It may be that the very strong phrasal collocations that could lead to compounding have not yet had time to become sufficiently established. We also find, however, a tendency to simplify and drop the classifier and talk about chips, architecture, and the like.

# 5. Conclusion

As we can see from the above examples, computer scientists (even while they are still students) are linguistically self-aware people. They play verbal games, both in the creation of terminology and in the ways they refer to it. They have, in much of their writing, re-introduced flux and fluidity', indeterminacy and even a playful quality into their writing. Even in research articles, which I have no space to discuss in detail here, there is evidence that scientific prose no longer need be the 'fixed and determinate discourse' that it once might have seemed to be. The type of features that I have described provide evidence that new freer modes of expression are available in English scientific writing and that these extend the linguistic options that are open to all users of the language. We have already seen a take-up of computer terminology into the registers of other fields (for example, top-down and bottom up processing in applied linguistics). When they are 'borrowed' in this way, they take on new metaphorical meanings, which can, in itself cause problems in communication.

I would not like to suggest that all the standard features of scientific prose have disappeared from writing in the field or that the innovations outlined above have necessarily made the computer science register more accessible to the educated lay reader than other branches of science. In the summary of the characteristics of traditional scientific prose given in section 2, I mentioned the use of inanimate nouns as causative agents ('things which do something'). This feature is central to writing in computer science as is the use of abstract nouns as technical terms. The difference in computer science is that there is a preponderance of nominal groups representing some abstract programming function which are derived by personification from human activity. The computer itself is said to do things, an operating system performs in certain ways, and a scheduler can make decisions, decide things, reason and plan.

Although there is a tendency to use shorter nominal groups in computer science than, say, in engineering, some longer nominal groups have evolved and threeword standard terms are quite common (automatic volume compressor; visual display unit; read only memory), but, as we have seen, along with this goes the tendency to transform such nominal groups to acronyms: AVC, VDU and ROM. Similarly, just as the technical terms become more and more complex there is a tendency for the writers to attempt informal paraphrase (as in example 6 above). The overall picture is still very fluid and difficult to grasp and much on-going research needs to be done to capture the nature of the changes.

I have (Bloor 1996 and above) referred to the genres of computing as emerging genres', simply because the conventions associated with them are still not clearly defined or agreed by the discourse communities using the medium. E-mail is, perhaps the most established, and some computer users have tried to fix certain conventions for e-mail communication (see Raymond 1993). They have not been entirely successful, perhaps because the rapid growth in the use of the system has allowed independent groups to develop without contact with the established users. For example, the use of capital letters was originally discouraged on e-mail, except for emphasis, and users would condemn the practice as 'shouting'. Many people using the system today would not have heard of this 'rule'.

The information carried in computer science texts is undoubtedly as difficult for the uninitiated to access as is the traditional scientific text (see Bloor 1996b for discussion). Even when such texts are written for the non-specialist by authors who are making a great effort to get their ideas across, they do not easily communicate technical information. The idea put forward by Halliday (1993:21) that science can develop new ways of meaning that are somehow more 'democratic' than written scientific discourse and that it is the language rather than the field that determines accessibility is not supported by my investigations, -except in so far as e-mail easily allows questioning, checking and responding, which encourages interactive exchange of information. The problem is that the playfulness, the fluidity and informality of computer science discourse can reflect the existence of an \*in-group' in much the same way as the elaborate forms of traditional science. The very fluidity of, for example, category change, a feature which is fairly common in everyday spoken language, can make reading very difficult for the uninitiated as the examples of read and write in (10) above testify. Whichever way varieties of language develop, it will be the social groups that use those varieties that control them. Computer scientists and other computer users have sometimes made brave and serious attempts to break out of the conventions of strict academic established modes of discourse, but, nevertheless, it is likely to be a struggle for the uninitiated to join in the game. It is still, as it always has been, the job of the educators to help them.

# SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE AS INTERACTION SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES VS. POPULARIZATIONS

PILAR GARCES-CONEJOS Universidad de Sevilla ANTONIA SANCHEZ-MACARRO\* Universitat de Valencia

# Abstract

The aim of this paper is to further develop some points found in two articles by Myers (1989, 1992). Myers studies the presence of politeness strategies in a series of articles on genetic biology. By analysing the social meaning ofthe different strategies used by the writers, he describes the interaction established between them and the intended readers. He also puts forth interesting conclusions regarding the nature of scientific discourse. Myers points out that a comparison with popularizations, a genre in which the writer has a different kind of relationship to the reader, and thus uses different kinds of politeness devices, reinforces the conclusion that these devices arise in response to the two types of interaction embodied in the texts. The space devoted in Myers's work to this interesting comparison is quite restricted so we decided to elaborate on it in an attempt to describe in detail the strategies used to establish and convey the above mentioned interaction. Ten articles on different aspects of genetics found in Scientific American were analysed and discussed using Brown and Levinson's postulates (1978, 1987) and Scollon and Scollon (1995) as a framework of reference.

# 1. Summary of Brown & Levinson's postulates

We think it might be useful to introduce briefly Brown & Levinson's politeness theory (B & L henceforth). The relevance of scientific discourse as the corpus for our study can only be fully grasped when the main premises of their paradigm are explicated. Additionaly the detailed linguistic analysis we present of the data found in the texts is based on the classification of strategies and terminology included in their work. However, in our opinion, Scollon & Scollon 's revised terminology (S & S henceforth) and insights on politeness theory were a helpful complement to B & L's model and a key interpretating device for a thorough understanding of the social interaction embodied in the texts. We will devote some time to a short review of their ideas below.

B & L present their explication for politeness within a framework in which their rational Model Person has face, the individual's self-esteem. They understand face as the universal, although culturally elaborated, public self-image that every member of a society wants to claim for himself.

B & L characterize two types of face in terms of participant wants rather than social norms:

Negative face: the want of every competent adult member that his freedom of action be unhindered and his attention unimpeded by others.

Positive face: the desire of every member that his wants (or the actions/ acquisitions/values resulting from them should be thought of as desirable.

Face is something that can be lost, maintained or enhanced and any threat to face must be continually monitored during an interaction. The assumption is made that it is generally in everyone's interest to maintain each other's face and to act in such ways that others are made aware that this is one's intention.

The organizing principle for B & L's politeness theory is the idea that some acts are intrinsically threatening to face and thus require softening (they call them FTAs: Face Threatening Acts). To this end, each group of language users develops politeness principles from which they derive certain strategies. It is by the use of these so-called politeness strategies that speakers succeed in communicating both their primary message(s) as well as their intention to be polite in doing so. And in doing so, they reduce the face loss that results from the interaction.

B & L propose that the following acts are inherently face-threatening to the speaker (S), to the hearer (H) or to both:

(1) Acts threatening to H's Negative Face: e.g. ordering, advising, threatening, warning etc.;   
(2) Acts threatening to H's Positive Face: e.g. complaining, criticizing, disagreeing, raising taboo topics;   
(3) Acts threatening to S's Negative Face: e.g. accepting an offer, accepting thanks, promising unwillingly;   
(4) Acts threatening to S's Positive Face: e.g. apologizing, accepting compliments, confessing.

They posit a taxonomy of possible strategies for performing FTAs, summarized as follows

Low face risk to the participant

Baldly - Without redress On record Positive Politeness Do FTA With redress Off record Negative Politeness Don't do FTA

High face risk to the participant

Performing an act on record, but (baldly) without redress, entails doing it in the most clear, unequivocal way (e.g. stop a moment!). On record but with redressive action may involve using positive politeness strategies (roughly, the expression of solidarity, e.g. Since we both want to hear the announcement, ...), or Negative Politeness (roughly, the expression of restraint, e.g. If it wouldn't be too much trouble...). Off record strategies (roughly the avoidance of unequivocal impositions) requires a more complicated inference, e.g. It would help me if no one were to do anything for just a moment.

B & L claim that a speaker must determine the seriousness of a face-threatening act --and therefore the strategy to codify it with-- in terms of three independent and culturally sensitive variables:

(1) Social Distance (D) between the speaker and the hearer; in effect the degree of familiarity and solidarity they share.   
(2) Relative Power (P) of the speaker with respect to the hearer; in effect the degree to which the speaker can impose will on the hearer;   
(3) Absolute Ranking (R) of impositions in the culture, both in terms of the expenditure of goods and/or services by the hearer, the right of the speaker to perform the act, and the degree to which the hearer welcomes the imposition.

In their model, the weightiness $( W s )$ (the seriousness or the estimate of risk of face-loss) of an FTA is calculated thus:

$$
\mathbf { W } \mathbf { x } { = } \mathrm { D } \left( \mathrm { S } , \mathrm { H } \right) { + } \mathrm { P } \left( \mathrm { H } , \mathrm { S } \right) { + } \mathrm { R } \mathbf { x }
$$

with the assumption that each of the three variables can be measured on a scale of 1 to $_ n$ with $_ n$ being a relatively small number. It is the values of Wx which will determine the degree of politeness (face-saving) that the speaker concludes is required for the communication of the act.'

# 2. Politeness theory and scientific discourse

The reason why scientific discourse presents itself as an interesting basis for the application of the postulates of politeness theory is related to the fact that most of the contents of both scientific articles (SA henceforth) and popularizations (POP henceforth) constitute FTAs at the propositional level. SA and POP consist, in essence, of presentations of claims --(present or new and past)-- i.e. assertions that the authors do no attribute to anyone else and for which they hope to be cited. In most cases, these claims imply a criticism, a reformulation or an elaboration of former theories, beliefs etc. put forth by other researchers. The IMPOsITION (I) of this face threatening content has to be somehow redressed- it is in the interest of the writer to do so, so as not to disrupt the interactional balance on which the social foundations of the scientific community are based. Thus, different mitigating linguistic codifications are used thereto, making the texts of these publications an invaluable source of study for anyone interested in politeness.

Notwithstanding the interesting possibilities they present as a corpus of study, both POP and SA -and all published writing material for that matter- pose two important problems related to the two other variables DISTANCE (D) and POWER (P). These together with I make up B & L's list of factors that S takes into consideration when codifying an FTA. Problems which are related to the fact that there is not just one H with whom S interacts, but a potentially diverse and large audience. In this respect, it is useful to cite Myers (1989) who following, Fleck (1935/1981), distinguishes between the esoteric and the exoteric scientific communities. The exoteric group is the wider scientific community. The esoteric audience are those individual researchers and particular groups of researchers doing similar work.

Relating these two concepts --exoteric versus esoteric communities-- with the variables D and P, we could conclude with Myers that the variable D -social distance between individuals-- is to be considered very great, whereas P, the relative differences in power between individuals, are supposed to be very small. However, the community as a whole is granted enormous power in comparison with the individuals in it. Because it is obvious that some researchers know each other very well and that Nobel Prize Winners and directors of research projects at prestigious laboratories and university departments are endowed with much more power than other investigators, we know for a fact this power endowement operates only at a theoretical, idealized level.

SA are supposedly addressed to the whole exoteric community --and overheard by the esoteric one. Therefore, whoever it may really be the one who reads a scientific article, the forms are consistent with it being addressed to a general scientific audience knowledgeable in that specific research. So for instance, knowledge of some terms is assumed, but well-known researchers and standard studies are cited as if the reader did not know them. Therefore, although a respect for the realm of science is in constant display, it is really those researchers working in direct competition with the authors -investigating in competing laboratories, studying related aspects of the same phenomenon, stating different or opposite claims etc.-- namely the esoteric community, to whom mitigating politeness forms are mostly directed.

Conversely, in POP the face of the exoteric group is of primary consideration not the one of the esoteric group of researchers. As Myers (1989: 28) points out: "The main interactive problem here is to avoid insulting the readers, to try to make them feel like part of the [scientific] community, while still maintaining the proper deference towards the scientific community". We think that this might be the case with POP, in those articles that are written by staff writers, but not when the contributions are written by the same authors who made the original claims. To redress the face of those colleagues working in closely related aspects of the same field, or competing laboratories is a major concern as shown in the many examples found in our corpus. These are later discussed.

Another key divergence between SA and POP is the IMPOsITION they suppose. As we mentioned earlier, every SA states a new claim: it makes a statement that is to be taken as the article's contribution to knowledge. POP, on the other hand, refer to past findings. These are former claims, usually already accepted by the scientific community. They therefore merely share information with the exoteric community which is already considered accepted scientific knowledge by the esoteric one. This same idea is expressed by Myers:

These genres [popularizations and scientific articles] have the same topics, and often the same authors, .., but the reader/writer configuration is changed. Popularizations written by the researchers themselves (like the articles in Scientific American ) present many of the same problems of FTAs as articles for scientific journals, but there is no longer the need to make and deny claims... It is the face of the exoteric group that is to be primarily considered, not that of the esoteric group of researchers. The main interactive problem is to avoid insulting the readers, to try to make them feel like part of the community of molecular geneticists, while still maintaining the proper deference toward the scientific community. (1989: 28)

# 3. Scollon & Scollon's politeness systems: an alternative terminology to B & L

After justifying, we hope, the relevance of scientific discourse as the basis for a linguistic politeness study relating it to B & L's model and establishing some crucial differences between SA and POP, we need to review some insights on politeness put forth by S & S. We will use them as the basis of our working hypothesis and to help us, together with B & L's taxonomies, tackle the analysis of the texts.

S & S (1995) distinguish three politeness systems: deference, solidarity and hierarchy.

Deference politeness system $( - P , + D )$ : A deference politeness system is one in which participants are considered to be equals or near equals but treat each other at a distance. Relationships among professional colleagues who do not know each other well is one example. The characteristics of this system are that it is:

1. symmetrical (-P), that is, the participants see themselves as being at the same social level;   
2. distant $^ { ( + \mathrm { { D } ) } }$ , that is, each uses independence strategies (negative politeness in B & L's terms) speaking to the other.

Solidarity politeness system $( - \pmb { P } , \pmb { D } )$ : When two friends have a conversation with each other they exemplify a solidarity face system (positive politeness in B & L's terms). There is a high level of involvement politeness strategies. There is no feeling of either a power difference (-P) or distance (-D) between them.

The characteristics of this system are that it is:

1. symmetrical (-P), that is, the participants see themselves as being in equal social position;   
2. close (-D), that is, the participants both use politeness strategies of involvement (positive politeness in B & L's terms).

One could find solidarity politeness anywhere the system is egalitarian and participants feel or express closeness to each other.

The third politeness system included by S & S in their taxonomy, hierarchical politeness, is not relevant to our study since it implies a $+ \mathrm { { P } , }$ and, as we noted above, the relationship established among the members of the scientific community implies a -P.

From what we have mentioned above, it is obvious that POP aim at making the exoteric community feel a part of the esoteric one, while paying due respect to the members of the latter. This means that the authors of POP, whose target audience is the exoteric community, try to give the members of the esoteric one the credit they deserve for their specific contributions to a given field, thus respecting their identity as a subgroup. This implies maintaining a higher $+ \mathbf { D }$ level for them within the scientific community as a whole. Satisfying the needs of both communities is bound to create a certain tension between two tendencies in the texts, i.e. solidarity and deference. Intuitively, we feel that solidarity will be displayed towards the exoteric community and deference towards the esoteric one.

# 4. Data analysis

Ten recent articles on the field of genetics were selected among those published by the well known POP Scientific American. The choice of the topic was due to the fact that Myers's article, whose conclusions motitvated the present work, was based upon a number of SA on the same field. This, we thought, would render more coherence to the comparisons being put forth.

The selection was also geared towards those papers which had been written by the same authors who had performed the very experiments and discoveries being reported, and who had previously presented them as SA in prestigious, hard core, scientific journals. As we stated above, we feel that these authors would feel compelled -more so than staff writers-- to consider the face of both the exoteric and esoteric communities. Although their focus is mainly the exoteric -target audience of POP-, they would not disregard the importance of maintaining the interactional balance with the members of the esoteric community --lab colleagues or competitors- to which they belong.

# 4.1 Positive politeness strategies - The displaying of involvement

4.1.1 One of the involvement (positive politeness) strategies that is most commonly found in the texts is the providing of basic information on the subject or topic that is being discussed. It can be related to B & L's generic strategy "Claim common ground: Notice, attend to H (his interests, wants, needs, goods). Obviously this strategy is directed towards the exoteric community and responds directly to the fact that some of the possible readers may find it difficult to understand some basic concepts, terminology, etc. The linguistic codification of the social interaction in POP, which can be explained in terms of this strategy, is the one with a higher percentage of appearance in the texts. Of course the difficulty lies in the assessing of how much information should be provided without insulting the readers. We should remember that, according to Myers, this was the main interactive problem to be tackled in this type of text. Too much information can be insulting, too little may hinder the correct comprehension and thus the internalization of the information which is being conveyed to the exoteric community.

The logic behind calling the translation-blocking strategy "anti-sense" is less apparent. But it can be grasped easily if one knows a bit about the structure of RNA and the way one RNA molecule combines with another or with DNA. RNA molecules are strings of nucleotides. These nucleotides consist of the sugar ribose, a phosphate group (PO4) and any of four nitrogencontaining bases -adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). (DNA nucleotides are similar, except that the sugar is deoxyribose and the base thymine, T, takes the place of uracil... So it is that the practice of inhibiting translations with oligonucleotides is called the antisense strategy. (The New Genetic Medicines", 51)

When referring specifically to human genes, the HOx label is capitalized to conform with standard genetic nomenclature. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 414)

4.1.2 Another positive politeness strategy, which is also related to the claiming of common ground, is that when there might be a moral issue involved, the authors make an explicit reference to it, thus anticipating the concern of the intended readers by showing that it is also their belief that social morality should check scientific discoveries. The most important fact is that, in their application, they will be able to help human beings by improving the quality of their lives. In this way, they are attempting to connect science and society, that is the esoteric, exoteric communities with society at large.

... Ernesto Sanchez-Herrero and Gines Morata of the Independent University of Madrid found that elimination of three genes in the bithorax complex -.-- is lethal. Yet such mutant embryos survive long enough to develop specialized structures that indicate all eight abdominal segments are replaced by thoracic segments. Most people would be unnerved by analogous birth defects in mammals, but these grotesque defects in flies can be observed with equanimity. (The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 36)

Our research has attracted an extraordinary degree of public attention, not so much because of any conceptual breakthrough -the idea that genes and the brain are involved in human behaviour is hardly new- but because of touches on a deep conflict in American society. We believe scientific research can help dispel some of the myths about homosexuality that in the past have clouded the image of lesbians and gay men. We also recognize, however, that increasing knowledge of biology can eventually bring with it the power to infringe on the natural rights of individuals and to impoverish the world of its human diversity. It is important that our society expand discussions of how new scientific information should be used to benefit the human race in its entirety. ("Evidence for a Biological Influence in Male Homosexuality", 25)

As investigators gain clarity on the specific groups of genetic changes that lead to and exacerbate particular forms of cancer, their insights should point the way to practical benefits for patients. When the mutations follow in a fairly set sequence, their identification in a patient's tumor should be of value for clarifying the stage of disease and thus for tailoring therapy to the individual's needs. (The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 57)

If DNA provides a recipe for building an organism, and ancient DNA stores the recipe with fidelity, then a question naturally arises: Can we hope to reverse extinction by resuscitating vanished species? Could we clone identical twins of our recent and more distant ancestors, recall the moas or quaggas to life or even establish breeding farms for dinosaurs? It is my firm conviction that such dreams (or nightmares) will never be realized. The resurrection of lost species will remain beyond our power... such experiments do not in any sense preserve or recreate lost species or ecosystems. Extinction is and will always be forever. What we can hope is that the study of ancient DNA will help us learn more about the dynamics of genetic change in populations over time. With such knowledge we may be able not only to understand better the history of ourselves and other species but also to frame more rational strategies to limit the ongoing erosion of biodiversity. ("Ancient DNA", 66)

4.1.3 There are also frequent references to the human side of researchers, which is also an involvement strategy directed towards the exoteric community. The writer once again claims common ground by enhancing aspects related with the human dimension of the investigating activity (difficulties encountered, surprises, disappointments, anecdotes, personal preferences...), which allow the readers to recognize in the distant figure of the researcher a fellow human being, one who shares similar feelings and experiences with them, thus bringing this figure closer to them.

... hese experiments all hark back to the classical observations of Karl Ernst von Baer, who in the 1820s concluded that if one examined early embryonic morphologies, all vertebrate forms seemed to converge toward a common design. The story which sounds too good to be true, is that von Baer came to this epiphany after the labels fell off some of his bottled specimens of early embryos and he realized with some chagrin that he could not be sure whether the embryos were lizards, birds or mammals.

To satisfy ourselves and the scientific community that we were correct, we had to devise an experimental procedure that would unambiguosly establish whether coactivators existed ... ("Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 43)

4.1.4 We can find another group of devices related to the positive side politeness which are employed to create rapport and to help the readers feel closer to the research activity of the esoteric scientific community and those who carry it out. Among them, we would like to highlight the frequent presence of conversational sounding devices such as the asking of rhetorical questions, the use of colloquial expressions or the direct address to the readers.

# 4.2 Independence strategies -- The displaying of deference

These strategies are used to redress the face of the esoteric scientific community and are found in the linguistic codification of the facts related to the specific investigating activity, to describe past findings, to mitigate criticism to the lines followed by different colleagues or laboratories, to state semi-claims, to point to future approaches, to show the limitations of a given field regardless of the contributions to it it might have referred to and so on.

Out of the different generic strategies listed by B & L, we have identified two very salient ones which group together a series of sub-strategies. These generic strategies, which reflect two of the main goals of the papers analyzed, are the use of impersonalizing devices and the use of devices aimed at giving options to H.

4.2.1 Impersonalization devices related to the negative politeness strategy "Communicate $\mathit { S 3 }$ want to not impinge on H, Dissociate S, H from the particular infringement - Impersonalize"

4.2.1.1 Use of the passive voice. According to B & L "The passive coupled with a rule of agent deletion is perhaps the means par excellence in English to avoid reference to persons involved in FTAs. It may be used to remove direct reference to the speaker...' (1978: 199) The use of the passive voice is pervasive in scientific discourse both to mitigate FTA and to emphasize results. It is not as important who made the discovery, who formulated the hypothesis. The key aspect is that the results of these processes are available to us all, and are seen not as the property of individuals, but as part of the realm of the scientific community. In the examples below, we can observe cases of the use of the passive voice as a results-oriented, agent-avoidance strategy.

One bacterial clone containing two such Alu-repeats was isolated form tissues of a mummy reliably dated between 2,310 and 2,550 years ago. (Ancient DNA", 62)

The reason for the low efficiency of cloning was discovered when the ancient DNA was analyzed biochemically. ("Ancient DNA", 62)   
Nor is the exact function of the rat's sexually dimorphic cell group known. (Evidence for a Biological Influence on Male Homosexuality", 20)   
Since then, however, homedomains have been found in many other proteins with varying degrees of similarity. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 38)   
The source of the emerging epidemic was soon traced to a food supplement that included meat and bone meal from dead sheep. ("The Prion Diseasses", 30)   
Since the 1940s, actin and myosin had been known as the major proteins of skeletal muscle. ("The Machinery of Cell Crawling", 58)

In the following set of examples, however, the use of the passive is directed to the mitigation of FTAs, which involve criticism, the recognition of shortcomings, the lack of answers, or the suggestion that more research is needed in a particular direction.

But no significant variations in the protein coding sequences were found. ("Evidence for a Biological Influence on Male Homosexuality", 25)   
Only a superficial answer can be given at present. (\*The Molecular Architects of Body Design") 38)   
But only at the level of molecular pattern can the developmental convergence of such different embryos be seen. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 42)   
A number of drugs already on the market have been found by chance to work by altering the activity of transcription factors. (Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 45)   
As time goes by, the precise combination of transcriptions factors that regulate individual genes is sure to be identified. ("Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 45)   
Stabilization of a complex might be achieved by deploying molecules that would strengthen the interaction between activators and DNA or beetween activators and coactivators. (Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 45)

Whatever the case, we can observe that the distancing, impersonalizing nuances put forth by the use of the passive voice are related, in all cases, to the activities of the esoteric scientific community and are a linguistic realization of the deference system of interaction which we mentioned above.

4.2.1.2 Impersonal verbs. Another impersonalizing device found profusely in the texts is the use of verbal expressions in which the subject carrying out the action has been replaced by the impersonal pronoun "it' plus a periphrastic verbal expression. These cases tend to be instances in which a claim is made about a new issue or approach, or an old claim is contradicted or reformulated. By using .this distancing device, the writer varies to different degrees his or her commitment to the truth of the proposition being expressed. And in all cases, the claims sound rather less committal than their (personal) subject+verb equivalents. By thus mitigating his/her statements, the writer is saving both his/her own face and that of the members of the esoteric community with whom he might be disagreeing or whose claims he might be contradicting. Other set of cases are those in which the writer by means of agent deletion distances him/herself from the outcome (positive or negative) of the scientific research under discussion or the activities involved in the research process itself.

# : Mitigated claims

It is now clear that plant and animal cells, in common with microbes, sometimes employ the antisense strategy to control gene expression. But back then, workers were still trying to find out whether their hypothesis was correct. (The New Genetic Medicines", 51)

It may be that linkage of activators to enhancers causes DNA to bend in a way that brings the enhancers close to one another and to the core promoter. (Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 44)

It soon became apparent that human sigma factors might not exist or might not take the same form as they do in bacteria. ("Molecular Machines that Control Genes", 40)

That work made it possible to isolate the gene and to establish that it resides not in prions but in the chromosomes of hamsters, mice, humans and all other mammals that have been examined. ("The Prion Diseases", 33)

Nevertheless, it is tempting to believe that proteins made in the cytoplasm are degraded by proteasomes and transported by TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum.. (How Cells Process Antigens", 49)

# : Distancing from the research process or outcome

The death of clones made it extremely difficult to repeat experiments and made many experiments impossible to perform. ("Ancient DNA", 62)

It seemed likely that the isolated clones had error in them at these positions, but because it was so difficult to obtain clones form the quagga skin, there was no practical way to go back. ("Ancient DNA", 62-63)

It is often the case in biology that bizarre defects in odd organisms contain the clues to solving important problems. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 36)

At the time, there was no reason to suspect that somatic cells (those involved in sexual reproduction) would have this machinery. ("Targeted Gene Replacement", 38)

4.2.1.3 Replacement of the pronoun I and you by indefinites. In line with the use of impersonal verbs and expressions we find another device whose function is that of weakening the commitment of the writer to the truth of the proposition being stated. The indefinite pronoun one impersonalizes FTAs, and has a significant effect of point of view distancing. The writer depersonalizes him/herself becoming one with the whole esoteric community, thus giving his/her claims more universality by making them a part not only of his/her experience --and therefore responsibility-- but that of the community as a whole.

If the disease were having a nonspecific destructive effect, one would have suspected otherwise. ("Evidence for a Biological Influence on Male Homosexuality", 22)

Ideally one would accomplish this swap by completely replacing the HOM gene of a fly with its Hox homologue. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 41)

The infections were thought to be caused by a slow-acting virus, yet no one had managed to isolate the culprit. ("The Prion Diseases", 32)

4.2.1.4 State the FTA as a general rule. According to B & L if you state an FTA as a general rule, you mitigate it since you dilute the object of the criticism, directive etc. by adressing it not to him or her particularly but to the class of people (be it gender, race, profession, hobby etc) they might belong to. To summarize, you impersonalize it by making it general. We have found that most of the mitigations of this kind pursue that impersonalization goal which is a constant in scientific discourse. When the authors make claims about past, present or future achievements or shortcomings or when they wish to critizise the particular attitude of a sector of the scientific community, they refer to this group by naming the class of scientists to which they belong. As we have emphasized in different parts of this paper, it is obvious that scientific endevours, past findings or future paths of research, are not seen as the property of given individuals but as the foundation of knowledge on which the community rests. Once again we see how it is the face of the esoteric community the one the author is redressing by making the following claims:

Biologists therefore despaired of ever being able to check their conclusions against the historical record, as paleontologists do. ("Ancient DNA", 60)

Molecular evolutionists who were keen on time travel therefore found themselves in a distressing situation. ("Ancient DNA", 63)

Researchers have long sought within the human brain some manifestation of the most obvious classes into which we are divided --male and female. ("Evidence for a Biological Influence on Male Homosexuality", 20)

Investigators have shown that the homedomain region of the HOM proteins is the part that directly interacts with the DNA binding sites. ("The Molecular Architects of Body Design", 38)

Later many scientists were similarly dubious when my colleagues and I suggested that these "proteinaceous infectious particles" ... could underlie inherited, as well as communicable, diseases. ("The Prion Diseases", 30)

Many molecular immunologists and protein chemists are still trying to understand more precisely what determines those affinities. ("How Cells Process Antigens", 47)

Workers can deduce many steps involved in biological phenomena without ever finding the genes involved. But without isolating those genes, they cannot make progress at the molecular level. Notably, they cannot determine the nature of the proteins encoded by the mutated genes, nor can they identify the cells in which the genes are active. (Targeted Gene Replacement", 34)

4.2.1.5 Nominalize. This is by far the most common impersonalization strategy used in the texts. In this respect, it is useful to point out B & L's comments: " .. in English, degrees of negative politeness (or at least formality) run hand in hand with degrees of nounniness, that is formality associated with the noun end of the continuum.... The more nouny an expression, the more removed an actor is from doing or feeling or being something: instead of the predicate being something attributed to an actor, the actor becomes an attribute of the action. As far as FTAs are concerned, with the progressive removal of the active 'doing' part of an expression, the less dangerous it seems to be --it is not objects that are dangerous, it is their trajectories". (1978: 212-213) This strategy fits in very well with the goal of scientific writing. We pointed out how the different authors try to generalize, to focus on the object rather than the subject and so on, in an attempt to make past findings, future lines of research the property not of individuals but of the whole esoteric community.

4.2.2.1 Use of hedges: According to B & L "... a hedge is a particle, word or phrase that modifies the degree of membership of a predicate or noun phrase in a set; it says of that membership that it is partial or true only in certain respects, or that it is more true and complete than might perhaps be expected' (1978: 150). We observe that the use of hedges is frequent in the sections in which new or untested claims are being put forth. The writer hedges these claims thus weakening his or her commitment to the truth of the expressed proposition. If they are not proved accurate his or her responsibility is lessened by the way in which they were formulated. Hedges highly contribute to the tentative nature of scientific discourse. The aim of the writer is not to force his readers to have to believe necessarily in what he does or defend the same claims he is putting forth.

Such proteins can draw the attention of the immune system to diseased cells, and so elimination of their genes presumably helps cancer cells evade immune destruction. (The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 56)

If the theory were correct, it would mean the majority of cells in a tumor would carry the same defects. That being the case, therapy capable of counteracting one or more of those defects would be effective against all, or a great majority of the cancer cells. ("The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 53)

Gelsolin is a normal extracellular constituent of the body. Its administration to the airways should theoretically be nontoxic and should not evoke an immune response. (\*The Machinery of Cell Crawling", 63)

Yet in the absence of a virus, this hypothesis looks to be untenable. "The Prion Diseases", 34. Perhaps a more cogent reason, however, is that, inmediately after their synthesis, the class II subunits associate with a third molecule, called the invariant chain, or Ii. (How Cells Process Antigenes", 49)

4.2.2.2 Be pessimistic. B & L state that "This strategy gives redress to H's negative face by explicitly expressing that the conditions for the appropriateness of S's speech act obtain' (1978: 178). We have to remember that the most commom speech act found in scientific reading is the making of claims, with which the audience might agree or disagree. It is that possible disagreement, and thus the subsequent contradiction of his/her readers beliefs that it implies, what the writer is trying to redress by being pessimistic about the likelihood of his/her claims. Once again the writer tries not to coerce the reader. S/he leaves ways open for outcomes different from the one he is predicting. However, this is not a very frequently found strategy. The writers are more prone to hedging their opinions about future results than to showing themselves openly pessimistic about their outcome.

As might be expected of any emerging technology, many difficulties still have to be resolved before the full promise ofthe antisense strategy can be realized. (The New Genetic Medicines"' 53)

Regrettably, though we do not yet know which gene or genes in the lost chromosome are most important to the progression. ("The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 56)

As yet, there is no strong evidence, that mutation of ras $p 5 3$ and DCC must happen in any particular order for a polyp to become cancerous .. (The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 55)

In spite of these encouraging findings study of colon cancer has a major analytical limitation. ("The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 55)

Questions remain. ("The Genetic Basis of Cancer", 57)

# 5. Conclusions

The use of strategies observed in the texts confirms the hypothesis we formed above regarding the tension between establishing of solidarity and maintaining of deference that the specialized writer of a POP would have to display and which would embody the relationship that s/he wants to foster between him/herself and the exoteric and esoteric communities respectively. It is interesting to see that all the positive politeness strategies which, following Scollon & Scollon (1995) we have termed the displaying of involvement can be subsumed under the heading create or claim common ground. The main communicative function of popularizations is to make the members of the exoteric community feel a part of the esoteric one, and this is achieved in the text by emphasising those things that the members of both may have in common namely a common: a set of moral values, the sharing of the difficulties inherent in performing any sort of task or job, ... and, also making the presence of the readers felt in the texts by adopting a conversational mode that is an indication that the writer is very much aware of the final destination of what s/he is producing. The writer attempts to make science more human, to incorporate feelings and emotions to the aseptic world of laboratories and data and to project him/herself as a fellow human being aware of the needs of others. This is probably the main difference between SA and POP, because according to Myers (1988) personal emotions and feelings are absent from SA.

The face of the esoteric group is redressed by the massive use of negative politeness strategies which help convey that sense of deference. These emphasize the value of D, which confers the esoteric community a place of its own within the whole scientific community. As we have seen, there are two groups of strategies related to this communicative function. The first one is that which focuses on impersonalization. What we have to take into consideration is that in scientific discourse it is the results -note that the device with a higher percentage of usage is nominalization- that are important not the processes or the people who bring them about. Besides in POP which do not make new claims but merely review the most important contributions to the field, claims -discoveries, contributions-- are not seen as belonging to individuals any longer but to the general knowledge which is the foundation and the property of the whole scientific community. Therefore impersonalization devices play a central role at this particular level of the interaction. Also, when the writer expresses his opinion not about the past but about the future, we find the constant presence of devices related to the strategy Don't coerce H. give him options. These are found especially in the closing sections when writers talk about new lines of research or express their opinions of the results of those which are currently being developed. It is in those sections, and also when writers criticise the work of other colleagues, when they tend to use many hedges which confer their discourse tentativeness. This communicates the reader that s/he is not being coerced into agreeing with the writer, but is left with his/her own room for interpretation. These hedges are also found along with some pessimistic expressions about the future or success of the line defended or followed by the writer.

The above conclusions hopefully will, apart from describing some of the differences found between SA and POP, help establish the notion that matters of genre need not only be discussed from a formal standpoint. The configuration and contents of texts can largely be explained in terms of the writer/reader interaction they embody. Politeness theory presents itself as the right tool for such an endeavour.

# RHETORICAL RELATIONS AND SUBORDINATION IN L2 WRITING

KATJA PELSMAEKERS, CHRIS BRAECKE University of Antwerp (UFSIA) RONALD GELUYKENS University of Minster

# Abstract

This paper investigates the way rhetorical relations can be expressed through subordination devices, and particularly how English L2 writers' insufficient exploitation of these devices may result in 'choppy' prose. Two types of written L2 data are examined: business letters and student essays, both written by Dutch L1 speakers. We concentrate on two phenomena in particular: (i) 'integration' of rhetorically related sentences through subordination (e.g. "I cannot send you these letters, since they are confidential'); (ii) 'explication' of these rhetorical relations through sentence connectives (e.g. "These letters are confidential. Therefore, I cannot send them to you'). It is shown that L2 writers regularly fail to make sufficient use of these linguistic devices to signal explicitly the type of rhetorical relation involved, in other words that they produce under-integrated and/or under-explicated prose. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is transfer, not from the writers' L1 (in fact, this is unlikely), but rather from the spoken discourse mode to the written one.

# 1. Introduction

Learning to write in a second language implies the training of many specific skills. This involves paying attention to basic requirements of written text, viz. correctness, coherence, cohesion and ease of processing.' This paper will discuss a particular skill, i.e. the use of subordination, which especially contributes to cohesion and ease of processing. We will argue that practising the use of subordination should not merely be a question of building grammatically correct sentences, but can be learned as a conscious option in cohesive text-building.

Our discussion of subordination as a tool for building cohesive text was motivated by observations in a range of empirical data drawn from L2 student writing and L2 professional letters. We often noticed that passages or entire texts had a fragmented or "choppy" character, which we related to the writers'tendency of making clauses independent rather than integrating them in a clause complex, or to their use of coordination rather than subordination. Comparisons with more felicitous L2 versions in the data suggested that an increased use of subordination could be of help to improve the quality of these texts.

Support for these views was found in the literature. A quantitative study by Biber (1988) suggests that native English written genres similar to our L2 data show a higher occurrence of adverbial subordinators than of either sentence-initial connectives (therefore, furthermore etc.) in independent clauses or coordinating conjuncts. A study by Hannay and Mackenzie (1990) found that Dutch L2 writers of English fairly consistently underuse right-subordination, and often resort to putting relatively unimportant information in independent clauses, to the detriment of text quality.

We further argue that learning to improve text quality by means of using more subordination should go hand in hand with an increased awareness of pragmatic and textual factors underlying the production and interpretation of written text. In this paper we focus on the role of rhetorical relations or coherence in text. The complicating aspect of linear information development in connection with the use of subordination in L2-writing will be discussed in Braecke, Geluykens and Pelsmaekers (forthcoming).

In the following section we will briefly go into the relationships between written text, coherence and subordination. Next we will explain what we mean by the notions of integration and explication as writers' options to signal rhetorical relations. After that we will discuss how these options were realized and might be optimalised in excerpts drawn from c. 90 L2 student summaries and $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { L } 2$ business letters. The latter section constitutes the core of this paper.

We should like to end the present section with a final word about our data. Our choice of student summaries was inspired by the need to limit the variability of writers' goals. Since we relate text to pragmatic factors (the writer's communicative goals and the intended effect on the reader), we need a way to back up our interpretations of the texts independently of the texts themselves. As we did not have any direct access to the writers' thoughts, we found support for our interpretation of the conceptual make-up of the summaries in the original text. In this way have tried to avoid the danger of mistaking coherence problems for formulation deficiencies. The former "educational' part of our data is balanced by a virtually equal number of naturally occurring texts, L2 business letters, which form part of a larger electronic corpus of professional and institutional discourse at UFSIA (the ACID-corpus; for a more detailed discussion of its design see Geluykens & Van Rillaer 1995). It comprises a fairly large number of business letters in native Dutch, native English and non-native English and its design was specifically meant to allow for the observation of interlanguage phenomena.

# 2. Aspects of making sense

# 2.1 Rhetorical relations

A first step towards improving writing skills is, in our view, a reconsideration of what we do when we write and read text. In this section we will show how the basic insights from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988, 1992; Matthiessen & Thompson 1988; Thompson & Mann 1987) can be useful for both teacher and L2-user to understand these issues better. Although RST is first and foremost a universalist theory about the structure of written discourse, and has been mainly been used in empirical studies outside the educational context (for references see Mann & Thompson 1988), it has also previously been used as a tool for analyzing student writing by O'Brien (1992,1995) and Pery-Woodley (1989).

Rhetorical Structure Theory differs from most "traditional" approaches to text and clause linking in that it does not start from any particular linguistic coding in text. Rather it sets out from the assumption that writers have certain communicative goals and intend certain effects on readers. It further assumes that readers can interpret these goals globally (the function of the text) and locally (the function of the different parts contributing to the global goal). Thus the analysis of written text takes interpretative phenomena as its point of departure and works its way from there to looking at how these goals and interpretations can be linked to codings in text.

A first claim made by RST is that readers nearly always look for more and less central parts in a text, and that this process recurs on various levels in the text. Writers structure their texts with these intended effects in mind. The levels on which these phenomena are found range from the text as a whole over subsections and paragraphs to clauses. Judgements about what is central or nuclear in text is essential for comprehending text, and are made by readers as part of the general cognitive tendency to impose structure reflecting centrality and supplementarity on certain types of perceptual input (Matthiessen & Thompson 1988:290).

Further, on a particular level under consideration, readers interpret the relationship of a nuclear part of the text to a supplementary part as a rhetorical relation. The perception of these rhetorical relations is at the basis of the perception of the text's coherence. On the level of relations between clauses, functional grammar-based approaches have a somewhat similar notion of 'logico-semantic relations' (Halliday 1985:193; Martin 1992:170), 'functional-semantic relation' (Halliday 1985:193), 'conjunctive relation' (Halliday & Hasan 1976:227). The difference is not merely a terminological one: in RST these relations are not only interpreted in terms of relations between clauses and the propositions they convey, but are always defined in terms of writers' goals and intended effects on the reader. In addition, they are not only identified between clauses (inside clause complexes or between sentences), but are found throughout discourse, on various text levels. Nearly all texts? can be broken down into pairs of non-overlapping spans between which such rhetorical relations are seen to hold. The more central span with respect to the writer's goals is termed the Nucleus, and the ancillary span is termed the Satellite (Thompson & Mann 1987:81).

For many rhetorical relations, the intended effect is that the reader recognizes the relation in question. They are what we might call a predominantly "semantic" subgroup of relations, and include various causal, conditional, elaborative, sequential and other relations. They are understood as related in the subject matter, and at clause level, most resemble the relations linked to inventories of linguistic forms by the grammar approaches mentioned above. This may be useful for our purposes since we are eventually interested in linguistic form. Yet as we have already suggested, the "detour" we make by way of RST has its reasons. Unlike the grammar-approaches it provides us with a strategy to motivate perceptions of and amendments to deficient form through discourse arguments which are not directly related to particular form.

In addition, RST identifies other relations, which are intended \*to increase some inclination in the reader, such as the desire to act or the degree of positive regard for, belief in, or acceptance of the nucleus" (Mann & Thompson 1988:257). They could be labeled as predominantly "pragmatic". These comprise Enablement (increasing the reader's potential ability to perform an action presented in the nucleus), Motivation (increasing the reader's desire to perform an action presented in the nucleus) and so on. It may be significant that we do not find these relations in the approaches based on linguistic code, in that these relations may resist overt coding in English.

In section 2.3 we will return to the RST insights and try to make them more operational with respect to the discussion of our data. In the section below, we will go into the question of how we can connect these rhetorical relations to coding in language.

# 2.2 Linguistic coding: connectives and subordination

Readers make nuclearity judgements independently of particular functional signals. Neither is the precise rhetorical "value"' of the relation (causal, conditional, sequential etc.) dependent upon particular signals. This is illustrated by example (1):

(1a) These letters are confidential.   
(1b) I cannot send them to you.

The adjacency of this pair is enough for readers to assume that (a) and (b) are meaningfully related (cf the notion of asyndetic relations in Quirk 1985:1472). The core of the message, i.e. the most consequential part of the text is in (b): the letters are not sent. (a) helps, in some way, to make (b) more acceptable, by Justifying, in Mann & Thompson's terms, the assertion made through (b). However, (a) and (b) figure as two independent clauses in the text, so that we find no grammatical emblem of their hierarchical relation in discourse terms. Neither is there a connective signalling just how (a) and (b) are related.

Recognizing that the interpretation of relations is not dependent upon explicit functional signals, RST also accounts for the occurrence of these signals in language. It argues that the pervasiveness of hierarchical discourse structures has led to the development of main clause - subclause structures on the one hand, and the variety of connectives on the other. Subordination is seen as a grammaticalization of nuclearity in discourse (Matthiessen & Thompson 1988), while the panoply of connectives that English and most languages have find their roots in the meanings conveyed by rhetorical relations. Subordination and connectives are thus linguistic resources that English has to make these discourse structures more visible and explicit.

Why then are relations sometimes left uncoded, as in the example above? First, not all of these relations are necessarily grammaticized in English. The more than 20 different rhetorical relations identified by Mann & Thompson (1988 for an overview, 1992 for a detailed application in analysis) are seen as a universal open-ended set of fundamental relations that may be grammaticized or not in a particular language. In English, for instance, no particular coding elements have been identified to co-occur with relations of evidence and motivation.

Second, as we have shown earlier, this functional coding is not necessary for the comprehension of discourse structures. It is rather a stylistic option that the writer has to make his/her text more transparent, or more cohesive. This effect will be discussed in relation to notions of integration and explication in section 3.

# 2.3 L2-writing and RST

We are now faced with the question of how we can make the concepts of nuclearity and rhetorical relations operational for a discussion of L2-writing. As it stands, RST provides the analyst with many precise definitions of relations that allow for a very detailed conceptual analysis of written text. But as we have indicated above, it makes no statements about how this conceptual structure is linked to code, other than the general statement that some of these discourse structures find their reflection in grammatical structure and functional elements.

Our present concern with L2-writing, on the other hand, was motivated by perceived deficiencies in the coding of the discourse structure. In other words, we are concerned with strategies to make perceived coherence even more visible. Indeed, whereas most writing in our corpus could be analysed in terms of nuclearity and rhetorical relations, we found that L2-writers did not always make it easy for us to do that, i.e. their lack of skill in coding often made the texts incohesive and difficult to process.

How can RST concepts help us then? First of all, it sharpens the awareness that skilled writers think in terms of effects on readers. Readers can comprehend text if they are able to find central and supplementary parts in text, and writers can help them by making these structures as transparent as possible. On the sentence level, this maximum transparency can be achieved by coding nucleus-satellite structures in main clause - subclause grammatical structures, and by using appropriate connectives. A more detailed inventory of options can be found in section 3.

RST further makes it clear that writers have a (pre-theoretical) knowledge of what the relations are between the parts of the texts they write. Stimulating writers to spell out the nature of these relations could therefore help them to look consciously for an appropriate coding element. It is likely that writers will come up with meaning categories that are less sophisticated than those of Mann & Thompson. The categories will likely be fewer and broader; but this is, in our view, not immediately an objection. Indeed, the categories need to be instrumental in finding an appropriate coding element, and the relation categories made by linguists on the basis of available coding material in English are also broader and fewer than those proposed by RST. Halliday & Hasan (1976:242-243) come up with just four broad categories: additive, adversative, causal and temporal. Halliday (1985:306-307) has eight: opposition, clarification, addition, variation, spatiotemporal, manner, causal-conditional, matter. Each of these relation categories offers entry points into grammatical structures and connectives.

The virtue of RST is that it provides the foreign language learner and teacher with a general strategy to analyse his/her own text in a pragmatic and conceptual way. Importantly, the writer or teacher can approach his or her foreign language text in very much the same way as they would their own language. In other words, learners are handed a tool that is not dependent upon their level of proficiency, but that is additional to it.

# 3. Aspects of making text

# 3.1 Integration or isolation

As we pointed out earlier, writers have certain communicative goals in mind when they write. They may want to make certain assertions and give reasons or evidence for them, or they may want to make requests and motivate these. There are many other possibilities, but in all these cases writers are then faced with the fact that written messages are packed in clauses and that one or more clauses are presented as sentences. Before writers can make decisions about coordination or subordination (see 3.1 below), or about connectives (see 3.2 below), a precondition for any successful arrangement must be met. Indeed, the presence and hierarchy of textual relations should be reflected in the writer's choice of sentence boundaries. This preliminary choice is about an obvious but often neglected point in actual writing: clauses combined within one sentence are an icon signalling that the messages in these clauses belong more closely together than a message, say in a following clause in a separate sentence. Consider the following example from Quirk et al. (1985:1472)

(2ai)He ate too much for dinner.   
(2aii)  and he was ill the next day.   
(2aiii) He decided to be less greedy in the future.

Let us paraphrase Quirk et al.'s comments on the example quoted above: (i) and (ii) together bear a causal relationship to (iii), so that the combination of (i) and (ii) into one sentence makes it transparent for the reader that (i) and (ii) together form a satellite of the nucleus (iii). A comparison with (2b) below clearly shows the advantage of combining. On the sentence level, a presentation in which (ii) seems to be equally important as both (i) and (iii) is slightly misleading. Even if compensatory signals on other levels are available, the role of choosing appropriate sentence boundaries remains crucial. This can be seen in (2c), where an explicit connective in (ii) improves this version by making it more explicit, but the basic 'choppy' impression remains, for what could be called a lack of suitable inter-sentence level text organization.4

(2bi) He ate too much for dinner.   
(2bii) He was ill the next day.   
(2biii) He decided to be less greedy in the future.   
(2ci) He ate too much for dinner.   
(2cii)  As a result he was ill the next day.   
(2ciii) He decided to be less greedy in the future.

Judgements about the what the "best' option is are always textually inspired and the preceding examples are therefore only a poor substitute for the reality of the writers' decisions, which must minimally be informed by their intentions on the paragraph level.5

Having considered rhetorical relations as a motivation for the choice of sentence boundaries, we can now also formulate the matter of clause combining in terms of general perceptual effects. The effect of combining clauses into clause complexes will be called integration, while leaving a clause to constitute a sentence on its own will be called isolation. Phrasing it this way might enable writers to become immediately and intuitively aware of the effect they create on the reader when the latter is presented with a particular clause arrangement. Verhagen (1991), in a discussion of this effect in Dutch writing (which is basically the same), makes a comparison between isolation and integration in dialogic terms. In the case of a full stop between two message blocks it is as if writers leave readers room for reaction, as if they are offering them a turn. In the case of integration of two clause messages in one sentence there is no such room for a potential turn. Putting it in these terms, writers, when judging the quality of their product, could ask themselves the question whether this is indeed the effect they intended to create with their readers.

In sum, concerning integration and isolation, our views and their consequences can be made explicit as follows:

(1) Choosing sentence boundaries is a basic operation in writing, enabling readers to discover rhetorical organization; (2) Probably, similar to writers' decisions on rhetorical relations, this is again largely a language-independent, cognitively inspired series of decisions. In other words, non-native writers of English can be helped by raising their awareness of general language-independent strategies that do not depend on their level of proficiency in English; (3) There is no automatic rule for grouping clauses into sentences. In the same way that readers can sometimes analyze the relations in a writer's text meaningfully in more than one way, writers may have several relations at their disposal to express broadly the same state of affairs. Moreover, even to express one single relation more than one arrangement could be selected (see note 5 above). It is important, however, to realize that some arrangements can make it difficult for readers to decode this part of text organization which is basic for global comprehension.

(4) The best solution will not only be inspired by coherence, but also by some of the factors quoted from Hannay and Mackenzie at the beginning of our paper, such as cohesion and ease of processing, some aspects of which are discussed under the following sections 3.2-3.4. In this light the terms integration and isolation not only refer to ways of expressing relations faithfully, but to expressing related messages in such a way that they are presented and packaged successfully for the envisaged readers and their expectations.

# 3.2 Coordination or subordination

When writers have suitably determined sentence boundaries and find they want to combine clauses, they face another decision: opting for structures of coordination or subordination. Although nuclear discourse structures are most transparently coded in main clause - sub clause structures (see 2.2 above), it is equally clear that the same relation can be expressed in several syntactic arrangements. The examples below illustrate this again:

(3ai) He ate too much for dinner. (3aii) He was ill the next day.   
(3bi) He ate too much for dinner (3bii) and he was ill the next day.   
(3ci) Because he ate too much for dinner, (3cii) he was ill the next day.

In terms of the preceding point (3b) and (3c) are integrated, whereas (3a) is not. (It is crucial to remember that this is not a question of explication. Explication and integration are two notions at different levels.) In (3b) integration is achieved by coordination, in (3c) by subordination. It has been repeated in the literature that coordinators are less specific in their expression of semantic relations. The fact that (3c) explicitly refers to the reason of the illness through because, makes it stand out from (3a), where and --perfectly comprehensible as it is here- could also serve to signal a host of other relations. This explicitness of subordinators explains why subordination is a privileged device in expository prose, where ambiguities tend to be avoided.

On the other hand, the choice between coordination and subordination can again be approached in terms of perception and message presentation. Coordination presents the conjoined clauses as two equal parts, as opposed to subordination. There the very semantic explication of the nucleus/satellite relation in the subordinating conjunction allows the subordinate clause to be more clearly perceived as the bearer of a message at the service of the core message contained in the main clause.

# 3.3 Connectives

Whereas in the traditional teaching of writing, cohesion is often narrowed down to the appropriate use of connective devices, the previous points have established that.first and foremost 1) it must be determined which clauses should go into one sentence, and 2) a choice must be made between coordination and subordination. It is only against this background that the question of explicit indication of rhetorical relations can be understood in its proper textual dimension.

In fact, subordination as the choice of a syntactic device cannot be dissociated from the semantic choice of the subordinator. Let us reconsider example (3c):

(3ci) Because he ate too much for dinner. (3cii)he was ill the next day.

Once the writer has opted for a (finite) subordinate clause to express 'cause', they cannot but select an appropriate subordinator (because, since, as). In other words, the choice of the connecting device inevitably comes after the decision to present two messages in the integrative mode of one single sentence. The latter textual dimension of message presentation has been missing in much of the established teaching, whereas we would like to stress its priority and its association with related decisions.

Apart from subordination, the two other possible arrangements have relatively simple implications for the practising writer as to the explication of relationships.

It is commonly known that coordinators (especially and as in (3b)), versatile as they are in terms of meaning, necessarily underspecify the semantic content they express in a particular environment. Expository prose therefore mostly prefers an explicit indication of semantic relation through subordination. Asyndetic ordering (as in (3a)), on the other hand, will often call for the addition of connectives to make the semantic link between separate sentences transparent (as in (2c)).

# 3.4 A note on punctuation

From the cases where prescriptive grammar allows a clause-separating comma, it will become clear that this is (A) with subordination (ignoring here any further discussion of the dependence of the comma on the position of the subclause); and (B) with coordinators (and, but, or, and for some grammarians a few short conjunctions such as yet and so, which share some of the criterial characteristics of the preceding real' coordinators).

What (A) and (B) have in common is the presence of an overt connective device. Symbolic integration of two clauses into one sentence through a comma only seems to be possible when such a device is present. Without such explicit linking device, integration seems not to be guaranteed by the comma on its own. Probably there is a clash between the conventional symbolization of belonging together (the sentence boundaries) and the absence of any content-expressing link between two clauses which look completely independent. In the normatively oriented literature this unsuccessful integration of two clauses is designated by the term 'comma splicing' '

# 4. Observations from the database

In this section we will discuss our observations from the student summaries and the business letters, arranging the phenomena along the dimensions of integration and explication.These observations will be supplemented with suggestions where we think this clarifies the issues.

# 4.1 Absence of integration and explication

In terms of both integration and explication, the most minimalistic way of signalling (or, rather, not signalling) rhetorical relations is by (A) creating two independent clauses, separated by a full stop; and (B) not using any connective device whatsoever to express the relationship between these two sentences. We have quite a few examples in our data where this appears to happen. First of all, consider (4) and (5), from the student writing and the business letters corpus respectively:

(4i) In 1982 governments agreed to limit the output of greenhouse gases.   
(4ii) These are believed to be raising the earth's average temperature.   
(4iii) Now, three years later, little change can be noticed.   
(5i) Unfortunately it would not be possible for us to answer positively to your request.   
(5ii) The nature of our business is such that business is essentially conducted by fax and by telephone.

In (4), there is a causal relationship between (ii) and (i), in that the state of affairs described in (ii) is the reason why the decision expressed through (i) was taken. Likewise, in (5), sentence (ii) expresses the reason for the negative response expressed by (i). Several options are available in English to express this rhetorical relationship, such as through a subordinator; alternative versions of (4) and (5) could be, for instance (constructed examples):

(4ai) In 1982 governments agreed to limit the output of greenhouse gases, (4aii) because they are believed to be raising the earth's average temperature. (5a) Unfortunately it would not be possible for us to answer positively to your request, (5aii) since the nature of our business is such that business is essentially conducted by fax and by telephone.

device is missing. In their article on writing Hannay and Mackenzie (1990:227-228), however, explicitly broaden their definition of comma splice to cases with conjuctions like however and therefore. Apparently, some conjunctions are perceived to lend a greater degree of independence to the clause they introduce. Therefore, they probably do not allow comma punctuation, but 'heavier' symbols, such as a full stop or a semi-colon, which are suggesting (semi-)independence. Significantly, pedagogic works (e.g. Swan 1995) unanimously disapprove of a comma before clauses introduced by however and therefore.

The database of student writing allows us to compare nearly identical excerpts, written by different students, with regard to the way rhetorical relations are expressed. Consider, first of all, instance (6):

(6i) One of the few certainties about global warming is that the costs of severely curbing emissions of greenhouse gases would be huge. (6ii) The world relies on carbon-based fuels for $9 0 \%$ of its energy needs.

Once again, we appear to be dealing here with a causal relationship between the two independent sentences, (ii) providing the reason for the proposition in (i). Further evidence that this is indeed the case, and that it is possible to integrate these two clauses and to express their rhetorical relationship more explicitly, can be found in the following three excerpts from other students. These excerpts deal with the same semantic content as (6):

(6ai) One of the few certainties is that the costs of severely curbing the emission of greenhouse gases would be huge,   
(6aii) because the world relies for $9 0 \%$ of its energy needs on carbon-based fuels.   
(6bi) As the world relies on carbon-based fuels for $90 \%$ of its energy needs,   
(6bii) the costs of severely curbing emissions now would be huge.   
(6ci) One of the few certainties about global warming is that the costs of severely curbing emissions of greenhouse gases now would be huge,   
(6cii)  because the world relies on carbon-based fuels for $90 \%$ of its energy needs.

In all three cases, this formulation clearly brings out the nucleus/satellite relationship between both parts, as well as the type of semantic relationship, which is expressed through the subordinator. Note, incidentally, that the linear order of nucleus and satellite in (6b) is different from that in the other examples. This raises questions about the importance of linearization in the creation of textual cohesion; a thorough discussion of this falls outside the scope of this paper, but see Braecke et al. (forthcoming) for a full discussion.

The majority of cases of non-integration and non-explication in our data are instances of causal relationships. This does not mean, however, that other rhetorical relations are not subject to this treatment; consider (7):

(7i) Most scientists believe that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost the temperature if other variables remain the same.   
(7ii) . The extent of the boost is not known.

Taking into account that for contextual reasons (ii) is the nucleus, the relationship between (i) and (ii) is one of concession; this could have been expressed through a connective in the following manner (but also in other ways, cf (17) in section 4.4):

(7ai) Most scientists believe that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost the temperature if other variables remain the same; (7aii)  however, the extent of the boost is not known. (constructed)

In the following sections, to allow for easy comparison, we will use examples of causal relationships wherever possible.

# 4.2 Weak integration through coordination

One rather simple option writers have to integrate two independent clauses to some extent is to create a complex coordinated sentence using and as a coordinating conjunct. Consider, for instance, the following excerpt:

(8i) We announce you (sic) that we can agree with the shortage of the quantity of the meat dispatched (8ii) and allow you hereby to deduct the sum of XXX DM from our PBG.

Compared to the \*non-integrated' option described in the previous section, such coordination at least brings out the fact that some rhetorical relationship exists. What it does not bring out, of course, is the nature of this rhetorical relationship --in this case, once again a causal one: the fact that the writer agrees with the valuation of the meat shortage mentioned provides the reason for allowing the addressee to pay less, as stated in (ii). An alternative could have been:

(8ai) We announce you (sic) that we can agree with the shortage of the quantity of the meat dispatched; : (8aii) therefore, we allow you hereby to deduct the sum of XXX DM from our PBG.

Apart from the fact that such coordination does not specify the rhetorical relationship, another problem with this strategy is that it suggests that the two coordinated clauses are on an equal footing. In other words, it does not signal explicitly which is the satellite and which is the nucleus, but rather treats them as having equal status in terms of textual coherence. Subordination through because, for instance, would have brought this nucleus versus satellite relationship out more clearly.

Below is another example of weak integration through and and of a causal relationship, also from the business letters data; this is a letter from a student who is applying for an educational exchange programme between Belgium and the United States:

(9i) In the future, I plan to focus on international political and economic relations (9ii) and I would like to continue my studies in a foreign country.

In this case, the writer's reason for wanting to continue his studies in a foreign country is given in the first part, viz. the fact the in the future he plans to focus on international relations. Two alternative versions which preserve the linear arrangement of the two sentences could be:

(9ai) In the future, I plan to focus on international political and economic relations, (9aii) so I would like to continue my studies in a foreign country.   
(9bi) In the future, since I plan to focus on international and political and economic relations, (9bii) I would like to continue my studies in a foreign country.

In (9a) the rhetorical relationship is expressed through a coordinating conjunct (paratactically), whereas in (9b) it is expressed through a subordinator (hypotactically). The latter version makes the nucleus/satellite relationship more explicit.

We ought to point out that, despite the lack of integration and explication inherent in such coordination, it does at least suggest some rhetorical link, since the two parts are not presented in isolation, as was the case with the examples in the previous section. Furthermore, this strategy does have the potential advantage that it does not commit the writer to specifying the precise rhetorical relationship between the two parts, while at the same time suggesting that they at least 'belong together' in some way. In cases where the writer is unsure about whether or how to express the rhetorical relationship, they can thus be used as a kind of 'bailing out strategy'.

Finally, we need to point out that some of the coordinations in the data are of a slightly different type:

(10i) Environmentalists are dismayed.   
(10ii) They want to save the world from global warming   
(10iii) and therefore they made the world governments agree to bring down the emission of greenhouse gases (...).

In this instance, we have a combination in (iii) of the semantically empty coordinator and and a second connective, therefore, which expresses a causal relatonship. Since this latter connective already does the job of integrating (ii) and (ii), the conjunct and appears to be superfluous in this context.

# 4.3 Weak integration through punctuation

A very similar strategy to the one discussed in the previous section is the one in which the writer uses punctuation to suggest some degree of integration between two clauses. In most cases, the integration method is a comma, as in (11) below:

(11i) For $90 \%$ of our energy needs we rely on carbon-based fuel, (11ii) the cost of a switch to non-polluting alternatives would be huge and would cut people's living-standards.

We can compare this example to (6) in section 4.1 above. As we saw there, clause (i) expresses the reason for the proposition in (ii). Compared to (6), instance (11) creates an impression of - weak - integration, in that the two parts are now conjoined in what looks like one single complex clause. However, this strategy also has obvious shortcomings. Most importantly, from a discourse perspective, it does not express the type of rhetorical relationship nor the nucleus/satellite relation between (i) and (ii). Also, from a syntactic viewpoint, such a formulation is in fact ungrammatical, since one is not supposed to coordinate two clauses through a comma. When one wants to coordinate two clauses, we need a coordinating conjunct, as a comma itself cannot perform this function (see section 3.4). What we are dealing with here is the so-called 'comma splice' (cf. section 3.4; see Hannay & Mackenzie 1990; McDermott 1990), a use of the comma for integration purposes which is not regularly used in English. It is worth pointing out that Dutch appears to be more tolerant with regard to the grammatical acceptability of such comma splices.

Another instance from the student essays, where we can once again compare several versions of the same piece of text, can be found in (12) to (14) below:

(12i) Scientists are still uncertain about the extent of global warming,   
(12ii) they still understand little about the world's climate.   
(13i) Firstly, science is still very uncertain about the extent of global warming   
(13ii) because it still doesn't understand the climate, which depends on manyvariables. (14i) Because they still understand little about the world's climate,   
(14ii) scientists are still uncertain about the extent..

If one compares the version in (12), which weakly integrates the two parts through a comma, to (13) and (14), which both integrate them more fully, the difference is striking: the latter versions bring out the nucleus versus satellite relationship, as well as specify the causal relation between (i) and (ii).

Although weak integration through punctuation usually takes the form of a comma, we do find occasional occurrences of a colon serving the same purpose; e.g.:

(15i) When, at the Berlin conference the environmentalists evaluate the results of the Rio agreement on the output of greenhouse gases,   
(15ii) they are dismayed:   
(15ii) no progress has been made.

We are once again dealing with a causal relationship here, (ii) expressing the reason for (ii). Although the colon does suggest some kind of rhetorical link, it does not specify what that link is. Note that, unlike the instances with a comma, this formulation is at least grammatically acceptable. The problem with a colon, however, is that it appears to be reserved in English for very restricted types of rhetorical link, such as the one which Mann & Thompson (1988) label 'elaboration'. Note that according to some (Lemmens and Parr 1995) in Dutch the use of a colon appears to be less restricted in terms of rhetorical relations; we could thus be dealing with transfer from the Dutch writers' L1 here.\*

# 4.4 Explication without integration

In a number of instances, L2-writers have found some way to explicate the rhetorical nature of the relationship between text portions they found relevant, but they have not syntactically coded the asymmetrical relation between nucleus and satellite. A clear illustration is found in the following:

(16i) It is also certain that reducing the polluting emission of carbon based fuels will cost very much. (16ii) Because over $90 \%$ of the world's energy needs are served by it.

Nucleus (i) and satellite (ii) are both coded by what looks like independent clauses. Although the writer has expressed the semantic relationship of (ii) to (i) by using because, and the causal relationship can therefore not be ignored, the coding is slightly confusing here. The writer has given (ii) equal weight to (i) by assigning it to a syntactic form on a par with that of (i). Yet from a communicative perspective it is clear that (i) and (ii) do not assume the same central position in the text as a whole: in a text about the pros and cons of curbing emissions of carbon-based fuels (i) without (ii) is immediately relevant, but (ii) without (i) is much less topical, even if because is deleted. The text quality will thus benefit if this difference is also shown in the syntactic coding of the message.

This is clearly a case where it might be seductive to apply mechanical grammar and punctuation rules: 'because introduces a subordinate clause of reason, separated from its main clause by a comma'. Yet working from a discourseperspective could enhance the writer's understanding of what is going on in text and as such facilitate the access (consciously and unconsciously) to selections from the lexico-grammar.

In other instances, the nature of the relationship between clauses is expressed only very weakly, by means of connectives that, in terms of prescriptive grammar and punctuation, would allow for independent clauses. Yet from a discourse perspective (and in terms of style) these solutions are not always optimal. Consider the following fragment:

(17i) There is uncertainty about the extent of global warming.   
(17ii) Most scientists agree that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost temperatures.   
(17iii) But the extent of this boost is widely disputed.

In the text that served as a basis for this summary, the writer's main point was that the extent of global warming as a result of carbon dioxide is still uncertain. The student producing the above summary version somehow understood this: he more or less reproduced the initial topic sentence in (i), and later paraphrased it again in (iii). Syntactically, (i), (ii) and (iii) are more or less on a par, but the fact that (ili) more or less duplicates the meaning of (i) gives the proposition a special value, and sets it off against (ii). This "contrast' was also captured by the student and encoded in the adversative But at the beginning of (iii).

However, we were not very happy with this student's formulation of the summary text fragment, for the following reasons. First, in the short space of these summaries, repetition such as that of (i) and (ii) is not a very effective device to emphasize the special (central) status of the conveyed proposition. Second, but can express many kinds of contrast, opposition or incompatibility, and is therefore only weakly expressive of concession.' Third, if the central part of the message is not repeated anymore, syntactic means may be in order to emphasize the difference in communicative status between the propositions conveyed by ((i),(iii) on the one hand and (ii) on the other.

One suggestion for improvement could be to simply delete one of the repetitious clauses, (ii) or (ii). Clearly, simply deleting (iii) would not improve the text at all. On the contrary, it would entirely obscure the rhetorical relationship between (i) and (ii).

(17ai) There is uncertainty about the extent of global warming.   
(17aii)Most scientists agree that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost temperatures.

On the other hand, when we delete (i), the result is more acceptable:

(17bii)  Most scientists agree that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost temperatures.   
(17bii) But the extent of the boost is.widely disputed.

The difference between the acceptability of (17a) and (17b) may be due to the fact that the latter version has at least some kind of connective, But, be it not a very specific one. Another reason may lie in the fact that concessive satellites provide some kind of "background" against which the reader is supposed to judge the situation presentend in the nucleus more readily positive;' they may therefore be communicatively more successful when they precede the nucleus, preparing the ground, as it were, for the reader's acceptance of the situation in the nucleus. Mann & Thompson in effect found that concessive satellites typically $\mathrm { { ' } = }$ most frequently, but not exclusively) precede the nucleus (1988:256).

A further improvement of this text fragment might be obtained by using a connective that specifies the relationship between nucleus and satellite even more, and by reflecting the communicatively 'subordinate' status of the satellite by coding it in a hypotactic clause. Both these operations would result in the following:

(17cii) Although most scientists agree that big increases in carbon dioxide will boost temperatures,   
(17ciii) the extent of the boost is widely disputed.

Ultimately, whether (17b) or (17c) is selected as the best option in the text depends on a number of factors that lie outside the relationship between (ii) and (ili).

# 4.5 "Over-integration"

Interestingly, there are also a few instances in our data where some kind of rhetorical relation is suggested, by virtue of two clauses being syntactically integrated to some degree, without such a rhetorical relation being immediately apparent. In (18) below, for instance, clauses (ii) and (ii) are conjoined by the connective and:

(18i) It is regrettable that the governemnts do not want to deal collectively with the global vironmental problem.   
(18ii) It is too early to panic   
(18ii) and it is also possible that the action would pose a bigger threat to humans than does the global warming.

Even more striking examples are (19) and (20) below:

(19i) I wish you all possible success   
(19ii) and try to convince them to become a member immediately because once you are left (sic), the decision is often postponed and may be forgotten.   
(20i) Thanks for your letter dd 30 April   
(20ii) and I do understand your concern; because as a lecturer of a Flemish school we are also alert as far as the extension of the Network is concerned.

These instances, both from the business letters database, are rather peculiar attempts to 'over-integrate' two clauses through co-ordination which are rhetorically unrelated. What makes these attempts even stranger is the fact that, in both cases, we appear to be dealing with two different types of speech act: a combination of a wish and a request in (19), and of an expression of thanks and a statement in (20), respectively.

Such examples show that \*mistakes' can occur in both directions: not only do authors sometimes under-express rhetorical relations, but they also sometimes try to create an impression of integration by joining up clauses in cases where there seems little call for doing so, thereby creating rather vacuous over-integrated prose.

# 5. Conclusion

The results of our observations are briefly summarized in the table below. If we take both integration and explication as the dimensions along which phenomena are interpreted, there appear to be two possibilities for achieving the 'right' level of explicitness in expressing rheorical relations (see boldtype in Fig. 1): (i) explication through an independent connective, without integration, or (ii) integration through subordination, with the subordinating conjunct expressing the rhetorical relationship.

At the less explicit end of the spectrum, we have strategies which have no integration whatsoever (see section 4.1), which have weak explication (sections 4.2, 4.3), or which have explication without integration (section 4.4). At the other end of the scale, we have the over-integrated cases (discussed in section 4.5).

It remains to be seen what the explanation for our L2 writers' behaviour could be. One possible explanation -that it is due to insufficient command of (i) subordinating principles in English; and/or (ii) the uses of various connectives in English-- can be ruled out, given that the proficiency level of these writers is fairly high. Moreover, if that were the case, such deficiencies would show up throughout their writing, rather than merely in isolated places, as is the case here.

Another possible explanation, given that we are dealing with interlanguage data, could be that we are somehow dealing here with language transfer from the writers' Dutch L1 to their interlanguage English L2. This seems unlikely, since there is a lot of structural similarity between Dutch and English with regard to the use of subordination and connectives. One area where transfer might play a part is the over-use of the colon for integration purposes (see section 4.3), but this concerns a very specific, limited phenomenon. Moreover, it would appear that L1 writers of English regularly use the same under-integrated and/or under-explicated strategies.

Figure 1. Overview of strategies, from least to most explicit

A more tempting explanation for our writers' behaviour could be that they are to some extent making use of the spoken discourse mode in their writing. A careful look at Biber's (1988) quantitative analysis shows that this could indeed explain a few things. Curiously, it is rather the over-use of coordination than the underuse of finite adverbial subordination that could be ascribed to transfer from the spoken mode. Let us elaborate this point a bit further.

Many researchers have taken subordination as an index of structural complexity and therefore supposed that it is more commonly used in typical writing than in typical speech (Biber 1988:229) An example of such views is found in e.g. Brown and Yule (1983:15). Yet the picture is much more complex than that. Different "kinds" of subordination seem to have differing distributions across speech and writing. Non-finite (participial) clauses combined with main clauses show higher occurrences in press editorials, academic prose and professional letters than in conversation (Biber 1988:247-264). Yet in our discussion of subordination we have not explicitly referred to these "solutions" to L2 writers' deficiencies in clause combining. Indeed, in absolute figures, the occurrence of these clauses even in writing is relatively low. The type of clauses that we have discussed in a more detailed way, i.e. those containing subordinators, on the other hand, are more frequently found in conversation than in the three written genres mentioned above (ibidem). Of course, this immediately calls for some qualification. In Biber's study of conversation, what was measured was the occurrence of the subordinator. Syntactic forms (main clause-subclause structures within one sentence) cannot be readily compared in conversation and writing. It may well be that the occurrence of subordinators in conversation sometimes goes together with a prosodic break (pause) between main clause and subclause, a phenomenon that would come under our heading of"explication without integration" (see section 4.4). However, since we have no exact data on this possible phenomenon in conversation, we cannot infer anything about transfer in this particular case.

More importantly for our findings, another striking fact from Biber's study is that coordinating conjunctions (in particular and) also occur more in conversation than in writing (just like subordinators), but in conversation their number also far exceeds that of subordinators, while in the three written genres mentioned above subordinators were more frequent than coordinators. In other words, whereas subordinators are quite common in conversation (and other spoken genres) they are largely outnumbered by much less explicit connectives, while. the reverse is true for writing. In the latter, subordinators thus have a higher relative frequency than coordinators.

With Biber's quantitative findings in mind, we could now venture the qualified hypothesis that the observed lack of explication through coordination and potentially also the occasional lack of integration in our data is due to transfer from spoken modes, with which language users are most familiar. If this is indeed the case, it has far-reaching pedagogical consequences, in that teachers of writing should make learners aware of the need for more integration and explication in written English, and that this can be achieved by employing the equally familiar device of finite adverbial clauses.

# QUALITY CHOICE AND QUALITY CONTROL

GORDON TUCKER University of Wales, Cardiff

# Abstract

Taking choice, and paradigmatic relations, as the point of departure for linguistic description in no way relieves the linguist from the necessary task of constraining the grammar. This paper discusses the nature of choice in terms of the lexicogrammatical consequences and constraints which follow from any choice made. The central formalism used in systemic functional grammars, the system network, is therefore responsible not only for specifying the options available to speakers, but also the syntactic and lexical constraints which are a consequence of them. The nature of these interdependencies is illustrated through the discussion of the lexicogrammar of Quality, associated with adjectives and their structures.

# 1. Choice, consequences and constraints

The notion of choice is central to systemic functional linguistics (SFL). It is the attention given to choice -to the paradigmatic axis of linguistic organization-- that distinguishes SFL from other major theories of language. Indeed, once one decides to take a socio-functional perspective on language, one is inevitably led into the question of choice. In this chapter I first explore the notion of choice in linguistic expressions as a way of representing lexicogrammar and relate choice to consequences and constraints. I then provide some exemplification of these phenomena focusing on one area of the lexicogrammar of English, namely that of Quality, expressed through adjectives and their associated meanings and structures.

I will define choice as the availability of at least two different courses of action in a given context, where 'course of action' is taken in its widest sense. This is the potential that a given context offers. There is, of course, another sense of 'choice', which corresponds to what has been chosen. We can see this difference in examples (1) and (2).

(1) You have a choice of music to listen to. (2) What is you choice of music?

Now if we take the potential perspective we are concerned with knowledge or belief. A human agent must firstly know that there is choice, and what the choices are. If I walk to work, I must cross the river Taff running between my house and the University. As I know that there is a footbridge over the river if I cut across the fields, as well as the road bridge through the town centre, I have knowledge of a choice. If I had not learnt about the footbridge, then my choice would be effectively removed. At least as far as I am concerned. The potential is still there, but is reduced because of my ignorance of it.

Secondly, an agent must know what it means to take one course of action rather than another. What is central here are the consequences of one or other choice. In the case of my choice of route to work, the consequences are clear. The footbridge route is half the distance of the town centre route, so I would expend less energy and arrive in half the time. On the other hand, it involves walking across open fields, which means my feet will get very wet if it's raining, and in the winter it is unlit, which means that after five o'clock I would have to walk in darkness. The consequences themselves have consequences. I must get up twenty minutes earlier to take the town route or take a change of footwear if I take the footbridge route. Notice that so far these consequences are private to my own aims and objectives about how I organize my time. They can, however, easily have consequences for others. Taking the foobridge route I may arrive with sodden shoes and trouser legs, and introduce wet grass into the building. I am also signalling to others that I am being ecologically friendly by walking, rather than driving the car. Others who know of the choices open to me may therefore be affected by my choice, both by any direct consequence on them and by their interpretation of the wider significance of my choice.

Finally, there is the notion of constraint. Whichever route I take involves compulsory courses of action. For example, with either I must cross a bridge, and therefore must follow a route that includes a bridge. Furthermore, if I take the footbridge route, I must either take a longer detour to reach a footpath that joins the road on the other side, or head for the ambulance station which has an open gate leading out of the fields and towards the road. In either case, there is a busy road to cross, which can only be crossed at a number of points where the continual, fast traffic has to stop at traffic lights.

A potential choice of courses of action involves knowledge, consequences and constraints. All these factors are interrelated. The fact that any two courses of action have different consequences is what make either significant. All actions are a function of goals, especially the conscious actions of a human agent. And as individual humans are social animals, a given social group will have collective goals. Indeed many of the individual's goals are oriented towards social existence. There is often conflict between individual goals (and the courses of action through which they may be achieved) and the collective goals of the social group. The collective goals are those that are established by convention or by imposition of those who wield power. Such goals ascribe significance to the individual courses of action that are available to achieve them. They may lead to the proscription of courses of action which are otherwise possible. The taking of a proscribed course of action in this sense can lead to death, outlawing, imprisonment, fining, or simply be frowned upon. Other courses of action, where they are taken by more than one individual, lead to the establishment of groups or subgroups, where the actions are representative of group membership. -

Language is the quintessential symbolic form of human behaviour. Every utterance is, or can be interpreted as, a choice from the potential of possible utterances. Like other modes of behaviour a linguistic choice is relevant to its context. Like other modes of behaviour each linguistic utterance has consequences and involves constraints. Each linguistic utterance is goal driven and is interpretable to all those who share the same knowledge of the potential. Knowledge of potential is often assumed and attributed to the speaker whether the knowledge is shared or not. This is the same with other modes of action. If I spit in the street because I am unaware of a significant choice between spitting in public and spitting in private, then my act will be interpreted by those who claim there is a choice and that the choice is significant, and who also interpret my action as if I had a choice and knew its consequences. Similarly, if I use a double negative, this is interpreted in the same way, whether or not I am aware of the choice. In either sense, I will be judged either as being different (or inferior) because I do not know the difference, or anti-social because I do and choose to flout the convention.

Here we come to the question about what linguistics (and grammar in particular) is about. And it is here that at least one major division is encountered -a division between what I shall call biological linguistics on the one hand and social linguistics on the other. If, as in.the contemporary Chomskyan paradigm, (Chomsky 1981a, 1981b, 1995) one explores the universal constraints upon natural language systems, upon the characteristics that all natural languages have (in one form or another) then one is making a biological statement. Languages are the way they are because of the nature of the human mind, and the human mind is the way it is because of the biological structure. If one looks at a particular language and how it differs formally from any other, one is exploring the parameters in a biological paradigm. Such approaches do not concern themselves with choice, apart from stating what is possible and what is not possible. Once the functionality of language is introduced, then we are in the domain of social linguistics. Biological linguistics may state why certain representations do not occur, in terms of universal features of human languages, but that is where it stops. If something must be the case, then it has little or no social significance. Likewise, the parameters which certain languages display are socially insignificant. A speaker of language A in which the Head-Modifier order is $\mathbf { H } { \boldsymbol { \Lambda } } \mathbf { M }$ is not able to interpret the significance in language B, where the Head-Modifier order is $\mathbf { M } { \wedge } \mathbf { H }$ , simply because most other variables in language B make it clear that it is an entirely different language. A speaker of language A does not ascribe linguistic choice to a speaker of language B. Each speaks a different and mutually incomprehensible language, and that is enough. The speaker of language A may, if he or she recognizes language B, have beliefs about speakers of language B (e.g. that speakers of Arabic are all Islamic fundamentalists) but that has nothing to do with the linguistic structure of language B.

The semantic interpretability of language structure, again, has no social repercussions. The fact that any permitted representation in a language must be semantically interpretable does not necessarily extend to the value of the semantic intepretation.

What remains is what interpretations are placed on what possible utterances of a given language. In other words, what does it mean to produce utterance $s$ in the context of language A in the context of situation $C S$ in the context of culture CC? This involves what might be viewed as (a) semantics and (b) pragmatics; the value of utterance S in the context of language A is a question of semantics, whereas its value in the context of situation is a question of pragmatics.

What I shall be concerned with here is the first of these two relationships; that is with the choices in linguistic form in a given linguistic context, which correspond to choices in meaning. These are meanings that derive from the formal possibilities themselves. They are not determined by the extralinguistic context in any strict sense, for if this were the case, there would be no choice at the linguistic level. The meanings that derive from the availability of formal differences in the same context must (a) be relatively independent, and (b) possess some constancy of interpretation. That whatever alternative is selected must subsequently be interpreted in the light of its extralinguistic context is another matter. If, for example, I have no constant way of interpreting the difference between an active clause and a passive clause, then the difference cannot not be taken into consideration when I am interpreting either. If they lose their differential value, vis-a-vis each other, then the difference is not relevant to interpretation in context. The difference is carried into the pragmatic interpretative process.

One of the tasks that a linguist may decide to undertake is therefore an explication of the potential differences and their linguistic semantic value. This means observing for example, that interrogative word order at the level of form corresponds with a constant at the level of meaning. Once again, if this is not recognized, we have no way of interpreting the formal choice in the wider context.

Why should the interrogative in (3) have a different value from the imperative in (4) in the context of the act of offering?

(3) Would you like another drink.   
(4) Have another drink.

It is surely here that the contribution of the formal system interacts with the demands of the context. Why otherwise would there be different linguistic ways of realizing what is essentially the same speech act? This is not to say that the extralinguistic context does not exert influence on the linguistic choices. It may well be that in some sense all choices are predetermined, but this is another matter and a question perhaps for philosophical (and even theological) investigation.

Let us turn to consequences and constraints. The consequences of choice are twofold: (1) the wider consequences in terms of what is communicated to the addressee(s) and (2) the linguistic consequences, i.e. what can or must be done linguistically as a consequence of a choice. Constraints are present in their own right and are also related to consequences, although it is perhaps more precise to say that contraints constitute a subset of consequences.

Linguistic utterances as acts cannot but have consequences, especially if we assume that all linguistic utterances are social acts, produced in the context of social interaction. In one sense, all linguistic acts are telic; they are uttered with a purpose or intention, they have illocutionary force and they have consequences, their perlocutionary effect (cf. Austin 1963; Searle 1967). Even if we appear to be stating the obvious by saying that an utterance either brings about change or maintains the current state of affairs, this dichotomy of consequences is necessary. In terms of the interpersonal meanings -when viewing the role of language in terms of power and solidarity- it is as important to be able to maintain the status quo as it is to be able to change it.

The linguistic consequences are inherent to the linguistic system itself. If choice were open ended, there would be no basis on which to guarantee intelligibility in communication.-An open-ended plethora of signs in a semiotic system, all competing with one another paradigmatically would defeat both the maker of the message and the interpreter. And if the selection of one such sign brought about no constraint in terms of the semiotic system itself then the next choice would simply be a re-run of the first, and so on. This is not an argument against recursion, in any sense of the term. Every act has as a context the act(s) which have preceded it. Even in the most open form of linguistic recursion (coordination) the fresh start is linked either explicitly or implicitly to the previous fresh start. So if I declare,

(5) I put the milk out and two and two makes four. then, if the relevance of the juxtoposition of these two apparently related clauses cannot be found by the addressee, the utterance will simply fail as a conventional message.

There is only one type of constraint at the heart of any semiotic system, and that is, in any given context, the specification of those signs that are in opposition -and thus available to be selected in a proper act of signifying. Every grammarian's example of an ungrammatical sentence is an example of this. Thus, example (6), which raises the problem of unbounded dependencies, represents, if it is uttered, a misselection of signs in the context of requesting information.

(6) \*What did John say who did?

One may choose to decontextualize it and attempt to explain why as a linguistic representation it contravenes some principle of the universal nature of the linguistic semiotic. And indeed one may even do that in a number of ways. For example, one may say that because of the nature of the brain, and the way that it has evolved to support language, this is simply an impossible combination. Alternatively one may wish to investigate why such representations are illegal in terms of what is unversally communicatively useful. It seems to me that this second approach has not yet been considered a worthy enterprise in the mainstream generative community.

If a child is born into the world with a biologically endowed universal grammar, it can be no more than a set of intructions about the formal properties of the linguistic semiotic. This cannot be a grammar of possibility. It is simply a statement that formally you can do anything, except x, y and z. It can be claimed that a child embarking upon social interaction through language 'knows' what is possible in the formal organization and what is not possible. It will only therefore be able to do what is universally possible. This does not seem very different in essence from a child knowing that humans walk by putting one foot in front of the other in succession. Thus a child does not have to experiment with leg movements, or even learn it from other walkers. 'Illegal' ways of walking are ruled out.

It is not problematic for the systemic functional linguist to accept the findings of universal grammarians. The emphasis is entirely different. The systemic functional grammarian is concerned with constraints on representations only in the sense that they are constraints on choice. The lexicogrammar of a language imposes limitations on what speaker's can do. The relationship between the lexicogrammar and the speaker's needs is summed up by Gregory, as follows:

The grammar of a language (its form) allows the speaker to do what the speaker wants (function) but insists on how the speaker does it (symbiosis). (Gregory 1993)

As for choice, clearly one can describe the grammar of a language simply in terms of formal choices in context. One is doing this by saying that in the context of [clause] the grammatical systems [declarative], [interrogative] and [imperative] are options. To proceed solely in this way would be to describe the formal properties of a particular language as a semiotic system without reference to the use to which the signs are put. We are back to function and meaning. And if we adopt a social orientation on language we are forced into considering ultimately the meanings that a semiotic system generates. So when we say that in a context $^ { a }$ you must select between $b$ and $c$ , then it is ultimately only significant if there is some basis for the choice.

The first basis for the choice is that there is a conventional meaning attached to $^ { b }$ and $^ c$ in the context of $^ { a }$ $^ { b }$ and $c$ are things we can do' in this context and the choice in terms of consequences is understood by both the chooser and the person to whom the choice is communicated. If the choice is entirely interpretable from the wider context and adds nothing in its own right then the semiotic system is redundant. It wouldn't matter which of $^ { a }$ or $^ b$ were chosen. So the choice of $^ b$ or $^ c$ is semantically significant in terms of the linguistic context $^ { a }$ and pragmatically significant in the wider context CS. The wider context $C S$ may well impose an expected choice -the unmarked choice-- but it is still in opposition with the marked choice. In another sense options may be entirely determined by the speaker's intentions, plans, knowledge of discourse, addressee knowledge, encyclopaedic knowledge etc. This can be interpreted as 'given what my plan is and what I know about the context, I have to choose $\acute { a }$ or 'alternatively, given my plans, knowledge etc, $^ { a }$ is the choice which has the best chance of success in the performance of my act of communication'.

It is not difficult, therefore, to argue the case for a referential' semantics, for a set of conventional meanings which attach to formal representations. It may simply be the case that in the evolution of a language, differences in structure --syntactic, morphological, lexical and intonational- have come to be associated with different kinds of meaning. Most speakers associate interrogative word order in English with the notion of asking a question, even though the structure may realize acts such as an offer, an order, a request, a suggestion etc. Yet, if we lose sight of the 'referential' meaning of interrogatives, for whichever act they may realize in a given context, we are unable to say much about interrogatives and the other linguistic forms which may realize the same act.

Even the referential meanings of forms, however, cannot be identified without examining them within their contexts of use. One can only ascertain that interrogatives are related abstractly to the act of seeking information and declaratives to the act of giving information by observing there typical uses and interpretations. One might even talk about prototypical meanings for forms and representations.

It can be argued therefore that part of the grammarian's task is to identify the functional or semantic role of formal oppositions. The only problem is describing such meanings, for to do so is to use both the system itself as the metalanguage and to talk about the meanings as if they were in some sense the 'face value'. Furthermore, to what extent do we wish or perhaps need to separate the signifiant from the signifie? Explicating the meanings of linguistic forms is a traditional activity of descriptive grammar. One need only think of the range of substantial grammatical descriptions such as The Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language (Quirk et al. 1985) to understand that a description of forms and meanings go hand in hand.

The way we go about an account of any aspect of the language depends upon our goals as grammarians, or our needs as analysts. Systemic functional linguistics has a healthy tradition of textual analysis, prioritized in the approaches of its popular texts (e.g. Halliday 1994; Eggins 1994; Martin 1992 etc.). When one analyzes a text one is attempting to uncover the meanings that the text realizes in context. Clearly, even in this exercise, the object is the choices in meaning which have been made by the speaker or writer, in terms of the choices which have not been selected. The reader of the text (the intended addressee) can only understand the text in the light of the choices which he or she know to be available. Each text is referenced against the addressee's own lexicogrammar. Textual interpretation by an addressee is not a decoding process as might be carried out by an intelligence unit faced with a message written in secret code. If a text as message is to be successful it must interpretable be and therefore must assume that the addressee shares the same system.

Text is therefore a record of the instantiation of the potential to be read as a selection of meanings realized through lexicogrammatical form in terms of the value of the choices compared with the choices which could have been made but which weren't, and all this in a given context.

As I have pointed out the meanings of lexicogrammatical choices and the reasons for making such choices are two distinct sides of the communicative act. One may agree on the linguistic meaning that is realized through thematization or through the choice of a pronoun, but that will not always indicate why these choices have been made. To understand the motivation for choice one must inevitably bring into the equation all the factors in the context, including speaker and addressee goals, the models they have of one another, their knowledge of other types of organization such as discourse and genre, their knowledge of the world etc.

Such consideration become apparent when one is trying to model interactive mentalities in the computer. The Cardiff Grammar, which is illustrated in this chapter, is a large systemic functional grammar based upon choices in meaning and their lexical and grammatical reflexes (Fawcett, Tucker and Lin 1993). This represents the potential. In order to instantiate the potential, however, the chooser must have knowledge which determines which choices to make. And as systems can be described as choice points then each time any choice point is reached a decision must be made. We are back to our routes to work. I may be aware of what consequences there are of taking one or other of the routes, but this is only a small part of what is involved in making the choice.

The consideration of motivation for choice may take us well beyond the perceived domain of grammar or lexicogrammar. What I shall be concerned with here is an account of available choices and the consequences which arise from them.

# 2. Lexical and structural choice

Excluding intonation from the present discussion, we may view the linguistic choices available to be of two kinds: lexical choice where the speaker selects a lexical item which corresponds -let us say referentially-- with some entity, and structural choice, where the speaker selects one from a system of structural configurations available which corresponds with some function. In terms of meaning, however, it is a question of degree, rather than one of absolute difference. One may say that the difference between the meaning of interrogative and declarative is different from the difference between the meanings of table and chair. But we are arguing about kinds of meaning. If, as systemic functional linguists, we insist upon something like the tripartite metafunctional hypothesis (cf. Halliday 1994), then our lexicogrammatical description must incorporate the potential for experiential, interpersonal and textual meanings. And here structure and lexis are involved in all three. Choices in lexis, for example, are motivated not only experientially (e.g. man - woman) but interpersonally (e.g. man - gentleman) and textually (e.g. man - person). Similarly with structure, the patterns of transitivity are closely associated with experiential meanings, whereas mood is associated with interpersonal meanings and theme with textual meanings.

Secondly, the selection of a lexical item has consequences for other choices, both structural and lexical. Once I have selected the meaning realized through the item belong then my structural choices are different from those available through the selection of the item own. I have no potential for passivization, for example, with belong.

Similarly, structural choices have consequences for lexical and further structure choice. If I wish to passivize (i.e. present the marked participant role as the subject of the clause) then this will affect my selection of own or belong. Similarly if I wish to express a Quality as a modifier of a nominal group head, this choice will determine the range of lexical choice available. I cannot choose alight in the context an -- -- warehouse.

What these observations indicate is that if we are concerned as lexicogrammarians with choice and consequences, we cannot exclude either structure or lexis from our model. Neither can we separate them out. This in itself is reasonable justification for Halliday's notion of 'one network of lexicogrammatical options', and for the term 'lexicogrammar' itself (Halliday 1978:43).

Naturally, the construction of such a model is fraught with problems, some of which are listed below:

: lexis is in certain cases open ended.   
: lexical units and structural units are not co-extensive.   
: the manifestation of lexical difference is often only apparent in terms of the difference between one lexical item and another.   
: the meanings associated with structural difference and signalled by features in a system network have the assurance of some reflex in form.

What is important however --and this is emphasized by many corpus linguists-- is that the selection of individual lexical items has consequences, both in terms of structural and lexical co-occurrence. These may be less well perceived and understood than are the consequences of structure, but where is the cut-off point? The lexical semantics of verbs, for example, has been extensively studied, especially in recent years, and often by those working in non-functional theories (cf. Levin 1993; Levin and Pinker 1991). This is because of the important consequences for transitivity and the structure of the clause that are the outcome of verbal difference. One only need to think of the complementation patterns of verbs like know, think, believe etc. to realize that without representing them somewhere in the unified lexicogrammar the model would run into problems of inadequate description. But the fact that the consequences of lexical choice with regard to nouns and adjectives is less well understood is not reason enough to treat them any differently.

It is for this reason that over the past years I have been exploring the nature of the lexicogrammar of what I have termed the third order of lexis, that is the lexicogrammar of adjectives, or more overtly semantic terms the lexicogrammar of Quality. What I propose to present briefly here are some aspects of this lexicogrammar in terms of choice and consequences, thus the title, Quality Choice and Quality Control, where the last term introduces the notion of constraint.

# 3. The lexicogrammar of Quality

The aim of such a lexicogrammatical description is this: if I need to express an attribute or Quality of some thing (i.e. through the selection of a member of the word class adjective), what choices are available to me, how do I do it and what linguistic consequences does a particular choice have?

What I wish to do here is to examine some of linguistic environments where adjectives occur and the options, constraints and consequences which are involved. These can be listed as follows:

(a) Pre-head modifiers in nominal structures (a big parcel).   
(b) Complements of a copula in clause structure (he is kind).   
(c) Complements expressing the result of the process denoted by the verb (he shot him dead, he pulled the tooth loose).   
(d) Postpositive modifiers of certain types of nominal expression (something nice).

As authors such as Quirk et al (1985:424ff) and Downing and Locke (1992:518) observe, adjectives occasionally occur in other environments, namely as:

(e) Complements of prepositions (in short, for good etc.).   
(f) Premodifiers of certain adjectives (pale blue, red hot).   
(g) Adjuncts in Clauses (I'm receiving you loud and clear).   
(h) Contingent adjective clauses (Strange, I never suspected him).   
(i) Supplementive adjective clauses (Soaking wet, he walked into the room).

For reasons of time and because some of the environments have not yet been adequately addressed in our own research I shall not deal with all of them. Let us unpack the most common environments.

Environment (a) suggests the following. In the realization of meanings referring to Things (nouns), thus typically as Participant (Thematic) Roles, but also as complements of prepositions, and in the things which may realize certain Circumstantial Roles, the speaker has the option of expressing a Quality associated with the thing through premodification.

Premodification may serve a number of functions, such as epithet and classifier to use Halliday's terms (Halliday 1994: 184-186). In broader terms, the premodifier may be used to describe, identify, subclassify the Thing in question.

In terms of classification, Qualities are not the only option here. Also available are verbal (or clausal) items and nouns.

(7) A wooden platform.   
(8) A recovery platform.   
(9) A revolving platform.

Thus the lexicogrammar must make explicit the potential for premodification. Where does this potential originate? As explained above, it is likely to be the outcome of other choices. In this case it is a question of choices associated with the realization of Thing. And Thing itself is associated typically with the realization of Participant Roles.

It is dependent on a number of choices which have been made in the network for Thing. For example the speaker must have chosen [outsider], i.e. a thirdperson, rather than [interactant] given than with [interactant], i.e. a first or second person, the typical realization is through pronominal forms as in (10) and (11)

(10) I have been waiting.   
(11) Will you come in please.

But even the feature [outsider] may be expressed as a pronominal form, when it is recoverable, as in (12):

(12) They say he will never win.

It may also be expressed as a name, through a proper noun, as in (13).

(13) They say John will never win.

It may also be an indefinite reference, as in (14).

(14) They say something may happen.

Now in all these cases, the option to premodify is either nil or highly marked, since they concern forms which are either fully sufficient for the purposes of identification or they are purposely indefinite. This does not exclude the marked option in certain cases of the premodification of a name, wherever the context makes this necessary, as in (15).

(15) I mean big John, not little John.

Neither does it exclude modification of indefinite meanings such as in (14), although Quality senses are expressed through postmodification, as shown in (16) and (17).

(16) They expect something catastrophic to happen.   
(17) \*They expect catastrophic something to happen.

It is only when the speaker selects [cultural classification] (i.e. noun lexis or a recoverable pro-form such as one), that the option for premodification becomes available, as in (18) and (19).

(18) We preferred the red car.   
(19) We preferred the red one.

Haven chosen to supply some additional information about a Thing which is being expressed through some realization of [cultural classification], a number of choices open up. Let us suppose that the speaker wishes to identify through some attribute a particular Thing. There are at least three options which may be selected, beside the absence of any further information. A Thing may be identified through (a) some form of premodification, (b) a prepositional group structure (a minimal relationship with some Thing) or (c) through a relative clause (a Thing identified by its role in another situation), as illustrated in (20) - (22).

(20) They chose the red car.   
(21) They chose the car with the red bodywork.   
(22) They chose the car which was red.

Here, however, we have the potential for different ways of identifying, which are not mutually exclusive. A nominal group may have all three, as in (23).

(23) They chose the red car with the stylish interior that had the best petrol consumption.

Note that the potential of three ways of identifying a thing are related to the potential for expressing the identifying it through a Quality. The alternatives to identification by Quality are often required if no straightforward Quality sense is available. Quality, where available, might seem to be the unmarked option, the grammatically and morphological simplest means of achieving the task. In the case of certain regular alternative forms of description, the relative clause alternative becomes a premodifier, a complex quality, as in (24) and (25).

(24) a ready to wear suit.   
(25) a over the top remark.

The choice of modification is therefore dependent to some extent on the range of meanings which are available though premodification, and premodification by Quality. Unless this potential is made part of the lexicogrammar, however many features it involves, one is unable to fully express the consequences apparent in the presence of a prepositional or relative clause expression.

Now let us assume that our knowledge of the available options for premodification allows us to take this route. What are the options? Firstly, as we have already observed, there is a potential, certainly in the case of classification, for adjectival, nominal and clausal expressions. On the whole, unless we are interested in some form of sub-classification, the options will be limited to Quality senses. But this is not entirely the case, since verbal, or clausal expressions also function as epithets, as illustrated by (26).

(26) A poorly treated old army officer.

Given the principle of modifier ordering, poorly treated has an epithet function rather than a classifier function. Thus, depending on the function required we may have a number of options drawn from clausal (i.e. Situation-like) modifiers or from adjectival modifiers.

Furthermore, at this point we are not restricted to a single choice. One interesting phenomenon in English is modifier sequences. A speaker may select a considerable number of modifiers all of which contribute to the description or identification of the Thing in question, as illustrated in (27).

(27) A beautifully preserved large old red wooden Victorian cigar box.

Anyone who is familiar with this potential will know that it does not simply consist of the possibility of stringing together any old modifier in any old order. There is a stereotypical ordering principle in operation which is based on classes of modifier, all of which have a different function in the process of modification (see Tucker forthcoming for a full discussion of this phenomenon). Clearly, there is no fixed order, rather a preferred order based upon the aforementioned principle. And it is on classes of modifier rather than on individual adjectives. Moreover, it is a question of modifier sequencing rather than some form of coordination. Coordination is the norm when two or more quality senses are selected from the same modifier function, as illustrated by the differences between (28) and (29).

(28) An intelligent, courteous and conscientious member of staff.   
(29) A large warm woollen jersey.

Thus, once again we have options and constraints. A prototype system network for this is given in Figure 1. It recognizes a range of different modifier functions which correspond by and large to some of the major classes of Quality sense and which are allocated a place in the structure of the nominal group. The model also allows for the option of re-selecting for the same modifier function, in which case co-ordination markers will be used. Note also that at the level of the nominal group modifier functions also include options realized by nominal structures and verbal (clausal) structures. Finally, the network must allow for ordering which is not stereotypical. It is my claim that marked ordering involves some kind of promotion of a modifier function in terms of its centrality to subclassifying the Thing in question. This promotion may be on an ad hoc basis or may be part of a different register.

Little has been said so far about the choice of Quality senses themselves. We have not even mentioned the network which is responsible for the generation of adjectives and their structures. Let us therefore now examine choice, constraints and consequences involved in the selection of a quality sense at modifier. We may thus have selected something like (30).

# (30) a helpful teacher.

The modifier function expressed by the feature [by quality] and realized by the modifier element $\mathfrak { m } ^ { \mathfrak { q u a l } }$ will lead to preselection in the network for Quality. If our assumption about the relationship between modifier functions and semantic classes of Quality senses is right, then the selection of [by quality] will open up only that part of the Quality network which contains such senses. Having selected [by quality] one would not want to be presented with an open ended choice which might lead to a sense which fell under some other modifier function. Thus, one consequence is the limitation of choice.

![](img/892e85dd5776a58355b66b8917d6c18b07f13c47f7b960afa6db4fa17b29a40c.jpg)

What other consequences does the choice of modifier have? In certain cases, adjectives are restricted to either a 'predicative' function' or an 'attributive' function. To use the example given earlier, if it is the quality sense alight that we are interested in, then we know that it is not typically available as a modifier. This is a bi-directional constraint. If we are building a linguistic expression involving a modifier, we must have a mechanism for excluding any sense that is not available at modifier. Alternatively, if we select the sense alight, we must introduce the Quality in a different environment.

One system in the network for Quality must therefore be [quality as modifier] (modifier in a nominal group structure) and [quality as attribute] (predicative complement of a copula, expressing the Participant Role of Attribute in a relational process). Although these features are preselected from our previous selections, they are needed as complex entry conditions to constrain choice.

Let us assume that the sense we wish to select is kind. In this case there is no restriction; the sense is an option either in the 'attributive' or 'predicative' function. It may well be that we simply want to realize the nominal group as a kind teacher. But that is not the only alternative. We must consider whether we are able to premodify or temper (in the Cardiff Grammar) the Quality, as in a very helpful teacher, and if so what tempering options are available? We know that adjectives can be classified as gradable and ungradable. By and large this corresponds to whether or not they can be tempered. For example, if we select the basic material sense of wooden, then the option to temper in any way is removed. So tempering is not a universally available system, and again the system network must ensure that it is not entered when unavailable. Note that it is not a question of specifying individual senses as having the potential or not, but classes of senses. For example the senses which I include under [classifying] are by and large untemperable. Thus the feature [classifying] is not an entry condition to the subnetwork for tempering.

As we have seen, the acceptability of very kind suggests that kind belongs to the member of a subset of senses has tempering available. This latter system opens up a new set of options. The general range of available is shown in the network in Fig. 2. This system recognizes tempering types such as by quality (using one of a range of lexical adverbs (e.g. disappointingly inadequate), by measure (e.g. three feet long) by degree (extremely/very kind), and the subtype of degree which I refer to as referenced degree, where the degree associated with some Quality is expressed by reference to some other measure. Comparatives, superlatives and resultatives are included in this group (e.g. the kindest person, a kinder person or so kind a person that he was loved by everyone).

Before we explore the consequences of tempering in the case of kind, it is important to mention that not all the temperable Quality senses share the same general range of options. Recent work by Allerton (1987) and Johannson (1993)

Figure 2. Systems for degree temperers

draws attention to correlational phenomena with regard to temperer $+$ quality. Allerton sets up the categories of telic, absolutive and scalar in both temperers and adjectives in order to explain collocations such as such as those pointed out in (31-33).

(31) absolutely/very beautiful (32) \*absolutely/very pretty (33) absolutely/\*very gorgeous

The network will therefore have to cross-classify all such senses along with the range of temperers in order to ensure appropriate tempering. Once again the choice of Quality senses has consequences for the choice of temperer meaning available.

In certain cases, a class of senses may require its own set of temperers. One clear case of this is the set of colour senses, which have a potential for a range of temperers of an adjectival nature (e.g. bright/dark/pale/light red, blue etc.).

Assuming that kind is cross-classified accordingly, we can proceed with our exploration of the associated tempering potential. Note, incidentally, that kind is scalar rather than absolutive, and is altogether odd when tempered by the item absolutely.

Let us turn our attention to some of the options in referenced degree tempering. I may select to indicate that, in terms of being kind, the teacher in question outranks the whole group. She therefore has the highest degree of the quality kind of any of the set which serve as the reference point. Notice that such referencing is always relative. Someone may be the kindest person in the group but not necessarily be extremely kind.

An immediate option is whether or not to include the reference. This appears to be a textually determined choice. I may select to realize the superlative as (34) or (35).

(34) she is the kindest teacher.   
(35) she is the kindest teacher of the lot.

The availability of explicit reference opens up a number of options in expressing the reference, including indirect reference such as in (36).

(36) she is the kindest teacher I have ever known.

The range of options available for explicit reference with comparatives is even more complex, and I have dealt with a good number of these in Tucker (1990). What is noticeable about such explicit reference is the limitations on the structures. Thus the selection of explicit comparison sets up a reduced range of options available in the structure of the clauses and nominal groups that realize them.

Let us finally consider the option [to result] realized by the temperer so. Here the speaker has no choice of explicit or implicit result as reference. As is well known, so is also associated with emphatic tempering, (e.g. she is so kind), where no result is implied. Thus having select the resultative so an explicit result or outcome must be expressed. Yet another constraint as consequence of choice.

Before leaving tempering, we should note that the potential has not yet been exhausted. The emphasizing temperer so is available with a number of other degree temperers. Thus we can choose to add so to temperers such as very and awfully or to the range of senses available in tempering by quality, as shown in (37) - (39)

(37) so very kind.   
(38) so awfully kind.   
(39) so unexpectedly kind.

Note that this option is not available with medium degree temperers such as fairly, quite and rather, as (40) and (41) illustrate.

(40) rather/fairly/quite kind.   
(41) so \*rather/\*fairly/\*quite kind.

This further constraint can be modelled by a complex entry system, as shown in Fig. 3.

![](img/80a3e0ff933db049bbaddc38d772b935b75fb0b29da3aefc1c8a9a3e33e732b9.jpg)  
Figure 3. The system for temperers accepting further emphasis through so

Keeping our attention on the sense kind, let us step back a moment from its selection as a modifier. As many of these behaviour quality senses, kind is associated with some form of complementation (Huddleston 1987). The behaviour of such senses is similar to that of Mental Process verbs. Thus in (42) to her students is a complement of kind very much on the same lines as her students is the Complement of the Process loves in (43).

(42) she is kind to her students.   
(43) she loves her students.

However one wishes ultimately to analyze this 'predicative' use of kind, the same option is not available to kind as a modifier. Thus (44) is at best odd.

(44)?she is a kind teacher to her students.

It is therefore necessary for the lexicogrammar (a) to specify whether or not complementation is available for individual quality senses, or classes of senses, (b) to specify what potential meanings as structures are available if complementation is permitted, and (c) to specify constrain the kind of complementation outline above to the 'predicative function. This is shown for a more complex type of complementable sense, angry, in the network in Fig. 4.

# 4. Conclusion

The choices, consequences and constraints which we have explored above lead to the full range of Quality meanings from the simplex (adjective only) meaning as shown in (45) to the complex (full adjectival structure) meaning as shown in (46).

(45) she is kind. (46) so very much more violently angry at Mr Major for the confusion he has caused than he has ever been with any other leader in his political career.

Most of the options, consequences and constraints I have touched upon are well understood, certainly from a descriptive linguistic point of view. If not in the form of a systemic functional generative grammar, they have been explored by numerous scholars. Yet there are many phenomena that are yet not fully understood, the individual collocational consequences of Quality senses being a case in point.

The emphasis on choice in linguistic description foregrounds language in its social context. Ultimately, it is of little consequence whether individual linguistic expression is determined by the hard-wiring of the brain or whether such genetically transmitted hard-wiring is a consequence of the development of language as the principal means of social interaction. Whatever the biological constraints, the potential of each individual language represents at the level of form the social semiotic potential conventionalised by any linguistic group.

Moreover, if members of a linguistic group are constrained in absolute terms by universal principles of the language faculty, the observation that languages differ in their parametric settings, their peripheral properties and the idiosyncratic behaviour of their lexical items bears witness to the resourcefulness of their speakers in shaping each language to the semiotic needs of the community. There are, after all, universal constraints on all aspects of human behaviour. Yet within those constraints, humans have always sought to express their individual and group identifies. Wherever choice is possible, it has been exploited, as a means of signalling such identities. And, as we have seen, choice engenders its individual consequences and constraints. It is a matter of philosophical perspective whether one's point of departure is choice or constraint.

In the study of linguistic form, therefore, choice, and the contingent consequences and constraints, is a valid point of departure. The grammatical description of individual languages is still an important and necessary enterprise, both in its own right, and in the insights it can offer a whole range of related and applied disciplines, such as textual analysis, language acquisition research, second language learning and teaching, and computational natural language generation and understanding. Furthermore, descriptions that are anchored in the notion of choice do not and cannot neglect purely formal syntactic considerations. Clearly, it is our observation of the syntactic possibilities that languages exhibit that one comes to an understanding of how they are exploited for the expression of meaning. Finally, and importantly, such grammars set out to investigate and explain what it is that linguistic knowledge must comprise, above and beyond its universal features with which we are allegedly genetically endowed.

# MODALITY IN THE THERAPEUTIC DIALOGUE

# Abstract

Much of the interpersonal metafunction in the lexicogrammar of English is carried out by a wide array of markers: modal auxiliaries, adverbials, hedges, interclausal relations, parts of the mood and aspectual systems. In an utterer-centred perspective, such markers share a major role of inflecting the co-construction of meaning and modulating the referential information. Modophorics can thus be recategorized around a basic cognitive-affective function: the projection of open versus closed worlds.

A psychotherapeutic exchange illustrates the systemicity of this metafunction. The selective use of modal markers encourages a modified perspective in client-discourse. The client's responses turn out to be structurally adjusted to the therapist's strategies. The phenomena are too microscopic to be implemented intentionally.

# 1. Introduction

We focus in this paper on a particular type of language in use for specific purposes: dialogue unfolding in a psychotherapeutic context. Since language is the only means of intervention through which psychological transformation is enacted in that context, it follows that the therapist will use language selectively to shape the life narrative of the client. We try to show that the selective language of therapists in practice instantiates special configurations of functions distinct from those of spontaneous spoken language, even though they present themselves as natural and nondescript. Particularly as those configurations are produced and elicited by an expert in therapeutic discourse -the therapist-- it may be justified to speak of a "heightened" use of language in the sense G.M. Hopkins used to characterize poetry (see Tambling 1988). Theorists have explicitly explored this aspect from psychoanalytic to narrative approaches (Schafer 1981; White & Epston

1990), but we argue that all therapists develop ways of doing things with words for the therapeutic purpose of transforming the client's life narrative. One crucial instrument for enacting this change is the interplay of modality in the exchange.

Our approach is descriptive, based on a reconceptualization of the notion of modality from the more conventional logicist modes of apprehension to a comprehensive, cognitive-affective construal. A postulate of this preferred angle is that the level of organization of modality is best accessible to the observer if the latter steps away from the classic stance of scientific inquiry (the "view from afar' exemplified in Levi-Strauss's structuralism after Saussure), and focusses instead on the operations performed by the speaking subject in the real time of practice, constructing them from the speaker's point of view in the co-construction of the exchange.

This attempt is deliberately interdisciplinary, borrowing from linguistics and psychotherapy. Even within linguistics, it will be seen that various schools usually kept distinct are solicited --based on the belief that many authors are currently converging towards the idea of an extended modality anchored in the speaking subject. Previous work to this effect has developed in a variety of language-oriented disciplines, inclusive of but certainly not limited to linguistics: To conceive of an extended modality presupposes a speech-to-narrative continuum instead of several specialized fields of inquiry.

This is one component in a longer-term programme of research. Its horizon is a sociosemiotics of the language user (rather than language), in which modality takes center stage.

# 2. An extended modality system

An essential component of natural language, modality does not reduce to its grammaticized forms. "Whenever speakers (or writers) say anything, they encode their point of view towards it [with] markers of commitment and detachment" (Stubbs 1986:1), thereby signalling their degree of involvement in the exchange (Katriel & Dascal 1989). Modalization is inherent in the semiotic properties of natural language. Conveying the speakers' opinions, feelings and attitudes, and defining their active positioning in the intersubjective relationship, modality can further index the progress of that personal involvement.

Something similar takes place at the higher, narrative level of organization of language. Discussing psychological reality in cognitive terms, Jerome Bruner (1986) sets the narrative modes of 'telling' as central to autobiography. He draws from Greimas and Courtes (1976) the distinction between a "landscape of action" (telling actions, facts) and a "landscape of consciousness" (telling emotions, perceptions, representations, beliefs). These landscapes have discursive features which differentiate between them. The psychological landscape of consciousness transforms cut-and-dry informational expositions and "subjectivizes" the accounts, adding perspective, appreciation, presuppositions, including uncertainty, epistemic deliberation, deontic necessities or contingencies. Studies of a baby's soliloquies show the early acquisition of such forms of speech, which Bruner accounts for as meaning-making processes:

The language of skillful narrative differs in that of skillfull exposition in the employment of 'subjunctivizing transformations'. These are lexical and grammatical usages that highlight subjective states, attenuating circumstances, altemative possibilities. (Bruner 1990:53. Our italics)

The extreme diversity of modality markers accounts for the fact that their class-membership has been denied as a general category (Ducrot 1993:112, 128). Indeed, it does not seem fruitful at first glance for linguistic analysis to construct a single category grouping words, phrases and clauses such as 'I have a feeling that', 'going to', just', 'let me', and maybe'. Unless, that is, we take a functional perspective: Since most involvement markers that serve to encode speakers' points of view, feelings, attitudes do so potentially, under "certain conditions of usage' (Roulet 1993:29), the incentive is compelling to envision modality as a \*quality', a modulated property of clauses obtained by virtue of their being used in certain ways, under certain circumstances.

In this paper, we take the initial view that the flow of utterances in ordinary language consists of loosely-juxtaposed sequences of minimal clausal nuclei $( \mathsf { C N } _ { 1 } ,$ $\mathsf { C N } _ { 2 , \cdots } \mathrm { C N } _ { \mathrm { n } } )$ . These clausal nuclei actualize propositional notions, at the same time as they are modified by a constellation of modality-carrying markers (modophorics). It is important to note that the schema does not presuppose a precedence of one or the other type of components. Nor should the heuristic implicit in the presentation be taken to suggest that clausal nuclei provide the "information", modophorics the "clothing" -both categories are informative.

Thus, the statement

I have a feeling that you are just going to sit there and let me stew in it and I want more, uttered in therapy, may be interpreted as the actualization, and modal deployment, of the following complex of clausal nuclei $( \mathsf { C N } _ { 1 - 2 } )$ .

$$
[ < ( \mathrm { y o u } ) / \mathrm { s i t } \mathrm { t h e r e } / > _ { _ 1 } + < ( \mathrm { I } ) / \mathrm { s t e w } \mathrm { i n } \mathrm { i t } / > _ { _ 2 } ]
$$

Translated in an empirical context of research, clausal nuclei can be reinterpreted as the pre-expressive base of so-called "single-case frames" (Chafe 1979:164) consisting of "a verb with its associated nouns"' and a clear intonational contour signalling "some kind of unit boundary" below sentence level. In Chafe's assessment, such single-case frames were shown to display the following characteristics in a corpus of English: (1) "have a mean length of about 5 words"; (2) "a mean duration of slightly less than 2 seconds"; (3) "represent two-thirds of all case frames, three-fourths if [...] extended to include verbs with complement case frames as their arguments, phrases containing identificatory restrictive relative clauses, double verb constructions, and the like". (4) Besides, "most of the remaining $2 5 \%$ of the phrases consist of adverbs, interjections, or topic like noun phrases. Only about $4 \%$ consist of what are clearly two independent case frames". (5) "About $40 \%$ of the phrases [...] begin with and, and many of the remainder with but, so, then, or a combination of these"'. It is likely that different corpora taken from different registers of English would have yielded other results, but the point is, that there seems indeed to be a natural lower limit towards which clauses, however complex, will tend to --while remaining intelligible. This limit is precisely what we choose to conceptualize $\mathbf { a s } \mathbf { \mathbf { \subset N } } .$ It seems justified then, even empirically, to adopt this initial view of the flow of language as a sequence of concatenated nuclei.

This construct of two meta-types of expressions, clausal nuclei and modophorics combining in language, is compatible with Bruner's (narrative) landscapes of action and consciousness. The underlying distinction $( d i c t u m + m o d u s )$ has been with us for ever of course -at least since Aristotle (Ruthrof 1988:315). In modern functional phraseology it is usually specified as such:

(1) the referential dimension (in Hallidayan terms the "ideational metafunction" partly "logical" and partly "experiential') linking phrasal/clausal structures to the informational contents or 'messages'; this aspect of language has been deemed characteristic of certain forms of written production and, perhaps because of that, more easily pliable to syntactic (de)coding;   
(2) the intersubjective field, or "interpersonal metafunction", referring the structure of phrases and clauses to the acts of persuasion and negotiation during the co-construction of meaning. Although in no way restricted to speech, this feature often results in parataxis (Nesbitt & Plum 1988) and is characteristic of spoken forms.

It is of course possible to conceive of certain forms of speech with minimal modal input, and conversely, of hypermodalized written forms. However, because of their functional relation to rhythm and intonation, modophorics may be viewed as a necessary manifestation of orality, therefore as attached to spoken language in priority.

# 3. The transcategoriality of modality: a piling up of effects

Modophorics are precious language resources. Without them, speakers would not be able to voice their subjectivities in ways that allow for mutual interpretability within the boundaries of language communities. The technical question is: Can we group together in one class the whole array of modophorics in English whose functions, applied to the referential construction of utterances, signal the constant repositioning of the utterer --cognitively, affectively, and socially-- to the speechact participants?

The following list adopts the more conventional names under which those markers have usually been classified. Categories overlap somewhat, due in part to the different goals pursued by those who coined the labels. We do not propose to build a typology. Rather, we hope to show that an extended modality system exists effectively in natural languages.

We begin with the categories that have been grammaticized in English (2.1), switching then to the lexical diversity of modophorics (2.2). The third subgroup relates to the interclausal structure (2.3). Modality is construed here as applying to the three levels of (ii) the lexicon, (ii) grammar, (iii) discourse. Although individual identification of markers requires an analytic presentation, their functional quality is best appreciated at discourse-level, in terms of variable intensity. This quality is clearly at odds with Saussure's syntagmatics of linearity, applied to the sequence of signifiers: "Si j'accentue une syllabe, il semble que j'accumule sur le meme point des elements significatifs differents. Mais c'est une illusion" (1982:103). The contrast can easily be accounted for, since we are opting in this paper for a "linguistique de la parole". Finally, it should be noted that we are not denying the pervasive role ofrhythm and intonation in generalized modality. Simply, as we will still be dealing with a syntagmatics of sorts (modulated with highlighters and downtoners), we prefer to leave aside the complexities of marked stress and intonation, provisionally.

# 3.1 Grammaticized modality

This primary group of modophoric markers serves to construct and deploy the basic utterance out of the basic clausal nucleus. The primary system is organized around the verb in English.

# 3.1.1 Mood

It is impossible to study modality without mentioning its interplay with mood (Palmer 1986). To illustrate, the softening (hedging) of an injunction ("have a chair') is conventionally brought about by means of an interro-negative combined with a modal:

won't you have a chair?

Mood may be abstracted from a sentence for analytical reasons but it is an integral constituent of utterances. Modality has a cumulative quality: any overt modophoric marker has to be supported by a mood component consistent with the intonation.

# 3.1.2 Aspect

Aspect interacts with mood to actualize the modophoric complex. Narrative changes such as "aspectual shifts" (Chafe 1979:173) thus appear to be "cognitively motivated": by spatial shift for example, or frequency shifts from repeated actions to repeated single action. Like mood, aspect can be viewed as a primary modifier of the clause.

# 3.1.3 Modal auxiliaries

Modal auxiliaries are not as indispensable to the utterance as mood, aspect and intonation but they follow strict rules of usage whenever speakers resort to them. Formally, it may be useful to think of each member of the set of auxiliaries as just one component in a larger paradigmatic system. For example, modal verbs behave as auxiliating forms combined with certain types of auxiliated units (Benveniste 1974:183, 187-192). Both the auxiliating form and the auxiliated unit are paradigmatic. Combined with the category of 'person' anchored in the utterer (Ego), the auxiliating form grounds the utterance as part of the overall mood system. Extended to the clause complex, it is possible to view propositional attitudinals (see 3.3.1) as auxiliating units for the clauses they project.

In some of their more conventional uses, modals combine with so-called 'illocutionary' verbs to produce hedged performatives' (Fraser 1975). These clausal structures turn up in conversational exchanges as blocks ready to serve, likely learned and used by native speakers as single-unit complexes (Morgan 1978) as in:

I would advise you that $^ +$ [PROPOSITION] or: Je dois vous avouer que $^ +$ [PROPOSITION]

This coupling of auxiliating modals with verbs with which they form a modophoric complex seems to be a common strategy by speakers, playing on the 'illocutionary/ perlocutionary force' of messages. The strategy augments the argumentative power of the propositional sequence.

# 3.2 Lexis

This second group of markers comprises a great variety of modifiers, instantiated lexically. Its levels of application are more diffuse than the first species; they may even not be attached to a precise position (e.g. parentheticals).

# 3.2.1 Evidentials

Evidentials are those markers of detached involvement whereby speakers take a step back and make their subjective stances explicit: "for me", "I heard you say", etc. Unlike other languages (Chafe & Nichols 1986), English has not grammaticized evidentiality. Yet there is no question that in all languages, "there are everyday expressions for this [expression of detachment from full commitment to propositional information], as when we talk of just 'entertaining' a proposition, 'for the sake of argument'" (Stubbs 1986:6-7), or when we use verbal/adverbial forms to express hearsay or sensory evidence (Chafe 1986:267-268).

# 3.2.2 Adverbials

Quirk et al. single out two classes of adverbials with a propensity to serve as modalizers: "highlighters" (also "intensifiers'); and "downtoners". Their functional resemblance with modal auxiliaries is attested formally in a number of languages such as Mandarin (see e.g. Alleton 1973:105).

# (i) Adverbs modalizing the predication

Examples are "naturally", "evidently", "certainly", "perhaps", "effectively", etc. also called 'propositional modalizers' (Roulet 1979). They can either be sentence adverbs, or modalize parts of the predication only.

Those modophoric adverbs are routinely transformed into adjectival clauses actualizing properties of objects or processes: "it is natural that $+ \vec { \mathsf { p } } ^ { \flat }$ , "it is possible that $+ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } ^ { \dagger }$ $\mathbf { \mu } ^ { * } \mathbf { \tilde { x } }$ is evident'. These paraphrastic variants behave as clausal complementizers for some of the most delicate uses of modal auxiliaries.

# (ii) Delexicalised "discourse markers'

Coates (1987) and Markannen (1989) cite functional adverbs such as "sort of', "kind of", "a little" and "really"'; "a bit", "quite", "presumably". Generally called "particles" in Germany (Weydt & Ehlers 1987), "discourse markers" in the US, the wealth of denominations for those is quite astonishing: "Abtonung"; "modal particles" (sometimes "focus particles'); "particules enonciatives' (or "modalisateurs d'enonce") etc. We interpret these pragmatic connectives as having shifted domains, from the postulated 'cn-base' to the modophoric component of the sequence. They are pervasive in speech and in "intrusive narration' (May 1994:69) where the narrator does not hide his/her involvement in storytelling. Arndt (1960:325) also characterized them modally as expressing "the objective relationship or subjective attitude of the speaker to the actuality of the phenomena and relationships in nature and society with regard to their likelihood, possibility, inevitability, etc".

# 3.2.3 Hedges

Lakoff 1972 (also Hubler 1983; Markannen 1989) worked on those useful little words suggestive of 'fuzziness'. As can be seen from Lakoff's examples in his 1972 article, the category overlaps with that of delexicalised discourse markers. This is not surprising since Lakoff's intent at the time was not so much the concept of modality as such as emphasizing the ubiquity of non 'truth-value' markers in ordinary language.

# 3.2.4 Lexical items

This open class comprises all sorts of words and expressions used habitually with varying degrees of definiteness or intensity, including verbs of volition and conation in the first person singular. "Want' may be prototypical of such predicates, clearly rooted in eGo's foundational desire. The modal component here can be viewed as a semantic aggregate of features, or a higher-order lexical type (depending on the theoretical approach).

# 3.2.5 Parentheticals

Urmson (1952) coined the term, defining parentheticals as "first-person verbs Of cognition" --I believe", "I think", "I suppose", "I presume", "I guess", etc.- used without complementizing copulas. Thompson and Mulac (1991) have called them "epistemic parentheticals", or EPARs. Parenthetical modophorics however are restricted neither to epistemic values nor to first-person formulas. Casual expressions such as "if you like", "si tu veux", "see", etc. can be seen as part of this set. Interestingly, those readymade expressions overlap functionally with modophoric adverbs (3.2.2 (i)).

# 3.2.6 Validation markers

Validation markers are, typically, 'tags' as they occur in spontaneous verbal interaction (in British English at least). Their function is to request agreement and/or support from the other participant or the audience. We have included in this set non-lexical anaphoric markers of validation such as "mm mm...", long recognized as meaningful by psychologists who call them "minimal responses" or "encouragers' (Ivey 1983). In our opinion, this inclusion is motivated for the specific use of language in therapy, as the function of validation conveyed by those markers bears directly on the client's storytelling, i.e. the main object in the psychotherapeutic relationship. We do not imply that such validation markers should be classified as modophorics in all language realizations.

# 3.2.7 Interjections

Like particles and parentheticals, interjections have largely been ignored in formal linguistics. They modify the strength of the utterance to which they apply.

# 3.3 Interclausal modophorics

# 3.3.1 Propositional attitudinals

These modophorics behave like auxiliating units at clause-complex level: "I see that $+ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } ^ { \prime }$ ,"I think that $+ { \mathfrak { p } } ^ { }$ ', "I hear that $+ \boldsymbol { { \mathfrak { p } } } ^ { \flat }$ (where the projected proposition is the auxiliated part). The difference between this set and that of"parentheticals" (3.2.5) is structural: it has to do with the presence/absence of a complementizing copula. It is not so much the verbs themselves that matter, as the bi-clausal usage they entail. Based on Halliday's distinction (1985) between alpha, beta, etc. clauses and their hypotactic complements, we call such modal units $\alpha \mu$ (alpha-mu) projections. $\beta$ -clauses are 'filtered', so to speak, through utterer-centered auclauses. The modophoric function of a-clauses is vividly illustrated in grammatical metaphor.

# 3.3.2 Topicalisers

Topicalisers ("the thing is...", "the way I sense this, is..." etc.) resemble modalizers of predication 3.2.2 (i)), only their scope is at a higher structural level. They bear on the entire clause complex. Actually, their scope can extend even further, supra-sententially, particularly if they occur repeatedly in the flow of discourse.

# 3.3.3 Connectors

Although consideration of those items has usually been limited to their function in linking up statements, interclausal connectors crucially present speakers with a variety of options whose selection is often congruent with the dominant modality in their discourse. Depending on the register in which they are cast, clauses can be connected in ways that are semantically close, yet intersubjectively distinct. Thus a series in English such as "because", "so", and "and' may convey approximately the same idea, but each option will convey different ways for the speaker to position her/himself in relation to the other participants, and to the world at large.

# 4. A higher-level reorganization

Other works, descriptive and corpus-based, have posited a notion of generalized modality similar to our own (see e.g. Maynard 1993:48-49, Sandhoffer-Sixel 1988; and Ludwig 1988). According to Maynard (1993:6), who was working on Japanese in a pragmatic perspective, modophorics have the following interpersonal functions: (i) information qualification; (ii) speech action declaration and qualification; (ii) participatory control and (iv), interactional appeal. In this section, we focus on a different aggregate of attempts, more concerned with linguistics than pragmatics.

# 4.1 The classic categories: epistemic, deontic, bouletic, alethic

From Aristotle to von Wright and beyond, the notion of modality was a logical artifact. Linguistics has generally accepted this perspective. It is against this backdrop that a number of authors set out reconsidering linguistic modality in the light of more accommodating, one is tempted to say more "human" terms --terms that were more inclusive of the human potential for a different order of classification than rationality: force and intensity (instead of epistemic and deontic settings), wish and desire (versus the bouletic or boulomaic parameter), imagination (as against realis/irrealis). In those attempts, the more classic categories have not been discarded; rather, they were reconstructed, or recast, as an intermediate system of options, a mediating level of organization (Vermittlung in Cassirer's words 1963:6-7) between language unfolding naturally and higher-order cognitiveaffective meta-notions.

# 4.2 From modals to generalized modality

Despite considerable variation in usage, the disparate threads of 'epistemic' vs. 'root', or 'deontic' and 'dynamic' values attached to basic auxiliating forms have been the focus of several efforts at unifying them. A small number of higherorder cognitive categories have thus emerged: "force dynamics" (Talmy 1981), "potentiality" (Klinge 1993), "tentativeness" (e.g. Duffley 1994).

4.2.1. Talmy assigned auxiliating modals to a "greater modal system' (lexicogrammatical) around a basic "Agonist/Antagonist' relation postulated as omnipresent in language. Higher-order notions were thus characterized, that could be glossed as the alternation of 'letting'/'precluding' situations and events (1988:81). He was the first cognitive linguist to our knowledge to propose a unified semantics of modality based on the concept of cognitive force' retained or applied, either concretely or abstractly, and to refer to possible applications of the model to psychological and psychoanalytic research, citing explicitly the Freudian concepts of"id"' and"superego" (1988:95).

4.2.2. Culioli (1990) has proposed the most overt effacement of the cognitive/ affective distinction, resulting in highly abstract meta-notions lending themselves equally to ideational and interpersonal interpretations: the constructs of "open" versus "closed" notions. The superordinate concepts of"openness" and "closure" in this sense can apply equally to spatial, temporal, epistemic, deontic, emotional, etc. events or situations. Like Talmy, Culioli explicitly suggests an extension of the field of semantics beyond the boundaries of cognition as ideation. Ultimately, their semantics is one of anthropological inclusion. Unlike stricter cognitive grammarians who equate grammar with mental conceptualization, they construct a model of ego as full experiencer. Modophoric reiteration in discourse effects a piling up of expressiveness reminiscent of a logical point of accumulation or Hoherung (Culioli 1985:20). At that point, it is impossible to distinguish between cognition and affect. Instead of the two functions of ideation and intersubjectivity being kept separate --a decision largely entailed by the detached perspective of the more classic models--they merge as common attributes of the speaking subject, whose status thus becomes pivotal for the theory.

# 4.3 The flexibility of usage, captured in theory

4.3.1. Leaving aside his preference for the "empirical, rationalist conception of the speaking subject" (see Thibault 1987:607), Halliday's tripartite distinction of ideational, interpersonal, textual metafunctions is ingenious in that it leaves plenty of room for a dynamic conceptualisation of modality per se. The first dimension, "modulation", covers the modalities of"obligation" and "inclination". It corresponds roughly to the deontic/bouletic values of traditional models. The second dimension, "modalisation" ("probability" and "usuality') recalls the conventional epistemic and alethic modes. Together, the four types are said to project an "indefinite" number of modality options or "choices" available to the speaker/writer. This is made possible by the introduction of a scale of values defined in terms of three settings ("high", "median" and "low") but with a potential to accommodate more refined distinctions (Halliday 1985:335). This leaves room for a much finer resolution in the distribution of choices, whereby all imaginable degrees of obligation, inclination, probability and usuality become available for selection, anywhere between the maximum and minimum settings. This 'gradient' or scale of values is something that we propose to extend to all modophorics, grammaticized or not.

4.3.2. Another imaginative construct is by Culioli (1985) who distinguishes four types of modality. Type 1, mood -and intonation- based, articulates a transformation: a statement can be turned into a question or an injunction. This primary modality plays a key role in permitting the redeployment of the "speech-act continuum" (Givon 1982). Type 2 marks a variety of departures from existential certainty: doubt, probability, possibility, equivalence occupy positions on a gradient. The utterer projects her/his point of view, identifiable by the analyst and the co-utterer as deviating from a form posited as "neutral". Type 3 comprises the modalities of "qualitative appreciation"'. The utterer forms an opinion of the situation in terms cognitive and affective ("I like that", "you were great", "this is unconscionable", etc.). Type 4 is that of "causal force". Again, a gradient is in order: a command can be formulated in such a way that it takes the form of a request or a wish. All four types overlap. Each can be viewed as radiating from a core meaning. The further the effective modality, the more likely it is to belong to an intermediate type and as a result perhaps, change types (4 slips into 1 for example). .

In Halliday's and Culioli's models, modality is seen as a dynamic quality of ordinary language. This quality is invoked by the utterer whenever the need to become involved is felt. It subsumes a great variety of forms, lexical and grammatical. The different ways in which languages grammaticize modality, and the different styles of speaking and writing lexicalised in sociolects, point to a socio-cultural dimension of modality. Highly personal landscapes of consciousness thus define the intersubjective relationship.

# 4.4 Implications

Extended modality can be defined as the open set of intersubjective modifiers --whether lexical, grammatical or interclausal-- encasing (and permitting) the full deployment of clausal nuclei in discourse. The propositional core is modalized by one or several modophorics depending on the cognitive-affective and social grounding of the speaker -his/her positioning in relation (i) to the scene (actual or projected), (ii) to the other participants, (iii) to the audience (actual or virtual), (iv) to her/his sociocultural itinerary and background. Modalization can be either mandatory (through grammaticization) or optional. Not everything that does not belong to the clausal nucleus belongs to the domain of modality. Determination, case, tense, etc. are not part of the extended modality system. However, they interact with it (Robert 1994).

Rather than mere polarity, there seems to be a gradient' (or scalar organization) pervasive in lexicogrammar. The system may seem binary when looked at exclusively at the poles, under the analytical eye of the observer; but in practice, the system is continuous and qualitative. It is this qualitative dimension that may allow for the recurrence of topic negotiation and (re-)adjustments in the process of symbolic meaning-making (Simeoni & Fall 1992; Fall, Simeoni, Chambon 1994).

The sheer variety of modophorics combines with a qualitative scale of (open/ closed) values, to yield an indefinite number of configurations presenting themselves as so many 'choices'. Modal auxiliaries, ${ \mathfrak { a } } { \mathfrak { k } }$ -clauses, EPARs, modophoric adverbs, etc. are potential resources more or less available to the speaker/writer. The system as such shows itself at its most effective at the inter-clausal level and in the actual deployment of usage.

Like mood and aspect (in some of its uses), intonation grounds the modophoric base of utterances. No utterance exists that is not intoned. In this paper we do not study the interaction of intonation with the rest of the modophoric system. We do suppose however, a compatibility of intonation patterns with the larger modality system.

# 5. The relevance of extended modality for clinical studies

According to Caffi and Janney (1994), many psycholinguistic motivational categories observed by linguists over the last 25 years could be of interest for psychotherapeutic research. The categories they cite are related to several distinct orientations: "positive/negative", "more or less 'intense'", "near/far', "clear/ vague", "confident/doubtful", "self-assertive/unassertive" (1994:342-343). They argue rightly that those "emotive categories need to be connected with specific types of linguistic choices' for bridges to be built between the psychological professions and linguistically motivated inquiry.

The emotional, relational, cognitive structures of clients are manifested in the discursive patterns of their autobiographical narratives, through the stance that the speaker posits between her/himself and other people or events. Essig and Russel (1990) developed a more extensive typology comprised of: clausal "predications" of (i) subjectivation (our clausal epistemic category): I think he..., I believe she...; (ii) attitude: I enjoyed..., (ii) entreaty, expressing intention, wish or desire linked to another subject: I want you/him/her to... Also: in-clause "specifications" of "intention, will or desire to perform an action' (bouletic);, "mode" (necessity of possibility); "degree" (really, kind of); "ongoing temporal organization of the event, initiation and result' (aspect); even "duration as temporal perspective". While acknowledging the similarities between their work and ours, we have also tried to stay closer to the terms in use from different perspectives in current linguistic work.

Therapists are particularly interested in what professionals refer to as relational schemas, patterns of self and self/other representations. Some patterns are seen as "maladaptive"; others as more "adaptive" and providing satisfactory interpersonal relations (Horowitz 1991). Maladaptive patterns of relating are characterized by rigidity and constraint, more adaptive patterns by greater flexibility and possibility.

Those stances can be traced to language use and, specifically, to the deployment of modality. Clients express various degrees of certainty and uncertainty, of obligation or a range of options, of impossibilities and possibilities. The cognitive psychologist Aaron Beck (1967) thus explicitly associated clinical depression with the dominant use of deontics (e.g. "should') and polarized notions, therapeutic progress being correlated with a decrease in the use of such markers. Sherman and Skinner (1988) have stated that cognitive semantic analyses can contribute to documenting personal meanings and their transformation, and assessing the clinical progress of clients. They highlight the dysfunctional role played by deontics of obligation ("should", "must", "ought to") and quantifiers with absolute values (such as "everybody", "nobody", "al", "none", "always", "never", "everything", "nothing"). They include as important, central markers of possibility -in particular an increase in the "possible" and "able to" range as indicator of improvement.

On this basis, and in keeping with Culioli's notion of a transcategorical continuum of open and closed forms, we propose to conceptualize two poles of such a continuum for modality informed utterances: open modalization and closed modalization. These can be realized with multiple resources:

Open modalization foregrounds possible, alternate realities: she could go; she would be able to..., sometimes, maybe, I wonder whether

The development of relational sensitive approaches to working with clinical populations led to a therapeutic model of intervention which softens the clients' rigid nodes of interpersonal exchange through language. Therapists avoid expressions of definitive certainty and discursive closure. Instead, they consistently use 'tentative expressions' of irresoluteness with an open-ended quality --to encourage the exploration of new stances and ways ofrelating (Marziali & Munroe-Blum 1994).

This led us to attempt an initial classification of"open" versus "closed" modalities, and to apply this type of analysis to segments of sessions. Not only was it possible to track therapeutic interventions as being predominantly in the open range, based on a wide array of modophorics, it could also be shown that over a number of sessions, clients will modify their utterances towards an increase in the use of open modophorics, as well as a concurrent decrease in that of closed forms (Chambon 1995). Increase in open modophorics was clearly associated with therapeutic progress, with positive clinical measures correlating with the clients' increasing use of such forms.

More recently, the analysis of a group session (Chambon, Tsang & Marziali, in press), illustrated the contrastive modalization of the same core ideational notion by two group members. The lexical notion of "freedom", whose default connotation would seem to be one of "openness", was modalized differentially along the open gradient by speaker 1, as against the closed gradient by speaker 2. The former group member valued freedom highly, the latter constructed it negatively. The utterances of speaker 1 stressed the dimension of heightened quality (so free"), and quantified this emphasis accordingly ("very free') --open modalizers attached themselves to a lexical notion symbolizing the positive quality of openness. In contrast, speaker 2 modalized the notion by means of a quantifier ("always free"') and a qualifier ("absolutely free") both closed, transforming what would spontaneously be taken to be an open notion by most native speakers asked to pass judgment out of context (and by dictionaries), into a closed domain. This is borne out in the corpus by complementary occurrences showing similar devaluation: "almost too free", "utterly free". In each case, speakers resorted to several modophorics to the same effect. The cumulative outcome of such uses was striking in the dynamics of the group.

Martha: very free so free Diane: always free absolutely free almost too free utter freedom

Each speaker conveniently expanded her modalized phrase into an appropriate connotative statement. One speaker associated her sister "leaving her free" as an indication of love, of being cared for, while the second speaker associated freedom in negative relational terms as an imposed condition, an indication of lack of love. She was "set free' because she was not cared for. This illustration demonstrates the association made by speakers themselves between open modalization and potentiality on the one hand, closed modalization with blockage on the other. The relevance of the open/closed modalizer categories can thus be validated empirically, through usage consistency.

Therapists' interventions are important since they influence and shape the discourse of clients. Set in the landscape of consciousness, they provide alternatives to clients' patterns of subjectivity. We can reasonably hypothesize that therapists deploy particular strategies of modality in their speech.

Autobiographical accounts are notably unstable. On the one hand, this very instability makes life stories highly susceptible to cultural, interpersonal, and linguistic influences. This susceptibility to influence may, in fact, be the reason why "talking cures", religious instruction, and other interventions in a life may often have such profound effects in changing a person's life narrative. (Bruner 1987:14-15)

The following analysis examines how one therapist uses everyday language strategically to deploy various features of open modality in a systematic manner.

# 6. Analysis

The Client-Centered therapist Carl Rogers is an interesting case. He developed a humanistic", non-directive approach to counseling which orients the client towards her/his "potential self'. He encourages clients to explore their open projected space of possibility, with a view to enhancing their inner reality (Rogers 1961). As a result, therapists working in this mode (i) encourage clients to explore the cognitive/affective ramifications of their statements --this implies staying close to the client's wording; (ii) foster statements of possibility and potentiality.

We have selected a number of statements from a session between Rogers and "Gloria", which is part of a public tape series (Shostrom 1966). We will focus on the therapist's statements.

# 6.1 Opening statement

The opening statement therapists make is pivotal. An orienting interpersonal act, it provides an entry for the client into the therapeutic activity, setting the stage for the terms of the exchange (Goffman 1974). The opening statement that Rogers makes to Gloria is the following (strings run into one another in the actuality of the exchange):

(a) We have half an hour together (b) and I don't know what we'll be able to make of it (c) but I hope we can make something of it (d) I'd be glad to know whatever concerns you

A blunt restatement, i.e. a gloss 'to the point' might collapse the four strings into two, the first and last, resulting in the paraphrase:

We have half an hour together. Tell me what concerns you.

Instead, the speaker develops a much expanded statement in the four-unit speech turn above. The initial string undergoes minimal modalization. It is followed by three highly modalized strings which share an identical structure: au auxiliating clause $^ +$ projected clause.

Remarkable is the tentativeness, or 'fuzziness' of the language, characterized by multiple open modophorics in single strings:

I don't know / what... be able to... ..it ${ \mathfrak { a } } \mu$ -clause modal periphrase lexis open epistemic open possibility open domain epistemic uncertainty potentiality tentativeness I hope... ... we can ...something ...it $\alpha \mu$ -clause mod. aux. lexis lexis

open bouletic open possibility open domain open domain projected reality potentiality tentativeness tentativeness I'd be glad ... ...whatever concerns (you) auxiliating unit $( \alpha \mu )$ lexis lexis open hypothetical open domain lack of closure positive valuation scanning tentativeness ( $\nneq$ problem; trouble)

All three statements combine interclausal, grammatical and lexical modophorics. All modophorics are "open'. In (b) the interclausal structure modifies the otherwise closed epistemic assertiveness of "I don't know"' into an open interrogation: "I don't know what...' Functionally, au-clauses project an open epistemic (b), an open bouletic (c), and an open positive valuation (d). The projected clauses combine an open lexico-grammatical potentiality (b, c) and a maximally open pronoun functioning as a scanner of all possibilities (d), with one or two lexical items instantiating, either an open domain--^it' remains unnamed and indeterminate-- or a domain that is substantively named as a generic term of non-closure, like a joker in a pack of cards: "concerns". The term "concern" is interesting, as the speaker could have opted for "problem", "pain", "worry", etc. "Concern"' certainly includes those possibilities, but it also subsumes more positively valued ones.

The therapist thus refuses to name "whatever' it is that causes the concern, inviting instead the client to name "it'. He encourages all potentialities and possibilities, taking an open epistemic position, at times even hopeful, in relation to the client-speaker. The opening statement is discursively coherent: it positions the therapist-speaker in consistent manner in regard to the client, emphasizing systematically the full openness of potentialities. We are struck by the multiple and crucially repetitive modophoric resources implemented by the speaker, and by their convergence in a coherent stance. They would likely seem excessive in everyday terms, if it were not for the directionality they clearly emphasize, in keeping with the clinical-theoretical perspective. All this of course occurs unconsciously. We would like to argue that modalization models that perspective, as the discursive coherence obtains through cumulative and convergent operations (Chambon 1994b).

# 6.2 Additional cumulative deployment of open modophorics in session

Many other utterances by Rogers in the same corpus combine more than one open modophoric, resulting in a cumulatively open cognitive/affective position. Here is a sampling:

(i) It seems to me that perhaps..

(ii) I guess the way I sense it is... (iii) I guess I heard you saying.. (iv) what is it you wish I would say?

(i), (ii), and (iii) are introduced by an auxiliating clause containing an open epistemic ("seems", "guess'") suggesting uncertainty. In (i), this initial function is complemented by an open adverb ("perhaps"). The effect is to project maximal openness onto the auxiliated clause. In (ii), the initial epistemic phrase projects yet another open epistemic clause: "I guess": "I sense", doubling the tentativeness of the therapist-speaker's epistemic position. The added topicaliser, "the way I sense it, is...", further opens the epistemic domain of "I guess", adding speculativeness to an otherwise closed assertion: "I sense.."' In (ii), the setting is again consistent. The projecting open epistemic clause ("I guess") is followed by a sensory evidential embedding a continuous aspectual form. The modalization of the core definitive statement into a tentative open statement can be illustrated thus:

you said $ \mathrm { I }$ heard you say $ ^ { \bullet } \mathrm { I }$ heard you saying'

Finally (iv), "what is it you wish I would say" may be glossed into the core interrogative:

what/I say?

Though the mediation of a bouletic clause grounded to the client ("you wish"), the latter is given potential control. The ensuing cn (I/say) incorporates a modal (would), which follows normally from the expression of a wish.

# 6.3 Mixed usage of open modalization and closed (or neutral) forms

The piling up of modophoric forms is not always unidirectional. Often speakers deploy mixed expressions, varied and compensatory, to convey a greater complexity of meaning.

<html><body><table><tr><td>CORE NUCLEI</td><td>MODAL DEPLOYMENT</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; ... / subterfuge &gt;</td><td>...a sort of subterfuge</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; you / reproach (self) / &gt;</td><td>you kind of reproach yourself</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; you / blame (them) &gt;</td><td>you kinda feel like blaming them</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; (self) relationship / (be) vanished / &gt;</td><td>you sort of feel like your relationship is kind of vanished</td></tr><tr><td>&lt; she / know (you) / &gt;.</td><td>if she really knew you would she</td></tr><tr><td>+ &lt; she / accept (you) &gt;2</td><td>could she accept you</td></tr></table></body></html>

6.3.1 Open modalizer tones down a closed or ambivalent segment

A second pattern of open modalization is also used in combination with closed or neutral statements, generally with strong affective tonality, with a potential for eliciting conflict and difficulty of expression for the client.

A simple combination juxtaposes an open modophoric serving as down-toner (in this illustration a "hedge') to a core term, valued negatively:

a sort of subterfuge

The same operation can apply to a predicate:

you kind of reproach yourself

More often in the session, modophorics are piled up, following close on one another, giving rise to a syntagmatics of accumulation. The clausal nucleus is modified through repetitive, even excessive means. Thus, the modal deployment of the core CN: $<$ you / blame (them) $>$ yields:

# somehow, sometimes, you kind of feel like blaming them

Multiple open modalizers are applied, sententially and to the predicate. "Sometimes' is an open modifier which tempers the pervasive quality of the event in the projected clause, thereby minimizing the absolute nature of the core notion ("blame"). "Somehow" and "kind of' are hedges, redundantly applied to an affective epistemic predicate. The epistemic status of the clause is made more mellow. "You feel like" adds a tentative epistemic to the core clause "blame (them)".

The statement "you sort of feel your relationship is kind of vanished" exemplifies the deployment of the actualized core nucleus "(self) relationship / (be) vanished' around a similar combination of modophorics, a hedged epistemic, with an additional hedge to the property "(be) vanished". Together, a softening of the blow is accomplished, allowing the client to adjust to the difficult projection. At the same time, the expansion of the epistemic clause lays the emphasis on the reflecting insightful (or epistemically deployed) subject.

# 6.3.2 Mixed closed and open modalizers

A mix of closed and open modalizers is another possible configuration. Based on the actualized nuclear sequence: "It cuts deep. Knowing you, will she accept you?", the therapist says:

it really cuts a little deeper if she really knew you would she could she accept you?

The first clause acts as a 'preface' to the main statement expressed in the following clauses. In it, a mixed modalization of closed and open modophorics is used. The adverb, "really", is used as a closed modalizer to stress the predicate "cut", while "a little" tones down "deeper". The second clause reproduces some of the same effects. "Really" emphasizes "knew". Here, the hypothetical form is used as an open (potential) modalization --"if she really knew you"-- to suspend the blow, thus transforming the modality of certainty into a possibility, a projected mental space. The rewording--"would she" "could she"-- which precedes "accept you"', (i) relies on more of the same hypothetical structure; (ii) modulates the multiple possibilities in moving from somewhat more abstractly determined forms of eventuality ("would'), to new forms of possibility ("could'). The introduction of multiple formats ("would" and "could') leaves the event open to interpretation.

A more subtle configuration of clausal contrast is provided by the following statement:

I guess you've been telling me you know what you want to do.

This wording, unusual in the session, is uttered in the latter part of the exchange, following extensive exploration of the client's experience and reflection. Here is illustrated a highly selective way of making use of the combination of open and closed modophorics. Open modophorics apply to the preliminary clausal sequence which indicate the epistemic and relational position of the therapist-speaker: "I guess you've been telling me". Closed modalization refers to the client's position: "you know what you want to do". In this instance,the therapist is "arresting" the client's position, enunciating a committed stance, while stating his own position as tentative. By contrast, the client's position becomes even more firm. This is an illustration of a concluding statement which affirms the client's cognitive and emotional experience, marking a point of narrative closure.

Rogers was interviewed at the end of the exchange about what he had thought of the session. It is remarkable that his language was no longer tentative. He no longer used open modalizers. He spoke as an established researcher. This observation seems to validate our understanding that extreme modophoric forms were used purposefully by the therapist in session with the client, to encourage alternative statements and open up her perception of new possibilities.

# 7. Conclusion

In order to analyze what is being done by speakers in multiple ways, the configuration of resources put to use, the ways of influencing and orienting the exchange through combination and repetition, it is essential to start working from large enough sequences. Only on that basis can the main feature of discourse modality be fully revealed: the cumulative effect of modophorics giving rise to a multidimensional syntagmatics, or syntagmatics of accumulation. An articulation with intonation patterns and prosody, in terms of rhythm, loudness and pitch, is needed. Modophorics are also constituents of expressive styles, motivating a plausible definition of style as the idiolectal implementation of modophorics.

It is surprising to find that it is possible to document the everyday means which therapists use to conduct their work. It is particularly important to identify the discursive resources solicited to intervene upon and influence the clients' speech, to understand what goes on. We do not suggest that such findings can guide professional practice mechanically. However, this type of analysis demonstrates the importance of strategic speech, its differentiation according to the utterer, and its significance in interpersonal terms.

Therapists use systematic means to structure their utterances into more "open" and "closed" forms. At times they pile up the modophorics unidimensionally. At other junctures, they combine "open" and "closed" forms and accomplish complex communication tasks of encouraging assertion while softening the blow, couching conflictual notions with cautious downtoners, positioning self in a tentative location while variously fostering the "potential self' of the client and its anchoring to reality. Extended modality reveals the broad lines and logic behind the speakers' statements. We do not claim that all therapists use modality in similar fashion. In fact, we would even argue that it is Rogers's particular emphasis on the potential of humanness of the client that led to his privileging open modophorics to the extent that he did.

# THE CONVERSATIONAL DYNAMICS OF INTERACTIONAL DISPUTE IN CONFLICTIVE CALLS FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE

A SINGLE CASE STUDY'

LUIS PEREZ-GONZALEZ Universidad Europea de Madrid

# Abstract

It is a widely held assumption that emergency lines such as 999 are oriented to the immediate mobilisation of the assistance-units required by a troubled citizen. Every now and then, however, the fatal consequences of certain controversial cases where a citizen fails to obtain the assistance required from an emergency organisation hit the headlines. Bearing in mind that the dispatch of the assistance-units is the result of a fateful negotiation between the caller and the organisational representative, it is reasonable to conclude that the latter's willingness/refusal to mobilise is contingent on what is being said in the course of the episode.

This paper sets out to look into those conversational phenomena that may result in the neglect of a request for emergency assistance. Our analysis is grounded in the functional description of conversational organisation as a network of linguistic choice-systems which operate at different points of the discourse; consequently, the actual unfolding of a certain conversation is the result of the succession of choices made by the interactants. In emergency encounters, callers are expected to furnish relevant information about the troublesome event, to do it in organisationally suitable terms and, above all, to follow the interactional trajectory set by the call-taker. For his/her part, the latter is expected to gather enough information for the dispatch of assistance units, but to do so without neglecting the actual contingencies which arise in the course of the ongoing encounter.

Occasionally, however, one of the parties departs from this routine dynamics. Any oppositional move on the part of one conversant will then have to be locally tackled by his/her co-interactant. Henceforth, the principles of sequential organisation will transform the context of talk and alter the interactive value of the ensuing utterances, such that a conflictive contribution may contaminate the remainder of the encounter and turn it into a dispute. This being the case, the actual management of the emergency is at stake and the citizens' request for service virtually neglected.

# 1. Introduction

999 calls for emergency assistance constitute a very specific type of service encounter which so far has been neglected by practitioners of conversational analysis from a linguistic or non-ethnomethodological standpoint. Callers dialling emergency numbers do so to get assistance for troublesome events in which they have been involved or which they have witnessed, whereas their organisational co-interlocutors strive to determine the type and urgency of the emergency before dispatching the assistance required. The intended outcome in emergency interaction --namely, the organisational mobilisation-- is pursued by means of the conversants' alternation at talk and the mutual interpretation of their contributions to the ongoing interaction. In other words, 999 calls are service encounters where the preservation of the caller's personal safety is contingent on the conversants' performance during a given interactional exchange over the phone.

Whalen, Zimmerman and Whalen (1988) have defined calls for emergency assistance as fateful' conversations whose consequences may become now and then the subject of public scrutiny. In this respect, they illustrate their point by referring us to an emergency call where the conversants' engagement in an interactional dispute results in the neglect of the help request and the subsequent death of the caller's mother.

The attribution of such a fatal denouement to the emergence of a dispute between the conversants highlights the central role and the constitutive function of talk in the activity of calling for emergency assistance. In their CA-based paper, Whalen et al. wonder why this misunderstanding occurred and argue that certain routinized conversational structures always correlate with the pursuit of a given institutional task; consequently, the departure by one of the conversants from the default interactional strategies will trigger off the co-interlocutor's efforts to restore the expected trajectory of the call; this being so, it is either the former's uncooperativeness or the latter's failure to reinstate the relevant interactional framework which turns the emergency call into a personal dispute with no possible return.

In the remainder of this paper we intend to tackle this issue from an alternative standpoint. It is our belief that a systemic approach to the analysis of conversational interaction can help the researcher to gain an accurate and deep understanding of the overall structure of conversation and of the interactional implications which arise from the conversants' compliance with/deviance from the normative discourse expectations which characterise a given conversational setting. It is well known that systemic functional linguistics seeks to systematise the range of choices available in the resources of a language and hence to

represent a language, or any part of a language, as a resource for making meaning by choosing. Each choice point in the network [the system network which results from the aforementioned modeling of the choices] specifies (1) an environment, consisting of choices already made, and (2) a set of possibilities of which one is (to be) chosen; (1) and (2) taken together constitute a 'system' in this technical sense. (Halliday 1985:xxvii)

As far as the scope of this paper is concerned, we intend to investigate how the precursors to and actual manifestations of interactional dispute can be accounted for by looking at the strategic choices made by the speakers in particular conversational environments and in the light of the other choices that might have been made under the same sequential constraints.

# 2. The role of choice within a systemic description of conversation

In attempting to test the relevance of systemic linguistics to the analysis of interactional dispute, we will first track down the earliest key contributions to the structural description of conversation; we will subsequently review some modifications and expansions of the original proposals; finally, we will examine in detail the role of choice within these functional studies of spoken interaction.

Drawing upon Halliday's (1961) earlier description of the units within the domain of grammar, Sinclair and Coulthard (1975) maintained the notion of rank scale' as the basic organising principle of classroom interaction; accordingly, the grammar/discourse unit at any given rank consists of one or a combination of the units located at the rank immediately below. In the ensuing discussion, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of the units postulated by this model; however, figure 1 below provides a schematic representation of the structural analogy which has been drawn between both rank scales:

![](img/f187d554838a62d651fef2030512505ea41bd9a7953ba460a6eedd52b428de4d.jpg)  
Figure 1. Correlations between the rank scales of grammar and discourse units

The rank of the exchange has attracted most of the analysts' attention, much as grammarians have concentrated on the rank of the clause (Sinclair 1992). In this respect, Sinclair & Coulthard's (S&C) model postulates the possibility of building a systemic description of the unfolding of classroom discourse which revolves around this unit. However, different analysts have demonstrated that most of the everyday forms of colloquial and institutional interaction cannot be accounted for by S&C's formulation of the exchange structure, usually represented as E(xchange) I(nitiation) R(esponse) F(ollow up). One of the most immediate implications of the ensuing structural reform is the addition of a new slot R/I which both Coulthard & Brazil (1981) (C&B) and Francis and Hunston (1992) (F&H) regard as optional.

The fact that certain moves may function 'as a response to the preceding element and as an initiation with respect to the following element' (C&B 1981:40) could result in the exchange containing two moves that belong to the same class. In this respect, C&B now argue that the exchange only carries one (potentially complex) piece of information and its polarity, and that the information and the polarity can only be questioned and asserted once (43). Consequently, the repetition of one of these constituents entails the existence of an exchange boundary between the recurring elements. With these new proposals, C&B aim to attain a wider applicability of the model without enlarging the restricted number of descriptive categories postulated in the original proposal.

From the outset, the systemic description of conversational structure has met the problem of the optionality/obligatoriness as far as the actual linguistic realisation of certain functional constituents of the exchange structure is concerned. In order to face this problem, C&B (1981) put forth the notion of 'predictability', whereby each move may be characterised as [ predictive] and/or [ predicted]: such a differentiation would thus constitute a first account of the issue of choice in conversation. To start with, I is always obligatory and predictive; consequently, it must be always followed either by R/I or by R. Second, R/I is optional and, when it occurs, is always predicted by the previous move; however, its initiating character renders it also predictive. Regardless of whether it follows I or R/I, R is always obligatory and therefore predicted. Finally, F is not subject to any of these two trajectories of predictability and is always optional.

However, this account of choice in conversation was soon called into question. Following her analysis of non-classroom exchanges, Berry (1981) challenged such a characterisation of F and illustrated her claim with the following examples:

Example 1a (Berry 1981:122) $\pmb { I }$ Quizmaster: in England, which cathedral has the tallest spire? $\pmb { R }$ Contestant: Salisbury. $ F$ Quizmaster: yes.   
Example 1b (Berry 1981:122) $\pmb { I }$ Son: Which English cathedral has the tallest spire? $\pmb { R }$ Father: Salisbury. $ F$ Son: oh ((good now I can finish my crossword).

In Berry's view, the third move in (1a) is obligatory insofar as the quizmaster is required to evaluate the correctness of the contestant's reply; on the other hand, the third move in (1b) is optional, inasmuch as it only indicates that the son has received the father's response. It is precisely this differentiation which allows Berry to gain a deeper insight into the nature of choice in conversation. Apart from the interpersonal' level of the exchange structure (1981:121), Berry also gives some thought to the 'ideational' or content-related one. According to this proposal, every exchange must contain an amount of information equivalent, at least, to a completed proposition: unless the first speakers complete the proposition themselves, their utterance narrows the range of choices for the completion of the former by their co-interactant.

In 1984, Halliday built on this idea and postulated that the unfolding of conversation is the result of the speakers' choices at different points of the discourse. The range of propositions which are negotiable at each point of the unfolding of the exchange constitute a system of choices. It should not be assumed, however, that the discourse expectations set by the first speaker constitute an immutable framework for the second speaker's contributions. In Halliday's (1985) view, human interaction is based on the exchange of goods/services, such that the initiating element (giving/demanding) entails the occurrence of its responding counterpart (receiving/giving). Now this response may be either the 'expected' or a discretionary' one: to put it in Burton's (1981) terms, the first one complies with or 'supports' the discourse framework set by the first speaker's initiation, whereas the discretionary response deviates from or 'challenges' those expectations.

In recent years, John Sinclair (1992) has contributed to this discussion by looking at the relationship which holds between the successive systems of choice in conversation, i.e. the 'interactive plane of discourse'. As far as the issue of choice is concerned, Sinclair advocates the existence of certain links between the successive systems of choice which operate within a single exchange structure, such that the systems mutually constrain one another: on the one hand, there is the mechanism of 'prospection' whereby the initiating move preempts what is going to happen next; on the other hand, the mechanisms of 'encapsulation' account for the possibility of a certain move capturing what has gone before.

We have seen so far how the notion of choice fits into the theoretical apparatus of the systemic analysis of conversation; in this respect, the consensus among the analysts is that certain systems of choices exist at various points in the discourse and that the act of choosing among the possibilities which configure the current system opens up a new one. In the following section, we will look at the actual choices and their location by turning to the analysis of our own data.

# 3. The data

The transcript of the emergency phone-call whose analysis we are about to undertake is presented in the fourth column of the final Appendix (SA), i.e. the one headed as [linguistic realisation]. In order to keep the size of this paper within manageable bounds, SA consists of 7 parallel columns. These represent simultaneously the different sets of analytical parameters which will be considered as this paper progresses. The reader's attention will be drawn to the relevant column as the need arises.

In this encounter, the caller (C) requests the dispatch of an ambulance to the place where he has just been held at gun point and attacked. In the course of the two-and-a-half-minutes exchange between C and the call-taker (CT), the original call for service turns into a personal dispute which results in the caller putting the phone down before the successful resolution of his request for assistance has been actually achieved.

This single case analysis is, to a certain extent, built out of our more extensive investigation into sixty calls for service to the switchboards of a number of British fire brigades, ambulance dispatch centres and police-stations (Perez Gonzalez, forthcoming). Accordingly, the reader will be occasionally referred to this more comprehensive piece of work on the organisation of emergency interaction; moreover, some of our claims in the following sections will be illustrated by excerpts from other 999 calls for purposes of presentation. Our aim is thus to use the principles of systemic functional linguistics to understand how the outcome of this particular emergency call is the result of the participants' conversational choices.

# 4. The system of analysis

The exposition regarding our system of analysis will first deal with the description and delimitation of the basic unit of interaction; secondly, it will proceed to systematise the different possibilities of combination displayed by the constituents of this basic unit. Finally, we will examine the actual structures of conversation in the light of the systems of choice which operate at certain points of the discourse, before moving on to the discussion of the results.

# 4.1 From the structural slots to the functional structural slots

This subsection sets out to describe systemicly those exchange-types which characterize 999 calls; also it intends to ascertain whether certain exchange-types can be associated exclusively with one of the two interactants.

Participants in 999 calls orientate to the resolution of the service requested by exchanging information about the emergency at issue; if we look at SA, we will notice that many of the exchanges within this call are two-move structures whose I and R elements are mapped onto two distinct speech functions, i.e. question and response respectively.' However, this is not always so, as we see in the following excerpt from another call:

Example 2a

(B.14; 012-015; modified) 012 CT: Whereabouts did he make his way from? 013 C: He was heading towards...uh...towards Torquay on the West Road. 015 CT: On the West road, right.

Consequently, it is not always possible to describe such exchanges as basic [demand-supply] 'adjacency pairs' (Sacks et al. 1974; Sacks 1992). Moreover, we have already explained that the analysis of the exchange structure in terms of organisational slots is not accurate enough to determine the circumstances under which the linguistic realisation of certain constituents becomes obligatory or merely optional. Given this difficulty of mapping certain moves and speech functions onto their respective structural slots, Berry's (1981) multi-layered approach to exchange structure opts to define the exchange structure in terms of functional structural slots. In the ensuing discussion we will restrict our exposition to the interpersonal layer of organisation, although we will refer to the remaining two where necessary. The analysis of our data in terms of functional structural slots is displayed in the second column of SA.

Among the types of exchange proposed by Berry, it is the knowledge- and action-orientated ones which prove more relevant to our analysis of dispute in 999 calls. Berry's study of the knowledge-orientated exchanges is based on the existence of a 'primary knower' -who knows the information required- and a 'secondary knower' -who receives the former. Similarly, the action-oriented exchanges result from the interaction between a primary actor' -who will perform the action requested-- and a 'secondary actor', i.e. the beneficiary of such an action. Consequently, X1 (K1 or A1) and $X 2$ (K2 or A2) are, respectively, the exchange slots where the primary knower/actor and secondary knower/actor perform their distinctive interactional roles.

The function X1 has to be realised obligatorily in each exchange. When used in combination with other functions, X1 will always follow X2, where the secondary interactant asks the primary knower/actor to supply the information or to perform the action in question:

Example 3a (SA2; 043-044; ex. 14) K2 043 CT: What is your name? K1 044 C: Uh- Wayne, I've just told you.   
Example 3b (A.14; 006-040; abridged) A2 006 C: Can you give us a hand, please? It's nine Hands-Handsworth Grove, Dayesmore. A1 038 CT: Yeah. Okay, Fire Brigade is on its way to you. 040 C: Okay.

Now example (2b) above shows that the secondary knower may opt to acknowledge the primary knower's move (line [015]). Likewise, the secondary actor in example (3b) also carries out this acknowledgment in line [040]. The slot of the exchange where such moves take place is labelled as X2f(again, K2f or A2f).

Berry's account allows for a fourth structural functional slot, i.e. delayed X1 or dX1 (dK1 or dA1). In everyday conversation, this slot is occupied by a move whereby the primary knower/actor delays the supply of the information or the performance of the action; such a deferral takes place in order to check or negotiate $\mathbf { \eta } ( i )$ whether the secondary knower already knows the information or $( \romannumeral 1 )$ to make sure that the secondary actor accepts the forthcoming action. Neither our SA nor the remainder of our corpus contains any example of dK1. As far as dA1 is concerned, we have found only the following instance:

Example 4 (B.4;069-071; modified) ((CT has asked C which is the number of the house reported)) dA1 069 C: Uh... if you want I'll have a look, yeah? A2 070 CT: Yeah. A1 071 C: Okay.

These four functional structural slots are subject to a number of formal constraints. Among them, let us highlight that X1 is always obligatory and that the realisation of the other slots is contingent on the occurrence of the former. Moreover, the four functions are 'sequentially ordered' (Berry, op. cit. 128), which means that X2, dX1 and X2f 'can be identified by their position in sequence relative to K1 [or X1] and to each other'. Accordingly, the recurrence of one of these functions entails the existence of an exchange boundary between the two realisations of the element in question.

Following such constraints, the functional structural formula proposed by Berry for the interpersonal layer of exchange structure can be represented as dX1 K2 X1 (X2f), which gives rise to the following combinations:

<html><body><table><tr><td>1. 2.</td><td>dX1 dX1</td><td>X2 X2</td><td>X1 X1</td><td>X2f</td><td>no example in SA example 4</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td></td><td>X2 X2</td><td>X1</td><td>X2f</td><td>examples 2b and 3b</td></tr><tr><td>4. 5.</td><td></td><td></td><td>X1 X1</td><td>X2f</td><td>examples 3a and 3b</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td></td><td></td><td>X1</td><td></td><td>no example in SA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>see SA2, exchange 12</td></tr></table></body></html>

Each exchange constitutes an interactional unit whereby a speaker A inquires about information which only B has or requests an action which only B can carry out. This relationship calls then for the equation between speaker B and primary interactant, as well as that between speaker A and secondary interactant. Now insofar as B is the primary knower/actor, s/he is not expected to initiate the exchange, which is tantamount to saying that our corpus will only show instances of exchanges initiated by the secondary interactant. Putting it in more concrete terms, the combinations (1) (2) (5) and (6) of Berry's formulation are not relevant to our study of dispute in emergency calls, as the first slot will not normally map onto an initiating move by the primary knower/actor, i.e. dX1 and X1. In sum, the two remaining combinations are:

4.2 From the synoptic to the dynamic constituents of the exchange structure

The inspection of our SA reveals that Berry's functional structural slots do not always cater for all the communicative needs of the interactants. Conversational interaction is not always successful: the interactants may fail to understand each other; they may wish to confirm the information obtained through a deficient hearing or even initiate the correction of what they regard as a wrong proposition. Similarly, they may decide to gather a certain amount of information before responding to a given question or simply express their disagreement with the current trajectory of the encounter. In order to account for such conversational contingencies, Ventola (1987:105) draws heavily upon Martin and advocates the differentiation between the 'synoptic' and 'dynamic' exchange systems; on the one hand, the former generates exchanges according to Berry's formula -and hence cater for the expected trajectory of the encounter; on the other hand, the latter are supposed to 'capture the potential dynamic aspects of genres more efficiently'-- and hence cater for any deviations from the typical generic unfolding of the conversational encounter. In the ensuing discussion, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with Ventola's taxonomy of dynamic moves.

SA provides examples of $( i )$ 'suspending moves' -both 'confirmations' (cf) and 'responses to confirmations' $( r c f ) –$ in exchange 13; (ii) 'elucidating moves' -both clarification-seeking moves $( c l f y )$ and responses to the latter (rclfy)-- in exchange 8; (ii) 'aborting moves', illustrated also by exchange 8. In this respect, the challenge $( c h )$ --which may be followed by a response to the challenge (rch)-- is related to Halliday's aforementioned concept of discretionary speech functions, insofar as challenging moves do not comply with the interactional expectations set by the immediately preceding one.

Now in that challenges are crucial to our study of conversational dispute, we will analyse them in more detail later in this paper.

The differentiation between the synoptic and dynamic systems of moves is conspicuous in the second and third columns of SA. The representation of these move-types in two different columns of the table allows the analyst to highlight the expected or discretionary character of each move with respect to the previous one. In order to account for the emergence of an interactional dispute, however, it is indispensable to render explicit the initiating/responding character of these synoptic and dynamic moves, as we do in the fifth column of SA. As opposed to the second and third columns --which display the difference between the status of synoptic and dynamic moves, the fifth column analyses both the synoptic and dynamic moves in terms of a common set of labels, i.e. I, R, F and C (challenge). SA indicates that knowledge-orientated exchanges usually consist of a typical initiating move (question) on the part of CT, followed by an unmarked or expected responding one (answer) by C; the exchange 4 of SA is the only instance of an exchange being terminated by a follow-up move. At any rate, the K2 function is usually realised by the question, whereas the K1 one usually correlates with the response. As far as the action-orientated exchanges are concerned, they are usually initiated by C's request for assistance, which corresponds to the A2 function.

The inspection of our corpus reveals that the responses provided by C in the first-type of exchanges are not always the expected ones; moreover, the responses to C's initiating moves in the action-orientated exchanges of this episode are noticeably absent from the surface linguistic form. Interestingly enough, both C's production of a discretionary/challenging answer, and thereby his withholding of a response are inextricably related to the shift from the synoptic to the dynamic system of exchanges. As opposed to the discretionary answers realised by the elucidating and suspending moves --e.g. (r)cf, (r)clfy in exchanges 7, 8, 13, 18, which can be straightforwardly analysed as the combination of an initiating and a responding move-- the aborting or challenging moves, map onto a different label (C) in the fifth column of SA. According to Burton (1991), challenges are those moves which encapsulate the previous ones and neutralise the interactive value that the latter would have displayed under unchallenged circumstances. As far as our sample analysis is concerned, challenges occur when

(i) C fails to provide CT with a response that complies with the relevant interactional expectations. Exchange 9 (SA) illustrates how C may answer without responding to CT's elicitation.   
(ii) CT ignores C's request for emergency assistance (A2), as in the first exchange of SA.

In sum, let us note that the challenging moves represented in the exchanges 9 and 1 illustrate one further interesting point. On the one hand, the first challenger's contribution gives the interactional floor back to CT without setting any specific expectations as to the expected ensuing move. On the other hand, the second challenge has different interactional implications, inasmuch as the challenger prospects the ensuing move in a more specific fashion, as is also the case with exchange 16. Such a differentiation between challenging moves will prove extremely useful for our analysis of dispute in 999 calls, as we will argue below.

# 4.3 Formulating the systems of choice in emergency interaction

The systems of choices which open at the boundaries between moves are very relevant to our research question; in English Conversation, Tsui (1994) sets out 'to examine the systems of choice operating at various points in the discourse and demonstrate how the actual development in conversation is the realisation of an ongoing process of choices made by speakers' (emphasis in the original; p. 217). Apart from her proposals regarding the systems of choices available at the initiating, responding and follow-up moves, Tsui's major contribution is the systematisation of the 'discourse maintenance choices' between moves, which constitute a qualitative advance with respect to Berry's systems of 'options available at places in the textual layer of structure' (1981:135).

Berry's and Tsui's proposals regarding the system of choices available at postinitiation, move-transition points overlap to a certain extent: basically, the major similarity between both models lies in their treatment of the issue of discourse framework and its maintenance. Drawing heavily upon Burton's (op. cit.) original formulation, both analysts allow for the possibility of the primary knower/actor's supporting or challenging the interactional expectations set by the secondary knower/actor's question/requestive. Such a system of choices opens up again once the responding move has been completed. The sixth column of SA represents the discourse maintenance systems which apply at every stage of the unfolding of the exchange structure; in its turn, the seventh one displays the conversant's actual choice among the paradigm of all the possible alternatives.

Our analysis of choice at move-transition places draws upon Tsui's treatment of this issue, insofar as her systematisation of the range of choices available is more detailed and thorough than Berry's. The first system of discourse maintenance $( T \bar { \imath } )$ opens once the initiating move has been completed. Although Tsui's system allows for further choices, only this section of the network is relevant to our research question:

![](img/8d1a1b7f0b6413128117685081f9304f8d27a82405462fd0dbf6fe4defd15067.jpg)

Exchange 14 in SA illustrates how --- once the first speaker has produced the initiating move--- the second speaker makes the choice of supporting the active discourse framework and producing a relevant answer. In exchange 3 of SA, however, CT challenges the interactional expectations set by the previous request for action and tells C that some additional information is required before the assistance can be dispatched. Finally, in exchange 18 of the sample analysis, CT does not maintain the discourse framework and opts to produce another initiation which allows him to shift from the synoptic to the dynamic system of the exchange structure. The full significance of this shift is what we intend to address in this section.

The second system of discourse maintenance $( T r )$ opens once the responding move (X1) has been completed. As far as the knowledge-orientated exchanges are concerned, these are the relevant systems of choices:

![](img/6cde8d6d424f39b9b80769c1162d713c17c5cbf6a2b015000c6ad5b6b9101d5e.jpg)

As the following examples reveal, the speaker who produces a responding move may either hold or transfer the interactional floor to his co-interactant.

Example (5) below shows how C retains the floor in order to initiate an actionorientated exchange. Exchanges 4 and 19 illustrate the set of choices which open up when the answerer hands over the interactional floor. This being the case, the next speaker is faced with the choice of either complying with or deviating from the active discourse framework; insofar as these choices have been explained already, we will refer the reader to the analysis in SA for the illustration of these two possibilities.

Example 5 (SA2; 003-004; ex. 2-3)   
K2 003 CT: Where are you? 1 Ti [+main/R]   
K1 004 C: In the town centre of Birmingham. R Tr [S.S./- main/I]   
A2 004 C: Can you hurry up please?

Before ending this section, however, we deem it necessary to draw the reader's attention to the type of discourse framework enacted by the challenging moves that occur in our sample analysis. An inspection of this conversational episode reveals that such challenges appear to set two different types of interactional expectations.

As example 5 shows, the system of discourse maintenance which opens after the production of a challenging move may be a $T r$ one. In these cases, the challenger will hold the floor in order to produce two consecutive moves: in the first one, he acknowledges the presuppositions which his co-interactant's prior initiating move had set up. His second move, however, constitutes the initiation of a new exchange, such that the co-interactant's previous expectations are thus neutralised. We propose to label these moves as encapsulating challenges.

Alternatively, it is a $T i$ system of discourse maintenance which opens after the challenging move represented in exchange 16, since the challenger totally ignores the discourse framework enacted by the previous speaker and moves straight on to the initiation of the next exchange without having cancelled the former. We will identify such moves as prospecting challenges.

To summarise: I have been suggesting that the exchanges which configure the service section of 999 calls consist usually of two moves at the synoptic stratum of discourse structure; in broad terms, Cs initiate the action-orientated exchanges, whereas CTs initiate the knowledge-orientated ones. Such initiating moves predict specific responses, although the systems of choices available to the speakers allow for the possibility of deviating from the normative expectations.

# 5. Discussion

According to Ventola's (1987:119) study of service encounters, Service (S) is that section of the interaction which is located between the 'service bid' and the 'resolution' of the episode and regarded as the most 'genre-defining' stage of each encounter type. The nuclear activity involved in emergency calls consists of a need, i.e. the request for assistance, and a compliance, i.e. the dispatch of the help required. As is also the case with Ventola's data, our corpus demonstrates that the negotiation and accomplishment of the nuclear activity in 999 calls requires more than one exchange; in this respect, the stretch of discourse which spreads between the request for assistance and the organisational response has been identified elsewhere as 'interrogative section' (IS) (cf. Zimmerman 1984; Whalen & Zimmerman 1987; Eglin & Wideman 1986; Whalen and Zimmerman 1990; Whalen 1994; Perez Gonzalez: forthcoming).

As far as our sample analysis is concerned, the interrogative series begins after C's request for emergency assistance (SA, 002); however, as a result of the interactional dispute which emerges in the course of the IS, C puts the phone down before actually obtaining CT's response. This is precisely the issue on which we are about to focus: in other words, we hope to explain in which ways the systemic approach to conversation analysis proves relevant to the study of the emergence of dispute.

# 5.1 The generic constituents of the Interrogative Sequence (IS)

As mentioned above, line [001] of SA conveys C's direct request for emergency assistance. CT's ensuing move (line [002]), however, introduces a first challenge to this initiation in the shape of a 'temporization' (Tsui, op. cit.), whereby CT defers or postpones the supply of the response required by his co-interactant. It is precisely CT's following move (also line [003]) which reveals the reasons for such a deferral, i.e. the dispatch of assistance units is contingent on the previous fulfilment of a number of institutional requirements.

According to Merritt (1976:352), CT's challenge and subsequent positioning of a question after C's request should invite the latter to analyse the relevance of the second elicitation and its answer to CT's eventual decision. In other words, CT's placing of a question (where are you) after C's explanation of his need marks the initiation of the IS; this fragment of the encounter should allow CT to elicit and gather enough information about the nature of the emergency for a thorough assessment of the type of problem and the urgency of the assistance required. Consequently, it should be stressed that the succession of exchanges which configures the IS progresses while the compliant answer to the initial request is still pending (Whalen and Zimmerman 1987; Perez 1995).

In Ventola's view, the structure of S within a given type of service encounter can be differentiated from others only by who initiates the exchange and with what kind of slot' (1987:123). In emergency calls, the exchanges which configure IS are basically knowledge-orientated structures initiated by CT by means of a K2 slot, whereas the fundamental nuclear exchange is an action-orientated structure initiated by C with a A2 function. Accordingly, the analyst may expect that the succession of CT-initiated exchanges which constitute this fact-seeking sequence' (Sharrock and Turner 1978) or \*complaint-remedy bracket' (Zimmerman 1984) will display certain patterns which hold across particular instances of a given service encounter.

![](img/5e42cda17371a32ac0033dec788f5e904019dd44cf0d41e3f7927720a41c5838.jpg)  
Figure 2. A schematic representation of the generic stages in SA

As we have demonstrated elsewhere (Perez, forthcoming), our data show that it is possible to identify several goal-oriented generic stages' which hold across the majority of ISs: in that space precludes discussing those findings in detail, let us just mention that each stage -consisting of a number of exchanges which are, in their turn, formed by a combination of synoptic and dynamic moves-- is intended to complete a proposition regarding a given aspect of the emergency which is crucial to the organisational mobilisation. $^ 2 \mathbf { A }$ graphic representation of the generic stages in SA can be found in Fig. 2 above. Having postulated the existence of the functional generic stages, we are now in the position to map each of these requirements onto a given functional generic stage of IS and to gain some insight into the interactional effect of the aforementioned challenge which CT produced right in his very first turn at talk. This issue is particularly important for our ensuing analysis, insofar as it leads us to conclude that the IS in 999 calls usually involves more than the simple determination of the nature of the problem.

# 5.2 First segment: setting the ground rules in emergency interaction

Going back to our sample analysis, CT defers his response to C's request for assistance by focusing on his co-interactant's whereabouts. Initially, C complies with CT's questions (SA; 004) but he immediately reiterates his request, which is now reinforced by an urgency marker (can you hurry up please). This second expression of need is aborted (006) much in the same way as before, although this time CT makes explicit the goal of his interrogation (I need to get the details of where you are); subsequently, he resumes the interrogation in order to complete the generic stage at issue and inquiries about C's location on two more occasions (007; 010).

The relevance of the locational data to the dispatch of the ambulance is evident even for an emotionally distressed C, who complies with CT's requirements time and time again. However, his partial responses (008; 011) prove to be insufficient for CT's processing needs: as a result, C initiates a third action-seeking exchange (012) with a move which consists of a recycled urgency marker (can you hurry up please?) and an expletive (I'm shitting myself here). In his turn, CT produces a third challenging temporisation by shifting the focus of his interrogation on to the nature of the problem and hence on to a new generic stage. In sum, this is the third C-initiated request for action whose expected outcome is deferred by CT. The emergence of the expletive at the end of the first generic stage indicates that C is not willing to have his request delayed indefinitely and that he seems to have started calling into question the relevance of the interrogative series to the resolution of the need which is still pending.

Interestingly enough, similar changes seem to affect CT's interactional stance as the conversation unfolds. In order to illustrate our claim, let us look at the three challenging moves produced by CT so far, which we present now in aggregated form:

002 CT: Well, give me your address first.   
006 CT: Wait a minute. I need to get the details of where you are.   
013 CT: Would you answer my questions please?

If we characterise these moves according to the classification proposed above (cf. section [4.2]), we may conclude that they are all intended to cancel C's interactional expectations before CT actually moves on to initiate another move/ exchange. However, such an aborting encapsulation has different implications in each case: on the one hand, the first challenge merely introduces the object of the ensuing question; the second challenge highlights the relevance of the ongoing interrogation to the final resolution of the encounter; finally, the third challenge -which follows C's first expletive, attempts to make C aware of the normative expectations that should determine the unfolding of every 999 call.

Insofar as CT's challenge in line [013] is intended to demand a compliant interactional stance from C the systems of discourse maintenance which open at different points of each exchange in 999 calls are not 'equiprobable' but 'skewed' (Ventola, ibid.:103). Consequently one of the choices is more desirable to be selected than the other alternatives. Putting it in more concrete terms: if we look at the set of options which configure the $\pmb { T } \pmb { i }$ and $\pmb { T r }$ networks represented above, it is the choices corresponding to the $[ +$ discourse maintenance] section of the system that C should stick to in order to comply with the ground rules of emergency interaction.

# 5.3 The precursors of dispute: interactional asynchrony and departure from the normative expectations

After his third challenge to the caller's need [013], CT focuses on the nature of the reported trouble and, as was also the case with the previous generic stage, C complies provisionally with CT's elicitations [015]; this time, however, it takes C only one exchange to show his scepticism about the relevance of CT's question by means of the recurring expletive [018].

Line 018 of our transcript is particularly consequential as far as the ensuing trajectory of the episode is concerned. Immediately after responding to CT's probe for the nature of the trouble, C initiates the fourth assistance-seeking exchange;

nevertheless, this fourth request relies exclusively on the recurring expletive $( I ^ { \prime } m$ shitting myself here) which C had previously used as a complementary urgency marker. It is obvious that such an expletive can only be interpreted as a requestive because of its sequential placement within the ongoing discourse framework; in other words, it constitutes a mood-marked or incongruent realisation of the requestive move. As Ventola (1987:94) has pointed out:

Interactants play with the system by using incongruent realizations consciously... Incongruent realizations are common in a genre such as service encounters; customers seem to favour incongruent commands for getting the servers to get the goods they want.

Now the strategy which C is pursuing by means of these mood-marked utterances cannot be regarded as successful in the light of CT's ensuing temporisation [019]. In this respect, CT's challenge constitutes a particularly meaningful alteration of his interactional stance: for the first time, CT does not bother to cancel the discourse expectations which C's prior requestive had set up. Far from that, he ignores C's presuppositions and moves on to initiate a new generic stage -i.e. a [focus on C's identity] one-- which reaches line [024]. The effects of these qualitative shifts of both C's and CT's interactional behaviour on the ensuing conversation are readily noticeable:

(i) On the one hand, this stage provides us with C's first two challenges [020; 024] to the CT-initiated, knowledge-orientated exchanges which configure IS. In both cases, C's choices are crucial insofar as his answers constitute the first explicit refusals to submit to the institutional requirements, i.e. reveal his own identity.   
(ii) Even more important is the role of the dynamic exchange represented in lines [021- 022] of our transcript. In this respect, C's account of the reasons whereby he refuses to say his name [020] is misheard by CT, who initiates then an elucidating exchange aimed to clarify his co-interlocutor's answer [021]; interestingly enough, C takes advantage of this call for the replay of his previous response and realigns by giving his name at this second opportunity. Such a move, however, has important consequences: drawing upon Clayman (1985), Whalen et al. observe that 'displaying realignment by modifying a prior position cannot be done wholly at random; such modifications must occur for some demonstrable reason and be heard as ultimately consistent with what was previously said. In the absence of an explanation reconciling the discrepancy... the status of the latter [in this case, C's final acceptance to supply the information previously denied] as a reliable basis for deciding the dispatch is undermined' (pg. 352). Putting it in other words, in that C's identity has been revealed by means of the process explained above, CT is not likely to consider such information as reliable as he might have done otherwise; in fact, we should note that the issue of C's identity becomes again the object of CT's interrogation later in the encounter (037).

As intimated above, the situation of interactional conflict caused by the conversational asynchrony between the conversants in the previous generic stage was a reversible one; despite CT's successive deferrals of the organisational response, his intervention made C aware of the normative expectations, such that the latter answered CT's questions before producing a new upgraded version of the original request. In his turn, CT produced encapsulating challenges, which cancelled C's expectations before the initiation of the next generic stage. Line 018 of our transcript, however, constitutes a break point as far as these interactional dynamics are concerned. To begin with, C's reformulations of the request for help are now expressed through incongruent formats which attempt to alter the interpersonal relationship between the co-interlocutors in his own benefit: in that he is now aware of the normative rules of 999 interaction, C's use of incongruent formats constitutes an intentionally deviant move. Second -as a result of this shift at the interpersonal level of generic structure-- CT opts for prospecting challenges which deliberately ignore C's presuppositions, in order to restore the institutionally relevant framework. This being so, C takes his uncollaborative disposition further and, for the first time, challenges the organisational representative. Consequently, the origins of the dispute are to be found in the succession of C's uncollaborative moves and CT's prospecting challenges, i.e. C's 'oppositional moves' and CT's 'oppositional counter-moves' respectively (Whalen et al.).

# 5.4 The confirmation of the interactional dispute

The inspection of our sample analysis shows that the conversational dynamics set up by the speakers during the third generic stage (i.e. the one we have just discussed in the previous section) is maintained throughout the remainder of the conversational episode:

(i) In spite of CT's directions as to what is expected in 999 interaction, C's performance during the second half of the call remains characterised by his oppositional moves: in broad terms, this type of behaviour manifests itself in the reiteration of responses which have proved to be insufficient at previous stages of the call. As lines [029, 038] and [043] show, certain informing moves on the part of C may turn out to be regarded by CT as uncollaborative contributions only because of the discourse framework in which they occur.   
(ii) Finally, C's incongruent reformulations of the original request [027, 041] face either the aforementioned prospecting challenge [042] or another type of temporisation which focuses on the mood-marked character of the request: in this respect, challenges such as the one represented in lines [026-028] focus on the interpersonal component of the request rather than on the request itself.

The results of our analysis would seem to suggest that the interactive meaning of a given utterance does not only depend on its role within the exchange structure, but also on its structural location within those larger units which we have called generic stages. In order to understand the reasons why C decides to start producing mood-marked requests for assistance, it is necessary to bear in mind that C has already met a number of temporisations which have led him to modify his original disposition; on the other hand, CT's shift from encapsulating to prospective challenges will be better understood if set against CT's previous failures to impose the relevant ground rules of emergency interaction. In other words, each move is to be examined with regard to the other constituents of the exchange, but also in relation to other instances of that same move-type which have occurred within previous generic stages of the episode.

The analysis of the IS section of our sample analysis demonstrates that C reiterates his request for help each time he seeks the termination of the ongoing generic stage. In their turn, CT's ensuing challenges postpone the supply of the answer and constitute the boundary after which a new generic stage begins. Fig. 2 on page 279 provides a schematic representation of the generic structure of the IS of our sample analysis.

In sum: it is the position of an utterance within a given exchange which allows the analyst to characterise it as compliant with/deviant from the current discourse framework; however, it is the analysis of such an utterance in relation to its counterparts within previous generic stages which allows the analyst to deal with the shifts in the co-interactants' disposition, and thereby to account for the emergence of the interactional dispute.

In the very last fragment of our sample analysis, seemingly informative and requestive moves occurring in certain types of sequential context fail to be interpreted by the other speaker as such. C's last attempt to accomplish his interactional goal [052] is followed by a temporisation on CT's part [053] which brings us back to earlier stages of the call. It is at this point that C decides to quit and puts the phone down.

# 6. Conclusion

In the previous sections, we have looked at the reasons why a phone-call for emergency assistance may fail to trigger off the organisational mobilisation, such that the request for help is eventually neglected. Moreover, we have attempted to gain insight into the relationship which holds between this outcome and the conversants' engagement in an interactional dispute. It is particularly noteworthy that our study of such a peculiar interactional denouement allows us to account for the emergence of the dispute as the result of a succession of choices on the part of both interactants. We have also been able to pin down the processes whereby interactants make use of language as a resource to make their own meanings and build their own conversational strategies.

We have suggested that the pursuit of the organisational mobilisation correlates with certain routinized conversational structures. In broad terms, an emergency call consists of a basic action-orientated exchange (request for help/assistance) whose constituents are separated by a succession of knowledge-orientated exchanges dealing with specific aspects of the emergency reported. As explained above, it is CT's duty to control the trajectory, stages and length of the knowledgeorientated exchanges which configure the interrogative series.

The institutional constraints, however, do not constitute an immovable social background: in other words, they are not fixed structures which impose on the conversants' choices. The caller's emotional distress, for instance, may prevent him from realising the relevance of the call-taker's interrogation to the dispatch of the assistance required. Therefore, his ensuing uncooperative attitude may be built on conversational choices which do not belong to those systems favoured by the call-taker: interestingly, the latter's efforts to tackle the caller's deviant choices and to put the conversation back on the institutionally right track frequently clash with the interests of the caller, who will then regard the call-taker's contributions as hostile.

It is also important to note that the systems of choices are to be looked at from a double standpoint: since the inspection of our data suggests that dispute manifests itself through regular patterns of conversation, it is interesting to analyse a given choice by setting it against $( i )$ the other possibilities available at that point of the exchange structure -i.e. the paradigmatic axis of choice-- and against (ii) the choices which have been already made at analogous places in previous stages of the encounter -and which constitute thus the syntagmatic axis of choice in conversation. Putting the issue in more concrete terms, the analysis of choice within an exchange unit as well as within a given generic stage of the interrogative series allows the researcher to account not only for the emergence of the dispute but also for its development.

If we were to summarise what has been proposed in this paper, we may conclude that the dispute emerges as a result of the interactional asynchrony between the conversants. The most conspicuous manifestations of this asynchrony are the caller's attempts to terminate the CT-initiated interrogative section, insofar as the latter delays the supply of the organisational assistance. In order to do so, the caller will attempt to challenge CT's knowledge-orientated exchanges by initiating several action-orientated exchanges which, in their turn, are successively aborted by the call-taker.

Finally, we believe that the implications of our analysis are twofold; on the one hand, the researcher's acquaintance with the interactants' vulnerabilities may help him/her to devise certain efficiency-seeking strategies for the management of the call, especially in those encounters involving emotionally distressed individuals. On the other hand, the systemic description of interactional dispute allows the researcher to draw conclusions about the emergence of this phenomenon by looking at actual conversational data, i.e. recordings and transcripts. This being so, there is no need to appeal to the analyst's subjective hypotheses about the conversants' personality or the latter's internal cognitive and interpretative processes.

# FRIENDS OR STRANGERS ONLY THEIR PHASES SHOW FOR SURE

KAREN MALCOLM University of Winnipeg

# Abstract

This paper compares the casual conversations of two dyads of university women using the descriptive methodology known as phasal analysis. In both dyads neither interactant knew the other at the outset of the recording session; however, during the initial stages of the conversation one dyad realized that they shared far more than their university context. The significant change in their discourse which resulted reveals how the language of 'strangers' differs from the language of 'friends'. Phasal analysis captures not only how changes in the interpersonal relationship affect the spontaneous and dynamic 'structuring' of this complex register, but also highlights how speakers continually and cooperatively exchange communicative power during their conversation. The second conversation is interesting not only for reasons of its interpersonal shift, but also because the interactants misjudged the extent of the shift and the conversation almost 'broke down' as a consequence.

In the early eighties Michael Gregory and I noticed in our analyses of both literary and non-literary discourse that there were passages of tri-functional consistency which we called 'phases'. When I speak of function in this context I am referring to Halliday's metafunctions (1994:34-36): the experiential, interpersonal and textual functions of language, corresponding to his ideas of 'clause as representation' realized by the systems of transitivity; 'clause as exchange' realized by the systems of mood and modality, and 'clause as message' realized by theme and rheme etc. So, when Gregory and I analyzed children's discourse in terms of these systems, and the structures therein, we began to see how the patterns which reflected the various metafunctions did not shift one at a time as the discourse progressed, nor did these selections change continuously. They changed in an interdependent way, with the selections made in one system influencing the selections made in the other. And these shifts were not continuous, but intermittent. As a consequence the discourse was 'structured' in a 'dynamic' way, by brief chunks of tri-functional consistency. As we analyzed a variety of texts with different registerial characteristics, we began to realize that such brief passages of trifunctional consistency were common to all communication. We had uncovered a 'unit', which we called 'phase', which was larger than the sentence/utterance, and usually included more than the adjacency pair of speech act theorists. Really, it was not a unit at all in the sense that units usually classify static predictable phenomenon, but was a spontaneously and unconsciously occurring patterning or 'structuring' principle beyond sentence/utterance.

Since then 'phase' has proved a most useful way of describing how encoders organize their discourse 'above' the sentence dynamically, as the communicative event unfolds. In my work on extended texts I have been interested to discover that phases sometimes reveal even larger 'structuring' principles at work. In some texts several distinct phases seem to evolve gradually forming a continuous string, still tri-functionally consistent, but at a more general degree of delicacy. In others individual phases form discontinuous phasal strings, where the tri-functional consistency that identifies one phase may disappear, only to reappear some moments or sentences later. (Actually, this latter phenomenon seems more typical of speech than written discourse; however, some authors write in this way, particularly those attempting to capture some of the nuances of the spoken mode, dramatists most notably (cf. Malcolm 1991, 1992)). What proves even more fascinating, but perhaps not that surprising, is the correlation between such broader structuring principles and the interpersonal relationship between the encoder and decoder (cf. Malcolm 1987). My analyses reveal that 'strangers', who have not met before, who have not shared any prior communicative situations, structure their discourse in either isolated phases or continuous phasal strings. Strings which evolve gradually, naturally, in a way which facilitates decoding. However, 'friends' who have already established a pool of shared experiences, both linguistic and non-linguistic, structure their communication in a discontinuous way: where one set of phasal consistencies might end at one point only to return moments, or perhaps even weeks later (as they return to a discussion of the same experience from much the same personal point of view with a similar purpose or function in mind, and making many of the same textual selections).

My current research focuses on this correlation between interpersonal relationship and discourse structuring. To this end I have recently extended my corpus of four casual conversations between young Canadian adults attending university to include six more conversations between university students, some rather older than others. Two of these conversations have piqued my interest particularly, and this paper will focus on these. In one conversation the two interactants, Sarah and Sharon, were proceeding quite normally given their university context by introducing themselves in terms of the courses they were taking, their majors and so on, when they realized that they knew someone in common. Sarah's sister was Sharon's close friend. This recognition encouraged them to uncover a shared world of experience around this third person which they could then discuss, in a more intimate way than they could discuss university which was relevant to them in a more restricted and superficial way. In the other conversation, the women, Sarah again, but this time speaking to Diane, never discovered such a hidden resource of shared knowledge, and in the ten minutes of their conversation seldom ventured beyond the constraints of their common university experience. Although I was originally interested in these two texts for what they would reveal about the correlation between interpersonal relationships and discourse structuring, as it turned out what they revealed about the maintenance and exchange of communicative power was equally interesting.

Both conversations began in much the same way: the two interactants introduced themselves. In both cases, the participating dyads did not know each previously; however, they were far from strangers. Their common university experience was obvious to them: a particular professor had requested they participate in the project, and the 'required' conversation was to take place in the professor's office on a day when both were on campus. The question was 'How would the dyads use this shared pool of experience to reduce the interpersonal distance between them?' For decreasing the social distance seems to be one of the prime motivations for actually cooperating in casual talks; that is when there is not a more overt agenda like informing, teaching, entertaining, arguing etc. In the first conversation, involving dyad#1: Sarah and Diane, after a cursory selfidentification "I'm Sarah, I'm Diane", Sarah continued with "What other class do you take with her?" And later in the discourse she added "Is it it's your first year?" Sarah's conversation with Sharon (dyad #2) began along the same lines "You're a first year second year student?", to which Sharon replied, "No I'm a first year student. I'm actually I'm in rhetoric that's how she's my prof. What are you taking?"

Sarah and Diane did not stray far from their university context during their entire ten minute conversation. In phase one they identified themselves to each other by discussing the courses they were taking. In phase two one of the women complained that one of her professors was unfair. In phase three both complained about their political science class; in phase four they complained in greater depth about their sociology professors. In phase five there was a moment of respite as they interrupted their complaints with further identification, historically-inclined although still related to their university experience: they shared when they had graduated from highschool and where they were from. In phase six they explored the one unpredictable event in the entire conversation: the story about a day when their professor's son had visited each of their classes. In phase seven, one of the women added some relevant background to her version of the story before extrapolating beyond it in phase eight to her experience of children at her place of employment. This is the single instance where the interlocutors' discourse explored personal experiences beyond those predictable in their university context. However, it was directly related to their experience with the child visiting their classes. In phase nine one woman talked about her interest in one discipline; in phase ten the other woman talked about her future in another. This led to a discussion of more immediate academic futures: which university to attend (phases eleven to thirteen). And this led to a more general discussion of career aspirations in phase fourteen. Following that, one of the women re-introduced the current situation: the recording of their conversation, and after that the women seemed merely to be biding time until their session came to a close with 'camera' talk (they were being videoed), speculations as to the focus of the project, and finally a few comments about the physical environment. They never tread far beyond the very predictable experiences available to them in the university context: professor and course complaints, and areas of academic and career interest. The one exception was the discourse generated by the one unpredictable event in their shared context: the boy's visit. It is important to remember that the phases which I have used to describe this discourse, are not merely defined by experiential criteria, although my 'topical' appellations may appear to belie this: phases are spontaneously occurring passages of tri-functionally consistency.

The beginning of the conversation did not prepare me for such predictability. After their predictable opening, Sarah had asked "Do you like it?" referring to a particular course. And soon thereafter Diane had lodged her first complaint concerning unfair professors. In many registers of discourse 'likes' and 'dislikes' are considered rather intimate forms of discourse which are not generally explored between 'strangers', certainly not at the outset of an interchange. However, perhaps this is not always true: perhaps complaints, as long as they are very standard complaints, promote group solidarity which effectively reduces the social distance between interlocutors, and hence is an appropriate experiential focus to explore at an early stage in a conversation in this context. The women's discourse that followed attests to the difficulty of changing the negative tenor of the discourse, which did not happen until phases five and six where the two re-introduced themselves in terms of their immediate history and then carried on with the boy in the classroom' story.

Sarah and Diane's casual exchange was also predictable in terms of its 'cooperative completeness', and its gradual structural evolution, described by continuous phasal strings which typify the discourse of interpersonally distant, 'strangers'. After the isolated identificatory phase one, phases two to four evolved gradually, comprising what I have called the 'complaint' block of discourse. Then there was a brief intermission in phase five which re-introduced the phase one concerns of identification but using a rather different assortment of linguistic selections. Phases six to eight recounted kid' tales, phases nine and ten focussed on favourite courses, which initiated the academic future talk of phases eleven to fourteen. Situationally-related small talk accounted for the final phases fifteen to eighteen. They were described block on block of related phases, often closely enough related to obscure phasal distinctions, but with questions highlighting phasal boundaries as new experiences with their attenuating interpersonal and textual selections were introduced.

Despite its predictability, the analyst would have to call dyad #1's conversation 'successful' in that the participants seemed to enjoy themselves thoughout, they laughed now and then, and their discourse changed gradually as their interpersonal distance diminished with the continuation of their linguistic cooperation and participation. At their most intimate, in the middle of the conversation where, for a brief moment, they explored experiences beyond the university, their utterances were more complex syntactically, and their phases were longer. Throughout the discourse the women seemed sensitive to and respectful of the communicative power held by the encoder. In the beginning of their exchange they shared the encoding power turn by turn, and as their levels of trust increased they maintained the mutuality of this conversational control by alternating phasal dominance: one encoder would dominate the linguistic selections made in an entire phase, and then hand control over to the other participant to command in the next phase.

The second discourse was quite different, both in terms of discourse structure and the exchange of communicative power, despite the similarity of its low key beginning. As might be expected Sarah and Sharon used their conversation initially to establish a relationship. To this end they began the process of self-identification by classifying themselves in terms of their year of study "Yer a first year second year student?", then justifying their inclusion in this project by specifying the nature of their relationship to the professor involved "she's my prof what are you taking?". In phase two one of the women told the humourous anecdote of how she was grabbed' by the professor and asked to participate. Following this short narrative the women returned to the combination of linguistic choices which I described as phase one for a moment, before taking a courageous plunge into more personally revealing discourse removed from their mutually experienced university context: self-identification from a historical perspective "But I just moved in September from Montreal'. Sarah responded to Sharon's admission with "How do you like it [here]?" acknowledging and obviously accepting the proported shift in interpersonal relationship. After a positive response Sharon began to lament her difficulties retaining her fluency in French. This led to the introduction of a character called Kemlin who changed the course of the discourse to follow.

In an interesting series of recognitions "it's my sister's um best friend", and then "Yer Theresa's sister' the two interlocutors came to realize that they both knew not only the Kemlin character, but more importantly, Theresa his friend. Theresa was Sarah's sister and Sharon's friend. Once the two realized that they shared much more than their university context, it was dropped quickly, and the women spent virtually the rest of their discourse exchanging Theresa stories through which they sought to further diminish the social distance separating them and perhaps eventually lapse into 'new found friend' banter. It wasn't that simple though, as the rest of their discourse revealed.

After the first three phases of identification revolving around their university experience, followed by the fourth phase in which the recognition took place, the women continued the process of solidifying their new relationship by contextualizing it. In phase five Sharon reminded Sarah of an incident where she had actually greeted her via Theresa "remember she called home and left this message... like when your mom was away... and she said Sharon's going to say hi'; Sarah responded "Oh that was you... oh wild'. Following Sharon's lead in further identifying herself by describing her relationship with the third party: Theresa, Sarah then proceeded to develop her relationship to Theresa in a comparison contrast phase (six) "Well you certainly wouldn't guess us being sisters eh?". After Sharon responded with the rather unpredictable "your face is not like hers... but your mannerisms are", she returned to her bilingual dilemma and the aforementionned Kemlin character, both signalling a momentary return to phase three linguistic choices. Sarah did not prompt her to develop this experience, but after a few evaluative feedback signals "oh really...yeah... great great", left the identification and recognition talk behind and headed into new terrain.

By this point in the conversation the women seemed to have established a comfortable and quite familiar relationship, so they could use their discourse to explore new experiences rather than further refine their interpersonal relationship. The descriptive and syntactically simple personal orientation of their early talk increased in complexity as it took a narrative turn in the lengthy phases seven, eight and nine involving new participants in new events and new circumstances. In phase seven Sarah told of a joke she had heard on the radio where Kemlin was said to have been "wrestling a pigeon in the back of McDonalds". In phase eight Sharon began to recount some school election gossip which she called the Walters Affair'. In phase nine Sarah introduced another juicy tidbit of election gossip revolving around a 'Zony' character. In terms of the initiator of the phase it might look as if the discourse were cooperatively and equally shared by both women taking turns introducing new experiences. However, one of the most interesting features of this text was, that it wasn't: the attempt was made, but it failed.

Back to the wrestling joke of phase seven. Because Sarah was the one who heard the joke she, as knower, was the one who held the communicative power in the situation. However, Sharon participated very actively: asking if she remembered who had told the joke, reacting quite strongly "she's going to flip", later "I'm starting to get a little pissed off about it", and eventually supplying the context of the joke so even the analyst had a way of appreciating it "I mean she's a full blown vegetarian and a and a even the mention of McDonalds in the same sentence". As it turned out Sharon, knowing the relevant background, seemed to have a greater interest in the gossip than Sarah had information: in response to Sharon's request for more information she revealed "I can't remember... I was trying to write a paper"'. Sharon used a final comment "they've got to be careful about what's being said over the air at this point' to end the wrestling anecdote and introduce the next bit of gossip because of the implications of everything that's been happening and especially with the elections and like John Walters or as we called it the Walters Affair". What was most notable about phase eight was the power shift between the two interlocutors. The previous phase ended up with an equal distribution of power: Sarah was the 'knower' of the actual event they were talking about, but Sharon was the 'knower' of the relevant background, and as a consequence both could participate.

In phase eight though a real disparity emerged between what each woman had to offer the discourse: from the beginning Sarah had difficulty participating in the exchange for the very simple reason that she seemed to lack information. For some reason though, perhaps unconsciously unwilling to admit this in case it affected the continued reduction of the social distance between them, she attempted to disguise this by the linguistic choices she made. Once Sharon introduced the Walters Affair, Sarah probed with the elliptical "Why?", meaning 'why must they be careful?'. Sharon then answered "because of the letter". Sarah responded "oh yeah he wrote that letter', her use of the demonstrative signalling an awareness of a specific letter. However, Sharon then said "no nno there was a letter". Seemingly unphased by her mistake Sarah guessed "there was a letter written about him?", and apparently hit the target, as Sharon continued "so like all that it's just been blowing since we finally got it settles with the board a little while ago". After a quick question "and what was the letter about?", Sarah again resorted to a speculative declarative to cover her ignorance "they wrote that letter about him and there were all sorts of implications that weren't true?". Again, it appears that her extrapolations from Sharon's earlier words were accurate as Sharon reacted by reiterating "they weren't true they were unsubstantiated". An interesting passage: Sarah's speculations enabled her to 'play along', and maintain her end of the conversation, but still she had not been given enough information to interpret Sharon's original message, and Sharon seemed oblivious of the fact. As their conversation continued, Sharon gradually revealed details of the event, but so partially, and in such a convoluted sequence, that it appears she still had not appreciated Sarah's linguistic plight. Even when Sarah finally stopped trying to disguise her ignorance and quite overtly said "I didn't hear anything about that", Sharon still did not seem to hear her, but rather, further confounded the situation by introducing a second letter and a plethora of new information that Sarah had no hope of interpreting. Not surprisingly, by then Sharon monopolized the discourse entirely, and Sarah was reduced to feedback signals 'really, yeah, wow'.

In the discourse that followed Sarah tried to re-establish her credibility as 'knower' by introducing her own snippet of election gossip. She began "I know people were really upset about um what I remember about that whole election thing was that um people were really upset with Sony or Sawny or", but it's difficult to establish your credibility as knower when you are not sure of the pronunciation of the protagonist's name. Sharon corrected her "Zony", only for Sarah to get herself into more hot water by making innuendos that suggested that she knew what she was talking about when she didn't "people were really upset uh with the whole coalition er". Sharon's following query "coalition?" served to undermine everything Sarah had said. Sharon then redirected the experience by the assertion "we were called Zonites", and by so doing let Sarah off the hook. At this point Sharon once again had the communicative edge, and once again Sarah resorted to safe feedback 'mhm, yeah, really'. Had Sarah known what she was talking about and really contributed to the discussion mutually, perhaps the women's interpersonal relationship as reflected in the discourse would have become increasingly intimate, with more complex and extended phases. However, Sarah had lost too much ground, and her final attempt did not enable her to recover. She gave up on the 'insider'election talk, to which she was obviously and outsider, and resorted to what should have been safer terrain: her sister's personal history, as it related to Kemlin.

With the authority of personal history on her side she should have regained some sort of communicative momentum, but Sharon's ignorance of her friend's past did not preclude her from participating in its discussion. In fact, Sarah shifted the experiential focus herself: to her sister and Kemlin's appearance and then their singing, avoiding the historical perspective entirely. And by avoiding the potentially exclusive history, the women re-established a mutuality in their discourse which seemed to herald a new beginning: one that was 'safer', albeit less intimate and less dependent on insider information which apparently Sarah did not actually share with her sister. In the last five phases the women seemed to adapt readily and quite effortlessly to a level of intimacy where they could maintain a more equal distribution of power and conversational control over the experiences they explored. The phases which captured this were shorter and less complex, and the organization of the events was predictable and accessible.

The conversation between the first dyad, Sarah and Diane, was 'nice', few risks taken, few blunders made; yet it served the discoursants well: it reduced the social distance between them while they learned a bit about each other, nothing to prohibit future meetings, nor anything to promote them. The second conversation was very different: many risks were taken, many blunders were made, and yet, it too was 'successful' in the sense that the women eventually did find an appropriate level of intimacy which enabled them to share language in a meaningful and mutual way.

The structuring of the womens' discourse reflected their interpersonal relationship aptly. The conversation of the first dyad was described by continuously evolving blocks of phasal consistencies, reflective of their 'stranger' status. The second dyad were neither complete 'strangers' nor were they established 'friends'. Phasal analysis revealed a kind of beginning, middle, ending structure typical of the conversation of 'strangers' with continuous phasal blocks one to six, seven to nine, and ten to fourteen; however, there were a few instances of the discontinuous phasal strings of 'friends' too, with the brief reappearance of phases one, three and five later in the discourse. Still, when dyad $\# 2$ attempted to develop their experiences more fully, as the extended middle phases revealed, where they gave up chronological sequencing and explicit referents and adopted the more complex syntax of friends, their communication floundered. When they returned to a less intimate relationship, their discourse flourished.

In working with these two texts, phasal analysis has proved a most valuable approach in 1) capturing the unconscious, spontaneous and dynamic structuring of the complex and continually shifting register of spoken language known as casual conversation, and in 2) revealing how this structuring is affected by the interlocutors' interpersonal relationship. Phasal analysis also highlights how speakers continually and cooperatively exchange communicative power: how they make second by second adjustments to their discourse as the social distance between them fluctuates: anything to keep the conversation going.

# LARS PORSENA AND MY BONK MANAGERA SYSTEMIC-FUNCTIONAL STUDY IN THE SEMOGENESISOF THE LANGUAGE OF SWEARING

ROBERT VELTMAN Eliot College, University of Kent at Canterbury

# Abstract

Identifying the main swear-word tokens in a language like English is relatively easy, at least for some groups in the community. However, reporting on swearing publicly and even giving a precise name to the domain to which it belongs are disproportionately more difficult.

Moreover, characterising swearing, both process and product, as realisations of a common interrelated set of options raises complex and interesting questions about the notion of 'choice', so central to systemic linguistics, and the relation of choice to semogenesis as an 'increment of functional differentiation' (c.f. Halliday 1992:27). Choice as an outcome of this study appears to more abstract and culturally and historically embedded than many, more general linguistic accounts suggest. The perspective adopted illuminates such central systemic contrasts as that between 'expletive' and invective (e.g. 'Damn' and 'Piss off'). The metafunctional character of swearing, intuitively thought of as being interpersonally and even textually driven (c.f. Halliday 1979, Halliday and Hasan 1976), is within this semogenetic framework typified as fundamentally ideational, in that in ideation lie its creative origins.

Swearing is as ideationally as interpersonally or textually complex. The social and grammatical aspects of swearing are also considered. The data examined are drawn mainly from the British English swearing repertoire but the possibilities of inter-cultural comparison are strongly implied by the framework adopted and a few of the examples studied.

# 1. Swearing: use, mention and nomenclature

Swearing is perhaps the only area of language which it is difficult to discuss publicly. It is also probably more difficult to talk about it publicly than write about it publicly, since writing, especially in print, allows a certain clinical distance from this controversial and raw topic; but it is entirely in the nature of swearing that such special reticence should be exercised -while a crime reporter is never thought of as performing a criminal act in the exercise of his or her trade, a swearing reporter, so to speak, may feel or be thought of as prurient, self-indulgent or exhibitionist. There is always the possibility, as Davis (1989:1) points out in her discussion of the Gatting-Rana cricket case, as reported in the Independent newspaper in December 1987, that \*mentioning' a swear-word ('meta-swearing') is easily confused with 'using' it.

One other major difficulty associated with what I am calling swearing is what 'swearing' actually refers to and what other terms are available to designate the domain. It is indeed a peculiarity of the area that there is a plethora of terms that could apply in one way or another to designate this area of language, but none, including 'swearing' itself, is adequate. People who try to designate the area do so, either with an extreme lack of confidence or indulge in massive overgeneralisation or overspecification. I list some of the terms here:

swearing, swearwords, bad language, rude words/language, coarse words/language, taboo words/language, filthy words/language, foul words/language, dirty words/language, crudities, pornographic words/language, uncouth words/language, strong language, obscenity, obscene words/language, profanity, profane words/language, offensive words/language, (verbal) abuse, flyting, smut, scatology, lavatorial word play, etc.

The absence of a stable nomenclature for a domain which people react to in predictable manner is symptomatic of the subversion and chaos implicitly threatened by these expressions --not only are the referents of these expressions themselves taboo, but the sheer absence of a secure name are symptoms of taboo. This state of affairs contrasts with the way in which the concept of 'word' is held by people in general: although linguists have problems defining 'word, the public do not -there is at least a constancy of terminology for 'word', if not definition (see Allan 1986:77-78 on the morpheme; Davis 1989:9).

Both 'obscenity' and 'profanity' seem to be subsumed by swearing, although socio-psychological literature seems to use the latter to cover obscenity (Sewell 1984; Selnow 1985; Kottke & Macleod 1989). However, Sazer & Kassinove (1991) and Kurklen & Kassinove (1991) use the term \*profanity' more narrowly (and accurately) in respect of assaults upon subjects' religiosity. 'Bad language. (Davis op.cit.; Andersson & Trudgill 1990) covers the ground but is far too inclusive, while 'dirty words' (Risch 1987) tends to exclude the purely profane. 'Swearing' and its associated term 'swear-words' have been used over a reasonably long period to designate the area (Graves 1939; Harris 1987; Hughes 1991). 'Swearing' is of a different order from other terms -any polysemy or vagueness that might inhere in it is functionally occasioned, as is the case with the 'overlexicalisation' characteristic of 'antilanguages (Halliday 1976); and, because 'swearing designates an act, while a 'swear-word' denotes a product of that act, we have embodied in that stem, 'swear', an important functional distinction, between the pragmatic and the objective. This distinction between act and product is central to the study of texts (see Steiner and Veltman 1988:2-3) and the discourse processes that create them.

Swearing is, all the same, a fairly 'detachable' area of language -a register in which the socio-semantic and formal probabilities are relatively well defined and co-occurrent-- and this study reflects this state of affairs in the path its takes, as it begins by explaining swearing semiotically in the broadest historical terms i.e. as a semogenetic process, since a language is a historical-functional phenomenon to which individuals have differential access, for swearing, in its use and impact does differentiate members of the same linguistic community. Within this established semogenetic framework, the metafunctional, sociosemantic, lexicogrammatical and textual aspects of swearing are examined.

# 2. The semiotic of swearing

Lars Porsena was an early King of Rome. The 19th. century British historian, MacCaulay, wrote an epic poem about him (\*The Lays of Ancient Rome' 1842), which says:

'Lars Porsena of Clusium, By the nine gods he swore, That the great house of Tarquin, Should suffer wrong no more'.

Lars Porsena in this context is swearing an oath --an oath through which he invites retribution on himself by the nine gods he swears by and not swearing a curse, appealing for retribution on others. Hence, the initial system for swearing is:

![](img/cc68c1babc5c8814b34b32f438f81d98bec4ae596dd2e25213fbb6d832c39638.jpg)  
Figure 1.

This system demonstrates acts of meaning in the Malinowskian sense, where language is a mode of action rather than reflection, and where a simple choice between self and others reflects the most primal semiotic choice open to early man and young infant (Halliday 1989: ch.1). Furthermore, this model illustrates the important point that meanings are engendered within a 'social semiotic' (Halliday 1978; Eggins 1994), in which possibilities of meaning occur as systemic 'choices' or 'options'. However, it is not that, as speakers, we simply make conscious or even unconscious choices in relation to the language we use (Shall I swear or shan't I?), but that to some extent these choices are pre-determined by a) the context, and b) by the meaning potential embodied in the context, which ultimately is a cultural fact. It is not that Lars Porsena wondered whether he should swear an oath or swear a curse (see Fig. 1), but that the culture offers the choice in abstraction, because the culture itself is an abstraction. This is what I feel is what is most usefully meant by the notion of 'social semiotic'. Eggins' view (1994:3) "that the process of using language is a..process of making meaning by choosing is thus an incomplete one, especially as she equates the 'semiotic process' in language, with "making meaning by choosing". The fundamental semiotic choices are available in the culture, but are not necessarily evoked as choices in the creation of texts in any direct manner. Fig. 1 is a model of the semogenesis of swearing. illustrating the abstractness of the semiotic of swearing in that it is a diachronically prior model (Halliday 1992). Certainly, swearing in the sense of Fig. 1 is archaic swearing, perhaps indulged in nowadays, in modern European culture for instance, at most as parody. However, this archaic model does underlie contemporary, vernacular less ritualistic acts of swearing, evoking further delicacy in the system, as Fig. 2 demonstrates:

![](img/79656ef9591ee5f4ed2c99c63d8fd6d37ce35f90b7eebbe7159d6605a9a0f354.jpg)  
Figure 2.

Fig. 2 further incorporates, via the broken, vertical line joining the RITUAL and NON-RITUAL options, an impression of the historical genesis of swearing, a relation that may or may not be alive in the cultural and individual memory, but which accounts for the cultural and individual variation in respect of cultural and linguistic change. Non-ritualistic, vernacular swearing reflects semogenetically the ritualistic model in the distinction between EXPLETIVE and INVECTIVE, the former being self-directed (cf. ritual oath), and the latter other-directed (cf. ritual curse). There is a significant 'vocative' element in the choices in this system, which is realised often as \*minor' clauses at the level of grammar (Martin 1981)

and has narrow, specialised potential realisation at the level of phonology, with heightened pitch, loudness and duration, as Fig. 3 shows:

![](img/d7c9a63ec09bc7fe2e6c39c664a237978137f119138069a103de310f95ce4c73.jpg)  
Figure 3.

The main difference between ritualised (Fig. 1) and non-ritualised swearing (Fig. 3) is that the semogenesis has involved an increment of functional differentiation (Halliday 1992:27 in fact describes semogenesis as \*increase' in the meaning potential of the system) with the ideational element becoming more explicit in non-ritualised swearing. This semiotic process will be elaborated in Section 3.

# 3. The metafunctional perspective on swearing

The semantics of natural language is metafunctionally driven. The major contribution of systemic-functional theory to the understanding of the functions of language is that there are three highly generalisable metafunctions: the interpersonal, the ideational and the textual, which cooperate to create texts. Halliday uses a weaving metaphor to illustrate this dynamic, metafunctional interrelation. Metafunctions thus co-occur simultaneously in the differently ranked units, particularly in the structure of the clause, which a) interfaces with the meaning of texts themselves, in a way that smaller units out of which it is built do not interface, and b) does not primarily foreground particular functionally derived meanings as smaller units do, particularly at the level of the word. For example, 'weep' and 'cry' both refer and therefore have ideational meaning, but the former has an inbuilt interpersonal element which is foregrounded in use -its use being often emotive and affective. Swear words have been typically regarded as interpersonal, as Figs. 1 - 3 suggest (oath vs. curse, expletive vs. invective). In the following three texts, the single occurrence of 'bastard', and the two occurrences of 'fuck' clearly contain the 'I'm feeling angry/frustrated' element, accompanied in 1 and 2. by the 'I want to hurt/offend/provoke you' element:

(1) Burn, yer bastard, burn. (Said by a Loyalist demonstrator as the Irish Republican tricolour was held aloft and burned - The Observer 16th. July 1995)   
(2) Fuck the ceasefire. (Said by a Loyalist demonstrator on the same occasion -The Observer 16th.July 1995)   
(3) If they want me to move office in August, then fuck it. They'll have to wait until September. (Addressed by one Kent lecturer to another 18th. July 1995)

The use of such words is often regarded by members of society as uneducated, uncivilised, primitive and animal-like, akin to non-verbal cries and gestures. It is not surprising therefore that they are not seen as referential or belonging to the cognitive domain, to which adult speakers consciously assign metalingual privilege.

Two particular texts in the SFG canon stand out in support of an interpersonal characterisation of swearing. These are Halliday & Hasan (1976:275-27) and Halliday (1979: 67-28).

Halliday & Hasan say of the cohesive role of the class of ' general' nouns, e.g. My car has stalled. The thing/contraption/bugger always plays me up at traffic lights: The expression of interpersonal meaning, of a particular attitude on the part of the speaker, is an important function of general nouns...the speaker assumes the right to represent the thing he is referring to, as it impinges on him personally' (1976:276). This personal involvement may take the form of sympathy (\*poor dear thing') or contempt (\*the bastard/idiot/motherfucker'). These cohesive general nouns may be lexico-grammatically circumscribed: while they may be preceded by an attitudinal modifier ('the stupid twit'), they may not be intensified (\*'the very stupid twit') or compared or modified objectively (\*the tall idiot) and they are always non-defining. Bach (1968) noted their ambiguity in this respect: The idiot rang me up at 3 a.m.' is paraphrasable as That man, who is also, as you well know, an idiot' vs. The man who is an idiot and not the man who is sensible rang me up at 3 a.m.' Only in the former example are we concerned with a form of swearing.

Halliday (1979) is concerned with the contrast between clause boundary marking (theme and information structure -Theme/Given versus Rheme/New), which he sees as marking the 'periodicity of discourse' and the way in which prosodies suffuse the structure of the clause without belonging strictly to any particular point in the discourse. Functionally, unlike textually significant thematic and information structures, prosodies convey interpersonal meaning. Interpersonal meaning is typically strung throughout the clause 'as a continuous motif or colouring', whether lexico-grammatically realised, as with modality, or phonologically realised, as in the case of intonation:

These realisations are distributed like a prosody throughout a continuous stretch of discourse..mood and modality, tone and key, intensity and other attitudinal meanings are typically realised through this kind of structural pattern. Swear words and obscenities, also, may occur at any point or at all points in the clause; it does not matter what segments they are attached to. (ibid.:68) (My italics)

and may occur even in the middle of a word (e.g. 'abso-bloody-lutely'). Halliday exemplifies this case with 4 below:

(4)Christ they beat the hell out of those bastards!

Here the speaker's perspective is foregrounded, and is therefore not primarily a configuration of discrete, contstituently organised (implicitly ideationally governed) elements. These highly charged semantic features "may be attached, as connotations, to particular lexical items, like bastards meaning people' plus I am worked up'; but connotations do not enter into constituent-like relations" (ibid.:69). The meaning potential is associated with the act of meaning as a whole, the speech act, in other words, and interpersonal, emotive elements are interpolated at any point in the clause. When they do occur in the same clause "they still do not go together to form constructions" (ibid.:69). How are these prosodic structures to be represented in the description? They are either to be ignored, if they are considered to be extralinguistic, or "forced to fit into the constituency mould" (ibid.:69). They could be treated like prosodies in phonology, that is as "contrasting features with no place in experiential constituent structure... or they could be specified separately and then mapped onto the constituent structure as a distinct step in the realisational process" (ibid.:69). These are interesting ideas which require elaboration and testing. They were expressed before the formulation of 'grammatical metaphor' (Halliday 1985) with its inbuilt relation of 'congruity'. One could imagine the text of 4. containing non -congruent swear words represented above their congruent counterparts, with a prosodic line excluding the congruent elements, as in 5:

(5) Christ the hell out of bastards! I am worked up they beat up badly those people.

The prosodic line, underpinning the utterance and raised for the swear word elements, reflects what was said earlier about the narrow, predictable phonological realisation of swear words, as well as the melody. The ideational element is also captured in the relation with the constituent structure and the metaphorical alternation. However, the questions remain whether swear words are really metaphorical or merely attitudinally marked synonyms, and whether this alternation strongly suggests a prescriptive view of swearing expression.

Despite the obvious interpersonal connotations of swearing expressions and their less obvious but significant textual role in cohesiveness (Halliday 1979 and Halliday & Hasan 1976 op.cit.), there is a strong ideational lexical set of Fields to which they belong, on which the act of swearing constantly draws and which remains permanently independent of the prototypical kinds of swearing act, namely expletives and invectives (see Fig. 3 above). The acts draw on a fairly circumscribed referential base which contains its own highly complex, mainly lexical networks. The principal choices in this referential base are PROFANITIES, OBSCENITIES and what I shall call MENTALITIES (those concerned with mental states: sanity or intelligence). One can motivate options conflating OBSCENITIES and MENTALITIES for English (call this entry condition CORPORALITIES) and disjoining PROFANITIES from OBSCENITIES, because in Anglo-Saxon influenced cultures, the referential field of PROFANITIES is the usual source for EXPLETIVES rather than INVECTIVES: Jesus', Holy Moses' versus May the Almighty teach you a lesson you will never forget', which is archaic in the culture (see Vincze 1985 or Hemingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', respectively, for pre-war Hungarian and Spanish profane invective). On the other hand, OBSCENITIES are the normal source for both EXPLETIVES and INVECTIVES, as examples 1 and 2 (invective) and 3 (expletive) show with 'bastard' and 'fuck'. Therefore, alongside the system in Fig. 3 above, we have Fig. 4 illustrating this referential semiotic base, relating to the context of 2nd. order Field (Halliday 1978), where 1st. order Field conveys the act engaged in and 2nd. order Field the reporting or describing of that act:

![](img/f211bb39f94870ce657e43cbe85f6a83f6adb73859bd2b96ed7e600508aa5295.jpg)  
Figure 4.

Obscenities play a prototypical role in the general understanding of the language of swearing. Here, body parts are contrasted with body functions ('shit (n)'/'prick' vs. 'shit (vb)'/'fuck') and objects or activities concerned with excretion are contrasted with those relating to the sex act ('shit'/'piss' vs. 'cunt'/'shag'). Note that 'scatological' is derived from the Greek word for 'dung', but like several phenomena in this area, zones are confused, so that 'scatological' has come to refer to obscenity in general. A further but most significant point is that not only are these words used as expletives and invectives but they actually have reference independent of these sorts of swearing acts and constitute a similar group of items, which arouses the same level of social hostility. This happened in the early 1960s, in the trial concerning the use by the hero of Lawrence's 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' of the word 'fuck' to refer directly to the act of copulation. The same words are used both REFERENTIALLY and EXPRESSIVELY. The latter option feeds the INVECTIVE/EXPLETIVE field, while drawing on the the REFERENTIAL. The REFERENTIAL Field, which is Ideational in origin, expands into EUPHEMISMS and TECHNICAL terms, when social and interpersonal pressures apply ('contraceptive' vs. 'durex' vs. 'condom' vs. johnny'/ 'rubber', etc.). A further, but also unindicated, option in the system shown in Fig. 4, would relate to APPLIANCES, which would include \*scatologies' viz. words for \*toilet', such as 'bog', 'shithouse', and 'sexualities', such as words for 'contraceptive sheaths' It is interesting that no widely known obscenity exists for female contraceptive appliances, such as coils, pills, although the term 'rasclat' for sanitary towels has been used not only referentially but as an invective by Caribbean English swearers. It is here in the Ideational domain that swearing terms remain taboo but begin to constitute more general 'slang', exhibiting features close to Halliday's 'antilanguages' (1976), such as novelty for the sake of secrecy or humour (euphemisms function for novelty for the sake of avoiding unpleasantness).

Further independent motivation for the disjunction of the PROFANITIES and OBSCENITIES systemic options can be found in the fact that their lexical realisations can be syntagmatically concatenated. Thus, Vincze (1985:36), describing Hungarian pre-war peasant swearing, finds such an obscenity combined with profanity: "May the heavenly, kind-hearted, seven times holy God knock his thundering prick into it'". Such combinations are also possible in English e.g. 'fucking hell'.

Finally, potentially profane words like 'Hell', 'Christ', which otherwise typically occur as expletives, do not always occur referentially as taboo items, unlike obscenities. There are exceptions -for instance, the prohibition on reading aloud the orthographical form for 'Jehovah' in Hebrew, replacing it with the word for 'Lord' and the reluctance by some religious groups to hear certain terms associated with other religions or with satanism.

# 4. Mode and tenor

I have described the vital importance of referential FIELD in the description of swearing. What other semiotic sources exist, which orientate swearing within a particular culture? For this, we return to the categories of Register established within SFG, since pioneering work by Halliday (1964, 1978), Gregory (1967), etc.

With regard to MODE, swearing is of particular interest. It is one area where only surreptitious recording is legitimate in the collection of live data, where '3rd. Party presence' (heaviest in terms of 'public' hearing or reading) would affect the symbolic value of the output, owing to the degree of consciousness exerted by society on the individual. The degrees of social sensitivity, which condition the use of swear words, is exponentially increased, as one moves from casual to non-casual speech to personal to public writing to codification in dictionaries and grammars (Quirk et al. 1985 list swearing under 'Formulae', thus avoiding serious discussion). Here, in respect of codification, Victorian mores make themselves particularly felt, with their positional role values (Andersson & Trudgill 1990). One particular context, giving rise to a whole genre, and which essentially involves swearing is that of toilet graffitti, which is situationally and graphetically highly defined.

For TENOR, following Brown & Gilman (1960), a category needs to be established, which is particularly relevant to swearing --invective, namely the TU value which corresponds with address forms and words that bring together not only familiarity but also socially dominant distance and contempt. Grammars of TU-marked languages normally say that such features are for close relatives or friends, children animals and social inferiors. The TU value is simultaneously opposed not only to the VOUS/USTED forms of social equality and formality, but also to the EGO of expletive usage (you DOG! vs. Good morning, Mr.Green vs. Crikey!/Fuck-a-duck!). In some cultures, as in the ethnicities of central Tanzania, relationships exist -in Tanzania called Utani-- according to which only certain ethnicities may curse each other without any risk of hatred or enmity. Thus the paradox posed by the opposed values of TU: familiarity vs. contempt, are rationalised.

With such contextual conditions in place, swearing may occur and given the nature of swearing active genuine choices are involved. These are not just choices at the semantic level but are choices in form at both the lexico-grammatical and often the phonological levels, arising from the conjunction of socio-semantic contextual factors, which as suggested above are less open to choice and are more determined. As Risch (1987:353) says It is not the meaning of these (dirty) words that is considered taboo, because it is permissible to express that meaning through other lexical forms; the irrational response characteristic of linguistic taboos is a response to the form of the word' (my italics). Although there is something in what Risch says, she overlooks the problem that Leith (1983) noticed, namely, that even words like 'bottom' are not neutral, lying putatively between scatological words like 'arse' and euphemisms like 'posterior' or 'derriere'. The referential meaning of swear-words seems to account to some extent for their taboo potential.

# 5. The lexico-grammar of swearing

Swearing is normally considered to be a lexical phenomenon, although I have pointed out that some cultures have or had an archaic form of swearing which involved whole, sometimes complex sentence structures. I want to show in this section that in English swearing there are not only lexical but also grammatical factors involved.

In the case of lexis, words may be systematised componentially:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Canine</td><td>Bovine</td></tr><tr><td>Mature:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>dog</td><td>bull</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>bitch</td><td>cow</td></tr><tr><td>Immature</td><td>puppy</td><td>calf</td></tr></table></body></html>

(following Martin: 1992:286)

These lexemes may be used metaphorically, for instance:

dislikeable woman bitch 'dislikeable woman' 'female dog'

where non-congruently 'a dislikeable woman' is realised as bitch, borrowing from the Animal network, sketched above. Alternatively, swear words relate with nonswear words as strong alternatives, e.g. \*prick' for 'penis', 'bollocks' for 'testicles'.

With expletives, as 1-3 above show (bastard', 'fuck'), the ideational content of the term is lost, as one would expect. However, as the example of 'bitch' demonstrates, the relationship between swearing and semantic absurdity is strong (see Vincze 1985:38 and below), especially but not uniquely in the expressive semiotic mode of invective and expletive.

Veltman (1985), in a study of the relationship between comparison and intensification, ('older' and 'too old' vs. 'very old') notes that comparison has ideational origins in the system of transitivity, particularly in relation to reciprocals, reflexives and null referents ('John and Mary are taller' meaning taller than someone just mentioned). The study brought together a number of processes, some of which are structural and others purely lexical (see Hasan 1987 for reflections on the Grammarian's Dream of generating lexis from grammatical networks). These items, which may be generalised to others were:

structural: be similar (to), be as old (as), be older (than), be opposite lexical: kick, kiss, talk (to), talk (with), copulate with/fuck.

There are a number of inherently reciprocal processes, those which are reciprocal without overt use of the reciprocal expression 'each other' e.g.' they kissed/met'. These potentially reciprocal items, unlike 'kick' ('they kicked themselves'), constitute semantic absurdities (ABNORMAL) if reflexive, either of a DERANGED kind (\*she was talking with herself') or of an OBSCENE kind ('she kissed herself on the lips' or 'he was copulating with/fucking himself'). However, in swearing, as opposed to pure semantic absurdity 'Go fuck yourself' is lexico-grammatically acceptable, as is 'I fucked myself climbing the fence'. Therefore, criteria of acceptability for systemically derived lexico-grammatical classes, described above in the area of linguistic comparison are not operative in the case of swearing, where all sorts of semantic but not grammatical absurdity are the norm.

Hughes (1991:30-31) shows how various swearing terms are flexible'. He claims that 'as terms become more highly charged, so they acquire greater grammatical flexibility' (ibid:30), meaning that they vary in the number of generalised, differing linguistic environments they can occur in. Hughes gives eight environments, 'bugger' occurring in all of them, fuck' in six for UK usage and seven for US usage (You fuck!'), with 'bastard' having only two, the converse distribution of 'fuck'('the bastard', 'you bastard', but not \*'the fuck', \*'you fuck' in Britain).

A final example showing how swearing represents a distinct part of the meaningpotential of a language like English, and as such will be somehow idiosyncratically characterised in the lexico-grammar, is drawn from James (1972:164). In a study of discourse markers such oh and ah, she shows that whereas Fuck John Wayne' is ambiguous between an idiomatic, expletive, and a non-idiomatic interpretation, 'Fuck oh John Wayne' has only non-idiomatic, referential meaning. In our functional interpretation, both utterances have obscene meaning, but, semogenetically, the latter with its metafunctional structure at the level of the clause undisturbed differs from the former 'idiom' with its metafunctional structure skewed towards the interpersonal, as an expletive. At the same time, ideational meaning underlies the interpersonal in the expletive utterance, endowing it with ambiguity. It must also be recognised that while the expletive is normal in usage, the absurdity of having to wonder who is to be violated ('oh') suggests that the latter is not a likely corpus occurrent.

# 6. The text and swearing

Eggins (1994:2) characterises language use as "functional, semantic, contextual and semiotic"'. In defining the functional characteristic, Eggins (ibid:3) says that the systemic approach asks "how people use language" and "how language is structured for use". In this section the functional characteristic of language as defined by Eggins will be described.

The simple text illustrated in the title of this paper cames from a headline in the Sun', a popular tabloid newspaper: MY BONK MANAGER. This headline referred to a minor scandal in 1994 involving a bank manager and one of his female staff. Here is an active choice: BONK rather than BANK was the word in the actual text. It was, of course, intended as word-play, a pun, and was meaningful in the context, which of course could have been realised congruently as BANK MANAGER IN SEX SCANDAL. Sexual puns are characteristic within contemporary British culture of tabloid newspaper headlines, some typical popular comedy, e.g. films from the Carry On series and, of course, double entendre and joking, and thus typify language as choice -to pun or not to pun. What interests systemic-functional grammar most of all here is the putative choice made between BANK MANAGER and BONK MANAGER in the creation of the text. What is of less interest for SFG at first sight is the fact that bonk' is three ways polysemous, as Fig. 5 shows:

![](img/fd5e3270fcd7ec88e1d1ea7f9556c4e52aa6118cbf270b2926a8a3d0d3e7463a.jpg)  
Figure 5.

In the text the verb has undergone conversion as an attributive modifier in the context, - manager', offering lexico-grammatical novelty. But what also underlies such a text where semiotic oppositions are at such risk? I would argue that speakers do have some knowledge of unofficial dictionaries, as opposed to thesauruses, where ambiguities and other resources apply allowing texts to be interpreted and reinterpreted and multiply interpreted by different members of society on their own terms. In this way, language change may occur, causing the suppression of homophones such as cyclist's 'bonk'in Fig. 5, overtaken by sexual 'bonks'.

Swearing is thus a paradigm example of language as choice, it also shows up in stark terms the relation between language and culture, between the different linguistic and non-linguistic domains, and between different stages of the language. In this sense, it is an ideal domain' for SFG (Veltman 1985).

Further phenomena swearing raises are social dichotomies. As Pitt-Kethley (1986:34) says, 'Society is made up of swearers and non-swearers; like smokers and non-smokers, they rarely see each other's point of view'. As with Halliday's anti-languages, this phenomenon engenders not only social rift, disharmony and censoriousness and censorship, but also cornucopiousness of lexical terms and the possibility of verbal play and display. Robert Graves, writing in 1939 on the alleged disappearance of swearing in British society, sees swearing in such a light: the language "was so rich in its vocabulary and drew so copiously on the legitimate language for secret, obscene images of common words, that the greatest ingenuity was needed in legitimate speech to avoid the appearance of obscenity" (1939:61) (see the above examples of 'bottom' and bonk'). Graves also says that the future study of the 19th. and 20th. centuries will record "the existence of an enormous secret language of bawdry and an immense oral literature of obscene stories and rhymes known in various degrees of initiation to every man and woman in this country, yet not consigned to writing or openly admitted as existing' (ibid:58).

This semiotic resource and source, as this study has attempted to show, is essentially Ideational in origin -and it may be argued that it is this particular metafunction that is the 'enabling' function, as the 'textual' was thought to be, in the sense that it permits the generation of resources which other functions utilise. This may indicate that the textual and interpersonal metafunctions are not creative' or 'regenerative' to the same extent as those systems which are Ideationally organised.

# INTONATION CHOICES IN THE ENGLISH OF NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS AN EXPLORATORY STUDY

MARTIN HEWINGS University of Birmingham

# Abstract

While the English pronunciation of second language learners is an area of increasing research interest, the specific study of the English intonation of learners is relatively neglected. This is despite the claim that incorrect intonation has particular significance in producing misunderstandings. The research reported here studies tone choice in comparable samples of speech produced by speakers of British English and by learners from a variety of first language backgrounds. Attention is focused on systemic choices rather than their phonetic realisation, and analysis is conducted using the framework of Brazil's discourse intonation model. The findings suggest that learners generally conform to native speaker use of rising and falling tones for the purpose of marking what is said as either contextually retrivable or as a new contribution to the discourse. Differences identified suggest that learners fail to exploit tone choice for socially integrative purposes in ways observed in the native speaker area.

The pronunciation of speakers of English as a second or foreign language has been an area of substantial research over a considerable period of time, largely motivated by a need to produce teaching procedures which most effectively help learners approximate to some native variety of English pronunciation. Within this field, however, it has been widely observed that the English intonation of learners has been, at least until fairly recently, relatively neglected (see for example, E. James 1976; Neufeld & Schneiderman 1980; de Bot 1983; van Els & de Bot 1987; Chun 1988; Taylor 1993).

Some writers contend that this is a case of benign neglect and that the teaching of intonation deserves to be given only limited attention. It has been suggested that the communication load carried by intonation compared with grammar and lexis is relatively low so that a failure to produce native-speaker like intonation is unlikely to result in communication breakdown. Odlin (1989:119), for example, appears to offer support for this view in his observation that:

The effect of suprasegmental [...] transfer may often be relatively unimportant. When speaking English, a German may "sound German" and a Korean may \*sound Korean", but they may still succeed in communicating gracefully, fluently, and accurately in most respects.

Overwhelmingly, however, there have been calls for intonation teaching and research into the intonation of non-native speakers to be given a higher priority, with a number of reasons being put forward. Some have argued that for successful communication with native speakers, it is more important for learners to achieve target-like performance of intonation than target speech segments (Nash 1971; Wilkins 1974; Gilbert 1980). The view of these writers is that an error in the pronunciation of an individual sound is unlikely to affect communication because of redundancy in the language; however, an error of intonation can lead to a different interpretation being placed on the utterance from that intended by the speaker. Evidence to support these suggestions comes from work into native speaker reaction to non-native speech. In an experimental study of Indonesian ESL students, Fathman (1981, reported in de Bot 1986) found that native speaker judges considered suprasegmental errors to be the speakers' greatest problems. Johansson (1978) asked native speaker judges to rate English words, sentences and text readings from Swedish speakers, and found that the text readings were judged least acceptable. He put forward a number of suggestions why this should be so, but concluded that in the texts:

non-segmental errors caused a greater deviance [from a native-speaker target] than segmental ones. (1978:111)

A second reason is that it has been observed that the intonational features of a foreign accent are the last and perhaps the most difficult to eradicate. Ioup and Tansomboon (1987) suggest that there is anecdotal evidence from both learners and language teachers to support the claim that the prosodic system of a language is the last to be mastered, that it tends to become fossilised in advanced learners, and that it remains to characterise learners as having a foreign accent after segmental deviations from the target language have been eradicated. Esser (1978) reports that the intonation systems of English and German are very similar, but those few areas which are different produce particularly persistent problems for German speakers of English. The apparent difficulty of eradicating intonational features of foreign accent suggests that work on intonation should be given a high priority in teaching programmes: that it needs to begin early in second language learning, and be given continual attention. Other support for this position comes from Crystal (1969:2), Leon & Martin (1972), and Cruz-Ferreira (1989).

A third reason concerns the relationship between the pronunciation of sound segments and their place in units of suprasegmental organisation. Writers have noted that suprasegmentals influence the intelligibility of sound segments (Prator 1971), and Abberton et al. (1978:34), in relation to speech improvement work for the deaf, consider that:

From a formal point of view, voice and the associated prosodic features of rhythm and intonation provide the essential framework within which vocal tract segmental features are temporally organised. This is a major justification for working on prosody before articulation and segmental phonology.

Perhaps the most significant work on this relationship in the context of second language learning is that by A. James (1981, 1986, 1987). He observes that in research which investigates conditioning factors in the pronunciation of sound segments by second language learners, attention has been focused on verbal task, the proficiency level of the learner and phonetic or phonological environment. He argues, however, that the suprasegmental context, although largely ignored in research, is a further significant conditioning factor. For example, in a short section of English text read aloud by a Dutch speaker, he shows that there is a high degree of coincidence between segmental errors and points of prosodic prominence (1981:63-65). While the type of error and degree of variation from the target norm are subject to conditioning factors, the place of occurrence of the error appears to be influenced by suprasegmental context. The lesson for pronunciation teaching would seem to be that problems of segmental errors need to be treated in their broader, suprasegmental context.

# 1. The English intonation of non-native speakers: existing evidence

The predominant view, then, and the one adopted here, would appear to be that intonation should be given a higher priority in teaching programmes than is currently common practice. What is needed to implement this in a systematic way is a research base, one component of which would be an account of how the English intonation of non-native speakers differs from that found in some target variety of English.

Some evidence, of course, already exists, and it is possible to present this in three main categories. First, there are reports of communication breakdown which analysts contend are a direct consequence of some inappropriate feature of intonation. Gumperz and his co-workers (Gumperz et al. 1979; Gumperz $1 9 8 2 a$ and $^ b$ ) provide a number of instances which are reported in some detail. While such examples are of considerable interest, it would be hard to gather a sufficient number under appropriate conditions -allowing both audio recording and the collection of relevant information about the context in which they occur-- to provide a sound basis for generalisation.

Second, there are observations about how the English intonation of native speakers and speakers of a particular first language are thought to differ. For example, Jones (1960:321) observes that German speakers tend to misplace tonic syllables, particularly to place them too early in a tone unit. Ferch et al. (1984:125) identify three characteristic features of the English of Danish speakers: a tendency to pitch unstressed syllables higher than preceding stressed ones; a narrowing of pitch range in tones (falls, rises, and fall-rises); and the use of a generally narrower range of pitch tending to remain in or just below the middle range of the voice. Such observations appear not to be based on systematic comparative study from the study of recorded speech but, rather, represent comparisons between casually observed non-native English intonation and intuitive or introspective beliefs about the characteristic features of 'target' intonation in English. As such, while they have considerable value as starting points for further research, they cannot be taken as definitive statements about the English intonation of a particular first language group as a whole.

The third is experimental studies which set out systematically to compare features of native and non-native English intonation, using audio-recordings of non-native speech (for example, Delattre 1963 for German, French and Spanish speakers; Backman 1977, 1979 for speakers of Venezuelan Spanish; Adams and Munro 1978, and Adams 1979, for speakers having a number of Asian and SouthEast Asian languages; Phillipson 1978 for Danish speakers; and Willems 1982, and Jenner 1984, for Dutch speakers). While data-based studies such as these point the way ahead for studies of non-native intonation, I would like to note four methodological issues arising out of them.

# 2. Methodological issues

The first is that in some of the studies the characteristics and the extent of the deviation between native and non-native intonation is assessed by native-speaker judges (sometimes the researchers themselves). In other words, judges listen to some intonational feature of non-native speech in recorded material and compare this with what a native speaker would have said in similar circumstances, derived by introspection. The obvious difficulty in such a procedure is that there may be considerable variability in answer to the question 'What would a native speaker have said?' and, further, judges may come with preconceived ideas of correctness. I take it as axiomatic that where possible we should be comparing non-native speech with actual native speaker performance, rather than depending on introspection.

The second issue concerns the focus of the comparison. t Hart & Collier (1975) have observed that intonation can be analysed at various levels of abstraction.

These can be labelled, with an increasing degree of abstraction, the acoustic level, the phonetic level, and the phonological level. At the acoustic level, intonation is seen as the change in fundamental frequency level over time, where fundamental frequency is the physical correlate of pitch. Not all acoustic information will be perceptible to the human ear, so a phonetic level needs to be distinguished at which intonation is viewed as a succession of distinguishable "pitch events" (Couper-Kuhlen 1986:63). At the highest, phonological, level of abstraction, distinct pitch events are grouped together into categories which oppose each other and thereby carry meaning. It is my view that all three levels need eventually to be examined if we are to provide a comprehensive comparison between the English intonation of native and non-native speakers. However, for the purposes of providing a research base to inform teaching, the phonological component should take priority. To support this view it is useful to draw an analogy with the study of sound segments. It would be widely agreed that the ability to produce the sound segments of a second language so that they are perceived as distinctive is of greater communicate significance, and therefore warranting a higher priority in teaching, than the ability to articulate each of these sound segments in a nativelike manner. Prator (1971) expresses this view as follows:

We can, with some confidence, take the position that, since phonemic distinctions correlate with meaning, they are more important than allophonic distinctions to a student who is learning a language in order to be able to communicate meaning in it.

So, for example, the failure to produce a distinction between the sounds [p] and [b] is likely to have more serious communicative consequences than the failure to distinguish between the allophones [p] and an aspirated $[ { \mathfrak { p } } ^ { \mathtt { h } } ]$ . In the same way, the failure to produce a distinction between two semantically discrete intonational categories is more likely to result in miscommunication than the failure to realise one of these categories in a way that is in some way untypical of native speaker production.

The third issue is that of the data used. In some studies judges were asked to rate the acceptability of the intonation in decontextualised utterances. The view of intonation adopted here (see below) is that the choice of one intonation feature over another reflects the speaker's awareness of being engaged in purposeful interaction with a hearer against a context-specific background of shared assumptions. The study of non-native speaker production of decontextualised utterances might allow us to say something about intonation in citation forms, but will provide only limited evidence of whether subjects are responding in a native-speaker like way to contextual considerations. One of the principles I draw from this is that if we are to study intonation as a component of discourse, our primary source of data should be interactive, contextualised speech.

A fourth, related, issue is that of establishing 'targets' against which non-native intonation can be assessed. If, as I have suggested, intonation choices are dependent on context, it may be the case that variability among a group of native speakers in intonation choice at any particular point in a discourse is simply a response to a different perception of relevant contextual matters at that point. If, however, we can identify points in a discourse where contextual factors are such that a group of native speaker subjects will be strongly inclined to make the same choice, we can think of these as 'target' intonation choices. If non-native subjects make the same choice at comparable points in a discourse, then there are grounds for supposing that they are responding to the same contextual factors in the same way as native speakers as far as intonation is concerned: that is to say, there is evidence that the English intonation system of the native and non-native subjects is similar. If, however, they do not, then it is necessary to consider what influences are operative at the time to prevent this.

The main aim of the study reported below (and more extensively in Hewings 1993) is to compare intonation in two corpora of speech, one produced by native English speakers and the other produced by non-native speakers. The study is primarily descriptive, observing similarities and differences between intonation in the two corpora, although possible explanation of differences will also be presented. The methodology reflects the discussion of existing experimental studies reported above. Before describing the methodology in detail, however, I will briefly present the theoretical framework within which the work is conducted.

# 3. The descriptive and analytical framework for the study: Discourse Intonation'

The descriptive and analytical framework for the study reported here is the model of discourse intonation proposed by Brazil (1997). This is not the place to provide a detailed account of discourse intonation, but I will present a brief outline of parts of the framework which I refer to in the subsequent analysis and discussion.

It is assumed that speakers make an ongoing assessment of the state of understanding between themselves and the other parties with whom they are interacting. The background created by this assessment, in the light of which all intonation choices are made, is termed the CONTEXT OF INTERACTION. The state of understanding that is perceived to exist at any point in a developing discourse will have features which range from the long-standing, such as a shared understanding of what the language system allows, to transitory, never-to-berepeated understandings that are created at a particular moment in the discourse.

The model postulates three systematic intonation choices which are communicatively significant: PROMINENCE, TONE, and KEY/TERMINATION.

('Key' and 'termination' choices will not be dealt with in this paper). When a word is assigned prominence, it is marked as being SELECTIVE in the prevailing context of interaction. So, for example, in B's response in the constructed exchange:

(1) A I thought the paper was on the bookcase. B It's on TOP of the bookcase.

'top' is likely to be made prominent because it represents a selection from 'top' and 'other parts' of the bookcase, while 'bookcase' is likely to be non-prominent because, in this context, no other word -strictly speaking, no other sense- is available.

To account for tone choice, the metaphor of the common ground is adopted to describe the set of shared understandings that exist between participants in an interaction. Brazil contends that for each part of the message, the speaker has the option either to mark it as already belonging to the common ground, or to mark it as being outside the common ground. The first of these is signalled by means of a RISING TONE (a category which will here include Rising and Falling-rising tones), and the second by a FALLING TONE (either Falling or Rising-falling tones). Speakers also have the possibility to opt out of attaching the significance of either Rising or Falling tone to a stretch of speech by selecting a LEVEL TONE. Tone choice is selected on the last prominent syllable of a tone unit (see below), which is said to attract TONIC PROMINENCE.

Like many accounts of intonation, discourse intonation postulates the existence of a unit within which intonation choices are made. This is termed the TONE UNIT and is defined as a stretch of speech in which there is one, and only one, communicatively significant pitch movement, or TONE choice. On the evidence of researchers such as Goldman-Eisler (1968), Boomer and Laver (1968) and Laver (1970), Brazil suggests that the tone unit is one of the units of speech processing. It is taken to represent a preplanned addition or increment to the discourse, so that the beginning of each tone unit marks the speaker's decision to make a new selection in one of the meaning systems of intonation. This view of the tone unit as a unit of forward planning has important implications for the interpretation of how speech is segmented, and I return to this below.

The following extract from the data illustrates transcription conventions used here: (2) (NSb) $/ / $ she's WEARing a kind of/ $\mathbf { \tilde { \sigma } } _ { \mathbf { \tilde { \sigma } } } \mathbf { \tilde { \sigma } } _ { \mathbf { \tilde { \sigma } } }$ GREENy// $^ { \prime }$ GREENy SHIRT// $\mathbf { \mu } _ { \mathbf { \mu } } .$ SHORT sleeve SHIRT//

Tone unit boundaries are marked with $^ 6 / / ^ { \prime }$ ; prominent syllables are in upper case; tone choice begins on the underlined syllable; tone choice in the tone unit is represented by $\pmb { \mathcal { s } }$ $\mathop {  } =$ Rising or Falling-rising tone), $\blacktriangleleft$ $\left( = \right.$ Falling tone; Risingfalling tone does not occur in any of the extracts below), or $\nrightarrow$ $\overleftarrow { }$ Level tone). $\mathbf { \sigma } ^ { \bullet } \mathbf { N } \mathbf { S } b ^ { \bullet }$ indicates that this was said by native speaker informant $\bullet _ { b } \bullet$ (see below). 'NNS' below indicates a non-native informant.

# 4. Methods and data

The method adopted in this study was to elicit comparable recordings by native and non-native speakers. 24 subjects were used in total, 12 native speakers (NS), and 12 non-native speakers (NNS). The NS subjects (NSa to l below), 6 male and 6 female, were all tertiary-educated British English speakers, none of whom had a perceptible regional accent. All were experienced teachers of English as a second or foreign language. Of the NNS subjects, four were speakers of Korean (NNSa to d below), four of Greek (NNSe to h), and four of Bahasa Indonesia (NNSi to l). The English proficiency of all the NNS subjects was in a relatively narrow band of English, between 5.5 to 6.0 on the IELTS test or around 560 on TOEFL. None had previously made an extended stay in an English-speaking country. Data were collected from the NNS subjects shortly after their arrival in Britain and just prior to the start of their postgraduate studies at the University of Birmingham. Although the ideal would have been to have a gender balance among the NNS subjects, too, the small number of females in the pool of suitable subjects meant that only one female, from Greece, was studied. Recordings were made using a good quality cassette recorder with an external microphone, and transcription was done by auditory analysis using the conventions of the discourse intonation framework.

Two data sources were used. One was readings of an extended, rehearsed, scripted dialogue between a student and a lecturer discussing the student's accommodation. These were read either by pairs of native or pairs of non-native subjects. The advantage of this kind of data is clear: it provides a set of parallel performances, with the same lexico-grammatical content, in which relevant contextual information is largely recoverable by the analyst, and in which points of consistency are readily identifiable. Here is an extract from the script followed by four of the total twenty-four versions of readings of a short section of the dialogue:

(3) ...I'm really not sure which one to choose. The problem is, they need to know soon. By the end of today, in fact. (NSa) II $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ the PROBlem IS // $\blacktriangleleft$ they NEED to know SOON/ (NSI) II $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ the PROBlem IS/! $\blacktriangleleft$ they NEED to know/ $\mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } _ { \mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } } \mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } _ { \mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } }$ SOON// (NNSa) /I $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ the PROBlem IS// $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ they NEED to KNOW/ $\mathbf { \tilde { \sigma } }$ SOON// (NNSI) /I $\twoheadrightarrow$ the PROBlem IS $/ /  \mathrm { T H E Y }$ need to KNOW// SOON//

However, the disadvantages of such data are also clear: the process of reading aloud is different from that of producing impromptu speech, and observed differences in the intonation of native and non-native speakers might derive from their differential abilities to replicate impromptu speech in their performance of a script.

As a way of ascertaining whether differences between native and non-native intonation observed in this data were likely to be a consequence of the process of reading aloud, or whether they represented differences which would extend to more spontaneous speech, a second set of data was examined. Samples of spontaneous speech were collected from the same subjects using two elicitation techniques. The first was through an information-transfer' activity in which pairs of subjects were provided with pictures which were similar, but which contained a number of differences. Subjects were asked to identify five of these differences without showing their partner their own picture. The second was a 'discussion' task in which pairs of subjects were asked to decide co-operatively on the order in which they would choose to purchase a range of appliances to furnish a kitchen. Although the outcome of these less controlled activities was predictable only to a certain extent, it was intended that they should provide examples of language having communicative purposes similar to those found in the dialogue readings. So, for example, it was hoped that the information transfer' activity would provide a reasonable number of questions, or other kinds of elicitation, and responses, and that the 'discussion' task would provide examples in which speakers disagreed and put forward opposing points of view. This expectation was realised in most cases. This corpus is referred to as the 'IT & D' ('Information Transfer' and 'Discussion') data below.

# 5. Results

An analysis was conducted of prominence, tone unit length, and tone choice. To investigate prominence placement and tone choice, points in the discourse were identified where there was a strong tendency for the NS subjects to make the same selection. These were taken to be 'target' intonation choices at that point. NNS choices were compared at these points in order to establish whether there was conformity to or deviation from these targets. Other features, such as tone unit length, received quantitative analysis. Major findings are reported below.

# (a) Prominence and tone unit length

Two main differences were observed between the NS and NNS subjects.

The first is that the NNS subjects tend to divide their speech into shorter tone units. This is found in both the Dialogue readings and the IT & D data. The figures for the average number of words per tone unit for the NS subjects as a group and the NNS subjects as a group are given in Fig. 1.

![](img/abd6fd21415b9a6a08fe0ff39fee6eb02accc98da76b218412ecbab24d229040.jpg)  
Figure 1. Average number of words per tone unit

One of the consequences of a shorter chunking of speech into tone units is that relatively more words are assigned prominence by the NNS subjects. This can be observed clearly in these fairly typical examples from the Dialogue readings:

(4) (NSg) 11 $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ it CERtainly has its adVANtages// (5) (NNSq)// $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ it CERtainly/ HAS/I $\nrightarrow$ ITS adVANtages/!

The second major difference is that within comparable tone units the NNS subjects tend to place tonic prominence later than do the NS subjects. Compare the highlighted sections of these extracts from the Dialogue readings:

(6) // it MIGHT be DIFficult// to WORK there// $( \mathbf { N S } = 1 1 )$ (7) it MIGHT be DIFficult// to WORK THERE// $( \mathbf { N N S } = 1 2 )$ (8) II i MAY stay here// to FINish my disserTAtion// $( \mathbf { N S } = 1 2 )$ (9) i MAY stay HERE// to FINish my disserTAtion// $( \mathrm { N N S } = 1 2 )$ (The bracketed information is intended to show, for example, that in the first extract, 11 out of the 12 NS subjects produced the highlighted tone unit in the way indicated: that is, with tonic prominence on 'work'.)

This tendency is seen, too, in the IT&D data, although it is naturally more difficult to quantify this in a systematic way. Here are typical examples by NNS subjects in which the highlighted tonic placement seems unmotivated in that there appears to be no reason for marking the word as selective:

(10) (NNSu)// $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ you KNOW/ $\nrightarrow$ you HAVE to/ to WAIT THERE// (11) (NNSr) // $\twoheadrightarrow$ but i THINK// $^ { \prime }$ that the SECond ONE//

# (b) Tone choice

A major difference in tone choice is that the NNS subjects select Level tone far more frequently than do the NS subjects. Fig. 2 gives figures to show the average percentage of all tone units assigned Level tone by the NS subjects and the NNS subjects.

![](img/f4951cad3a67927dc443058630f067291b9b22b44b81a11caa00568e476e21c0.jpg)  
Figure 2. Average percentage of Level tones

The second set of observations concern choice of Falling or Rising tone. In general, there seems to be a conformity in how the NS and NNS subjects employ the Falling/Rising distinction for purposes of information structuring; that is, both groups mark with Falling tone matter that is not yet part of the set of shared understandings or the common ground between speaker and hearer, and with Rising tone matter that is already part of the common ground. For illustration, here are two extracts from the Dialogue readings where there is a strong tendency for both sets of subjects to make the same choice. In the first, the highlighted word is given Falling tone by all $1 2 \bf N S$ and all 12 NNS subjects:

(12) ... the problem is they need to know soon..

and in the second, $1 0 \bf N S$ subjects and 9 NNS subjects attach Rising tone within the highlighted section ( $\mathbf { \ddot { s } }$ indicates that the 'Student' is talking and 'L' the 'Lecturer'):

(13) s Well, one of them is in a house in Selly Oak. L s ... The second one's a University flat in Griffin Close.

Choice of Rising tone here, marking The second one' as part of the set of shared understandings, carries a meaning which we might gloss as: "Having talked about one, it can be anticipated or taken for granted that I'll talk about a second".

However, the NNS subjects generally fail to match tone choices where the NS subjects exploit the general significance of the Falling/Rising distinction in giving what I wish to refer to as lack of confirmation. In the NS data, lack of confirmation is strongly associated with Rising tone. The first two examples of this are taken from the many similar instances in the Dialogue readings. In the highlighted part of (14) s And I'd probably have to get another bus to go shopping. L No, there are shops nearby.

10 NS subjects selected Rising tone, while 11 NNS subjects selected Falling tone. 'No' with Rising tone is heard as a more discreet contradiction than with a Falling tone. Similarly, in

(15) S It might be difficult to work there. L Yes, it can be difficult, but in my experience students are happiest in University accommodation.

12 NS subjects selected Rising tone, but all 12 NNS subjects chose to attach a Falling tone within the marked section. With Rising tone, the speaker is heard as declining to give the confirmation that is asked for in the previous turn. This seems to be an example of a common pattern, in British English at least, where we try to say something 'positive', in this case agreeing--with Rising tone-- before saying something 'negative', in this case disagreeing -with Falling tone.

There is evidence to support this observation in the IT & D data. In the 'Discussion' activity in particular, there are occasions in which speakers express disagreement or reservation about the order in which it is proposed that pieces of kitchen equipment should be purchased. It is fair to say that in the NS data there is a strong association between Rising tone and those points at which there is a failure to concur with the preference stated by the partner. It would be difficult, however, to quantify the strength of this association as some of the turns in which concurrence is withheld extend over a number of tone units, not all of which are assigned Rising tone. For example, at the point in the discussion from which the following extract is taken

(16) (NSe) . $\mathcal { N } ^ { \star }$ how can we KEEP food/ how can we keep MILK// and - (NSf)1/ well we ARE quite near/ $\mathbf { \mu } _ { \mathbf { \mu } _ { \mathbf { \mu } } } .$ the SHOPS//

fhas stated that he thinks the next purchase should be a washing machine, while $e$ puts forward arguments in favour of a fridge. $f { \bf s }$ strategy in this extract is to try to bring $^ e$ around to his view by presenting the closeness of their accommodation to the shops as if it were a relevant factor that $^ e$ already knew --that is, as if it were part of the common ground between them-- but had, perhaps, not taken into account. Similarly, in

(17) (NSa) $\ldots / / $ it's a TOSS-up// $\mathbf { \tilde { \Delta } }$ between the COOKer and the FRIDGE/ as far as I'M concerned// (NSb) $/ / $ we don't NEED the fridge/ $\mathbf { \mu } _ { \mathbf { \mu } _ { \mathbf { \mu } } } .$ quite as MUCH as the $\mathbf { C O O K e r } / /  \mathrm { ~ i ~ }$ mean you can always LEAVE/ LIKE MILK and stuff/ on the WINdow sill/

$^ { b }$ argues in favour of buying the cooker before the fridge by presenting considerations as if $\pmb { a }$ is already aware of them, signalled by selection of Rising tone.

At comparable points in the NNS data, there is much less consistency. In a small number of cases, the NNS subjects adopt a similar strategy to that demonstrated by the NS subjects; for example, in

(18) (NNSj) $/ /  \mathrm { T H E N } / / $ the FIRST// $\mathbf { \hat { \mu } } _ { \mathbf { \hat { \mu } } } ^ { \mathbf { \mu } }$ priORity// $\mathbf { \Delta } _ { \mathbf { \mathcal { A } } }$ is the COOKer $/ / $ 'cause Otherwise we COULDn't // EAT/! $( \mathrm { N N S } i ) / / { \Join \underbrace { \mathrm { Y E A H } } } / / {  \mathrm { B U T } } / / . .$

Much more frequently, however, disagreement is associated with Falling tone, as exemplified in:

(19) (NNSi) $/ / \mathcal { \pm } \mathrm { \mathcal { \mathrm { Y } E A H } / / \mathcal { \pm } \mathrm { \Delta } } \mathbb { B } \mathrm { U T } / / \mathbf { \lambda } .$ BUT we $\mathbf { { C A N } } / / \mathbf { {  } }$ we can EAT// $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ SOMEwhere ELSE/ $^ { \prime }$ in a REStaurant/ $^ { \prime }$ for exAMple// (NNSj) $/ /  \underline { { \mathrm { I T } } } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { S } / /  \mathbf {  \mathbf {  \mathbf {  \Lambda } } }$ quite exPENsive//

in which NNS subject j offers a counter-argument in support of his preference for a cooker as the next purchase. The purpose of this is directly comparable withf's utterance in example 16 above in which Rising tone was selected. A further example occurs in

(20) (NNSe) // it's very POSsible/ to EAT er/ reFECtory// (NNSf)//YES/->BUT erm/ $\mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { \hat { \Pi } } ^ { \prime }$ i THINK that erm/ COOKer// $\nrightarrow$ IS er// MORE useful//

where, on the basis of evidence such as that presented above, from a native speaker we might anticipate a Rising tone either in 'yes' or at some point in 'I think that erm cooker is er more useful'.

# 6. Discussion and conclusions

The study was designed primarily to be descriptive, seeking to identify both quantitative and qualitative differences between intonation in the native and nonnative data. However, it would also be appropriate to offer some attempt to account for these differences, bearing in mind that this should be taken to be, at this stage, merely a best guess, needing a considerable amount of further investigation.

It seems likely that at most stages in the process of speech production, nonnatives will encounter more difficulties than native speakers. Encoding and articulating a message with an appropriate lexico-grammatical and phonological form will be inhibited or slowed down by their relatively restricted access to and experience of the second language. A possible manifestation of this exhibited in the data is that the NNS subjects on average divide their speech into relatively short units of forward planning (or tone units). At times of particular difficulty, each tone unit may contain only one word, or even one syllable, as the speaker, in reading, attempts to make sense of the text and articulate it appropriately or, in impromptu speech, determines what to say next using only limited linguistic resources.

A further manifestation of difficulties in speech processing is a disengagement from the process of making a moment-by-moment assessment of the state of understanding between the speaker and hearer which is necessary to produce intonation choices appropriate to the prevailing communicative requirements. One consequence of disengagement is the selection of Level tone, through which the speaker avoids attaching the interactive implications of the Falling/Rising opposition. A second is the delivery of sections of speech in citation: that is, treated as isolated forms, separate from the prevailing context of interaction. The result is the assignment of prominence to words where this is interactionally unmotivated, prominence being attached to contextually non-selective items. The greater frequency of Level tone and the tendency to place tonic prominence later than do the NS subjects within comparable tone units might both derive from the fact that non-natives are likely to disengage more frequently than native speakers.

It should be noted, however, that shorter average tone units and a higher frequency of Level tones are found for the native and non-native subjects alike in the more spontaneous IT & D data when compared with the Dialogue readings. That is to say, both groups respond in similar ways when they encounter conditions of speech production in which they are required to conceptualise, formulate and articulate a message in real time rather than produce rehearsed speech read aloud from a given text. This suggests that these possible manifestations of processing difficulties are not restricted to either native or non-native speakers and that what distinguishes the two groups is the relative frequency of their occurrence.

It seems unlikely that we could account in the same way for the observation that non-native subjects exploit the socially integrative implications of Rising tone in withholding agreement or approval. This failure to exploit the Falling/ Rising opposition for what are essentially phatic purposes would seem to reflect a lack of awareness among the non-native subjects of this relationship between intonation and social convention in British English. It is possible only to speculate on reasons for this. It may be that in the first languages of the non-native subjects a comparable use of Rising tone for the purposes of social integration does not occur and that such purposes, if they exist at all, are achieved by some other means. The relative lack of exposure to naturally-occurring spoken English among the subjects may mean that they have not become aware of the kinds of contexts in which Rising tone is used by native speakers to achieve such socially integrative aims.

I argued above that we need to develop a research base which is intended to inform effective teaching procedure. As the study presented has attempted to make a small contribution to such a research base, it would be appropriate to conclude by making some observations on what implications the findings reported here might have for what we teach about English intonation. I have suggested that two major influences which might result in differences observed in the NS and NNS data in tone unit length, the number of words assigned prominence, and selection of Level tone, might be the relatively lower capacity of the NNS subjects to plan ahead and their tendency to 'disengage' more frequently. Given the difficulties frequently encountered by learners in making appropriate phonological, lexical and grammatical choices in systems that are unfamiliar compared to those of the first language, it is unsurprising that non-native speakers will attempt to gain planning time and will be distracted from the process of making a moment-bymoment assessment of the state of understanding between themselves and their interlocutors. It seems likely to be the case that as there is increased competence in other aspects of English, so discrepancies between native and non-native performance will automatically be reduced.

This is not to say, of course, that nothing useful can be done to speed up the process. Steps can be taken, for example, to sensitise learners to the characteristic differences between utterances which are 'interactive' and those which are 'disengaged' or represent citation forms. However, such sensitisation to why words are assigned prominence or not seems unlikely to be achieved simply by the repetition of sentences. The difficulties encountered in other aspects of speech processing may well distract from the inference of any generalisation from such a procedure. This is more likely to occur when students are freed from the difficulties of speaking themselves, and are able to focus on the communicative implications of the speech of others. This suggests that a greater emphasis needs to be given to guided listening for intonation choices and, where appropriate, analysis of alternative choices. It is perhaps unfortunate, however, that intonation is usually seen to fall outside the domain of listening comprehension, despite calls for it to be given greater attention (for example, Dirven & Oakeshott-Taylor 1984; Brazil 1986).

Finally, the observation of the failure of the NNS subjects examined here to exploit in the same way as the NS subjects the Falling/Rising opposition for the apparent purpose of reducing potential confrontation in social interaction suggests that this might be a fruitful area of teaching. Before we can go forward with confidence, however, we obviously need a clearer understanding of this interplay between intonation and social convention both in British English and other target varieties of English.
