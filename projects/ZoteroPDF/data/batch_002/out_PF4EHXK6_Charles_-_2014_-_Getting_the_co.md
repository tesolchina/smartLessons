This paper reports on the long-term use of personal do-it-yourself corpora by students of EAP. Forty international graduate students attended a course in which they built and examined their own corpora of research articles in their field. One year after the course, they completed an email questionnaire, which asked about their corpus use in the 12 months since the end of the course. Results show that $7 0 \%$ of the respondents had used their corpus: $3 8 \%$ were regular users (once per week or more), $3 3 \%$ irregular users (once per month or seldom) and $3 0 \%$ non-users. Most users consulted the corpus for checking grammar and lexis while composing and revising and $9 3 \%$ of them considered that corpus use had improved their academic writing. Reasons for non-use included the small size of the corpus and its lack of reliability and convenience. Case studies of a user and a non-user are presented and highlight two other factors likely to affect take-up: the individual’s writing process and the focus of their current writing concerns. The paper discusses the reasons behind long-term use of personal corpora and some of the challenges to be overcome in extending the approach more widely.

# 1. Introduction

The direct use of corpus data by language learners has now been a subject of study for over two decades and there has been a particular focus on the teaching and learning of academic writing in English at university level (for reviews see Boulton, 2010b; Flowerdew, 2010; Yoon, 2011). Research has been carried out with students working on three main types of corpora: large general corpora like the British National Corpus (BNC); small specialised corpora, often compiled for an individual discipline-specific course; and personal do-it-yourself corpora constructed by students themselves. One overall driver for this research effort has been to understand whether, to what extent, and under which circumstances students can usefully engage directly with corpus data as they learn academic writing. To date, the majority of the work has been based on large general corpora, but there is growing interest in the use of specialised and personal corpora.

Research with students using large general corpora lends itself particularly well to the teaching/learning of individual lexico-grammatical items and has employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative studies include those which used an experimental set-up to investigate whether corpus consultation had a demonstrable effect on student learning of individual items (e.g., Boulton, 2009, 2010a; Cresswell, 2007; Estling Vannestål & Lindquist, 2007). Here there was evidence that students using corpus data performed better than control groups, although results were not conclusive in all cases. Other studies, which quantified the success rate of error correction/self-correction, showed more positive outcomes, suggesting that students were able to apply corpus data to solving language problems (e.g., Gaskell & Cobb, 2004; Gilmore,

2009; Watson Todd, 2001). The qualitative research employed methods such as questionnaires and interviews to examine student attitudes to and evaluation of corpus use (e.g., Bernardini, 2000; Granath, 2009; Varley, 2009; Yoon, 2008; Yoon & Hirvela, 2004). Again, the results of these studies were somewhat mixed, with students’ enthusiasm for corpus work often depending both on their level of English and the extent of training and support available.

Work with specialised corpora, while still addressing lexico-grammar, is also able to focus on genre and discourse issues, as discussed by several researchers (e.g., Bondi, 2001; Charles, 2007, in press; Flowerdew, 2012; Gavioli, 2005). For example, Weber’s (2001) students consulted a corpus of law essays; they used concordances to identify the links between lexicogrammatical items and generic moves and succeeded in producing acceptable law essays. Improvement in writing a specific genre, research articles (RAs) in psychology, was also noted by Bianchi and Pazzaglia (2007), whose students helped compile a class corpus of relevant RAs. Hafner and Candlin (2007) provided students with a corpus of legal cases for help with their writing assignments outside class. They found roughly equal numbers of users and non-users, with the non-users divided between those who preferred other web-based tools for checking language and those who preferred not to use such tools at all. They made the point that the students had not developed long-term habits of using the corpus; rather they used it opportunistically to provide support for specific assignments.

Finally, a much smaller number of studies describes the use of personal corpora built by students themselves. Lee and Swales (2006) report on the achievements of six students who presented linguistic investigations of self-chosen aspects of their own discipline. Similarly, Gavioli’s (2009) English majors wrote extended papers after compiling and examining personal corpora for their own research purposes. In both cases, the students have effectively become corpus linguists, an approach which requires large inputs of time and resources and may well be beyond reach on most academic writing courses. However, working with larger, multi-disciplinary groups and within more limited time and resource constraints, Charles (2012) also reported positive evaluations of a course in which students used personal corpora to explore discourse functions in their disciplines.

To date, however, attention has focused primarily on student achievements and evaluation of corpus work immediately after a corpus course has been completed. As Pérez-Paredes, Sánchez-Tornel, and Alcaraz Calero (2013) point out, there is little data on long-term use, and in particular on whether students carry on using corpora once their course has finished. Although Yoon (2008) tracks her students’ corpus use for approximately half a year, both during and after their course, her research is based on just six case studies and thus does not provide quantitative data on continuing corpus use. If corpora are to take their place as a third reference resource alongside dictionaries and reference grammars, then it is important to determine whether student take-up persists in the longer term. The aim of the present study is to examine the extent of students’ use of corpora one year after they took an academic writing course in which they constructed their own personal corpus and learnt how to use it to answer language queries.

# 2. Background to the study

This research is based on data provided by 40 international students who attended a corpus-building course in 2009 or 2010 and reported on their corpus use one year later. The course, which forms part of the Academic Writing programme at Oxford University Language Centre, is designed for advanced-level graduates and is open-access and non-assessed. Groups of approximately 15–18 students are taught in $5 / 6$ parallel, multi-disciplinary classes. The corpus work takes place over 6 weeks, with one two-hour session per week. Classes are held in a computer lab, although some students also work on their own computers.

# 2.1. The course

The course is designed to offer participants the opportunity to create a personal corpus and practice retrieving and interpreting the information it provides. In class, students work with their own corpora in order to answer lexico-grammatical queries and explore discourse issues. Details of the programme and its rationale are discussed fully in Charles (2012); here I just summarise its major features.

The first session offers an introduction to corpora and a demonstration of the freely available concordance software AntConc (Anthony, 2007), which students use to consult a corpus of theses previously constructed by the researcher. The focus is on the potential of corpora to deal with lexico-grammatical queries. In the second session, students build a personal corpus, by selecting RAs in their fields and converting them into text files. They are also shown how to clean the files by removing matter which is not part of the running text (e.g., references, graphical elements). This procedure makes it easier to read concordance lines and renders the statistical data more reliable. Partial cleaning is recommended, but it is left to students to decide whether to clean or not and many do not do so. Each of the remaining four sessions focuses on a different corpus tool and provides detailed questions which ask students to explore a specific discourse function in their personal corpus. For example, in the session on argumentation, students use the Word List tool to explore the frequency and sentence position of linking adverbials such as however in their own field. By the end of the course, students are familiar with concordancing and have used the Plot tool, which gives a graphic representation of the occurrence of a search term throughout each corpus file; they have examined the words in their corpus using the Word List tool and have retrieved collocations using the Collocates and Clusters tools. Some students use their personal corpus frequently outside class and become proficient at searching and interpreting their data, but by the end of the course, all have attained a basic competence in corpus skills.

One of the stated aims of the course is to provide students with a custom-built resource which will be available throughout their future academic career, and with the know-how and skills to use it effectively. The rationale for building a personal corpus is that its use will help students to move away from an over-reliance on outside agencies such as teachers and proofreaders and to become more independent and autonomous in their production of academic texts. Thus it is important to determine whether this aim is fulfilled, by ascertaining the extent to which students made consulting their personal corpus part of their normal writing practice after the course had finished.

# 3. Method and data

Details of participants’ background and prior corpus use were obtained from a questionnaire given at the beginning of the course; data on the size of students’ personal corpora were collected at the end of the course. A follow-up questionnaire was administered by email approximately one year after completion of the course; its purpose was to investigate participants’ corpus use during the preceding 12 months. The survey consisted of 12 closed and open questions, which were emailed to participants, completed and returned electronically. Where necessary, there was email correspondence to amplify or clarify students’ answers.

Background data were available for 50 students from 2009 and 53 from 2010. Attempts were made to contact all 103 students one year after the course, but this proved difficult, since many students moved away or changed their email addresses once they had completed their studies. However, responses were obtained from 17 students of 2009 and 23 of 2010. As there were no substantial differences between the two courses, the data from the two year-groups were combined, giving a total of 40 participant responses.

To provide further insight into how personal corpus use may or may not fit in with an individual student’s preferred writing procedures, two contrasting case studies are also presented. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out with two students, selected to show contrast in disciplinary area and on-going corpus use. One was a social scientist and keen user; the other a natural scientist and non-user. Each interview lasted approximately one hour and participants were asked both to enlarge upon their responses to the follow-up questionnaire as well as to describe their writing practices.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Respondents

Background data showed that 23 respondents $( 5 8 \% )$ were female and 17 $( 4 3 \% )$ male. The largest number of participants were from China (12), but 24 different countries were represented, indicating that students came from a wide range of cultural and educational backgrounds. Twenty-nine respondents $( 7 3 \% ) .$ , were doctoral candidates, while 11 $( 2 8 \% )$ were Master’s students. Participants studied in 25 different fields: 16 natural sciences $( 4 0 \% )$ ; 16 social sciences $( 4 0 \% )$ ; 8 arts/humanities $( 2 0 \% )$ . The most frequently represented disciplines were Education (6 students), Engineering (4), Applied Linguistics, Chemistry and Medicine (3 each). These data on gender, background, degree level and field are consistent with those for course participants as a whole (Charles, 2012). Thus the profile of the current respondents reflects the make-up of the original classes.

# 4.2. Size of the personal corpora

In many cases, it proved difficult to obtain data on the size of the personal corpora after 1 yr had elapsed, probably because students did not necessarily have their corpus open as they completed the questionnaire. However, the majority of the students stated that they had not made any changes to their corpus since the end of the course; thus the data on corpus size given at that time provide a reasonably accurate picture of the size of the personal corpora. These data are presented here; the changes reported by some students are discussed in Section 4.4 below.

While corpora are usually measured in number of words, here both the number of words and the number of RA files are given. This is for two reasons: first some students recorded only the number of files; second, and more interestingly, the number of files provides evidence of the amount of work that each student devoted to corpus construction, since each RA file was chosen, converted to text format, optionally cleaned and added to the corpus individually. However, although the number of files indicates the student’s level of commitment to their personal corpus, it does not give a reliable indication of the size of the corpus. Because of large disciplinary differences in the length of RAs, there is no consistent relationship between numbers of files and numbers of words across different fields. Thus the corpus with the lowest number of files (6) was constructed in the field of Egyptology and held 64,742 words, an average of 10,790 words per file. By contrast, the smallest corpus in number of words was 37,473 words in psychiatry; it contained 10 files, with an average of just 3,747 words per file.

The personal corpora varied widely in the number of files they contained, ranging from 6 to 80 (mean: 19.7; median: 12). Figure 1 groups the file counts into bands and shows the number of personal corpora in each category. Most students $( 5 5 \% )$ constructed corpora of 10–15 files, but 7 $( 1 8 \% )$ created corpora with more than twice this number, that is, 31 files and over. This represents a substantial achievement and suggests that these students see considerable value in their personal corpus.

![](img/e334b150ac69e66ff6e691e24f513b576be45b75376082ae9a71e184df05da89.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Number of files per corpus.

Twenty-nine respondents gave the number of words in their corpus, data which again revealed a wide variation. The range was from 37,473 to 1,128,468 words (mean: 67,164; median: 113,090). In reporting the size of the corpora in words, however, we should bear in mind that many have not been cleaned, and that the inclusion of material that is not part of the running text leads to somewhat elevated word counts. Figure 2 presents the number of personal corpora in each band of the word count and shows that 12 students $( 3 0 \% )$ constructed corpora of 50,000–99,999 words; 9 $( 2 3 \% )$ built corpora of 100,000–199,999 words, while a further 6 $( 1 5 \% )$ constructed corpora of considerable size, that is, 200,000 words and over.

Although many of these corpora are modest in size by the standards of linguistic research, I would suggest that, given their highly specialised nature, most would provide a useful resource for answering students’ lexico-grammatical queries and exploring the characteristics of discourse within a highly specialised field.

# 4.3. Use of the personal corpus

The follow-up questionnaire asked whether students had used their personal corpus at any time since the course ended. The results showed that 28 students $( 7 0 \% )$ had done so, while 12 $( 3 0 \% )$ had not. Thus a clear majority of students had used their personal corpus since the end of the course. This result is encouraging, since it suggests that the students were able to make use of their corpus independently, even after a relatively short course and in the absence of further input or help from a corpus specialist.

Moreover, of the 12 students who had not used their corpus at all, 5 $( 1 3 \% )$ stated that they intended to use it in the future when they had to do some academic writing:

‘At the moment I am just doing experiments in the lab but soon I need to write my transfer report and I am looking forward to use my corpus in that stage.’ (Iranian medical student).

Thus non-users did not necessarily reject corpus use; they may simply not be at a stage of their work where the corpus would be useful, a point also made by Yoon (2008). It is also worth noting that another 2 non-users $( 5 \% )$ consulted another corpus, usually the BNC. These students therefore incorporated corpora into their writing practice, but chose a resource that suited them better. A year after the corpus course, then, we can say that 35 students or $8 6 \%$ have used or intend to use corpora in their academic writing. This clearly indicates that students recognise the value of corpus consultation and consider it a worthwhile addition to their resources for writing.

Fig. 3. Frequency of use of the personal corpus.

Users were asked to estimate their frequency of personal corpus use according to the following categories: several times a day/about once a day/about 5 times a week/about once a week/about once a month/seldom. Results appear in Figure 3. Several students made the point that their frequency of use depended on the stage of their work:

‘It depends on whether I write, read or analyse my data at any particular period of time’. (Belorussian political scientist

The data do not show how intensively the corpus was used on each occasion; nonetheless they do provide a rough estimate of the extent of corpus use. Taking those who consulted their corpus once per week or more to be ‘regular users’ and those who did so once per month or seldom to be ‘irregular users’, the data fall into three groups as follows: 15 $( 3 8 \% )$ regular users; 13 $( 3 3 \% )$ irregular users; 12 $( 3 0 \% )$ non-users. These three groups are roughly equal, with regular users just slightly higher in number than irregular users, which in turn are slightly more numerous than non-users.

# 4.4. Modifications and new corpora

The majority of students $( 7 0 \% )$ , including all non-users and 16 users, made no changes to their corpora during the year. Twelve users $( 3 0 \% )$ reported having made modifications by adding, or deleting and adding files. For these students, their corpus is a resource which they adjust to reflect and respond to their needs as these develop and change over time. Although none of the students gave the number of words, the number of files in some of the corpora were impressive, with two students giving a figure of 50 files or more and four students reporting corpora of 100 files or over, including one with a corpus of 640 files. This student explained:

‘I add every paper I read. It makes me feel more confident when I use a phrase that has 2000 hits instead of 20.’ (Polish chemist).

The extent of these corpora suggests that the problem of students ‘drowning in data’ (Ädel, 2010, p. 46) when they consult large corpora may not apply to their personal corpus. As students have built these corpora themselves, they know and understand the contents and are therefore likely to be better able to handle large quantities of data. Indeed, as discussed in Section 5, it may well be that students are more often deterred from using personal corpora because they are too small than because they are too big.

A completely unexpected development was that one student had built three corpora. She was an engineer who was conducting an interdisciplinary doctoral study on energy use in buildings. This involved work in social science, engineering and environmental science. She noticed that there was little or no consistency in the terminology used across different disciplines, and compiled three corpora to help her pinpoint these differences. Although conclusions cannot be drawn from a single student’s experience, it is worth noting that the skill of corpus-building may not only be useful for academic writing, but may also contribute more generally to a student’s research goals. Once she became aware of the corpus approach, this student was able to see its potential in her own work and exploited it for her own purposes.

# 4.5. Purpose of use

To explore how personal corpora were incorporated into their writing practice, users were asked whether they used it for composing, revising or both processes. Although it might be expected that students would consult the corpus primarily for revision, this was not the case; $4 6 \%$ used the corpus for both composing and revising, $2 9 \%$ for composing alone and $1 8 \%$ for revising alone.

Students mentioned checking both grammar and lexis:

‘It was a useful way to check the grammar/expressions of my written work.’ (Japanese sociolinguist).

‘I use the corpus when I need to use constructions I am not sure of.’ (Italian engineer).

‘I find it helpful in my writing and as way to check my wording.’ (Israeli historian).

Such responses are consistent with those reported in earlier research (Charles, 2012; Yoon, 2011) and indicate that students often used the corpus for help with sentence level difficulties. Although the original course focused on discourse concerns, respondents did not specifically mention using the corpus to deal with such issues. This could suggest that addressing lexico-grammatical concerns is students’ most pressing need (Lee & Swales, 2006). However, as the participants had relatively little experience with corpus techniques and tools, it could also be that lexico-grammatical information was easier to access and interpret. Recent research tracking user corpus interaction shows that learners tend to perform relatively simple searches (Pérez-Paredes, Sánchez-Tornel, Alcaraz Calero, & Aguado Jimenez, 2011; Pérez-Paredes et al., 2013; Yoon, 2012) and further work in this area should help shed light on student search types.

# 4.6. Improvements noted by users

Users were asked whether use of the personal corpus had improved their academic writing during the year and gave their opinion on a 5-point scale: yes definitely; yes probably; undecided: probably not; definitely not. The overwhelming majority of users considered that the use of the corpus had helped improve their writing, with $5 0 \%$ answering yes definitely and $4 3 \%$ , yes probably. Together this amounts to $9 3 \%$ of the users. The two students who answered probably not both used the corpus seldom, which may be one reason why they did not detect any improvement.

However, when users were asked whether their search techniques had improved over the year, their responses showed less confidence. Taken together, those who definitely and probably agreed that their techniques had improved amounted to $5 7 \%$ , a majority, although not as large as for improvement in writing. However, about a fifth of students $( 2 1 \% )$ were undecided and the same number answered negatively. Although all those who answered probably not used the corpus seldom, half those who were undecided were frequent users. This equivocal attitude to improvement in corpus techniques underlines the fact that corpus skills may well require ongoing training and extensive practice:

‘I think students might need lots of practice to make it feel natural for them like searching on Google.’ (Mongolian educationalist).

# 4.7. Negative views of personal corpora

Several disadvantages of personal corpus use were mentioned by users as well as non-users. These negative views provide important information on issues that affect the use of personal corpora and suggest ways in which the resource could be improved.

# 4.7.1. Accessibility

Accessibility includes convenience, ease of use and speed, three factors that were often mentioned, when personal corpora were compared negatively to Google:

‘I just found to google the word or phrases is much easier than using the software.’ (Chinese medical student).

Some students also mentioned more technical aspects of accessibility, for example having to re-install the software when they changed computers. In particular, it was inconvenient for those who worked on several different computers to install the software on each computer they used. As one student pointed out, a solution to these problems could be provided through a web-based interface that allowed the personal corpus to be stored in the ‘cloud’ and consulted on-line from any computer:

‘Users would not have to install/launch an application on their computer: they only need a browser.’ (Taiwanese orientalist).

# 4.7.2. Size

Some students raised concerns about the small size of their personal corpus, especially when compared to corpora such as the BNC:

‘Mine is too small. I’d rather use those popular corpora on the web.’ (Chinese applied linguist).

As noted above, there was a wide range in the size of these corpora and some were undoubtedly too small to answer certain queries. While students should be encouraged to keep adding to their corpus, they have limited time available and if they are to undertake substantial corpus construction, they need to be convinced that the utility of the resource justifies the time taken to build it. This point highlights the importance of the early stages of personal corpus work, when the corpora are not yet well-developed; it is necessary to devise tasks that offer opportunities for discovery in all disciplines and with even very small corpora. For example, investigating reporting verbs (show, find, argue, suggest) is likely to produce hits for all students and to reveal disciplinary tendencies in tense and voice use. Working in groups can also enable students to supplement their individual findings, while students taking the same course may be able to combine corpora.

# 4.7.3. Reliability

Underlying the concern with size is the issue of reliability. Although results from smaller corpora may indeed not be reliable and such corpora certainly need expanding, some respondents seemed to be reluctant to trust their personal corpus, even when it was fairly large. This may be for two reasons: first, students are used to relying on external authoritative sources (e.g., dictionaries), which they have had no hand in creating. When using their own corpus, it may take time to develop confidence in the data they retrieve and in their own judgements and interpretations. Second, like all novice corpus users, students experience the surprise of an unmediated encounter with the data and the corpus may reveal evidence that runs counter to their expectations. Although initially it may be an uncomfortable experience, this confrontation with the data is consistent with the approach demanded of many graduate researchers in their own fields: to seek out and interpret evidence. In promoting personal corpus use, then, the writing class can support and even contribute to graduates’ general academic development.

# 4.7.4. English level

A further issue connected to reliability was raised by students who expressed reservations about the standard of English:

‘The English used in many publications, even in those high-profile papers are not always perfectly written.’ (Chinese plant scientist).

Although this student was a user of his personal corpus, he clearly lacked confidence in the reliability of its contents. While it may be true that these RAs were good enough, in the sense that they were published in well-regarded journals, they may not provide appropriate lexico-grammatical evidence for his current writing needs. This problem is one that may affect certain disciplines more than others and, although students can be advised to select RAs with native-speaker authors, this is difficult to determine, and is in itself no guarantee of the quality of the writing. Another approach would be for students in consultation with supervisors to determine which journals and writers are likely to satisfy their language requirements.

# 4.7.5. Cleaning

Although cleaning the corpus improves its usability and reliability, it can be a time-consuming task and caused problems for some students:

‘It [my corpus] won’t be good enough as too many bugs using my own dirty database.’ (Chinese art historian).

Half the users cleaned their corpus partially or completely and would recommend doing so. However, there is a trade-off between the time taken to clean the corpus and the time saved by consulting a clean corpus. A compromise is to encourage, but not require, students to do minimal cleaning by deleting references and front matter. After trialling the corpus in this form, students can clean more rigorously later, if necessary.

# 4.8. Use of other corpora and Google

To get some idea of the other resources students consulted for help with their writing, participants were asked whether they used other corpora or Google to answer language queries. Twenty-six students $( 6 5 \% )$ reported consulting these sources, while 12 $( 3 0 \% )$ did not. As expected, Google was the resource mentioned most frequently, by 18 students $(45 \% )$ ; the BNC was used by 10 $( 2 5 \% )$ , the thesis corpus (500,000 words of natural and social science provided in class) by three $( 8 \% )$ and the Corpus of Contemporary American English by one $( 3 \% )$ . Given the ease of use and ubiquity of Google, it is perhaps surprising that its use was not even more widespread. Indeed one student was firm in his rejection, arguing that Google did not provide reliable guidance on language:

‘I never use Google for this purpose, because there one can find any collocation.’ (Russian chemist).

These data suggest that there is a need to supplement a general search engine like Google with a resource designed specifically for linguistic investigation and provide support for the introduction of corpus work in language classes, especially with advanced and highly specialised learners such as those in this study.

It is interesting to note that, contrary to expectations, Google and other corpora do not appear to be used as replacements for personal corpora, but rather as supplements to them. Thus $7 1 \%$ of personal corpus users also consulted these resources, while only half the non-users did so. This might suggest that users of personal corpora have a tendency to seek computerbased help with writing, but further research with more participants is necessary to verify this finding.

# 4.9. Student recommendations

Students were asked whether they would recommend other international students to build their own corpora. Twenty students $( 5 0 \% )$ agreed that they would definitely recommend corpus-building, while a further 15 $( 3 8 \% )$ said that they would probably recommend it. Taken together, these figures amount to $8 8 \%$ of all students and reveal extensive support for corpus construction. It is not surprising that endorsement is high among users $( 9 6 \% )$ . However, it is unexpected to find strong support also among non-users, with eight out of 12 $( 6 7 \% )$ probably or definitely recommending the approach. This might suggest that students consider the process of learning to build a corpus to be a useful learning experience in itself. Building a personal corpus encourages students to focus on the linguistic features of RAs, not just their content and this may lead to greater awareness and understanding of discourse in their discipline. However, the reasons for this finding are as yet unclear.

# 4.10. Potential factors in long-term corpus use

An attempt was made to determine whether certain factors might influence long-term use of the personal corpus. The first aspect examined was disciplinary area. It was hypothesised that, given its strong emphasis on quantitative data, corpus work might appeal more to natural scientists than to social scientists or arts/humanities students. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed: the percentage of users was slightly lower for natural scientists $( 6 3 \% )$ than for social science and arts/ humanities students (both $7 5 \%$ ). As writing in the latter two fields tends to be less conventionalised, it is possible that students encounter more problems and thus have greater need of their personal corpus. However, a chi-square test showed the difference in use between the three areas to be not statistically significant $\chi ^ { 2 } = 0 . 7 1 4$ , $p = 0 . 7 0 0 \mathrm { _ { \ell } }$ ) and more research is required to explore this issue.

Another factor that could affect ongoing corpus use is degree level. The hypothesis was that doctoral students would be more likely to become long-term users than Master’s students, since their research lasts longer and their writing needs are more extensive. Many doctoral candidates also aim to publish in English and may therefore see the personal corpus as a useful resource for their future career. This hypothesis was confirmed: $7 6 \%$ of doctoral students were users, as against $5 5 \%$ o f Master’s students, but the difference was again not statistically significant $\chi ^ { 2 } = 1 . 7 3$ , $p = 0 . 1 8 9 \mathrm { \Omega } ,$ ) and this factor, too, requires further investigation.

# 5. Two case studies

The following section presents cases studies of two students whose attitude to their personal corpus developed along opposing trajectories. The first, Ahmad,1 reported moving from initial scepticism and apprehension to enthusiastic use, while the second, Piotr, described how he took the opposite path, from initial enthusiasm to disillusionment and rejection.

5.1. Ahmad, the frequent user: ‘like having a lovely friend’

Ahmad is an Urdu speaker from Pakistan; he has an IELTS score of 7.5 and is a doctoral student in comparative Islamic law. His initial reaction to corpus-building was very negative:

‘This is too technical. It’s not worth spending time. . . I was really scared.’

However, then he began to find it interesting:

‘It’s such fun to make different queries. It’s like having a lovely friend with you who can advise you any time you want.’

For Ahmad, corpus size is crucial. When he only had 10 files he often could not find what he was looking for, so he decide to enlarge the corpus, giving as his reason the advantage of having a single reference source to consult:

‘I just thought, let me build. . .er big enough so that I will not then have to look for lots of other sources.’

He gradually increased his corpus size so that it is now over 100 files (1,128,468 words) and states that he is ‘very rarely disappointed’ when he searches it. Like other students with large corpora, he stresses the greater confidence that comes with a large number of hits and makes the point that this is particularly important where the corpus contains RAs written by nonnative speakers:

‘If I find only 1 or 2 or 3, then I will not be confident to think, yes, this is accurate, because my corpus has non-native speakers as well, so they might not be using accurately.’

Unlike some students, he readily includes RAs written by non-native speakers in his corpus and is not overly critical of the English. In fact, he views it as having a higher standard than his own, saying, ‘that’s definitely better than mine.’ He also disagrees with other participants on the issue of cleaning. Although Ahmad himself has cleaned his corpus, he does not regard this as essential, considering that it affects the appearance rather than the usability of the corpus:

‘I don’t think it matters a lot. It’s just your own aesthetic sense.’

Two issues, time and convenience, surface continually as Ahmad describes and explains the role of the personal corpus in his overall writing process. He considers his biggest problem to be with definite/indefinite article use and he also mentions checking prepositions frequently. For him, however, these are issues that are mainly dealt with at the proofreading stage, which is when he makes most use of his corpus:

‘When I’m proofreading, then definitely my corpus is open, so I first check my corpus.’

By contrast, at the composing stage he uses the computer’s dictionary/thesaurus or Google for speed and convenience:

‘But if I really have to check something quickly, then definitely I’ll not stop working and then go and open my corpus. I’ll definitely go and check with the Google.’

Like other students he considers Google to be ‘easier’ and makes the point that it takes more time to open his corpus and that this would shift his focus of attention from ideas to language.

For Ahmad, then, the personal corpus fulfils a highly specific role. It has not replaced other long-established reference materials; rather, it supplements them, filling a gap in his writing resources by providing a reliable, custom-built proofreading aid. Indeed, at this proofreading stage, the personal corpus is Ahmad’s preferred tool and he has fully integrated its consultation into his writing practice.

5.2. Piotr, the non-user: ‘too much time, too much effort’

Piotr is a Russian doctoral student in chemistry with a grade C in the Cambridge Proficiency Examination. Prior to the corpus-building course, he attended a short course on corpus linguistics and thus already had some knowledge about corpora. He built a personal corpus of 10 files and was initially enthusiastic:

‘I was excited with the lessons, like ah, I should go and get this information from there.’

However, he soon gave up, offering several reasons, many of which were also noted by other non-users. He pointed out that his corpus was limited in size, which meant that it did not provide enough examples and he criticised the quality of the English:

‘Good paper doesn’t really guarantee good English.’

Time was again a crucial issue; like some other respondents, Piotr found it time-consuming to construct, clean and consult the corpus:

‘It just took too much time, too much effort.’

Of course, one could argue that most of Piotr’s reasons for non-use stem from his failure to invest sufficient time in building and cleaning his corpus and that had he done so, he would have found it more useful. However, this begs the question of why Ahmad decided to devote time to corpus construction, while, despite his early enthusiasm, Piotr did not.

Comparison of these two case studies suggests two reasons why one student may embrace the personal corpus approach and another may not. First, it is important to know which aspect(s) of writing the student identifies as most problematic. The main difficulty for Piotr lay in working out how to ‘tell the story’, the words his supervisor used to explain what was required in his writing. Piotr understood this as a problem with the coherence of his text:

‘In my head it sounds coherent, but I’m missing just some parts out.’

He dealt with this by writing a plan, which enabled him ‘to keep all the bits of the puzzle in’. Such issues of overall textual organisation are much less likely to be amenable to corpus investigation than the lexico-grammatical problems mentioned by Ahmad. Thus, if a student’s prime focus of attention is on aspects of discourse organisation, they are less likely to consider corpus-building worthwhile. This does not mean that Piotr’s texts were free from sentence-level problems; nor does it follow that corpus-building was a waste of time for him. However, it should be recognised that take-up of the personal corpus may well depend on the student’s perception of their main needs at any given time.

The second relevant issue is that a student may already have a well-established and successful set of procedures for writing and it may not be easy to incorporate personal corpus consultation into this framework. Thus Piotr’s normal practice was to select about 10 RAs for each of his thesis chapters and to read them on paper, highlighting and writing down collocations and grammar. He found that this procedure helped him to memorise the linguistic items he needed before he began to write. For Piotr, then, consulting the corpus was an extra, and therefore unnecessary, stage in his writing process:

‘I read the papers first. I highlighted what I want to anyway. If it was the language bit which I wanted, I highlighted it anyway and then I put it into the corpus and then I took it back, but I already had it.’

In his view, the corpus only gave him information which he had already gained from reading and noting useful language; corpus-building was therefore an inefficient use of his time. Thus Piotr was satisfied with the ability of his current writing procedures to deliver the linguistic information that he required. By contrast, Ahmad found that the resources at his disposal for proofreading were inadequate to his needs and therefore became keen to use the personal corpus to plug this gap.

What these two contrasting case studies emphasise is that reactions to corpus-building and eventual long-term take-up of personal corpus use are likely to be very diverse, depending on factors such as the individual’s writing process and the focus of their own writing concerns. Corpus work is one tool among many and although it is important that students have been introduced to it and understand its potential, it will not necessarily be relevant to all students at any given time.

# 6. Conclusions and Future Challenges

Results from this study show that most respondents did ‘get the corpus habit’, that is, they continued to use their personal corpus after the course had finished. To a greater or lesser extent, then, the students have incorporated this new tool into their writing practices; they are able to use it independently, without further assistance from corpus specialists, and they work autonomously, consulting their corpus in response to their own language needs. This suggests that the students consider their personal corpus to be a valuable resource, a conclusion supported by the improvement they perceive in their academic writing and by the fact that most would recommend corpus-building to other international students. Ongoing use also indicates substantial commitment to the personal corpus; users show their ownership both through the control they exert during its construction, as well as through the choice they exercise over when and how to make use of it. It may be concluded, then, that teaching students to build and consult a personal corpus is a worthwhile undertaking for advanced EAP classes and that even a short, introductory course can provide the foundation for long-term personal corpus use.

The present study is, however, limited in number of participants and raises many questions for future research. As noted earlier, it would be useful to ascertain whether factors such as discipline or degree level are associated with continued corpus use and research with a larger number of respondents should lead to greater clarification. Similarly, further research on reasons for non-use of the corpus is necessary with a view to increasing corpus take-up where it would be beneficial. Another important area for investigation concerns the type of searches that students typically perform. With this data, it should be possible to design courses that focus on specific tools and procedures, in order to give students more practice in the most useful elements of the personal corpus approach.

There are two types of challenges entailed in maximising the potential of personal corpora: pedagogical and technical. First, the irregularity of students’ writing requirements raises issues concerned with the timing and provision of corpus courses. Thus, in addition to one-off starter courses, it may be necessary to set up refresher sessions, drop-in clinics, on-line, on-demand courses or other means of just-in-time support, which would be responsive to student needs as they arise. The pedagogical challenge remains to get the tools into the hands of the learners at the right time and through the most appropriate channels.

A further issue that has implications for continued use is the question of ease of access. Student comments show that technical circumstances, including changes of computer, or work on multiple computers, may act as a deterrent to ongoing use of the personal corpus. The challenge here is for technical developers to address the need for accessibility and to design software and interfaces to support personal corpora in the cloud. Students are more likely to use their corpus if it is easily accessible when and where they need it.

However, student responses also suggest that the personal corpus can be regarded as more than a one-off resource, which, once constructed can be used throughout an academic career. Instead, it may be more appropriate to envisage the personal corpus user as one who is likely to build several different corpora over the course of their career, according to changes in their professional situation and technical circumstances. Thus, in the long run, learning the process of corpus construction (e.g. principles for selecting and organising corpus content) may be just as important as obtaining the product, the personal corpus. This implies a twofold need: for corpus courses that focus on such techniques for future use; and for technical developments which automate and facilitate the corpus-building process. These challenges need to be addressed for the benefits of personal corpora to be more fully realised and extended more widely to EAP writers.
