This paper proposes pedagogical activities for teaching students about gesture's intimate involvement with assessed speaking activities. The focus is on oral presentations and the communicative practice of navigating a visual with the audience's attention intact. The classroom materials were based on research published in the Journal of English for Academic Purposes and developed with three stages of input from language teachers at a university in Hong Kong. The class objectives are for students to discover how different ways of gesturing when explaining a visual can be demonstrably related to the presenters' situational awareness, content knowledge, and spoken language ability (in terms of grammatical complexity). While contributing to gesture pedagogy being developed from the perspectives of semiotic multimodality and Second Language Acquisition gesture studies, the materials embody an approach to gesture informed by enaction theory and ecological psychology.

# 1. Introduction

Courses on public speaking and oral presentations often include aclas or section dedicated to aspects of communication qualified as nonverbal, bodily, or embodied'. A salient example of such aspects would be the presenters' gesture, defined by Kendon (2004), for instance, as "visible bodily action that is intimately involved in the activity of speaking" (p.i). lthough this intimacy emerges naturally during development of language and social cognition (Di Plo et al., 2018; McNeill 992, teachers may lack guidelines and materials fr adressing its implications for asessed speaking activities. In the words of one career-long teacher of oral presentations, Who was referring to her intitions course handok, ethough the whle emester i on preenting sills it just says good body language', make eye-contact that's about al it says .. (Teaching Development workshop 47:16). This absence of specialized ma terial persts despite abundant studies of oral presentations shedding light on gesture for academic purposes from diverse perspectives. This paper proposes materials for a class exploring the presenter's communicative practice of navigating a visual with the audience's attention intact.

# 1.1. Learning outcome and class objectives

The main aim of the lesson proposed here is for students to learn that when presenters gesture while explaining their visuals, they inevitably reveal their depth of understanding of the visual as wel as their preparedness and ability to navigate it with an audience. This learning outcome is achieved by comparing the strikingly diffrent ways that two well-known public speakers gesture while explaining similarly technical visuals for their audience (American politician President Donald Trump and British science communicator Professor Brian Cox). The objectives are for students to discover how these different ways of gesturing can be demonstrably related to the presenters situational awarenes, content knowledge of the visual, and spoken language aility (in terms of grammatical complexity).

# 2. Background to the communicative practice: speaker-audience-slide interplay

Presenter's embodied interaction with slides has long been recognized as a challenging feature of the academic genre (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002). Dubois (1980) observed how in presenting slides \*the speaker ordinarily moves from the lectern and faces slightly toward the screen (p. 46). However, this kind of peaker-slide interaction did not become a research focus in AP until the fieds ful engagement with multimodal and semiotic practices" (Prior, 2012, p. 520). Semiotic multimodality was defined by Kress and Van Leeuwen (201) as \*the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event together with the particular way in which these modes are combined\* (p. 20). From this perspective, the presenter's speech, gestures, and slides have ben conceptualized as distinct semiotic modes working together within a model of communication. Carrying out an effective academic oral presentation at an international conference", as Morell (2015) puts i, \*is a mattr of using a variety of modes .. so as to be understood and appreciated by a multicultural audience" (p. 137).

In terms of the pedagogical implications formulated by authors of semiotic multimodalit research, it i common for multimodality scholars to encourage teachers to raise students' awareness of the meaning potentials of different semiotic modes and their orchestration when presenting with PowerPoint (Garcia Pinar & Palleja, 2018; Jiang & Lim, 2022; Morell et l., 2008; Morel, 2015). Morel et al. (2008) describe the design of a 20-h course for novice presenters from different academic backgrounds that intiates students to multimodality with \*awareness questions' that include \*What modes will the message take into account?" and \*What verbal and non-verbal connections may be made to go from one point to another?" (p. 559). Students on the course are subsequently required to provide peer feedback on each other's practice presentations using a multimodal evaluation grid' (p. 565).

In research from Second Language Acquisition perspectives, gesturing more frequently and diversely has been experimentall tied to benefits in a range of psycholinguistic processes of speech production (such as recall, fluency, discourse organization, rhythm, abstraction, thinking for speaking, and meaningful speech; cf. contributions to McCafferty & Stam, 2008). The importance of these processes to oral presentations have been the basis for proposals informed by McNeil's (1992) widely-adopted gesture typology comprising deictic, beat, iconic, metaphoric, and cohesive gestures (Carney, 2014; Wang et al., 2023).

For example, Carney (2014) reports his attempts to teach Japanese students gestures for their oral presentations in English and includes teaching his students deictic gestures' for \*directing audience atention to the PowerPoint (2014, p. 415). Deictic gestures featured in McNeills (1992) typology with \*the 'obvious' function of indicating objects and events in the concrete world" (p. 18) Carney gave his students the example of saying \*Take a look at this graph, with an outstretched arm and hand toward the PowerPoint screen' (p. 415). Even if pointing gestures can be semiotically complex (hence McNeills scare quotes; Knoblauch, 2008; Kendon & Versante, 2003), examiners may perceive pointing at the slide as a weakness rather than a skill, as discussed below.

A third perspective on gesture in oral presentations is being guided by the notion from enactive cognitive science and ecological psychology of participatory sense-making' (De Jaegher & Di Paolo, 2007). From this sense-making or 'enactive-ecological' perspective, speaking activities are approached with respect to the dynamics known to give rise to organism-environment ecologies (D) Paolo et al., 2018; Streeck, 2017; Thibault, 2021). In my analyses of the TED Talks by science communicator Professor Brian Cox (Harrison, 2021), I accordingly shift analyticl focus from the preenter's choice of modes and strategic orchestation to his methods for creating, maintaining, monitoring, and attuning the audienc's atentional focus to changes in the shared perceptual ecology. Referring to one such method with the term showing' (cf. Streeck, 2017, Ch. 4), and focusing on the appearance of new visuals, fine-grained analyses of relations betwen the presenters speech, gesture, and slide demonstrated how the presenter discosed the significance of pictures and graphs for the audience by selectively animating and decomposing their alient features. The findings were the basis for proposing pedagogical activities informed by showing as sense-making that might \*senstivise and engage students more directly and implicitly with the ecology of oral presentations (Harrison, 2021, p. 17) but the teaching and learning materials had not yet been developed.

# 3. The materials and development process

The materials include two main activities accompanied by a worksheet (see Supplementary Materials for student and teacher versions). For the first activity (3.3 below), students watch a presentation of CoviD data by American President Donald Trump and then in groups evaluate his performance. They will ee that Trump is neither alert to the graph that appears behind him nor well prepared to attune t it with his audience. This paves the way for the second activity (3.4), in which students explore the more skilful speaker-audience-slide interplay of astrophysicist Professor Brian Cox. Cox is similarly tasked with showing a scientifi graph (the Standard Model from physics) and the segment is similar in length and wordcount $3 4 \ s / 1 1 6$ words for Cox compared to $3 8 \ s / 1 1 8$ words for Trump). But unlike Trump, Cox is an experienced universty professor and award-winning populariser of science (Skouen, 2020). He is intimately famliar with this visual and it timed appearance on his slides, and obviously well-rehearsed in navigating the graph's technical details with an audience. This intimacy becomes aparent in Cox's diffrent way of gestring. The contrast between the two speakers' ways of showing isriking and lends itself to a comparison (3.5). The lesson ends with suggestions for hands-on practice (3.6).

# 3.1. Rationale for the different pedagogical activities

The proposed pedagogical activities engage students with an exploratory form of social enquiry similar to the extreme case study (Flyvbjerg, 2001). As an activity that is \*well suited for gtting a point across in an especially dramatic way" (Flyvbjerg, 2001, p.78), the juxtaposition of mediocr and award-winning example of the practice helps students to independently notice their distinguishing haracteristics. Since one of these distinguishing characteristcs i gesture, the eson is deigned to gradually gt acos the import of gesture's intimacy with speaking to the communicative practice of showing visuals to an audience during an oral presentation.

# 3.2. Input and feedback from language teachers

The activities and materials were developed and trialed with three stages of feedback from English language teachers at City University of Hong Kong. The first stage was a 1-h workshop facilitated by the author and offered within the Language Centre's Teaching Development series in the Autumn semester of 2020. Fifeen teachers of various EAP and ESP courses simulated a live marking exercise to evaluate Donald Trump's presentation of CovID data. I subsequently introduced these teachers to the highly skilld tage work and speech-gesture-slide interplay of Professor Brian Cox (Author. They discussed whether they already do/would teach this particular practice, what materials they would need to do so, and whether they have any concerns or other fedback. Student and Teacher versions of  worksheet were developed in resonse o this firs tage and interated to the oral presentation skill class of a large English for Specific Purposes course coordinated by the author and taught each year to upwards of eight-hundred students by at least fifteen language teachers (using English as Medium of Instruction). The worksheets were firt trialed in clasrooms during the Autumn semester of 2021 with approximately forty students across three sections of the course taught by the Course Lead, whose suggestions for improvement constituted a second stage of feedback (Email Exchange September 2021). I ccordingly revised the materials to be implemented on the entire course from the Spring semester f 2022 onwards. A third stage f feedback took place half way through that semester, when four tachers who had used the materials in their preentation skill clas agredto take part in a half. hour focus group (February 24, 2022). With the consent of al the teachers involved, I had video recorded both the Teaching Development workshop and the Focus Group, creating an empirical basis to draw on when finalizing the activities and materials to be shared in this paper.

# 3.3. Noticing Gesture when President Trump Gives the Case Updates for COVID

In the firs activity, students are asked to watch a short clip of a public speaker and to evaluate the speaker's way of presenting his audience with the graph on his slides: President Trump holds a news conference at The White House -- 9/16/2020. The relevant portion is a 3-min segment starting at 07:30 in which Trump gives the case updates for covID which have been scripted to include reference to a predictive model titled "Goals of Community Mitigation' on slides projected behind him, with which Trump will specifically interact for 38 s (08.37-09.15) (Fig. 1).

# 3.3.1. Warm up

Students could be asked to brainstorm what criteria could guide their evaluation (gesture and related notions like eye contact will inevitably come up) or be given the evaluation critria from the course they are taking. \*What advice would you offer friend who is giving a presentation with slides?" is a question that have found useful in my clases to similarly elict students' previous knowledge about the communicative challenge of speaking with an audience while showing them slides. Alternatively, teachers can show the visual supplied by The White House and ask students to brainstorm how they might present it to a non-specialist audience.

# 3.3.2. Evaluating pres. Trump's way of showing the graph.

With this visual in mind, the class now watch the media presentation by Donald Trump. When the visual appears on the screen Trump continues talking from his script, initiall unaware of this change in his audience's perceptual field. Then, the dynamics of Trump's relation to both audience and environment shift completely as he goes of script and spontaneously interacts with this visual by extemporizing and gesturing towards the slide with his back to the audience. The news camera angle zooms out to montage Trump and slide togther, as we se him uter fiedifferent ponting tures at his visual, esntilly conrasting the rely good ob curve with the "not so good job" curve. Examples include Trump's first pointing gesture with \*this was right at the beginning this was our prediction' (Fig.2) and his last pointing gesture with \*so we're down in this territory' (Fig. 3) before returning to his podium.

After watching the video students can be invited to discuss their evaluation of the speaker's way of presenting the visual to his audience. If the students were given the evaluation critriafrom the course they are taking, they can be asked to agre on a grade and feedback for the speaker. The teacher could ask the different groups to share the basis on which they came to their evaluations. The following points can be included on a slide to stimulate this discussion if necessary:

![](img/027ecefc7542b493611b6572992532b4bc756bda1061ccad78265b86390f5484.jpg)  
Fig. 1. The predictive model used during the press conference by President Trump (Source: The White House).

: Preparedness; timing of the appearance of the visual; awareness of surroundings;   
: Talking from a script/going off script; grammar and vocabulary;   
. Presenter's familiarity with and knowledge of the visual;   
. Presenter's interaction with audience; keeping the audience's attention;   
. Pointing gestures; relation between speaker's gestures, his slide, and the audience.

During the first stage of feedback in the development of these materials (Teaching Development workshop), there was consensu. among the language teachers who tried this activity that according to their marking criteria, Trump's delivery of the visual wa. marginal' (C grade). During their live marking exercise, a number of concerns were raised that would be relevant to share wit. students. One group's concern was with how Trump turns away from the audience when interacting with the visual:

Not too good. According to our criteria there was very little eye contact, he was leaning on the lectern, and he he turned away and didn't face his audience when he was pointing to the the PowerPoint." (TD workshop 10:40)

Out of the 35 s that Trump interacts with his visual, he only turns gaze back to his audience once for a brief 2s, which introduces a tension to how he is relating with them. This concern about eye-gaze with the audience was echoed by another group of teachers a the workshop mentioning "lack of eye-contact in communication" when justifying the 'marginal' grade (TD workshop 11:30)

A second ssue raised by these professionals concerned the way that Trump gestured with his slide, adifferent group's spokesperson ying:

"We didn't quite like the way he is erm using the visual aid. You know he did use some hand gesture, but t's not really ffective. it's not pointing to any specific erm piece of information there."' (TD workshop 12:27)

At a glance, all five of Trump's gestures can indeed be classed as deictics serving to direct the audiences attention to different locations on the graph (McNeill 1992). Looking closer, Trump varies the hand shape and palm orientation of each gesture. The gestures essentiallydiffer with respect to whether Trump points with his open palm (as in Fig. 2) or single index finger (as in Fig.3) as well as the orientation of his palm. Kendon and Verante (2003) have demonstrated how these "various forms of hand pointing relate to the way the speaker regards the object being referred to' (p. 134). In a nutshell pointing with the open palm is ften about 'exhibiting' (e.g., \*this was right at the beginning this was our prediction'; Fig. 2), whereas the index finger is ofen about object individuation' (e.g., \*so we're down in this territory"; Fig. 3). This distinction could be drawn to the attention of students, but the language teachers tasked with evaluating Trump's presentation skills did not give such variations any credit.

# 3.4. Exploring the showing of Professor Brian Cox

The second activity takes its example from a TED talk entitled CERN Supercolider by award-winning science communicator

Professor Brian Cox. Similar to Trump, Cox willalsobe navigating a graph, in thiscase the Standard Model of particle physics (Fig. 4). What is not similar to Trump is the skill on display when this \*major figure in popular science" (Skouen, 2020, p. 149) begins to navigate his graph with the audience.

The graph plots the three fundamental forces of nature: the electromagnetic force (green; highest on y-axis), weak nuclear force (blue; middle on y-axis), and strong nuclear force (purple; lowest on y-axis). The graph shows that as the energy of these forces increases ( $\mathbf { \widetilde { X } }$ axis), their strengths also change (y-axis). Whereas the electromagnetic force decreases, the nuclear forces increase. The graph shows at which energy the relative strengths of all three forces intersect.

According to analyses published in JEAP (Harrison, 2021), the graph appears in the audience's visual field when Cox is glancing at his slide and announcing \*there's another isue ., which secures the audiences attention while stting up a relation between what they are seeing and what Cox wil be explaining. Facing his audience, Cox's gestures irst animate the graph with flat hand shapes converging in ways that "simulate the changing of strength of the different forces over time (p. 9; Fig. 5), then he gesturally decomposes' the graph into different parts with line-depicting gestures that \*clarify the trajectory of two specific values (the electromagnetic force and the strong force)" (p. 9; Figs. 6 and 7).

As willbe explained, the Worksheet in the Supplementary Materials has been designed for students topredict, analyse, and discuss Cox's gestures with respect to his spoken description of the visual and attention to the audience.

# 3.4.1. Imagining how prof. Cox will explain

In the first stage of this part of the lesson, students can be given the worksheet and invited to imagine Brian Cox (or themselves) explaining this image to an audience. Both the image on the workht and Cox'sexplanation have bee simplified. The different lines have been specified and Cox's original explanation has been revised into three simple sentences. Such scaffolding was introduced to address and alviate one teacher'sconcern that \*Cox's speech is on things that are beyond my understanding" (TD workshop 49:18).

Task 1 on the workshet suggets that students can specificall easked to predict How doyou think the speaker might gesture when he says this? Do you think any kind of gestures could help? The teachers with whom I trialled this prediction activity at the Teaching Development workshop came up with creative suggestions about how Cox might gesture. The spokesperson from one group showed the graph's convergence of lines with flat hands and also gestured in a way that represented the trajectory of one of the individual forces (TD workshop 36:40). Both these gestures are quite similar to those made spontaneously by Cox (f. Figs. 5-7). As the teacher reported during the irst trial of this activity wth student, however: \*We briely predicted gestures but they mostly saidtooint atthe image'" (Email Exchange 05.10.2021).

Task 2 on the worksheet invites students to watch the segment of the talk where Brian Cox s showing this slide (09:10-09:50) and then discss the second question on the worksheet that allows them to reflect onthr predctio. The nex tge of the lson inolves a detailed analysi of Cox's showing to help students beter understand the complexity of gesturing for an audience when explaining an image on one's slide.

# 3.4.2. The gap fill activity

For Task 3 on the worksheet, students are instructed to compare four moments of gesturing taken during the Standard Model segment, selected from peer-reviewed analyses published in JEAP (Harrison, 2021). Students can be asked to \*keep in mind the image that is on the slide behind him' in order to answer the question: How is Cox gesturing in ways that could help his audience to understand aspects of the visul? Each of th four images on the worksheet i accompanied with the first part of asentence which describes what is happening and provides Cox's speech (e.g., \*As he segues into the new topic by saying there's another issue .."). The sentence has been truncated on purpose, because at the bottom of the worksheet are descriptions of the presenter's visible bodily actions with which it can be complee ,. he rey rotes upper ody, ga directio, and aes n ope palm towas theslide).  creating sentences that relate the presenter's speech, gesture, slide, and audience, this activity embodies the interplay discovered in the underpinning empirical research and engages students in ascafflded form of gesture analys. Allowing students to view the segment several times should reduce any difficulties in understanding the context of the truncated sentences.

This gap ill activity was added in response to a teacher experimenting with a previous worksheet with images only and noticing that her students \*could use a bit more scaffolding" (Email Exchange 05.10.2021). However, two teachers working with the revised worksheet observed that students found the task of "just matching" to be "easy'. Teachers can adapt the handout for a more advanced class y removing the descriptors, a did one of my participants, whose students \*were able to describe something very similar" on their own (Focus Group 03:20).

# 3.4.3. Follow-up questions

The teachers workshet has afourth section, suggesting several fllow-up questions designed to develop a deeper understanding of the answers to the gap fill activity.

# 3.5. Comparison of Prof. Cox and Pres. Trump

Showing of Professor Brian Cox (Section 3.4) - are the basis for a comparison between the two presenters, whichcan serve to conclude the case study and consolidate the clas objectives (c. ection 1.1). Important dfferences that students can be guided towards incude.

Trump is initilly unaware that his visual has appeared, whereas Cox embeds its appearance into his segue to the new topic;   
: Trump only looks at his audience once, whereas Cox only looks at his visual once;   
. Trump faces and gestures to his graph, whereas Cox faces his audience and gestures with them;   
Whereas Trump's gesturing is primarily deictic (pointing to referent), Cox's gesturing is primarily depictive (creating or evoking their referent imagistically).

This last point helps make the link to Cox and Trump engaging in qualitatively different ways of gesturing. Micro-ethnographer Streeck (2017) includes gesturally depicting something for an addressee in the presence of the depicted-thing as a practice of showing, noting that \*While pointing is about directing attention and action, showing is pedagogy (p. 202). As part of his pedagogy, Cox faces his audience and gesturally animates the graph for them, making available is ecological information based primarily on What he knows. Trump, on the other hand, tuns to the graph and points to different features based primaril on what he sees, hence utterig dectic expressions such as \*his was right at the bnning . (Fig.2) and o were down in this erritory.." (Fig. 3). Thisis a pedagogical diffrence in depth of understanding and engagement with the visual, which can furthermore be related with the presenters' differences in spoken language ability, at last in terms of grammatical complexity. Whil Trump's explanation is charaterised primarily by independent coordination clauses (and . but ..so ..), Cox's explanation is grammatically more complex, involving various types of dependent clauses (e.g., how- and what-clauses). Teachers can guide students through this comparison,for example, by setting paired or whole group discussion tasks. The bulle points in this section can be projected on a classroom slide to wrap up the discussion.

# 3.6. Suggestions for hands-on activities

The importance of having a hands-on activity stage with "output' and \*practice" was stressed by all four teachers attending the Focus Group (Focus Group 22:30, 29:30). The teacher's worksheet acordingly ends with a suggestion to invite students to \*think f a visual that you might be using on your slides" and consider how it might lend itself to being depicted with your gestures in ways that help to explain or engage the audience as the TED speaker has done'. Students could later try presenting their visuals in class, as one teacher encouraged during "mock presentations" (Focus Group 20:50).

# 4. Pedagogical value of the materials

The pedagogical activities and materials presented in this paper contribute to the limited but expanding pool of specialized re sources available for teachers of oral presentations being developed from different empirical and theoretical perspectives on gesture.

For approaches intent on increasing gesture awareness and production through explicit gesture instruction (e.g., Carney, 2014; Wang et al, 2023), Exploring the Showing of Professor Brian Cox (Section 3.4) provides the basis for a more in-depth exploration of iconic gestures (McNeill 1992). This includes the possbility of teaching about depictive devices and their interplay with gaze orientation (Streeck, 2017), while their interplay with the visual demonstrates why iconicity and deixis are not categories of gesture but di. mensions (McNeill 2005). Noticing Gesture when President Donald Trump Gives the Case Updates (Section 3.3) can similarly enhance a lesson on the deictic gestures by exploring Trump's form-function variations on this gesture type (palm up, palm down, index-extended; se Kendon & Versante, 2003; Knoblauch, 2008) as well as warning students about the aspects of Trump's pointing that were perceived as problematic by language teachers. Comparison of Prof. Cox and Pres. Trump (Section 3.5) offers one way of answering \*what constitutes a good gesture?", a question seen by Carney (2014) as "important" for ELT teachers but as yet \*unanswered' (p.418).

The materials and activities presented in this paper could also contribute to courses and classes guided by semiotic multimodalit (Garcia Pinar & Pallja Lpez, 2018; Jiang & Lim, 2022; Morell et a., 2008; Morell 2015). th activities (Sections 3.3 and 3.4) could be adapted for teaching what Morell (2015) refers to as effctive presenters "simultaneous use of the verbal mode, body language mode and the NVM [nonverbal material] (p. 149). The example from Professor Cox (Section 3.4)contributes the insight that such multimodal orchestration is dynamically adaptive to the needs ofthe moment, as Co monitors how his audience is responding to his explanation and adapts it accordingly (Harrison, 2021, p. 14). The example from President Trump (Section 3.3), on the other hand, exemplifies an improvised attempt at multimodal orchestration that is evidently less effective ('marginal').

Originating outside of these semiotic and psycholinguistic approaches, the enactive-ecological research underpinning the present materials can further enrich our understanding of gesture within assessed speaking activities. Rather than viewing bodily movement primarily as a tol to communicate knowledge efectively, for example, such research views bodily movement as the primary way that we know (i., sense-making'; Di Paolo et al., 2018; treeck, 2017; Thibault, 2021). Ths foundational relation between gestures and knowledge is what the comparison between award-winning science communicator Brian Cox and American politician Donald Trump can help to bring out. Thestriking contrasts show that gesture is not only about ther communication of content to an audience. Gesture is the presenter's content, his or her way of knowing the visual and making its ecological information available to the audience (what Streeck therized as showing; Streck, 2017, Ch.4). It' sort of likeer n illustration of knowing . of that peron showing that they know what they're talking about," is how one student taking this lesson could put it (Focus Group 20:12).

This ability to navigate a visual with the audience - to transcend traditional distinctions between content and delivery in asssed speaking activities - must be recognized as 'advanced EAP' (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 4). Students can be reassured that the President of the most powerful country in the world only cored a C and could benefit from taking their class Professor Brian Cox, on the other hand, has pioneered methods of bringing people in and bringing science to life to which his way of gesturing with visuals has become \*characteristic (Skouen, 2020, p. 161). With my student, I end by returning to a question from the beginning of the lesson: \*What advice would you offr friend who is giving a presentation with slides?". Their answers have often changed, from generalities about body language' to suggestions more closely related to the presenter's individualized experience with the dynamic situation, understanding of content, and ability to navigate this knowledge with the audience.
