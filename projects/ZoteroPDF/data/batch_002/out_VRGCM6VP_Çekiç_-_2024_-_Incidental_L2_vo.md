# ABSTRACT

Despite increasing number of studies on incidental vocabulary learning through viewing in a foreign language, glosses, which have been proven to have facilitative effects in incidental vocabulary learning via other modes of input, have remained underexplored in audiovisual input. The current study investigates the effects of (1) traditional gloss (TG), (2) multiple-choice gloss (MCG) and (3) no gloss (NG) conditions on incidental L2 vocabulary learning through viewing animated short videos. Turkish-L1 upper-intermediate to advanced EFL learners $( N = 1 2 7 )$ ), who were randomly assigned to three conditions, watched three short, animated videos twice. The results revealed that while the MCG group and the TG group significantly outperformed the NG group in vocabulary meaning recall test, there was not a significant difference between the glossed conditions. The results also suggested that the participants learnt new words through interacting with MCGs. Furthermore, the participants’ prior vocabulary knowledge positively correlated with incidental vocabulary learning from the videos. The results are discussed within the framework of previous research and the Involvement Load Hypothesis.

# Introduction

Earlier research into incidental vocabulary learning, which is defined as learning of new words as by-product of meaning-focused processing of linguistic input (Hulstijn, 2003), emphasized reading as its primary source in L1 (e.g. Nagy et  al., 1985; Saragi et  al., 1978) and later also in L2 (Day et  al., 1991; Pitts et  al., 1989; Waring & Takaki, 2003). However, research into audiovisual input as a mode of input in incidental vocabulary learning in L1 (Oetting et  al., 1995; Rice & Woodsmall, 1988) and L2 (d’Ydewalle & Pavakanun, 1997; Koolstra & Beentjes, 1999;

Neuman & Koskinen, 1992) is more limited. Recently, there has been growing research interest into incidental vocabulary learning through viewing (Feng & Webb, 2020; Peters, 2019; Peters & Webb, 2018; Rodgers, 2018; Rodgers & Webb, 2017; Sydorenko, 2010; Vidal, 2011). Previous research focused on a variety of audiovisual genres including lectures (Vidal, 2011), documentaries (Fakhr et  al., 2020; Feng & Webb, 2020; Peters, 2019; Peters et  al., 2016; Peters & Webb, 2018; Rodgers, 2018), short clips from TV series (Montero Perez et  al., 2018; Sydorenko, 2010; Yüksel & Tanrıverdi, 2009), several episodes of TV programs (Rodgers, 2013), and full-length episodes of TV programs (Rodgers & Webb, 2020). However, animated educational videos, possibly a more suitable genre for EFL classes, have largely remained underexplored except for Hsieh (2020). Such videos with their intriguing topics and appealing animations that provide high congruency between audio and visual input can be more suitable for EFL classes as they discuss a single topic in a video and are not too lengthy to extend beyond a class hour.

Research on learning from audiovisual input also investigated several word-related variables, such as frequency of occurrence (Fakhr et  al., 2020; Feng & Webb, 2020; Peters & Webb, 2018), cognateness (Fakhr et  al., 2020; Peters & Webb, 2018), visual support (Fakhr et  al., 2020; Peters, 2019; Rodgers, 2018), contextual clues, lexicalization, word relevance (Fakhr et  al., 2020) and learner-related variable of prior vocabulary knowledge (Fakhr et  al., 2020; Feng & Webb, 2020; Peters & Webb, 2018; Rodgers, 2013). In addition to item-related and learner-related variables, the effects of two input enhancement techniques; that is, captions and glosses, on incidental vocabulary learning through audiovisual input were also examined. Captions refer to the text version of the spoken language (not translation) displayed in lines at the bottom of the screen. Glosses, also referred as annotations, are notations generally added to written texts to provide the meaning of unknown words. Although glosses provide the meanings of the words explicitly, they can be regarded as facilitative add-ons in incidental learning because they do not inevitably necessitate intentional learning of words as in language focused study exercises, such as matching or gap-fill exercises and because they are transitionally processed to make sense of the text; that is, the focus is still on the meaning. Thus, unless the words are particularly noted down for further intentional study, glosses can be regarded as an enhancement method (Montero Perez et  al., 2018) in incidental learning (e.g. Fakher Ajabshir, 2022; Ünal, 2021), which ensures accuracy in form-meaning connection in incidental vocabulary learning rather than leaving it to learners’ deduction ability. With more widespread use of digital tools, electronic glosses in the form of hyperlinks are more extensively used in online texts (see Figure 1). Recently it is also possible

# Becoming an Active Reader Through Annotation

Three main things to consider: decide on the author's most important points, identify how they to add glosses to audio and audiovisual input. Of these two input enhancement techniques, while captions have been extensively studied in viewing (e.g. Montero Perez et  al., 2013; Winke et  al., 2010), glosses in audiovisual input have been underexplored except for few recent studies (Fievez et  al., 2021; Hsieh, 2020; Montero Perez et  al., 2018). Thus, it is clear that the role of glosses in audiovisual input warrants further research. The current study aims to address this gap in research by examining the effects of multiple-choice glosses (MCGs) versus traditional glosses (TGs) compared to no gloss (NG) condition on incidental vocabulary learning through watching short animated educational videos without captions.

# Literature review

# Incidental L2 vocabulary learning through different modes of input

Research on incidental L2 vocabulary learning through reading has revealed that learners can incidentally learn written form, meaning, grammatical information, collocation of unknown words through repeated encounters via reading (Feng & Webb, 2020). Studies in written input have emphasized number of encounters as an important variable for incidental vocabulary learning. Research on the required number of encounters has yielded a wide range of variation with thresholds for acquisition ranging across six (Rott, 1999), seven (Chen & Truscott, 2010), eight (Horst et  al., 1998), 10 (Webb, 2007) and more than 20 encounters (Waring & Takaki, 2003). Research has also examined other confounding item-related variables such as imageability, concreteness, cognateness, number of letters and syllables, and text-related variables such as length, type of the text, saliency of words in the text, richness of contextual clues (Uchihara et  al., 2019) and learner-related-variables of vocabulary size (Rodgers, 2013; Tekmen & Daloǧlu, 2006) and working memory (Varol & Erçetin, 2019). In sum, previous research on this mode of input revealed that it is a multi-faceted construct with a variety of item-related, text-related and learner-related variables at play, most of which still need to be enlightened further.

Relatively fewer studies have examined listening as a source of incidental L2 vocabulary learning (van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2013; Vidal, 2003), and some of them compared listening with reading (Brown et  al., 2008; Vidal, 2011). Studies into listening indicate that even higher number of encounters are necessary for vocabulary learning via listening. The figures ranged between four to five (Vidal, 2003), more than 15 (van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2012), 50 or even more than 100 (Brown et  al., 2008). Studies that compared listening with reading found that reading was a more favorable source than listening (Brown et  al., 2008) and that L2 proficiency significantly interacted with vocabulary gain (Vidal, 2003). In sum, it can be argued that similar variables influence vocabulary learning via auditory input. However, compared to reading, effect of frequency is less marked and proficiency play a greater role in listening. This can be attributed to limited capacity of L2 leaners to infer meanings of unknown words from flying away auditory input (van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2013).

Unlike written and auditory input, incidental vocabulary learning via audiovisual input has only recently received researchers’ interest. Semantic support of on-screen imagery in audiovisual input (Peters, 2019; Rodgers, 2018), authenticity of input, rich contexts (Peters et  al., 2016), irreplaceable L2 sociocultural information (Talaván, 2007) are cited as significant features of audiovisual input that can enhance incidental vocabulary learning. In line with these benefits, experimental studies have revealed that audiovisual input can also be a source of incidental vocabulary learning. Earlier research suggests that learners can incidentally learn words from aural input if they have adequately large vocabulary size, corresponding to 2000 to 3000 word families (van Zeeland & Schmitt, 2012; Webb & Rodgers, 2009). Rodgers and Webb (2020), who gave two vocabulary tests at different levels of sensitivity, reported relative gains of $2 3 . 0 3 \%$ and $2 9 . 6 1 \%$ by the experimental group, who viewed 10 episodes of a TV series throughout a semester, as compared to $2 0 . 8 6 \%$ and $2 5 . 4 2 \%$ by the control group, who only attended regular English classes. Peters and Webb (2018) reported that EFL learners learned four words on average $8 . 3 1 \%$ relative gain) through watching TV for an hour as compared to 1.5 words in the control group, who only completed measures. Fakhr et  al. (2020) found that incidental vocabulary learning can occur at form recognition and meaning recall levels via viewing a full-length TV program with captions. They reported that the number of encounters, contextual clues, lexicalization, visual support and prior vocabulary knowledge can influence learning with the effect of the last three variables persisting as long as three months.

There has been little research that compared audiovisual input with other modes of input. Earlier research indicated that viewing television with or without subtitles can even be more conducive to incidental vocabulary learning than reading (Neuman & Koskinen, 1992). However, in a later study which compared incidental vocabulary learning through reading with watching lectures, Vidal (2011) reported that the participants in reading condition outperformed the viewing subjects in all four proficiency levels with the gap narrowing as proficiency increased. A more recent study (Feng & Webb, 2020) comparing viewing, reading and listening reported similar vocabulary gain rates from each mode of input, indicating that lack of written word form and faster processing demands of audiovisual input (Montero Perez et  al., 2018; Peters et  al., 2016) might be counterbalanced with its dual-coding advantage according to the Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2009). Given to the limited number of studies and complexity of the construct, incidental vocabulary learning through viewing is a promising field of research that warrants further research especially in view of increasing amount of audiovisual presentation of information in all educational contexts including EFL contexts.

# Glosses in different modes of input

Glosses have been widely researched in paper or electronic written input. Research (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020) suggests that adding glosses to written input can significantly increase incidental vocabulary learning $( 4 5 . 3 \%$ and $3 3 . 4 \%$ in the immediate and delayed posttest) as compared to non-glossed reading $2 6 . 6 \%$ to $1 9 . 8 \%$ ). Their effectiveness has been attributed to different reasons. Nagata (1999) argues that glosses facilitate access to meaning as compared to dictionary consultation, provide precise meaning of unknown words, draw readers’ attention to the target words and ensure lexical processing. Likewise, Ouyang et  al. (2020) attribute their benefits to input enhancement (Wong, 2005) and noticing theory (Schmidt, 1993). They argue that glossing can increase the likelihood that input is converted into intake. Although it is clear that glosses increase vocabulary learning, the degree glosses facilitate vocabulary learning still remains to be unclear with meta-analysis studies reporting average (Hedge’s $g = 1 . 4 0$ , Abraham, 2008) to large effect sizes (Hedge’s $g = 2 . 9 0$ , Ben Salem, 2006). Boers (2021) attributes this variance in effect sizes to the vocabulary profile of the texts used in comparing glossed condition versus no gloss conditions. Research indicates that readers need to know majority of the running words in a text to comprehend it (Schmitt et  al., 2017) and thus to infer meanings of the words. In line with this, Boers (2021) argued that the texts used for comparison included too many unknown words, which made it too difficult for L2 learners to guess meanings from context without glosses and led some scholars to overestimate the effects of glosses.

In spite of their research-evidenced effectiveness in reading, glosses in auditory input have been a less researched issue so far. Although there is not a meta-analysis study, studies (Çakmak & Erçetin, 2017; Jones, 2004; Jones & Plass, 2002) mostly found that glosses led to significant increase in vocabulary learning via listening, with the exception of Cottam (2010), who did not find any effect of visual or verbal glosses on vocabulary learning.

Glosses, which have been shown to significantly increase incidental L2 vocabulary gain in reading (Abraham, 2008; Ouyang et  al., 2020) and in listening (Çakmak & Erçetin, 2017; Jones & Plass, 2002), have been examined only by three studies in viewing. The first study (Montero Perez et  al., 2018) on glosses added to audiovisual input seems to be an extension of keyword captioning studies. In line with the basic premise that incidental vocabulary learning occurs when learners notice new words and make accurate form-meaning connections (Hulstijn, 2001), Montero Perez et  al. (2014) found that as compared to no captioning, full captioning, keyword captioning and full captioning with keywords highlighted significantly increased form recognition. The researchers also found that only full captioning with the keywords highlighted and keyword captioning significantly improved L2 word meaning recognition. In another study, Montero Perez et  al. (2015) found that as compared to full captioning, keyword captioning led to significantly better performance in form recognition but not in meaning recall. The results of these studies indicate that drawing learners’ attention to target words (via keyword captioning or highlighting) can increase form recognition and meaning recognition, which can be attributed to increased noticing it enables. However, it is not so effective in contributing to meaning recall because learners cannot make accurate and well-established form-meaning connections by relying on audiovisual context only.

Probably following from their findings in favor of keyword captioning, Montero Perez et  al. (2018) examined effects of glossed keyword captioning (GC) as compared to different types of captioning (i.e. no captioning, full captioning, and keyword captioning). The results of meaning recall test revealed that the GC group, which recalled 7 out of 18 target words, significantly outperformed the others, who recalled 2–3 target words. Likewise, Hsieh (2020), who calculated absolute gains, found that full caption with L1 glosses added to audiovisual input led to significantly higher performance (11.38 words out of 19) in meaning recall compared to no caption, full caption with no audio, full caption, and full captions with target word highlighted. Similarly, Fievez et  al. (2021) found that their participants in glossed condition recalled $3 5 \%$ of the word meanings and $2 8 \%$ word forms. These studies suggest that while captions significantly facilitate form recognition via increasing the likelihood that new words are noticed, glosses, which can increase both noticing and making of form-meaning associations in viewing, can significantly enhance both dimensions of word knowledge (i.e. form and meaning) at recognition and recall levels.

# Mode, language and type of glosses

Research has also suggested that mode, language, and type of glosses can influence their effectiveness. Studies (Akbulut, 2007; Chun & Plass, 1996; Plass et  al., 2003) examined different modes of glosses; namely, text-only, picture-only and text-plus-picture glosses. The result of an earlier meta-analysis study is in favor of text-plus-picture glosses (Yun, 2011). In a more recent meta-analysis, Ramezanali et  al. (2021) also found that adding a new mode to a single-mode textual gloss could increase vocabulary learning but attributed the superiority of text-pluspicture glosses to the multiple lookups rather than multimodality of glosses. Some studies examined language of glosses as well. Recent meta-analysis studies have reported controversial results with regard to the language of glosses. While two meta-analysis studies revealed that L1 glosses were more effective than L2 glosses (Kim et  al., 2020; Yanagisawa et  al., 2020), a more recent meta-analysis concluded that the language of gloss had no definite effect (Zhang & Ma, 2021). It is also important to note that the benefits of L1 glosses are more marked with low proficiency learners (Boers, 2021). As for the type of glosses, Yanagisawa et  al. (2020) distinguished between two types of glosses: interactive glosses, which include hyperlinked and multiple-choice glosses, and non-interactive glosses, which include marginal, interlinear, in-text glosses or glossaries. Several researchers compared MCGs with single-translation glosses in written input. While some reported that MCGs were significantly more effective than TGs (Nagata, 1999; Rott, 2005), some other studies found no significant difference between the two gloss types (Hulstijn, 1992; Miyasako, 2002; Watanabe, 1997), and only one study suggested that TGs were more effective than MCGs (Yoshii, 2013). The result of a recent meta-analysis study revealed that multiple-choice glosses were the most effective type of gloss, which was followed by hyperlinked glosses, marginal glosses, glossaries and in-text glosses (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020). In sum, despite a number of studies on glosses in reading point to their effectiveness, the degree of their effectiveness depends on mode, language and type of glosses, which remain to be explored further.

Research into glosses in auditory input is not only limited in quantity but also in terms of the scope of gloss related variables examined. Jones and Plass (2002), who compared text-only, picture-only, text-plus-picture, and no-gloss conditions in listening to L2 French, found that text-pluspicture condition led to better performance than single mode gloss conditions in the immediate posttest but not in the delayed test. In a similar study, Çakmak and Erçetin (2017) assigned their participants to one of the mobile listening conditions: text-only gloss, text-plus-picture gloss, picture-only gloss and no gloss. The results revealed that all of the glossed conditions led to better performance in vocabulary recognition and recall than no-gloss condition with the type of gloss leading no significant difference in vocabulary learning. Likewise, Jones (2004), who assigned L2 French learners to no gloss, written gloss, pictorial gloss and written-plus-pictorial gloss conditions in a listening task, also found that glossing led to better vocabulary learning compared to no-gloss condition with type of gloss not leading to a significant difference. In brief, despite a number of studies point out the effectiveness of glosses in written and auditory text, answers for many questions with regard to language, type and mode of glosses remain to be tentative.

Although previous research on incidental vocabulary learning from reading and listening examined different variables in relation to glosses such as modes (textual, pictorial and auditory) (e.g. Chun & Plass, 1996; Jones, 2004; Jones & Plass, 2002), language (e.g. Jacobs et  al., 1994; Ko, 2012; Xu, 2010; Yoshii, 2006), type of glosses (e.g. Hulstijn, 1992; Miyasako, 2002; Watanabe, 1997; Yanagisawa et  al., 2020), their position on screen (Varol & Erçetin, 2019), previous research on glosses in viewing examined only a single mode (textual) and type (nonintreactive) of L1 glosses.

From a theoretical perspective, the depth of processing theory (Craik & Lockhart, 1972) and the Involvement Load Hypothesis (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001) lend support to MCGs. These theories basically argue that MCGs can ensure more active involvement of learners in the construction of form-meaning connections (i.e. by evaluating the context and making choices that can suit the context) compared to TGs. In sum, while previous research on types of glosses (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020) and existing theories indicate superiority of MCGs in reading, different types of glosses remain unexplored in viewing. To address this gap, the current study aims to find out how time-stamped TGs (i.e. verbal glosses providing short L2 definitions and L1 equivalents) versus MCGs can facilitate incidental vocabulary learning through viewing.

# Prior vocabulary knowledge and incidental vocabulary learning through audiovisual input

Studies on reading (Horst et  al., 1998; Tekmen & Daloǧlu, 2006; Webb & Chang, 2015) suggest that prior lexical knowledge correlates with incidental vocabulary learning. Research into incidental L2 vocabulary learning through viewing also indicates that there is a positive correlation between prior vocabulary knowledge and incidental vocabulary gain from viewing (Feng & Webb, 2020; Montero Perez et  al., 2014, 2018; Peters et  al., 2016; Peters & Webb, 2018), except for Rodgers (2013), who reported a lack of such a correlation $\mathbf { \Phi } ^ { \prime } r = \mathbf { \Phi } . 0 2 )$ in viewing without captions. But in another study Rodgers (2013) reported in the same dissertation, he found that there were positive correlations between vocabulary size and scores on tough and sensitive vocabulary tests with different levels of difficulty $( r = . 3 1$ and $r = . 2 7$ , respectively). Yet, given to the limited number of studies examining this correlation and controversial results, the current study also aims to find out if learners’ L2 vocabulary size positively correlates with incidental vocabulary learning through audiovisual input.

# Method

This study examined the effect of three different gloss conditions: no gloss (control group), traditional gloss (TG), and multiple-choice gloss (MCG) on incidental vocabulary gain from audiovisual input. The study sought to respond to the following research questions:

1. How do different gloss conditions compare in terms of their conduciveness to incidental vocabulary learning through audiovisual input?   
2. Is there a relation between the participants’ prior vocabulary knowledge and incidental vocabulary learning?

# Participants

The participants $( N = 1 2 7 )$ ) in this study were ELT (English Language Teaching) majors and ELL (English Language and Literature) majors in a state university in Turkey. They were all Turkish-L1 upper-intermediate to advanced EFL learners from five different intact classes. Eight-eight of the participants were female and 39 were male. The participants were randomly assigned to three conditions regardless of their VLT scores or any other variable. Initially, there were 145 participants; however, some of them were eliminated because they had failed to complete any one of the given tasks or tests.

# Materials

In this section, videos, video platforms, instructions, glosses and tests used in the study are described.

Videos Three short, educational and animated videos were chosen from the TED-Ed platform, which houses carefully curated educational animated videos. The videos were titled as A Brief History of Cheese (Kindstedt, 2018), Can Animals Be Deceptive? (Adams, 2018) and How Plants Tell Time (Savage, 2015). Their lengths were 5 min. 34 sec., 4 min. 55 sec., and 4 min. 19 sec., respectively. The three animated videos in this study were chosen because their vocabulary profiles matched learners’ vocabulary size and there were adequate number of unknown (target) words from low-frequency bands (Table 4). To determine vocabulary profile of the videos and potential target words, the transcripts of the videos were examined with vocabulary profiler on the lextutor.ca website using the BNC-COCA $2 5 \mathrm { k }$ framework (Cobb, n.d., see Tables 1, 2 and 3). The lexical profiles of the videos are presented as the number and percentage of tokens, i.e. the number of words running in a text, as distributed across frequency levels. The total number of words running in texts were 677, 669 and 562, respectively. Although the lexical profiles of the videos indicate that $9 5 \%$ lexical coverage can be achieved between 4K and 5K levels, they were deemed to be suitable not only because the group was composed of ELT and ELL majors, who had relatively large vocabulary size, but also because the target words were glossed.

Video Platforms. As innovative, partially open-source and user-friendly software (Bakla, 2017) interactive video platforms such as such EdPuzzle allow their users to add traditional (L1, L2 definition) and interactive glosses (i.e. MCGs) at certain points in videos. EdPuzzle is used in this study because it is partially free and the researcher could easily add TGs, MCGs, T/F questions at certain time points in the videos and track learners’ performance. Gloss Types. In the first condition, there was no gloss. The second one included TGs. In this type of gloss, students only saw the meaning of the target word in L1 and L2 together with the part of speech and IPA transcription (see Figure 2).

In MCGs, the target word was given in the sentence from the video (Figure 3). The participants were asked to choose the meaning of the word out of three choices, which provided L1 and L2 meaning. The participants were provided immediate feedback on their answers together with the correct answer. In the TG condition, the participants could see the meaning of the word approximately two seconds before the target word occurred in the video. In the MCG condition, the participants saw the question after the target word occurred in the video. However, in both conditions the participants could re-watch the excerpt where the target word appeared. The participants in all conditions were required to answer T/F questions to ensure more attentive viewing.

Target Words. A total of 21 target words were chosen from the three videos. Out of 21 target words, 12 of them were nouns, five of them were verbs and four of them were adjectives. The researcher and one of his colleagues, who had been teaching similar groups for about 6 years, watched the videos with captions and determined the target words (see Table 4) based on their judgements about the participants’ vocabulary size. To ensure that most of the participants were not familiar with the target words, the researcher chose words from lower frequency bands. According to the vocabulary profile analysis based on BNC-COCA corpus 1–25k (Cobb, n.d.), all of the target words were beyond the first 3K level from low-frequency bands except for two words, strain and glow.

Tests. The participants were given two tests: The Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) and a passive recall test developed by the researcher. With an aim to measure test takers’ receptive written knowledge of 14,000 words, the VLT includes 140 multiple-choice items with 10 items representing each thousand frequency level. The words are presented in a single non-defining stem with four choices, which were of the same part of speech and in the same frequency band. The 3K, 4K and 5K sets of the VLT (Nation & Beglar, 2007) were given in the study because of time constraint and relatively large passive vocabulary size of the study group. The VLT data for some of the participants were missing as they did not take the VLT. Besides the VLT, an online passive recall test was given as the pre-test and the posttest. In the test, the participants were presented the written form of the target word only. They were required to write L2 definition, L2 synonym or L1 equivalent for each target word in the blanks below each word.

# Procedure

Students in different sections were given the pretest and the Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) online at the beginning of the semester before they were assigned to any group in the study. Those who gave verbal consent to take the tests were informed that the tests were given to determine their vocabulary size and the test results would be used for research later. The pretest and the VLT were given one month before to avoid implicit announcement of the posttest. The participants were not allowed to note any unknown word during the pretest so that they would not try to learn these words intentionally. One month later, the researcher asked students in different sections to take part in the study. The students were told that the study involved watching animated interactive videos of 4 to 5 min. in length on various topics and answering some questions. The participants were not informed about an upcoming vocabulary test.

The participants in each section, who gave verbal consent, were invited to the computer lab, where each participants had access to one PC with internet connection and a headset. After registration to EdPuzzle on the PCs, the participants were randomly given one of the three virtual class codes to join one of the classes: NG, TG or MCG. All of the participants were informed that they were going to watch three videos, which would automatically play twice and stop from time to time to show them some glosses or to ask questions.

The researcher observed the participants in the lab as they individually watched all three videos twice. Immediately after watching the videos, the researcher asked the participants to complete an unannounced online meaning recall vocabulary test (the same as the pretest). The whole procedure including the posttest took 40 to 45 minutes in total. The researcher enabled ‘Prevent skipping’ so that all of the participants spent roughly equal amount of time; the participants took more time to complete only if they paused relatively longer to answer MCGs or comprehension questions. Although time-on-task was not measured strictly and compared across groups, all of the participants finished the viewing task at a similar period of time as observed by the researcher.

# Scoring and data analyses

As suggested by the developers, the VLT was scored by multiplying each correct answer with 100. As for the 21-item passive recall test, which was given as the pretest and the posttest, each item was scored dichotomously (i.e. 0 for each incorrect response or 1 for each correct response). Lenient scoring was adopted. The responses with small mistakes such as spelling mistakes were also awarded a full score. The researcher asked one of his colleagues to rate the answers for the $3 0 \%$ of the online responses and an interrater reliability of .93 was obtained. Conflicts over items were resolved through discussion. A Kruskal-Wallis was run to find out if there were significant differences between the three groups in terms of target word knowledge before the treatment. Similarly, another Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine any significant difference between the groups after the treatment.

As in previous studies (Horst et  al., 1998; Rodgers & Webb, 2020), relative gains were calculated for each participant by dividing the number of learned words by the number of target words that could be learnt (i.e. the number of the words known in the pre-test subtracted from total number of target words). The resulting numbers were multiplied by 100 to obtain percentages. Since relative gain data from the three groups normally distributed, a one-way ANOVA was carried out to see if the groups differed significantly. To present a clearer picture of incidental vocabulary gains, absolute gain scores were calculated by subtracting the pretest scores from the posttest scores as in Rodgers and Webb (2020). Another one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the groups’ absolute gains and an additional Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare the VLT scores between the groups. As for correlations between prior vocabulary knowledge and posttest scores, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated. To find out if groups increased their scores from the pretest to the posttest, three Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were conducted. Finally, a paired-sample t-test was run between the pre-test scores and the MCG scores of the participants in the first view to see if they learnt new words from the MCGs.

# Results

# Between-group comparisons

A Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to see if there was any difference between groups regarding their pretest scores. The test showed that the groups did not significantly differ in terms of their pretest scores, $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 )$ $= 1 . 5 2$ , $p = . 4 7$ . (see Table 5).

To compare the differences between groups’ posttest scores, another Kruskal-Wallis test was run, and the results indicated a significant difference, $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 ) = 6 8 . 1 7$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) (see Table 6). A Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc test was conducted to locate the difference.

The results of the test indicated that both the MCG group and the TG group significantly did better than the NG group $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . However, there was no significant difference between the MCG group and the TG group $\left( p \right. = \left. . 3 9 \right)$ .

A one-way ANOVA test was conducted to see if any glossing condition led to more incidental vocabulary learning than the others. Relative gain scores were used for this comparison. The result showed that there was a significant difference between the groups, $F = 8 8 . 0 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ (see Table 7). Therefore, a Tukey test was conducted as a post-hoc test to locate the significant difference.

The Tukey test revealed that both the MCG group and the TG group significantly outperformed the NG group $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . However, there was no significant difference between the MCG group and the TG group $( p = . 3 6 )$ .

Another one-way ANOVA test was conducted to see the differences between the groups in terms of their absolute gain scores. The results of the test revealed a significant difference between the groups, $F { = } 8 6 . 8 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ (see Table 8). In order to see where the significant difference between groups lies, another Tukey test was conducted.

The results of the Tukey test indicated that both the MCG group and the TG group significantly outperformed the NG group $\left( p \ < \ . 0 0 1 \right)$ . However, no significant difference was found between the MCG group and the TG group $\left( p \upsilon = . 6 9 \right)$ .

Further, the three groups (see Table 9) were compared in terms of VLT scores. The VLT had acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha $\ c = . 7 7 )$ . The results of Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that there was no significant difference in the VLT scores among the groups $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 ) =$ 1.80, $p \ = \ . 4 1 { \dot { } }$ ) with a mean rank result of 46.56 for MCG condition, 37.38 for NG condition, and 41.91 for TG condition.

# Correlation between the VLT and relative gain scores

To see the correlation between participants’ prior knowledge and their relative gain scores, four Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient tests were run using SPSS 26. The results indicated that there were no significant correlations between prior knowledge and relative gain scores for MCG condition $\left( r \ \left( 2 3 \right) \ = \ . 2 0 \right.$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 3 4 )$ , for TG condition $( r \ ( 3 2 ) = . 2 9 $ , $\hbar =$ .10), and for NG condition $( r ( 2 2 ) = . 3 8$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 0 6 )$ . However, there was a strong, positive correlation between prior knowledge and relative gain scores when the groups’ score was calculated all together $( r \ ( 8 1 ) = \ . 2 6 $ $N = 8 3$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 0 2 )$ ) (see Table 10).

# Within-group comparisons

Three Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests were conducted to reveal if each group improved from the pretest to the posttest. The results revealed that the posttest scores were significantly higher than the pretest scores in all three conditions. All of the three groups; namely, MCG, TG and NG, significantly increased their scores from the pretest to the posttest, respectively $( Z = - 5 . 6 5$ , $\textstyle P ^ { \mathrm { ~ < ~ } . 0 0 1 ) }$ ), $( Z = - 6 . 0 4 , \ \mathfrak { p } \ < \ . 0 0 1 )$ and $( Z = - 2 . 3 2$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } . 0 2 } } ,$ ).

To see if the participants in the MCG group interacted with the MCGs rather than simply learnt from immediate correct answer provided, a paired samples t-test was conducted to compare the participants’ pretest scores and accuracy rates in MCGs in the first viewing. The results yielded a significant difference ( $t = 2 6 . 1 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p \ < \ . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ ) with mean scores of 18.37 for the first viewing scores and 2.84 for pretest scores. As tracking data for some of the participants in the MCG condition was not accessible, results from only 19 participants were calculated.

# Discussion

# Effects of glosses on incidental vocabulary learning

As for the first research question, relative gain scores revealed that participants in glossed conditions significantly outperformed NG condition. This is in line with the findings of previous studies indicating the effectiveness of glosses as compared to NG condition in reading (e.g. Abraham, 2008), in listening (Çakmak $\&$ Erçetin, 2017) and in viewing (Fievez et  al., 2021; Hsieh, 2020; Montero Perez et  al., 2018). Furthermore, although relative gain was limited $( 3 . 5 2 \% )$ , there was a significant difference $\left( p \ = \ . 0 2 \right)$ between the pretest and the posttest scores in the NG condition, which is in line with previous research suggesting that audiovisual input can be conducive to incidental vocabulary learning even without glosses and captions (Feng & Webb, 2020; Peters & Webb, 2018; Rodgers & Webb, 2020).

Although there are some discrepancies in rates of incidental vocabulary learning, the results of the current study are also corroborated by previous studies using glosses in viewing. As the participants in the current study took only meaning recall test, the discussion will be based on relative or absolute gains on only meaning recall tests in other studies. The relatively lower rates of incidental vocabulary learning in Fievez et  al. (2021) study ( $3 5 \%$ relative gain) in meaning recall compared to those in the current study $5 3 . 6 6 \%$ and $5 9 . 5 6 \%$ relative gains for TG and MCGs, respectively) and in Hsieh’s (2020) study (11.38 absolute gain out of 19) can be attributed to the fact that the participants in Fievez et al.’s (2021) study watched longer videos (six series of a TV series each $5 1 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . on average) only once and over a longer treatment period with higher number of target words presented and tested $( N { = } 7 8 )$ , while the participants both in the current study and in Hsieh’s study (2020) watched shorter animated videos (4 min. 20 sec. on average) twice in one session (both of which lasted $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . to $5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } . }$ ) and studied 21 target words and 19 target words, respectively. Besides, as Peters (2019) and Fakhr et  al. (2020) revealed, higher visual imagery support in animated videos as compared to that in TV series can explain the difference in rates of incidental vocabulary learning. Moreover, although the number of target words and the length of the videos were similar in the current study and in Montero Perez et  al.’s study (2018), absolute gains in the current study (12.48 and 13.59 out of 21 for the MCG and the TG condition, respectively) and in Hsieh’s (2020) study (11.38 out of 19) were higher as compared to Montero Perez et al.’s (2018) study (absolute gain of 7 out of 18 target words). The discrepancy can be attributed to different type of glosses and video genres used in these studies. The three video clips (ranging between 2 min. 29 sec. and 4 min. 24 sec.) from foreign affairs TV program in Montero Perez et  al. (2018) apparently had lower visual support compared to the animated educational videos used in the current study and in Hsieh’s (2020) study. Further, while in Hsieh’s study (2020) and in the current study the glosses were automatically presented, the glosses in Montero Perez et al.’s (2018) study required the participants to look up the target words (i.e. press the space bar). As revealed by Montero Perez et al. (2018) and Fievez et al. (2021), some of the participants, even those with smaller VS, ignored glosses, which can partially explain the difference between the absolute gains. In sum, the results of the previous studies and the current study indicate that glosses can exponentially boost incidental vocabulary learning from audiovisual input with some moderating variables such as visual-audio congruency, length of the video, the number of viewing and of target words, and type of glosses influencing rates of incidental vocabulary learning.

The lack of significant difference between the MCG and the TG condition seems to contradict Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) Involvement Load Hypothesis. In both conditions, need and search elements were constant because the video stopped automatically and provided the meanings of the words. However, the participants in the MCG group needed to evaluate the immediate linguistic and audiovisual context to make an appropriate choice, which was expected to lead to more incidental vocabulary learning as a meta-analysis study of glosses in reading (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020) indicated.

The lack of significant difference between TGs and MCGs contrary to expectations could be attributed to enforced processing of both gloss types in the current study. Yanagisawa et  al. (2020) argue that enforced processing of MCGs make them more conducive than TGs, which students tend to neglect (Warren et  al., 2018, as cited in Yanagisawa et  al., 2020). However, in the current study, both types of glosses were displayed automatically and required processing to continue watching. This can be one explanation of why the result of the current study contradicts the results of the meta-analysis study (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020).

Moreover, the finding of the current study seems to corroborate previous studies conducted by Hulstijn (1992), Watanabe (1997) and Miyasako (2002), who also indicated no significant difference between MCG and TG conditions. Lack of difference between MCGs and TGs in reading condition was attributed to the lack of feedback to ensure accurate word-meaning formation (Nagata, 1999). However, the finding of the current study cannot be explained with the lack of feedback as in other studies (Hulstijn, 1992; Miyasako, 2002; Watanabe, 1997) because unlike these studies in paper-based reading context, the current study provided immediate feedback.

Nagata (1999) attributes the superiority of MGCs to feedback provided. In contrast, the only study indicating the superiority of TGs over MCGs, Yoshii (2013) also provided feedback in MG condition. However, while Nagata (1999) provided immediate feedback, Yoshii (2013) provided feedback only after reading and in bulk. The controversial findings between the two studies can be attributed to the timing and amount of feedback. Thus, research indicates facilitative role of immediate feedback for MCGs. However, the current study, which provided immediate feedback for MCGs, found no significant difference between MCGs and TGs. Therefore, lack of difference in the current study requires further explanation.

Rott (2005), who presented MCGs without feedback, found MCGs to be more conducive than TGs. Rott (2005) compared processing of TGs with MCGs in a reading task using think-aloud protocol and quantitative measures of vocabulary gain and attributed the superiority of MCGs to more extensive use of metacognitive word processing (including noticing and monitoring of comprehension) and semantic elaboration (which included assessing, retrieving existing knowledge) strategies with MCGs. In the current study, MCGs also provided the context (written sentence) for the target words, which could stimulate inferencing through reading as in Rott (2005). However, the number of occurrences of the target words and opportunity to refer the text recursively in reading can explain the discrepancy between the findings. While the participants in the current study saw the target words only once in the sentence (except for four words that occurred twice), in Rott’s study, the participants encountered with the target words three more times without glosses in the text. Although the interactive video software used in the current study also allowed the participants to re-watch the excerpt and evaluate the context of the target words until they pressed the skip button to continue viewing, it is not the same as in reading, where the participants could easily refer back to the MCG and previous context with eye movements. Thus, frequency of occurrence and recursive references to context in reading can explain why MCGs in viewing were not found to be more conducive to incidental vocabulary learning, contrary to finding of meta-analysis study in reading (Yanagisawa et al., 2020) and to the Involvement Load Hypothesis.

The result of the current study, which is not corroborated by previous research, can be attributed to three possibilities. In the current study, facilitative effect of immediate feedback in MCGs might have been lost because the learners might have skipped the evaluation process (as they soon—probably after the first MCG question—understood that they would be provided the correct answer regardless of they were involved in evaluation). Second, the number of choices and thus difficulty involved in choosing could have influenced depth of processing and the effectiveness of MCGs. Third, the visual support provided in the MCGs (see Figure 4) could have caused the participants to rely more on visual context than verbal context. The first possibility is ruled out as there was a significant difference between the pretest and MCG scores of the participants in the MCG condition in the first view, which indicates that the participants got involved in the evaluation process and learnt new words thanks to MCGs.

As for the second possibility, the three-choice MCGs in the current study must have involved more difficulty and thus evaluation than two-choice MCGs in Nagata (1999). Thus, although there is not extensive evidence, the final possibility which indicates that learners relied on accompanying visual imagery rather than evaluation of written context seems plausible. This can be evidenced by examining accurate and inaccurate choices they made with the MCGs. The higher number of participants choosing incorrect choice ‘a pleasant smell’ for the MCG for the word delicacy, can be the result of accompanying misleading visual shown together with the gloss (see Figure 4). On the contrary, for the target word clump, high accuracy rates for the MCG can be attributed to visual support congruent with its meaning. Both cases indicate that the participants could have relied on the visual support rather than evaluating the written context in the gloss. However, the real cognitive processes the participants went through could not be revealed without a think-aloud protocol.

# Effects of prior vocabulary knowledge on incidental vocabulary learning

As for the second research question, there was a significant correlation between VLT score and incidental vocabulary learning when the VLT scores for all the groups were calculated together, which is corroborated by most previous research (Feng & Webb, 2020; Montero Perez et  al., 2015, 2018; Peters et  al., 2016; Peters & Webb, 2018). However, when the scores were examined separately for each group, it was seen that there was no significant correlation between VLT score and incidental vocabulary learning. Incidental vocabulary learning through viewing is a quite complex construct influenced from a range of item-related variables of frequency of occurrence, visual congruency and input enhancement techniques in addition to learner related variable of vocabulary size (VS). Thus, this contradiction can be attributed to a number of other competing variables. The lack of such a correlation in the current study can be attributed to the existence of glosses in the MG condition and the TG condition. Automatically presented glosses could have compensated for the gap between the participants’ VSs, meaning that the participants with smaller vocabulary sizes benefitted equally well from glosses, which explicitly presented form-meaning associations.

In his dissertation Rodgers (2013) reports two different results with regard to correlation between VS and incidental vocabulary learning, each of which can contribute to the discussion of the results in the current study in a different aspect. On the one hand, Rodgers (2013) reported a positive correlation between VS and incidental vocabulary learning through viewing with captions. This can indicate that captions as an enhancement technique like glosses is not as effective as glosses in bridging the VS gaps between learners. On the other hand, in another study in the same dissertation, Rodgers (2013) reported no correlation between VS and incidental vocabulary learning through viewing without captions. The lack of correlation in terms of group-based results in the current study and and in Rodgers’ second study (2013), which contradicts most previous research, warrants more rigorous research into the correlation between VS and incidental vocabulary learning, which is a highly complex construct with a variety of variables that can be at play.

In sum, in line with previous research in viewing (Fievez et  al., 2021; Hsieh, 2020; Montero Perez et  al., 2018) and in other modes of input, such as reading (Abraham, 2008) and listening (Çakmak & Erçetin, 2017), the result of the present study indicated the superiority of glosses over no gloss condition in audiovisual input. Although it is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies in reading (Nagata, 1999; Rott, 2005; Yanagisawa et  al., 2020), the current study suggests that MCGs and TGs lead to similar incidental L2 vocabulary gains from audiovisual input, which can be attributed to visual support that could have eliminated evaluation process in the MCGs and enforced processing of word meaning in both types of glosses. In addition, the congruency of visual and verbal information in the video, the length of video, interactivity of glosses (automatically presented versus learner activated), and the number of target words can influence incidental vocabulary learning from audiovisual input with glosses.

# Conclusion

# Pedagogical implications

The results of the present study suggest that glosses added to audiovisual input can exponentially increase incidental vocabulary learning. Interactive videos can be used to add MCGs to enhance learners’ interaction with input. L2 learners can benefit from immediate feedback including the correct answer for MCGs. Videos with higher visual and audio congruency can be more conducive to incidental vocabulary learning. L2 material designers should pay attention to the congruency between the visual in a specific frame and the target word’s meaning when adding glosses because some visuals can be misleading.

# Limitations

The study is limited with a specific genre of videos, i.e. animated educational videos. The videos were relatively short and limited in number. Longer videos of different genres can possibly include more words for studying incidental learning via audiovisual input. Further, the study has weak ecological validity in that the videos used in this study are educational videos and are watched twice with glosses, which does not reflect the types of audiovisual input L2 learners are exposed to outside the class. Moreover, the findings of the current study are confined to learners at a certain proficiency level; therefore, it does not allow the researcher to investigate the effectiveness of interactive glosses with learners at varying proficiency levels. The researcher could have measured time-on-task more precisely and compared it across different conditions to explain the participant’s involvement loads in each condition. In addition, think-aloud protocol could have been used to better reveal cognitive processes in which the participants were involved in the MCG condition. Finally, a delayed posttest could have been given to see if different gloss types led to different retention rates.

# Further studies

Having discussed the limitations and pedagogical implications of the current study, the researcher believes that there is a need for further research into types of glosses in audiovisual input. In particular, how visual support in audiovisual input can interact with glosses should be further examined. Learner-related variables such as prior vocabulary knowledge, attitudes towards audiovisual input and incidental vocabulary learning gains from automatically presented versus learner activated glosses need to be researched further. Different genres of videos with varying degrees of audio and visual congruency and at varying lengths can be studied. Moreover, new studies can include qualitative data collection tools such as think-aloud protocols to paint a clearer picture of cognitive process learners go through when processing different types of glosses. The availability and timing of feedback, the number and quality of choices in MCGs and learners’ treatment of such feedback should also be examined. Further studies can also track learners’ responses to MCGs to find out how rates of accuracy correlate with vocabulary gain.
