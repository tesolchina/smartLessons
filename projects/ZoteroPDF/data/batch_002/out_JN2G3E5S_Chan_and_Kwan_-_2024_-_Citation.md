Keywords: Citation content Literature reviews Move analysis Research paradigms Information systems Re-contextualization

Despite a long history of citation research, its focus has been on the linguistic and rhetorical characteristics of citations rather than their semantic nature. Using a movebased approach grounded in the CARS model (Swales, 1990), this paper studies the sorts of source ideas cited in different parts of literature reviews (LR) of Information Systems research articles following the design science research (DSR) and interpretivist research (IR) paradigms. Findings reveal three types of epistemically-oriented semantic content – theoretical, research, and methodological – and one type that is non-epistemically-framed, which vary quantitatively and qualitatively between the DSR and IR LRs. For example, both types of LRs cite more often in Move 1 Establishing a territory than in Moves 2 and 3 Establishing a niche and Occupying the niche, with theoretical terminologies, definitions, propositions being referred to more frequently in the IR writing than in the DSR writing. On the other hand, citations in the DSR writing often display prescriptive propositions, design concepts, artefacts, and methods which are absent from the IR writing. These findings not only help us better understand how citation is shaped and constrained by rhetorical moves and research paradigms but also provide implications for the teaching of citation content.

# 1. Introduction

The literature review (LR) section is an integral component of a research article (RA). It situates one’s work in a network of scholarship produced in a relevant research community. In many cases, writers make use of it to advance the theoretical framework for their research through critical engagement with past literature (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Hart, 1998). Studies of LRs have found that theoretical frameworks are often defended through notable strategic rhetorical moves resembling those of Swales’s (1990) CARS model originally discovered in RA introductions (e.g., Kwan, 2006; Kwan et al., 2012; Tseng, 2018). This means that writers rhetorically organize and position their defenses for their theoretical frameworks through the three moves of establishing a territory, Establishing a niche, and Occupying the niche.

Although the CARS model has been used extensively to guide students to structure their LRs, those who have taught students to use it might be aware that having knowledge about its rhetorical moves does not necessarily guarantee a wellformed LR. This is partly because the part-genre requires working large amounts of source ideas into various moves that call for effective authorial control in not only selecting but also synthesizing those ideas to maintain coherence. These are taxing tasks, often leaving many inexperienced writers flounder in the very ideas that they cite indiscriminately, producing what Rudestam & Newton (2007) refer to as laundry listing of disjoined citations in the production of their LRs.

In spite of the common citing anomaly, surprisingly little is offered in instructional literature to help novice writers to master the art of citing in LRs. What can be found in most writing guidebooks primarily emphasizes mechanics of citations (e.g., Davis, Davis, & Dunagan, 2012; Ridley, 2012; Sword, 2012; Wallwork, 2011) and their rhetorical use such as stance-taking (e.g., Feak & Swales, 2009; Paltridge & Starfield, 2020; Ridley, 2012) rather than advice that describes what tends to be cited and the strategic use of the cited ideas in specific parts of LRs such as the three rhetorical moves alluded to above.

The paucity of these pedagogical materials is arguably a consequence of the lack of relevant empirical work on which $\mathsf { E A P } /$ ESP practitioners can draw. This is indeed surprising despite the long history of citation research that straddles different disciplines such as information science, sociology of science, and applied linguistics (see White, 2004). While researchers in these disciplines have focused on exploring different aspects of citation use, including the relationships between citing papers and those cited (Garfield, 1979; Small & Greenlee, 1980), the private reasons for citing (Small, 1978), and the discoursal and textual features of citations (Charles, 2006; Doolan, 2021; Hyland, 1999, 2002; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Nesi, 2021; Samraj, 2013; Swales, 1990; Thomas & Hawes, 1994; Thompson, 2005; Thompson & Tribble, 2001; Thompson & Ye, 1991; Zhang, 2022), one common topic of concern to them has been citation classification. Accordingly, various typologies have been created to categorize citations into function types (e.g., Liu, 1993; Peritz, 1983; Petri-c & Harwood, 2013; Spiegel-Rösing, 1977; Swales, 1986). A few exceptions can also be found for example in Moravcsik & Murugesan (1975), Finney (1979), Petri-c (2007) and Harwood (2009) who mentioned in passing some generic semantic attributes that could be found in citations such as “concept”, “method”, and “tool”.

Of particular relevance to our investigation are the studies by Kwan & Hang (2014) and Chan & Kwan (2022) only. While Kwan & Hang (2014) analyzed the sorts of knowledge cited in different parts of the results and closing sections of Information Systems (IS) RAs, Chan & Kwan (2022) examined those cited in different parts of the LR sections of IS RAs. More specifically and importantly, the latter has generated a semantic typology of citations specific to the part-genre analyzed in this study (see Analytical Framework below). Continuing the line of inquiry, the present study examines the types of source ideas found in different parts of LRs of RAs with a view to informing the instruction in citation for LR writing.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the analytical framework and research questions for the current study. Section 3 describes the research methodology of the study. Section 4 presents and discusses the findings of the study. Section 5 summarizes the findings of the study and discusses its pedagogical implications, limitations, and future research directions.

# 2. Analytical framework

# 2.1. The semantic content of citations

The analytical framework of the current study is informed by that developed by Chan & Kwan (2022), which postulates that four general types of cited ideas can be found in research writing (see Figure 1).

While Chan & Kwan (2022) work has contributed significantly to our understanding of the relationship among citations and rhetorical moves, their semantic typology of citation was based purely on data taken from behavioral science research (BSR) writing that emphasizes the use of a deductive-hypothetico approach to theory/hypothesis development and testing. This leaves us wondering whether and the extent to which the citation categories identified above are applicable to research following other research paradigms that do not particularly develop and test hypotheses, which is a major reason for the current study. Using Chan & Kwan (2022) typology represented in Figure 1 as a guiding analytical framework, the present study examines whether the distinct types of source ideas are cited in different parts of LRs of RAs following the design science and interpretivist research paradigms. More precisely, it intends to find answers to the following research questions:

What types of ideas are often cited in the identified moves and their corresponding steps of the two types of LRs? What are the differences in the types of the cited ideas between the two types of LRs?  What functions do the distinct ideas serve in relation to the moves and steps of the two types of LRs? How do the findings of this study compare with those of Chan & Kwan (2022) study?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The discipline of information systems

The applied social science discipline of IS was chosen in this study due mainly to its multi-paradigmatic nature with several types of better-known research paradigms, among which design science research (Hevner, 2007) and interpretivist research (Klein & Meyer, 1999) were examined here.

# 3.1.1. Design science research

Design science research (DSR) operates with a pragmatist or problem-solving paradigm with the aim of finding solutions to IT-related problems through the building and evaluation of an IT artefact which can take the form of a construct (e.g., a vocabulary used to define a problem or solution), a model (e.g., a statement expressing relationships among constructs), a method (e.g., an algorithm used to perform a task), or instantiation (e.g., a prototype system implemented in an authentic environment) (Martin & Smith, 1995). This type of research typically follows three cycles (Hevner, 2007). The first is the relevance cycle where researchers conduct a field study based on past scholarship to define an IT problem that will be solved (e.g., inability of a system to handle unstructured social media data) and performance criteria for the building and evaluation of the proposed artefact that solves the problem. The second is the rigor cycle where researchers draw on past literature to determine which design theories and methodologies are appropriate for and applicable to the development of a theoretical and methodological base for the building and evaluation of the proposed artefact. The third is the design cycle where researchers focus all attention on the building and assessment of the artefact with the latter task usually done by using either quantitative or qualitative research methods or both (e.g., experiment, case study).

# 3.1.2. Interpretivist research

Interpretivist research (IR) is obviously interpretive in nature, aiming to gain insights from organizations or individuals into phenomena in respect of the adoption, development, and management of IT artefacts (Klein & Meyer, 1999). Unlike DSR, it generally follows an inductive mode of inquiry that first begins with observing the phenomenon under study, then developing a theoretical perspective and lens based on past literature as some sort of research direction for analyzing the phenomenon (Cavaye, 1996; Charmaz, 2003), and finally ends with analyzing data from interviews, observations and documents through qualitative methods ranging from phenomenology (Gadamer, 1976) to ethnography (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995) and to grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).

# 3.2. Data collection

The data collected in this study are RAs (30 DSR RAs and 30 IR RAs) published between 2010 and 2018 in six IS journals highly rated by the Association of Information Systems (2011): European Journal of Information Systems (EJIS), Information Systems Journal (ISJ), Information and Management (IM), Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), MIS Quarterly (MISQ), and Decision Support Systems (DSS). These articles were collected using judgement sampling where two criteria were set up: i) each DSR RA must report a study which concerned the design and evaluation of an artefact that addressed an existing IT-related problem and ii) each IR RA must present a study aiming to provide insights into an IT-related phenomenon from the perspective of participating individuals or organizations through access to data collected through interviews, focus groups, or historical documents and analyzed through phenomenology, ethnography, or grounded theory. Following the collection of the RAs, the LR sections were extracted that occurred between the Introduction and Methodology (M) sections. However, extra sections were observed to appear between the LR and M sections of some of the RAs.1 Given that these sections served the main purpose of reviewing and discussing past literature regarding the writers’ research, they were treated as part of the data examined in this study. Table 1 summarizes the compositions of the two corpora for the study.

# 3.3. Data analysis

# 3.3.1. Coding of moves and steps

A move analysis grounded in Swales’s (1990) CARS model was done to code the moves and their corresponding steps of the LRs under study. The model was selected mainly because of its applicability to research into LRs in RAs and dissertations (Chan & Kwan, 2022 Gil-Salom & Soler-Monreal, 2014; Kwan, 2006; Kwan et al., 2012; Soler-Monreal, 2015). Each text was first read repeatedly to gain a general idea of how it was organized. It was then parsed into move-step segments, which were later coded by studying its propositional content and possible intention in relation to the writer’s own research (e.g., reviewing items of previous research), while at the same time analyzing its content against the rhetorical purpose of a potential move (e.g., establishing a research territory). Finally, attempts were made to develop a move-step structure for all the texts under study. Where necessary, the structure was modified to accommodate new moves and steps. Figure 2 presents the moves and steps of the LRs found in this study.

Briefly speaking, all the texts encompassed the three moves of the CARS model. Of the 14 steps found, nine were extracted from the model (see the asterisks in Figure 2), with S3C Concept-defining, S3D Concept description, S3E Theory description, and S3G Next (sub-)section indication drawn from the study of Chan & Kwan (2022) and S3F Research contribution(s) being the new step identified in this study.

# 3.3.2. Coding of citations and their ideas

After the move-step coding was completed, a citation analysis was performed. A citation is defined here as “a text segment comprising a unit of ideas taken from a single source or generalized from multiple sources, which can be realized in a wide range of grammatical units, ranging from noun phrases to subordinates and main clauses and even sometimes spanned several main clauses” (Chan & Kwan, 2022, p.9) (see the underlined parts in Texts 1–2).

Text 1 Following the approach of the Henderson et al.’s (1996) strategic alignment model, a firm’s intended IS capabilities are based on the firm’s intended competitive strategies.

Text 2 Barki et al. (2001) developed an integrative contingency model of software project risk management and found that the outcome of a software development project is influenced by the fit between the project’s risk and how project risk is managed.

All citations were first marked up and skimmed to develop a general picture of the sorts of ideas referred to in the LRs. Ideas in each citation were then read repeatedly and classified tentatively using the typology shown in Figure 1. Those not mentioned in the typology were placed in new categories. Texts 1 and 2 illustrate how coding decisions were made. In Text 1, the possessive noun phrase “Henderson et al.‘s strategic alignment model” is a clear revelation of a theoretical citation. Since only the name of the model was alluded to, it was counted as a theoretical citation with a theoretical subtype of Terminology. In Text 2, the research activities represented by the past tense forms of the two verbs “developed” and “found” show that what are cited are parts of Barki et al.’s study. They were thus coded as a research citation with two research subtypes of Act and Finding. Figure 3 shows the semantic typology of citations developed in this study.2

Simply put, the theoretical, research, and non-epistemically-framed citations from the guiding typology were identified in both the DSR and IR LRs. A group of methodological citations were also found. However, these citations involve ideas connected with artefact design methodologies emphasized by Hevner’s (2007) rigor cycle of DSR described above as opposed to those as to empirical methodologies shown in the guiding typology (see Appendix 1 for the glosses and examples of all the cited ideas in the typology developed in this study).

# 3.4. Coding reliability and validity

The coding tasks were carried out in multi-iterations with the help of the MAXQDA software. First, the preliminary round of coding was performed by the first author of this paper using the analytical frameworks and coding procedures presented above. Then, a second rater was invited to code 30 LRs (15 DSR LRs & 15 IR LRs) for a reliability check. To assess inter-rater agreement, Cohen’s kappa statistics were used for the coding tasks done by the author and the second rater. The obtained kappa statistics were 0.94 for the coding of moves, 0.91 for the coding of steps, 0.96 for the coding of citations, and 0.79 for the coding of citation content respectively. These results revealed a substantive to almost perfect inter-code agreement as suggested by Landis & Koch’s (1977) guidelines for interpreting kappa values. Finally, coding disagreements were resolved through discussion between the two codes, and modifications to the analytical frameworks were made when necessary.

# 4. Results and discussion

The following section presents and discusses the results of this study. For ease of reporting, shorthand names were used to refer to the cited ideas identified in the different move-specific steps of the DSR and IR LRs (see the names in bold in Figure 3).3 In order to minimize any effect resulting from the two corpora of different sizes, the data were normalized by turning the raw frequency counts into rates of occurrence per 1,000 words of texts. Since the mean frequency counts of the eighteen types of the cited ideas were not normally distributed across the two types of LRs, the Mann–Whitney test was adopted to find any paradigm-specific differences between them. The one-way ANOVA was also used to determine whether significant effects existed of move on the eighteen types. When a statistically significant effect was detected on a particular type, a bonferronicorrected post-hoc comparison test was subsequently employed to identify any move-specific differences between the two types of LRs. To measure the strength of the magnitude of the statistical results, eta squared was calculated as an indication of effect size and interpreted using the benchmark proposed by Cohen (1988) who categorized effect sizes of .14 as small (S), .36 as medium (M), and .51 as large (L). All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software. A p-value of .05 was established as a level of significance.

4.1. Sources ideas in the various move-specific steps of the DSR and IR LRs

# 4.1.1. Move-step distributions of theoretical citations

Theoretical citations $( \mathsf { N } = 7 8 5 )$ ) are the most common citation category with a total of 815 corresponding ideas that were classified into seven subtypes. Table 2 shows their move-step distributions in the two types of LRs. In Move 1, the centrality claiming strategy cites Evaluation only in comparison with the topic generalization strategy where six subtypes are referred to with Potential, Component, and Application appearing at higher frequencies in the DSR LRs and Terminology, Definition, and Proposition occurring at higher numbers in the IR LRs. In Move 2, the counter claiming strategy features Evaluation only with the IR LRs having a higher frequency count than the DSR LRs. In Move 3, three respective steps register theoretical ideas, namely the concept defining strategy where only Definition occurs in the IR LRs, the concept description strategy where only Potential appears in the IR LRs, and the theory description strategy where only Terminology exists in the DSR and IR LRs.

# 4.1.2. Move-step distributions of research citations

The second most common citation category is research citations $\mathbf { \Delta N } = 6 2 7 ,$ ) with a total of 662 corresponding ideas categorized into five subtypes. Table 3 presents their move-step distributions in the two types of LRs.

In Move 1, the centrality claiming strategy refers to Aim/Focus only when compared with the review of past research strategy where four subtypes are cited with Act appearing at a much higher frequency count in the DSR LRs, Aim/Focus and Finding occurring at a much higher number in the IR LRs, and Claim commonly used in the two types of LRs. In Move 2, the research gap/need indication strategy refers to Evaluation only, which stands in contrast to the counter-claiming strategy where Act, Claim, and Evaluation are referred to in the two types of LRs with Finding in the IR LRs only.

4.1.3. Move-step distributions of non-epistemically-framed citations

However, unlike the two citation categories discussed above, non-epistemically-framed citations $N = 2 2 8$ ) were observed to be less common with a total of 228 corresponding ideas divided into two subtypes. Their move-step distributions in the two types of LRs are presented in Table 4.

In Move 1, the centrality claiming strategy refers to both problem- and non-problem-associated phenomena with the former found in both the DSR and IR LRs and the latter in the IR LRs only, while the topic generalizations strategy features both phenomena in the two types of LRs. This stands in contrast to the counter-claiming strategy in Move 2 where only problemassociated phenomena are cited in the IR LRs.

# 4.1.4. Move-step distributions of methodological citations

Finally, the least common citation category is methodological citations $( \Nu = 8 7$ ) with a total of 87 corresponding ideas found in the DSR LRs only, and these ideas were grouped into four subtypes. Table 5 displays their move-step distributions in the texts. As can be seen, there is only Evaluation in the centrality claiming strategy of Move 1 and the counter claiming strategy of Move 2 respectively, which stands in contrast to the topic generalizations strategy of Move 1 where Potential is referred to most often followed by Terminology and Application.

# 4.1.5. Statistical tests of effects of moves on citation types

The one-way ANOVA shows statistically significant effects of move on the eighteen types of the cited ideas, with large effect sizes on citations to research aims/focuses and research acts, medium on citations to theoretical propositions and research findings, and small on the remaining fourteen (see Table 6). These results suggest that there are prominent effects of move on citations to research aims/focuses, research acts, research findings, and theoretical propositions in the two types of writing.

The bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparison test further reveals that most of the ideas appear much more frequently in Move 1 Establishing a territory than in Moves 2 and 3 Establishing a niche and Occupying the niche with the exception of those that denote theoretical and empirical evaluations which occur much more often in Moves 2 than in Moves 1 and 3 (see Appendix II for the results of the post-hoc test). These findings clearly reflect the ways in which the three moves influence the citing of the ideas. Move 1 is where the writers provide a background to the research topic under investigation using a large body of prior literature, which necessitates heavy reliance on source use. This is in contrast to Move 2 where the writers express their own stance on what has been discussed in Move 1 to justify the conduct of their own study, which requires relatively less reliance on source use. In some cases, however, evaluative claims made by predecessors are drawn in this move to demonstrate that the niche that the writers establish for their research is valid and convincing. Move 3 is where the writers announce different aspects of their research such as research aims and questions, thereby having less need for engaging with past scholarship.

With regard to paradigm-specific differences, the Mann–Whitney test demonstrates that only citations to theoretical definitions $\mathrm { ( U } = 2 9 9 . 5 0 0 , \mathrm { p } . = . 0 2 4 \mathrm { ) }$ , citations to research findings $( \mathrm { U } = 1 7 0 . 0 0 0 , \mathrm { p . } = 0 0 1 ) \mathrm { \Omega }$ , and citations to research evaluations $( \mathrm { U } = 2 9 4 . 5 0 0 , \mathrm { p . } = 0 0 6 ) $ ) are paradigm-specific, each having a small effect size (see Table 7).4 These results suggest that while the paradigm-specific differences are statistically significant, the small effect sizes show that these differences are marginal.

4.2. Qualitative differences in the cited ideas between the DSR and IR LRs

In addition to these quantitative differences, qualitative variations were found to exist in the types of the cited ideas between the two types of LRs. One obviously lies in the above-mentioned methodological citations identified in the DSR writing only, as illustrated in Texts 3–6 where different aspects of prior artefact design methodologies are referred to, i.e., the names of the document clustering methods (Text 3), the potential of the information extraction technique (Text 4), the application of the tree-based representation (Text 5), and the evaluation of the classification requirement technique (Text 6).

Table 7 Results of the Mann–Whitney test.

Text 3 (JAIS_DSR_2014)   
. existing document clustering methods include the vector space model (Salton & McGill, 1983), agglomerative cluster analysis (Walter, Bala, Kulkami, & Pingali, 2008), .

Text 4 (DSS_DSR_2011)

Information extract is capable of extracting important entities of interest from structured texts effectively and efficiently, . [56].

Text 5 (DSS_DSR_2016)

A tree-based representation also has been employed to show the hierarchical relationships among objects, e.g. . [35.41, 51].

Text 6 (JAIS_DSR_2015)

Classifying requirements into distinct categories is a widely accepted way of enriching them [individual requirements] with additional semantics (Casamayor et al., 2010; Cleland-Huang et al., 2007; Vlas & Robinson, 2012).

Another lies in citations to theoretical terminologies. It was found that names of design concepts and artefacts are usually referred to in the DSR writing, which stands in sharp contrast to the IR writing where those of what Blumer (1954) calls sensitizing concepts of social phenomena are often drawn, as exemplified below:

# Text 7 (DSS_DSR_2010)

Most clustering algorithms are based on two popular techniques known as hierarchical and partitional clustering. Hierarchical clustering algorithms organize data into a hierarchical structure . Hierarchical clustering algorithms are mainly classified as agglomerative methods and divisive methods. Many algorithms have been used in this clustering method, for example, CURE [20], BIRCH [51], ROCK [21], CHAMELEON [28], DIANA [29], AUTOCLUST [16] and AMOEBA [15].

Text 8 (IM_IR_2014)

In addition, to better understand the roles of routine reconfiguration, we adopt the conceptualization of “routine as trajectory” [60] as our theoretical lens to investigate the relationships among the components of routines.

In Text 7, the names of prior design artefacts in relation to hierarchical clustering are cited, while the name of the sensitizing concept of the social phenomenon “routine a trajectory” is referred to in Text 8.

The third lies in citations to theoretical propositions.5 Unlike the IR writing where only explanatory propositions are cited, both explanatory and prescriptive ones are frequently referred to in the DSR writing, as in:

Text 9 (IM_IR 2018) Guanxi significantly influences knowledge exchange in several ways [38, 46].

Text 10 (IM_DSR_2016)

In order to identify different perceptions of how collaborative work is carried out, the individual mental models of the collaborating contributors need to be made accessible for alignment [9] [43].

In Text 9, an explanatory proposition is used to demonstrate the causal relationship between guanxi and knowledge exchange. However, in Text 10, a prescriptive proposition is drawn to show the need to make the mental models of the collaborating contributors accessible (an action) to achieve the purpose of the alignment (a goal).

The fourth lies in citations to research acts. The DSR writing was observed to often cite research acts that concern the development and use of design artefacts and methodologies which are absent from the IR writing, as illustrated in Text 11 below:

Text 11 (IM_DSR_ 2017)

Khotimah et al. [32] proposed a TRS [travel recommender system] that extracted data from various social media in Indonesia to provide a user-relate recommendation .. . Chen and Edwards [9] used visual analytics on data sourced from Sina Weibo (the “Chinese Twitter”) to provide destination managers insights ..

As can be seen, two research acts are referred to respectively that are associated with the development of a TRS used to provide user-related recommendations and the application of the technique of visual analytics to offer insights on the effect of travel news on Chinese consumers’ attitudes.

These variations may perhaps be explained by the different epistemological nature of the research inherent in the two types of LRs. As stated, DSR focuses on finding solutions to real-world problems through the building and evaluation of a reallife artefact. This type of research emphasizes that artefact creation must be built on previous scholarship coupled with design theories/concepts relating to the class of IT problems to be addressed, design artefacts that have been developed to solve similar problems, and design methodologies that have been used to develop similar artefacts (Gregor & Hevner, 2013). In particular, a framework composed of explanatory and prescriptive propositions drawn from prior design theories/concepts and empirical studies must be laid down to guide the technological design activities and rules involved in artefact design (Gaß, Koppenhagen, Biegel, Madche, & Muller, 2012; Gregor, 2006). This is done to ensure that new design artefacts are developed based on a sound and robust blueprint supported by design theories/concepts, design methodologies, and design artefacts that have already been previously established and tried by predecessors.

On the other hand, the goal of IR is to gain insights into a phenomenon in the social world from one’s perspective (Klein & Meyer, 1999). Since this social phenomenon is usually elusive, complex, and unfamiliar to readers outside the field of the study of the researcher, it is important to characterize and clarify its nature. To do so necessitates the use of certain concepts as some sort of “linguistic handles”, and these concepts are actually what Blumer (1954) refers to as sensitizing concepts which can be used as background ideas to a form a theoretical lens/framework that shows how the phenomenon will be approached (Charmaz, 2003). One effective way to legitimize the theoretical lens/framework is to use previously established or applied sensitizing concepts and explanatory propositions regarding the phenomenon under study.

# 4.3. Rhetorical functions of the cited ideas in the DSR and IR LRs

In fact, the distinct ideas above do not appear randomly in the two types of LRs. In contrast, they are used on purpose by the writers of the texts. The following two texts discuss and illustrate how some of these ideas are used together with other cited ones in terms of the specific rhetorical functions that they serve in the move-steps of the two types of writing.

# 4.3.1. Rhetorical functions in the DSR LRs

Text 12 is an excerpt from a DSR RA whose study is to design and evaluate a requirement mining system (RMS) using the semi-automatic requirement mining technique. This text serves primarily to review the past literature on the requirement mining technique adopted in the writers’ study.

As can be seen, the writers first describe the process of natural language requirements (NLR) in the topic generalization strategy with sources cited non-integrally for its two different names (see the underlined parts in lines 5 & 6). This is then followed by discussions both on its sub-process with sources cited for its potential (see the underlined part in lines 10–12) and its prescriptive relationship to open source software development (see the underlined part in lines 14–17) and on the nature of systems-supported requirement mining. Subsequently, they proceed to review past research into RMS designs in the review of past research strategy with sources cited integrally for research focus and acts pertaining to non-functional RMS designs and the relevant design techniques and artefacts used (see the underlined parts in lines 29–34). Finally, the writers criticize the past research for its lack of codification and theoretical grounds in the counter claiming strategy and announce how the limitations are addressed in their own study in the announcement of present research strategy.

# 4.3.2. Rhetorical functions in the IR LRs

Text 13 is an extract from an IR RA whose research explores the roles of routine reconfiguration in traditional companies’ ecommerce strategy implementation. This text serves to discuss the sensitizing concept of “routine as trajectory” used in the writers’ study.

[M3 S3B announcement of</td></tr></table></body></html>

As can be seen, the writers first announce the use of the sensitizing concept in their study in the concept description strategy with a source drawn non-integrally for its name (see the underlined part in line 3). Then, they describe how the idea of trajectory was previously defined in the topic generalizations strategy and is defined in their own study in the concept defining strategy with sources referred non-integrally to for its corresponding definitions respectively (see the underlined parts in lines 8–12). Subsequently, they proceed to elaborate on the idea alluded to before in the topic generalizations strategy by discussing how it is suitable to study routine reconfiguration while at the same time defining its three relevant sub-concepts “trajectory projection”, “trajectory scheme”, and “trajectory action” (see lines 11–27) with sources cited non-integrally for the former two corresponding definitions (see the underlined parts in lines $2 3 \& 2 4 .$ ). Finally, they announce the conduct of a case study in relation to the three sub-concepts in the announcement of present research strategy (see lines 31–33).

From the two texts above, we can clearly see that a wide range of ideas are cited, which not only relate closely to the fields of the research of the citing writers, but also to the move-steps of their LRs. More importantly, these ideas are not simply used to show the readers their knowledge of their own fields of study and their mastery of citation skills; but they also have specific ends to serve therein. For example, while the cited terminologies in the two texts function as Thompson & Tribble’s (2001) “naming citations”, the theoretical one in the concept description strategy of Text 13 acts as Petri-c’s (2007) “statement of use” citation in the form of a shell noun (Schmid, 2000) or signaling noun (Flowerdew, 2003) demonstrating to the readers that the focus of the subsequent discussion of the text is on the cited concept of routine as trajectory used in the writer’s study. This stands in sharp contrast to the topic generalizations strategy of Text 12 where no discussion is provided on the two cited methodological ones: requirement elicitation and analysis. One possible reason for this is that they are peripheral to the writers’ research; elaborating will only distract the readers’ attention to the main arguments made in their text, thereby directing them to consult the original sources for more details. This strategy bears a striking resemblance to the “refer to further reading” and “signposting” citation functions found by Frost (1979) and Harwood (2009) respectively.

On the other hand, the citations to the research focus and acts regarding non-functional RMS designs and the relevant design techniques and artefacts in the review of past research strategy of Text 12 help the writers to pave the way for the discussion of the drawbacks of the existing RMS designs and techniques in its counter-claiming strategy while at the same time serving as empirical evidence to corroborate it. This act is similar to Harwood’s (2009) “support” or Mansourizadeh & Ahmad’s (2011) “supporting” citation function of providing empirical support or justification for the claims or arguments made. Likewise, the citation to the definition of the concept of trajectory in the topic generalizations strategy of Text 13 facilitates the adaptation of the definition used in the writer’s research in its concept defining strategy while simultaneously establishing a linkage between them. This corresponds to Harwood’s (2009) tying citation function of aligning a citing author with a specific school of thought/disciplinary tradition. In particular, the direct quotation of the definition of the concept of trajectory in the review of past research strategy of Text 13 also validates and legitimizes its use in the writers’ study, which echoes Petri-c’s (2007) “Application” citation function of drawing upon a certain argument, concept, term, procedure from other cited work for the citing writer’s own purpose. Finally, the citations both to the potential of the technique of requirement identification and its relevant prescriptive proposition in the topic generalizations strategy of Text 12 and to the definitions of the sub-concepts of trajectory in the topic generalizations strategy of Text 13 enable the writers to reduce the methodological and conceptual ambiguity of the sub-process of requirement mining and the concept of routine as trajectory in question respectively, and, in turn, make the methodological and theoretical frameworks being developed in the writers’ LRs much easier for the readers to understand and comparable to others’ work as well as reusable. This strategy resembles Harwood’s (2009) “building” citation function of using “sources’ methods and ideas as foundations that [the citing authors] will develop further” (p.509).

It is important to note here that the two texts discussed above are not intended to show the ‘correct’ types of ideas that should be cited from prior sources. On the contrary, they are intended to demonstrate that the cited ideas are used selectively and purposefully to assist the writers in achieving certain rhetorical functions in the different move-steps of their LRs like those just discussed above.

# 5. Conclusions

# 5.1. Summary and contributions

This paper has reported on a comparative semantic study of citations in LRs in IS RAs following the DSR and IR paradigms. In summary, the study identified four types of citations – theoretical, research, methodological, and non-epistemicallyframed, which varied quantitatively and qualitatively between the two types of LRs. While most of the identified cited ideas appear much more frequently in Move 1 than in Moves 2 and 3, those that denote theoretical and empirical evaluations occur much more often in Moves 2 than in Moves 1 and 3. The DSR writing also tends to cite prescriptive propositions, design concepts, design artefacts, and artefact design methods which are absent from the IR writing where explanatory propositions and sensitizing concepts of social phenomena are referred to.

A comparison of the findings of the current study with those of Chan & Kwan (2022) study of citations in the LRs of IS RAs following the BSR paradigm reveals similarities and differences. While both studies consistently found that Move 1 cites much more often than Moves 2 and 3 with theoretical and research citations used more frequently than non-epistemically framed ones, two important differences were observed. The first lies in the citation distributions in Move 1. Compared with the DSR and IR writing, the BSR writing cites more Definition and Proposition in the topic generalizations strategy and Finding in the review of past research strategy. The second lies in the specific ideas referred to in Terminology, Aim/Focus, and Finding citations. Names of constructs of behavioral phemenona, research focuses and findings couched in terms of causal/associative relationships show up more frequently in the BSR writing than in the DSR and IR writing. These variations, again, can be ascribed to the epistemological nature of the BSR inquiry. That is, precise naming and definitions of constructs are required for accurate measurement of hypotheses, which makes the BSR writers rely on previous literature for well-defined or well tested constructs while at the same time previous findings couched in relationships between constructs are often the main sources of inspirations that the writers draw on to inform the development of their own hypotheses (Jaccard & Jacoby, 2010; Shoemaker et al., 2004). However, neither of these cited ideas is necessary in the DSR and IR writing where hypothesis development and testing is not the main goal of inquiry. The differences between the two studies add further evidence that what to cite is often shaped and constrained by not only rhetorical moves but also research paradigms.

This study has contributed significantly to the existing EAP/ESP literature in three respects: First, Chan & Kwan (2022) typology adopted in this study has been expanded to capture methodological citations that refer to different aspects of artefact design methodologies. Second, our understanding has been advanced of the move-step relatedness of citations in LRs. Third, the effectiveness has been demonstrated of linking source use to rhetorical moves and research paradigms for analysis of citations at the move and intra-disciplinary levels.

# 5.2. Pedagogical implications

The study provides pedagogical insights into the teaching of citation. The findings of this study show that much of what is cited tends to relate to the move-steps of the writers’ writing and the epistemological nature of their research. In that regard, students need to be made aware of how to cite source ideas in a selective and purposive way, and in order to achieve this, the typology developed and the sample texts provided in this study could be used as an instructional guide. For example, with the help of them, teachers could discuss with students the extent to which the cited ideas and their rhetorical functions might vary across the different move-steps of LRs of RAs following distinct paradigms. Explicit discussion on these variations will make students aware of not only how the types of ideas that are cited are shaped and constrained by the structural patterns of a research text and the epistemological nature of a research study but also how they help to achieve certain rhetorical ends in the different parts of the LRs that they are producing. On the other hand, citing involves some kind of re-contextualization (Chan & Kwan, 2022). At this point, teachers need to demonstrate to students how writers appropriate original ideas from prior sources and repackage them for certain purposes in their own writing. There are some guiding questions that they could ask students about this:

Where do the source and cited ideas occur in the cited and citing texts respectively?   
Is there any part of the source idea dropped when moved from the cited text to the citing text? If yes, what specific part(s) of the idea is/are removed?   
Does the cited idea in the citing text contain both the same structural form and the same lexical items and serve the same purpose as the source idea in the original text? If no, what are the possible reasons for such variations?

Nevertheless, one caveat to note here about teaching re-contextualization is that inappropriate citation practices may lead to ‘citation diversion’ (Greenberg, 2009), which means ‘citing content but altering its meaning in a manner that diverts its implications” (p.3). It is therefore necessary for teachers to remind students to consult original sources as much as possible and engage critically with what they read before re-contextualizing particular ideas from the source texts to their own writing.

# 5.3. Limitations and future research

Finally, there are limitations to the present study. One is that the study is restricted to the semantic analysis of source ideas in LRs of two IS research traditions (DSR and IR), and accordingly the findings of the study are not necessarily generalizable to other IS research traditions (e.g., critical research or meta-analyses) or pardigms in other disciplines. Future studies could be conducted to validate the current findings in other research or disciplinary contexts. Another limitation is that only the LRs in RAs were analyzed and therefore the findings of the study are applicable to these texts only. Future research could be conducted to investigate the extent to which the findings could be applied to other RA sections such as Introduction, Methodology, and Discussion. Furthermore, the development of the semantic typology of citation content in this study was based on identification and analysis of the types of words and phrases cited and the types of meanings they represent. Future research could be done using other approaches such as identifying the epistemic levels of cited claims ranging from general theoretical claims to data-pointing ones and to personal and other meta-discoursal ones (see Kelly & Bazerman, 2003; Kelly & Takao, 2002) or their ideational metafunction such as processes (material, mental, existential), participants (e.g., animate or inanimate actors) and circumstances (location, cause, comparison) (see Halliday, 1985). Finally, only 60 LRs were examined. This small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings of the study. As a result, future studies could include a relatively larger sample size that allows for greater generalizability of the findings generated in the current investigation.

Researchers have used bipartite networks for various cluster analysis applications ... Beeferman and Berger (2ooo) use bipartite graphs for clustering queries.

Several studies have also attempted to address the social context of IOS adoption. .. Teo et al. (2003) adopt the institutional theory to investigate the adoption of a financial EDI in Singapore.   
Research has examined social targeting or behavioral targeting ... In the area of audience selection. Provost et al. (2009) [their study] show that user profiles can be built from co-visitation patterns of social network pages.   
Han et al. (2012) [their research] .. report that the degree of openness of the OIAs [open innovation alliances] is significantly associated with the amount of returns accruing to the partnering firms. Previous reviews of the Iss literature have revealed both a lack of research into power and politics and that ISS studies in security or management journals are rare, with a need for more research in these areas (Dhillon and Backhouse 2001; Jasperson et al., 2002; Keen 1981; Siponen and Willison 2007) Despite this evidence [supply chain integration has a positive impact on operational performance] studies have found inconclusive and, sometimes, contradictory results (e.g. [29,33,114]).   
[Finding] Through their meta-analysis they found that DsS need separate theory to explain and predict the outcomes of Dss [decision support system] development and use. [Claim] Further, they argued that theory developed in one form of DsS should apply to others, both to current and future management support approaches ([15], p. 603).   
[Evaluation] Previous review quality research has not addressed the issue of review spams, primarily because review spam detection is a very complex problem addressed in a separate research area known as review spam research [35], [50]. [Claim] However, some researchers argue that addressing review spams in review quality research improves its rigor and relevance [68] since review spams known as fake reviews are detrimental to review quality.   
In 2005 the saving rate in the US sank to $0 . 5 \%$ [ 1 5 ] .   
In particular, distributed software proj ects experience numerous management challenges, including unclear task coupling ( Sarker & Sahay, 2004 ; Sakthivel, 2005 ), poor process alignment ( Herbsleb & Moitra, 2001), differing work cultures (Dube & Pare, 2001; Krishna et al., 2004) and inhibited communication capabilities (Herbsleb & Mockus, 2003; Bjorn & Ngwenyama, 2009),   
We can see evidence of success with such orientation [orienting a design perspective to the local context) in a number of past initiatives. For example, in e-government initiatives in Kyrgyzstan and Chile, userfriendly e-services were provided according to indigenous priorities (UN, 2004).   
During the 2007 California wildfires, the public turned to social media to seek event updates that were contributed to by the community on the ground due to the slow response of traditional media and officials (Sutton, Palen, & Shklovski, 2008).   
On the other hand, for a collection of text-based documents, existing document clustering methods include the vector space model (Salton & McGill, 1983), agglomerative cluster analysis (Walter, Bala Kulkarni, & Pingali, 2008), and projection-based methods, including the least squares approximation (Kim & Park, 2008).   
Information extraction [a text mining method] is capable of extracting important entities of interest from structured texts effectively and efficiently, e.g., names of individuals or locations [56].

Network visualizations [a data visualization method] have been used to help identify global supply network risks [20], examine criminal networks [37], and understand the evolution of digital communication networks [38].

Node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices are the preferred visualization method for network and graph data [14].
