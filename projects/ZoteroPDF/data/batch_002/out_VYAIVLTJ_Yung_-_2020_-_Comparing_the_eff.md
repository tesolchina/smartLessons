This study compares the teaching effectiveness of cram school tutors and schoolteachers of English based on the perceptions of senior secondary students in Hong Kong. It adopts a sequential mixed-methods approach. The result from the online survey $\mathrm { ( N } = 4 7 7 )$ ) indicates that tutors are perceived to be more effective than schoolteachers in all identified aspects of effective teaching. However, the qualitative data from focus group interviews $ { \mathrm { ( n = 6 4 } }$ ) reveals a more complex picture. By problematising students’ perceptions with reference to the wider social, cultural and educational context, three themes were generated: (1) students’ utilitarian learning orientations in an examination-oriented system, (2) the commodification of education in a consumer culture, and (3) students’ immediate psychological needs in the process of learning. This study sheds light on the complex relationship between private tutoring and mainstream schooling and offers implications for policymaking and teaching in the private and mainstream sectors.

# 1. Introduction

Around the globe, a significant number of students receive private tutoring. In many Asian countries such as Bangladesh, China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand, over half of secondary school students receive some type of private tutoring (see Bray and Lykins, 2012). Other non-Asian countries such as those in Africa, Australasia, North America and Europe have also witnessed a rapid growth in students’ tutoring participation (see, e.g., Buchmann et al., 2010; Pearce et al., 2018; Silova, 2010; Sriprakash et al., 2016; Šťastný, 2017). Private tutoring can be defined as the fee-paying services students access outside regular school hours to supplement their formal school learning of academic subjects (Bray, 2009; Yung and Bray, 2017). It carries the metaphor of “shadow education” because it mimics and changes its shape according to the mainstream school curriculum (Bray, 2009; Stevenson and Baker, 1992). Private tutoring can be operated via oneto-one, small group and online modes (see Yung and Bray, 2017). The most prominent in many Asian contexts is lecture-type tutoring in socalled cram schools run by large tutorial companies (Chung, 2013; de Castro and de Guzman, 2014; Yung, 2019). Tutors often promote themselves and their courses through advertisements and tutorial websites (Kozar, 2015; Šťastný, 2017; Yung and Yuan, 2018), making private tutoring more visible and widespread.

Private tutoring has attracted a great deal of attention in education research in recent years due to its significant impact on policy making as well as teaching and learning in mainstream schooling. To date, many studies have investigated its patterns, intensity and scale in various contexts (see, e.g., Bray, 2009; Mahmud and Kenayathulla, 2018; Pearce et al., 2018; Silova, 2009). These studies tend to identify policy implications concerning the privatisation of education and its exacerbation of social inequality (e.g., Bray and Kwo, 2014; Matsuoka, 2018; Sobhy, 2012; Šťastný, 2017). Bray and Lykins (2012, p. 71) suggest that “enough is known about the broad outlines” and “detailed research would reveal the features more clearly.” In this regard, an increasing number of studies have focused on various issues such as the washback effect of private tutoring on mainstream schooling (e.g., Bhorkar and Bray, 2018; Jheng, 2015; Park et al., 2016) and its impact on the lives of various stakeholders such as schoolteachers, tutors, students and parents (e.g., Kobakhidze, 2018; Loyalka and Zakharov, 2016; Matsuoka, 2018; Sriprakash et al., 2016; Trent, 2016). Fewer studies have investigated how students perceive the teaching effectiveness of tutors compared to that of schoolteachers. This is an important aspect for investigation because perceptions drive behaviour and students’ learning is essentially influenced by their attendance in tutorial classes which tend to shadow the mainstream. However, students evaluate tutors and schoolteachers with their own criteria, and their perceptions can be framed by the wider educational context in which they are situated. Therefore, students’ perceptions need to be analysed critically in order to understand how and why tutors or schoolteachers are considered more effective than the other and to uncover the complex relationships between private tutoring and mainstream schooling.

This study compares students’ perceived effectiveness of tutors and of schoolteachers from a critical perspective. Specifically, it problematises secondary school students’ perceptions of how cram school tutors and schoolteachers help them learn English within an educational structure dominated by high-stakes testing and private tutoring. The paper commences with a critical review of the literature conceptualising teaching effectiveness. It then describes the context of cram schools and mainstream schools in Hong Kong and the research methods used in the study. The findings of this study are then presented and critically discussed before identifying policy and pedagogical implications relevant to Hong Kong and the wider international context.

# 2. Conceptualising teaching effectiveness: A critical perspective

The specification of teaching effectiveness varies across contexts and cultures, and it is thus difficult to identify a set of objective criteria for evaluation (Farrell, 2015; Stronge, 2018). Ideally, schoolteachers are expected to guide their students to meet the aims of education. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) identified the four pillars of education – learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live together (Delors et al., 1996; UNESCO, 2015). When education reforms worldwide move in this direction, schoolteachers play a key role in helping their students become well-balanced individuals and cultivate the personal and intellectual qualities for the twenty-first century such as critical thinking, creativity, independence (e.g., self-regulation) and communication skills (i.e., language competence) (Cheng, 2015). Farrell (2015) argues that effective teachers should also motivate students and inspire their curiosity for learning (see also Muijs and Reynolds, 2018).

In reality, however, schoolteachers are constrained by social norms which are dominated by performance goals. They are increasingly held accountable for students’ achievements, and the main criterion for teaching effectiveness depends on students’ scores in standardised tests. In the United States, for example, the No Child Left Behind policy has changed the dynamic of teaching and learning in mainstream schools and made schoolteachers resort to teaching to the test (Au, 2009; von der Embse et al., 2016). In many Asian countries, particularly those in Confucian-heritage settings such as Hong Kong, many students prefer their schoolteachers to be examination-oriented and to drill them with test-taking strategies (Carless, 2011; Watkins, 2009). If their schoolteachers are not examination-oriented enough, students may consider them ineffective and thus seek help from private tutors (e.g., Dang, 2007; Hamid et al., 2009; Yung, 2015).

Some studies have attempted to examine the effectiveness of private tutoring based on students’ school grades and performance on public examinations (e.g., Kuan, 2011; Liu, 2012; Zhang, 2013), but results have been inconclusive. Zhan et al. (2013) argue that research that links tutoring with academic achievement is “not robust” and “there are many ways in which tutoring can be ‘effective,’ and evaluation criteria might fit the motivations of the consumers” (p. 496). In this regard, they explored Grade 9 and Grade 12 students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of private tutoring in Hong Kong. Based on interviews with 101 students, they found that many students complained about the lack of support from schoolteachers in providing examination skills and appreciated tutors’ help with solving learning difficulties and examination preparation. Using the same sample, Kwo and Bray (2014) further compared schoolteachers’ pedagogical styles with tutors’ and students’ learning orientations at school with those in tutoring. They found that schoolteachers and tutors are perceived to be effective in different ways; with the former focusing on teaching the content required in the official curriculum, meeting students’ deep learning needs and paying holistic attention to students’ personal growth; while the latter teaching skills to help pass examinations, thus meeting students’ immediate learning needs and focusing narrowly on academic subjects. The findings reveal that teaching effectiveness can be based on students’ diverse expectations and attitudes to learning in different contexts.

A gap in previous studies is that evaluation of the effectiveness of schoolteachers and tutors was mainly provided by students enrolled in a wide range of subjects and modes of tutoring. This can be problematic and complicate the findings because the teaching strategies of tutors in lecture-type tutoring may be different from those in one-to-one or small group tutoring. The learning content required in different subjects also varies, leading to different evaluation criteria. In this regard, the present study focuses on students’ learning in one type of tutoring and in a specific subject. Lecture-type tutoring in cram schools was chosen because it is typically the most prominent type of tutoring in many places. Its class size and teaching strategies are also more comparable to those in the mainstream. Zhan et al. (2013) suggest that lecture-type tutoring shows a supply-driven feature and needs “further research concerning its relationship with students’ preferred learning styles” (p. 507). English was selected because it is the most heavily enrolled subject in tutoring in many parts of the world (e.g., Dierkes, 2010 in Japan; Ireson and Rushforth, 2011 in England; Kwok, 2010 in China; Mahmud and Kenayathulla, 2018 in Bangladesh; Park et al., 2011 in South Korea; Zhan et al., 2013 in Hong Kong). Moreover, learning a language is different from learning other subjects due to the strong social nature of language. It involves far more than learning skills or a system of rules (Williams and Burden, 1997). Therefore, focusing on English learning in tutoring is likely to yield different findings from tutoring in other subjects.

Considering that effective teaching is a “messy” notion reconfigured within a structure of standardised knowledge and accountability (Mooney Simmie et al., 2019), this study analyses students’ perceptions from a critical perspective to unveil how education policies and practices in the larger social context shape human consciousness. Beyer (2001) argues that critical perspectives are valuable in uncovering hidden realities and examining the choices people make and what these are linked to. By problematising students’ voices, researchers, educators and policymakers can understand how various factors within social contexts affect students’ perceptions of teaching effectiveness. The study thus aims to address the following research questions:

(1) How do secondary school students compare the effectiveness of cram school tutors and schoolteachers in helping them learn English?   
(2) What factors lie behind secondary school students’ perceptions when they compare the teaching effectiveness of cram school tutors and schoolteachers?

# 3. The study

This study is part of a larger-scale, year-long mixed-methods study exploring Hong Kong senior secondary students’ experiences in cram schools (see Yung, 2016, 2019). It adopted an explanatory sequential approach with a two-phase procedure (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2018). Data were collected through an online survey and focus group interviews with the students. Other data collected throughout the year in the larger study (e.g., interviews with tutors and schoolteachers, classroom observations in the cram schools) facilitated more in-depth, multifaceted and critical understanding of the students’ responses for this paper.

# 3.1. The research context

The study was situated in Hong Kong, a context which has experienced structural education reform emphasising learning through experience and promoting a culture of “learning to learn” in recent years (Education Commission, 2000). The new curriculum has shifted from transmission of knowledge and an over-emphasis on academic studies to learning how to learn and focusing on students’ whole-person development. The reform is also a response to the previous system which heavily emphasised students’ performance in public examinations (see also Tan, 2005). In the English language curriculum, as stipulated in the Curriculum and Assessment Guide (Curriculum Development Council & Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2007/2015), schoolteachers are expected to enhance students’ English proficiency and their confidence in using English for communication in daily life, develop their interest in English and motivation to learn, increase their ability to learn independently and identify their own English competence, and help them understand foreign cultures and solve learning difficulties.

Despite the reform initiative, many students still flock to private tutoring institutions, most probably due to their anxiety regarding their performance in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE), the results of which determine whether secondary students can be admitted to a higher education programme (Yung and Bray, 2017). Hong Kong has a high enrolment rate for private tutoring compared with other East Asian jurisdictions (see Bray and Lykins, 2012). According to the survey results in the study by Zhan et al. (2013), among 1646 Secondary Three and Secondary Six students in 16 Hong Kong secondary schools, $5 3 . 8 ~ \%$ and $7 1 . 8 ~ \%$ respectively reported that they had received private tutoring within the previous 12 months. Their study also showed that among 657 Secondary Six private tutoring participants, $5 4 . 2 ~ \%$ enrolled in live lecture-style classes and $6 1 . 7 ~ \%$ in video-recorded lecture-style classes in cram schools. These cram schools often promote their tutors as “stars” or “kings and queens” who are experts in teaching examination skills (Koh, 2014; Yung and Yuan, 2018). As in many other places, the subject in greatest demand is English $( 7 2 . 4 \%$ for Secondary Six students) (Zhan et al., 2013), mainly because it is a compulsory subject in the school curriculum and it has a significant status associated with academic success and career advancement (Yung, 2015).

# 3.2. Participants and sampling

The study adopted purposeful sampling. Unlike other studies which recruited participants from mainstream schools, this study collected data in 16 cram schools operated by one of the largest tutorial companies in Hong Kong (Synovate, 2011). Recruiting participants in this setting ensured a broadly homogenous sample group who all experienced this type of tutoring despite their diverse backgrounds and other out-of-school learning experiences. An invitation was distributed to students in Secondary Six classes near the end the academic year. It had a QR code for interested tutees to scan using their mobile devices in order to access the survey online. It also invited the students to participate in the focus group interview.

A total of 477 students (247 males and 230 females) participated in the survey. They came from a wide range of schools and attended Secondary Six tutorial courses for the local curriculum in different parts of Hong Kong. More than half $( 5 8 ~ \% )$ had subscribed to the tutorial courses for the whole academic year (from September to April). The majority $( 7 0 \% )$ enrolled in video-recorded classes and the rest in liveteaching ones. Their self-efficacy of English standard varied, with a mean of 3.4 (neutral) based on a scale of 1 (very bad) to 6 (very good). Their target in HKDSE English language was Level 4.25 on average, which is roughly equivalent to Band 6.5 in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).1

Among the survey respondents, 244 left their email addresses indicating their intention to participate in the focus group interviews. An email was sent to the “applicants” with a link to a website where they could sign up for an interview time slot on a first-come-first-served basis. All the 72 time slots were filled up to form 18 groups. Eight students did not turn up. In the end, 64 students participated in the focus group interview in 18 groups of three to four. The interviewees shared generally the same characteristics as the student population in the survey. They are representative in that they had a comprehensive range of English proficiency, self-efficacy, goals, school background and experiences of tutoring (e.g., length and mode).

# 3.3. Data collection

A survey was administered online in the first phase. The questions were informed by the conceptualisation of teaching effectiveness based on the literature and curriculum documents as well as the ongoing dialogue with the tutors, schoolteachers and students who participated in the larger study throughout the first half of the year (Yung, 2016). A 10-item questionnaire was developed to measure the degree to which tutors and schoolteachers can help students’ English learning in various aspects (see Appendix I in Supplementary material). Responses were on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Some background information of the participants such as gender, the periods they enrolled in tutorial classes and their perceived current English standard were also included. The questionnaire was written in Chinese, the participants’ first language. The survey was promoted by four tutors or their teaching assistants in their classes in the last month of tutorial courses before the HKDSE. It took the participants approximately ten minutes to complete the survey.

In the second phase, focus group interviews were conducted for the participants to follow-up and explain the survey results. The interviews elicited multiple meanings and generated deeper understanding of the quantitative data from the participants (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2018). All interviews were conducted in Chinese. Each interview lasted for 30 to 60 minutes.

# 3.4. Data analysis

For the quantitative data, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was first conducted to evaluate the factor structure of the scale so as to reduce the number of variables for overall comparison. Cronbach’s alpha was used to evaluate its internal consistency or reliability. An independent t-test was then conducted to identify any rating differences between male and female participants. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate the relations between students’ views on tutors and schoolteachers. A paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare the students’ rating of tutors and schoolteachers. The effect size was evaluated using Cohen’s d. In addition, a paired-sample t-test per item of the scale was conducted to further explore the subtle differences in various aspects.

The interview data were systematically coded and analysed using NVivo 12. Excerpts which illustrate and exemplify each item in the questionnaire were categorised into relevant nodes. Based on the initial nodes, excerpts pertaining to the items with medium to large effect size $[ \mathbf { d } \geq 0 . 5 $ ) were further identified. The selected excerpts were translated and used as the primary source of critical analysis. To problematise the participants’ reported perceptions, connections were constantly drawn with the data collected through the interviews with tutors and schoolteachers and classroom observations throughout the year in the larger study. As recommended by Mauthner and Doucet (2003), there were critically reflexive dialogues between the researcher and two academics in education to challenge the representations of students’ voices by taking into account education policies and practices in the wider social context. The critical analysis was a hermeneutic process which involved the interpretation of the way the participants explained their perceptions. This allowed the researcher to reflect upon what it means for the participants to have made certain claims and expressed certain feelings in a particular situation at a particular time (Larkin et al., 2006).

# 4. Tutors perceived to be more effective than schoolteachers

Regarding the PCA, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.914 and 0.938 respectively for the scale of tutors and schoolteachers, which was above the recommended value of 0.6. The Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant for both scales $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 4 5 ) = 2 0 9 4 . 5 5$ and 2740.93 respectively, $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1 $ ). Both indicators suggested that the set of items were adequate for factor analysis. Initial eigen values indicated that the first factor of both scales explained $5 1 . 5 ~ \%$ and $5 9 . 0 ~ \%$ of the variance respectively, while the second factor had less than 1 eigen value. All the communalities (Table 1) of both scales were above 0.3 except one item (Tutors: understand foreign cultures, community $= 0 . 2 9$ ). The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.891 and 0.921 respectively for the scale of tutors and schoolteachers, indicating high internal consistency of the ten items. No substantial increases in alpha for both scales could be achieved by eliminating any items. Given these overall indicators, one underlying factor, namely “students’ perceived effectiveness of tutors and schoolteachers”, was deemed to be suitable to capture all the ten aspects. The composite scores were then computed for further evaluation.

There was no correlation between students’ perceived effectiveness of tutors and that of schoolteachers $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 0 4 9$ , $\mathrm { p } = 0 . 2 8 7 $ ), suggesting that students rated tutors and schoolteachers as separate entities. Independent t-test showed that there was no difference in students’ perceived effectiveness of both tutors and schoolteachers between male (Tutors: $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 8 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 1$ ; Teachers: $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 3 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 0 \mathrm { ) }$ and female (Tutors: $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 8 9$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 4 4$ ; Teachers: $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 3 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 5 )$ ; Tutors: $\ t ( 4 7 5 ) = - 0 . 4 2$ , $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 6 7 5$ ; Teachers: $\ t ( 4 7 5 ) = - 0 . 5 4$ , ${ \tt p } = 0 . 5 9$ . Paired-sample t-test revealed a significant difference $( \mathrm { t } ( 4 7 6 ) = 1 6 . 1 0$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ) in students’ perceived effectiveness between tutors $( \mathbf { M } = 2 . 8 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 4 8 )$ and schoolteachers $( \mathrm { M } = 2 . 3 4 $ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 8 $ ), and the effect size was close to large (Cohen’s $\mathsf { d } = 0 . 7 3 7 \mathrm { . }$ ). This indicates that students perceived tutors to be substantively more effective than schoolteachers overall.

Item-wise, descriptive statistics show that the students rated tutors higher than schoolteachers in all ten items (Fig. 1). Based on the pairedsample t-test per item, such differences in rating were statistically significant $( \mathbf { p } \ < \ 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ) for all items (Table 2). The effect size ranged from small $\dot { \mathrm { \bf d } } = 0 . 2 7 4 )$ to large $\mathbf { \vec { d } } = 1 . 0 1 2 \mathbf { \vec { \mathbf { \alpha } } }$ ). Items with medium effect size or above $\mathrm { ( d } \geq 0 . 5$ ) included whether they can help students (1) learn examination skills, (2) increase confidence in taking examinations, (3)

increase learning motivation, (4) increase independent learning ability, (5) like English, and (6) enhance English proficiency.

# 5. Problematising students’ perceptions

The quantitative data show that tutors were perceived to be significantly more effective than schoolteachers in all ten identified aspects. This result is somewhat surprising because previous studies have tended to suggest that tutors and schoolteachers play different roles, with tutors focusing narrowly on examination preparation and schoolteachers concentrating more on students’ all-round development (e.g., Kwo and Bray, 2014; Yung, 2015). It is also unexpected that tutors were rated higher than schoolteachers even in the areas identified in the official curriculum document such as enhancing students’ English proficiency, their interest in the language and independent learning ability (Curriculum Development Council & Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2007/2015). However, the qualitative data reveal a more complex picture. By problematising the students’ perceptions with reference to the wider social, cultural and educational context, three themes emerged: (1) students’ utilitarian learning orientations in an examination-oriented system, (2) the commodification of education in a consumer culture, and (3) students’ immediate psychological needs in the process of learning.

# 5.1. Utilitarian learning orientations

The participants considered tutors substantially more effective than schoolteachers in aspects concerning examination preparation (i.e., learning examination skills and increasing confidence in taking examinations). They explained that tutors analysed past examination papers and examiners’ reports to identify trends and popular question types, while “schoolteachers usually teach everything” (S4, FG16). This agrees with the observation in Kwo and Bray’s (2014) study showing tutors’ “selective focus” on examinations compared to schoolteachers’ “comprehensive coverage of the curriculum” (p. 409). However, many participants in this study indicated that during Secondary Six, their schoolteachers also became examination-oriented, but tutors were comparatively more able to teach them test-taking techniques in a quick and systematic way:

S1: Tutors can tell you how to use a skill in a very logical way, but teachers are like, “you just need to follow the instructions” […] When you hear that, you don’t know what you should do. S2: That means teachers do not present clearly. S1: Tutors make the skills very explicit, but teachers are just like “this is obviously the answer”. S2: They know the answer, but they are not able to explain. S4: They just check the answers without much explanation. (FG 8)

The participants added that tutors were “really competent in summarising main points” and they could “put all the good things into one piece of note” (S2, FG18). In contrast, the content schoolteachers taught was “scattered without a system for students to follow” (S3, FG11). The pace of teaching at school was also perceived to be slow compared to the “cramming” style of tutors’ teaching, as one participant emphasised:

When my teacher asked us to do exam papers, she could spend two whole lessons just talking about the reading passage. Tutors would have taught us a lot of what was needed in the exam. (S1, FG 11)

Moreover, the participants pointed out that tutors teach examination skills with the support of data and examples from the examination authority, making their teaching content more convincing:

Fig. 1. Students’ comparison of tutors and schoolteachers based on descriptive statistics.

S3: Tutors justify why they discuss such examples. They would say many candidates made this mistake, so we should not fall into this trap. But schoolteachers usually do not support their teaching with data or evidence, so their teaching tends to be superficial.

S1: Also, tutors present in a very convincing way. Immediately after teaching an exam skill, like when you see this keyword, you should choose “yes”, they ask you to apply the skill to a question, and you get it correct. This largely increases my confidence in taking the HKDSE. (FG 3)

The excerpts above reveal students’ utilitarian (i.e., functional and instrumental) learning orientations reflected in their demand for explicit, quick and applicable test-taking techniques. It is understandable that students perceive the need to prepare for the public examination in an education system where academic performance matters as examination results determine students’ future. However, what needs to be pondered is whether such test-taking techniques are really helpful or “magical” (Koh, 2014). Students may have dichotomised genuine learning and examination preparation and may not believe that merely mastering the language would lead them to better performance in the public examination. A tension observed is that even though schoolteachers attempt to be examination-oriented, students still perceived tutors as more effective or, as Zhan et al. (2013, p. 505) put, more “knowledgeable” and “supportive” regarding examination preparation. They explained that “since cram school tutors have many students across Hong Kong, they understand the level of students in the region, unlike schoolteachers who usually only know the standard of their students in one school” (S2, FG4). This made the participants feel more assured and confident in using the tutors’ skills. The tutors’ “visible pedagogical work” (Sriprakash et al., 2016) and “evidence” of applying the test-taking techniques in past examination questions seem to have convinced the students to consider tutors more effective than schoolteachers.

With students’ utilitarian learning orientations, one contextual constraint for schoolteachers is that they, at least from the official perspective, are not supposed to narrowly focus on preparing students for taking examinations due to their “whole-person development” curriculum mission. In cram schools, on the other hand, examination drilling becomes legitimate. Tutors therefore can solely focus on helping students prepare for the public examination. Many tutors hire a team of teaching assistants to generate examination materials and strategies. Some participants observed:

S2: Tutors usually work as a team to search for information and prepare materials related to the exam, like different skills for different types of questions. This is the effort of the whole team. Our teachers’ work is very tough. They need to teach, mark assignments and exam papers, and they need to handle school administrative stuff, so they don’t have time to do something exclusively for the exam.

I: Do you guys agree?

S1: Yes.

S3: Teachers are very busy. (FG 1)

Tutors are free to devote time and resources to one specific task while schoolteachers have a much broader role in schools. This may have given an impression to the students that schoolteachers are usually busy and do not have enough time to prepare them for the public examination which most students prioritise. In a worse case, schoolteachers may be perceived to be less hardworking than tutors, as one of the participants explained:

My tutor said that school is a place without competition, and no competition means no improvement. But in the tutorial industry, everyone wants to make more money and gain better reputation, so tutors need to equip themselves and provide their students with the best skills. Schoolteachers tend to be lazier, and sometimes they don’t care much about exams. After all, tutors are more exam-oriented, and teachers sometimes just play games in class and lessons are relaxing. (S1, FG 13)

This excerpt reveals a serious criticism of schoolteachers from the participant, possibly also further influenced by what the tutor has said. This student considered the non-examination-oriented class activities meaningless and attributed this to schoolteachers’ job security. A few participants further elaborated that tutors are usually more hardworking than schoolteachers because tutors’ salary is based on their number of students, while teachers have a fixed salary. Tutors are accordingly seen as more willing than schoolteachers to make an effort to develop test-taking strategies and enhance their students’ examination performance.

# 5.2. Commodification of education

Some students considered tutors more “professional” and “knowledgeable” in teaching and tended to trust tutors more than schoolteachers because tutors promote their qualifications through advertisements but schoolteachers do not:

S4: I think tutors are more reliable than schoolteachers.

I: Why is that?

S4: We tend to think people outside are better. They show their “first honour” but we can’t see our schoolteachers’ qualifications. (FG 3)

S3: Our schoolteachers may be very competent, but they don’t show their qualifications. We can see tutors’ qualifications very easily. This at least guarantees something. (FG 10)

In their profiles, many tutors boast of having been markers or examiners for the examination authority. They also state how useful their test-taking techniques are and how many of their tutees got outstanding results in public examinations (see Yung and Yuan, 2018). Such marketing strategies make tutors appear to be more trustworthy and raise students’ confidence on them. This somehow reveals how students are manipulated by the “pedagogy of persuasion” adopted by tutors whose messages can appeal to most students who tend to trust “authority” and are ready to “buy” quick solutions to make life simpler and easier for them. Students are like customers who choose their tutors as products based on their “catalogues”. The participants’ explanation of why tutors were perceived to be more effective than schoolteachers reflects their consumer mindset and how education is commodified.

When explaining why tutors were more able than schoolteachers to increase their independent learning ability, many participants referred to the abundant resources provided by tutors which they could select for revision:

S1: The tutor didn’t say which part we needed to revise, but they gave us a lot of materials. Actually, in tutorial class, you only learnt some of the skills he taught, and you would need to go home and try to apply the skills in order to master them. This is already a kind of independent learning.

I: Right! What do others think?

S4: Same!

I: That means you guys also think it is a kind of independent learning?

S4: Like what she said, when the tutor gave us the materials, we needed to understand how to use them, although he gave us some directions.

S1: You needed to choose. You shouldn’t just follow everything. There were many methods, and you needed to pick one that was suitable to you.

S4: Yes, you needed to learn how to select suitable materials for yourself. (FG 12)

The participants tended to think that schoolteachers were less able to enhance their independent learning ability because “in school, you were not given that many English learning resources” (S3, FG 11). Also, they lamented that they were often instructed to do in-class tasks and homework without any choice at school. On the other hand, learning was perceived to be independent in cram schools since the tutees, to some extent, could regulate their own learning by selecting suitable materials; although some participants admitted that “basically when you go back home you won’t revise the given materials” (S2, FG 4). Regardless of whether students can truly become more independent, the consumer choices tutees have through “buying” the abundant resources that come with the tutorial services may have led them to perceive tutors as more effective in increasing their independent learning ability than schoolteachers.

The participants’ consumer mindset also motivated them to learn. Some participants explained that since they paid tutors for their teaching, “it would be a waste of money if not using their materials” (S3, FG 10). A participant added that “you don’t need to pay for your schoolteachers, so you usually lose the stuff teachers give you” (S3, FG 9). These excerpts illustrate that students’ motivation can come from their monetary investment in tutorial classes. They work hard because they do not want the tuition fee to be wasted. In contrast, they can be less motivated at school because they do not have to pay for their schoolteachers. This consumer mindset challenges the value of fee-free education which may be less appreciated without monetary commitment. It also reveals how much students value what they purchase in cram schools, whereas the free materials provided by schoolteachers may be considered less effective or even regarded as burdens. It appears that the students see the “market economy” quite clearly, and that it is already absorbing them before they have left school. Schools are thus fighting an uphill battle against the narrow educational requirements of the market economy.

# 5.3. Immediate psychological needs

The participants perceived that tutors were more able than schoolteachers to increase their motivation to learn in various ways. Some mentioned that they were motivated by tutors’ image, including their young and trendy look, compared to the relatively “conservative” style of their schoolteachers (S4, FG 16). They liked tutors’ sense of humour in class (S2, FG 11) and the use of humorous examples to remind students of important concepts (S1, FG 8) which their schoolteachers apparently were unbale to provide. They elaborated that schoolteachers needed to stick to English as the medium of instruction while tutors used Chinese, so students could understand their jokes better (S3, FG 3). This observation was also noted in Yung’s (2015) study, suggesting that tutors’ use of students’ first language facilitated the comprehension of humour in class. The participants also appreciated tutors’ encouragement, asking students to work hard to prepare for the public examination through different means such as social media:

S4: Schoolteachers are like “if you fail, I will see your parents”, using a hard approach. But tutors are like, “hey, you need to work hard, or you will see me again next year”, using a soft approach, like talking to young girls. […] Tutors are always in your life. When you use Facebook…

S2: You can see them everywhere.

S4: Yes! You see them holding a cat and drinking coke, and then it’s like, they stand by us and encourage us. But schoolteachers are not like that. They just scold us, saying we haven’t handed in our homework. (FG 16)

The excerpt shows that students are motivated by tutors’ supportive messages which encourage them to work harder. Indeed, it is very much desirable to some weak learners who feel the need to bond with someone who can encourage them. It is in stark contrast with schoolteachers’ apparent practice of scolding students. Whether they are motivated to learn the target language per se is an unanswered question, but tutors seem to be more able to cater for their tutees’ immediate psychological needs in the learning environment. Tutorial classes are more performance-driven by the tutors who are aware of the importance of entertainment.

The participants also considered tutors more able than schoolteachers to make them like English. One reason is the relaxing learning environment in cram schools. In contrast, since schoolteachers are accountable for their students’ results, particularly to the principal and parents, they can sometimes be “demanding” and the learning atmosphere at school can be “intense” (S2, FG 2). The participants also felt they liked English more because of tutors’ “useful” teaching content and instruction, as discussed in one of the groups:

S1: When I attended [the tutor’s] course, I felt that I became more interested in English. […] He liked talking about word family, like those synonyms, changing the part of speech of a word. This kind of stuff increased my interest in English. After all, you need to use a variety of vocabulary in writing.

S2: I also liked English more when I attended tutorial classes. For example, sometimes you learnt the kind of English you can apply to daily life, and it may be useful for our future. In this aspect, I am interested in learning new things, for self-improvement and preparing for the future.

S3: Indeed, same for me. He taught very well and gave us a clear direction to do revision. Then my results improved, and then I liked English more. (FG 7)

Although some participants have a genuine interest in English (e.g., learning the language system), others may develop their “interest” in cram schools merely by the instrumental values of the language such as its usefulness for studies and future career. In particular, when they find tutors’ skills useful in boosting their school grades, they may like learning English even more, as one of the participants described:

Tutors made me like English more. Actually, I have been interested in English since I was small. I also found that, like many of my friends, I like English because I always get good results in this subject. This gives me a sense of achievement, as you defeat many others. Tutors help you become stronger in this examination system, so when you go back to school you become better, and you get better grades. Then you like this subject even more. (S2, FG 1)

The student’s use of “defeat” is striking in that it reveals an educational context of fierce competition. When students see their results improved after using their tutors’ skills, the resultative motivation can lead to an increased sense of achievement. Instead of a genuine interest in English, students may have simply developed a “pseudo-interest” in the subject due to its pragmatic value and the cram school environment where students feel relaxed and satisfied.

The participants perceived tutors as more effective than schoolteachers in enhancing their English proficiency. This result contradicts the findings from previous studies suggesting that tutors’ exclusive focus on examination undermines students’ learning of English for authentic communication (Chung, 2013; Yung, 2015). Since tutors have been criticised as being excessively examination-oriented, they have tried to include some language enhancement elements to cater for students’ language learning needs, at least superficially. They teach idioms and vocabulary from news and current affairs and highlight their usefulness in daily life to their tutees. One participant stated that she felt the idioms learnt in tutorial class enhanced her English proficiency, and her spoken English improved when she communicated with her schoolteacher and schoolmates (S3, FG 12). Another participant elaborated:

The tutor had a “language enhancement” section in every lesson. I think it was useful, as he taught some phrases and idioms that we couldn’t learn at school and had to learn by ourselves through reading newspapers. (S4, FG 15)

The participants appear to be satisfied with the vocabulary and idioms learnt which they were told to be useful for their life. While it is doubtful whether students’ English proficiency has really increased by simply being presented with the content tutors claim to be applicable to daily life, the inclusion of the “language enhancement” component in tutorial lessons may have to some extent fulfilled the students’ immediate psychological needs of learning English for the purposes beyond examination.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This study has explored how senior secondary students enrolled in cram school English courses compared the effectiveness of tutors and schoolteachers. Given that tutors and schoolteachers are typically perceived to serve different functions (Kwo and Bray, 2014; Yung, 2015), what is surprising from the survey result is that tutors significantly outperformed schoolteachers in all identified aspects in the framework of effective teaching. Since tutors usually hail themselves as examination experts in advertisements (Koh, 2014; Yung and Yuan, 2018), it could be expected that they were perceived to be more effective than schoolteachers in aspects related to examination preparation (e.g., helping students learn examination skills and increasing their confidence in taking examinations). However, what was not expected was that this was the case even in aspects stated as objectives in the curriculum document in mainstream education (e.g., increasing students’ motivation to learn, increasing their independent learning ability, liking English and enhancing their English proficiency) (Curriculum Development Council & Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2007/2015). This also contradicts the finding in previous studies on English private tutoring suggesting that tutors ignore students’ learning of English for authentic communication (Chung, 2013; Yung, 2015). These new findings have therefore provided evidence for the description of tutors as “invasive species” in the ecosystem of education (Bray and Kobakhidze, 2015), creating a competing discourse between the public and private sectors where tutors are taking the place of schoolteachers, at least based on students’ perceptions. This poses a threat to schoolteachers and undermines the values of mainstream schooling. There is an urgent need for considered discussion of the issues identified among researchers and policymakers to examine the conflictive relationships between tutoring and schooling, and the effects of the former on the latter.

A contribution of this study to the field of shadow education is the analysis of tutees’ perceptions from the critical perspective. Through this conceptual lens, the students’ skewed understanding of learning (e.g., “defeating” others in examinations, “pseudo-interest” in learning English) and even self-contradictions (e.g., being given abundant resources automatically means opportunities for independent learning) have been identified. Their preference for tutors is also problematised to unveil how the wider social, cultural and educational contexts may have influenced their perceptions. In a curriculum which promotes student-centredness such as the “learning to learn” initiative in Hong Kong, teaching to the test is considered detrimental to students’ development in mainstream education (Au, 2009; Berry, 2011). However, in reality, examination success is essential in enabling students to pursue higher education, making examination drilling inevitable (Carless, 2011; von der Embse et al., 2016). Policies of accountability in public education worldwide also tend to evaluate teaching effectiveness based on the perceptions of key stakeholders such as students, parents, school leaders and state inspectorate, who value students’ performance in high-stakes examination more than the process of learning (Biesta, 2012; Mooney Simmie et al., 2019). Schoolteachers who do not explicitly help students prepare for examinations may be perceived as ineffective. Tutors fill this gap by providing “visible” examination-oriented teaching (Sriprakash et al., 2016). Even though some schoolteachers try to drill their students with examination papers (see Koh and Benson, 2011), they may still be considered less effective than tutors mainly because of schools’ demand for “all-round” education from schoolteachers compared to tutors’ legitimately narrow focus on examination preparation. In this situation, the question is not whether schoolteachers should uphold the ideals of education or adopt an explicit examination-oriented pedagogy, but how they can strike a balance between “assessment for learning” and “learning for assessment”. A policy implication for teacher education is to highlight schoolteachers’ professional development of assessment literacy to strengthen the connection between assessment and genuine learning and to engage students in discussions about the rationale behind certain instructional strategies (Alderson et al., 2017; Brown, 2009).

The study also reveals that students appear to take a “consumerist” view of their education. Going to cram schools may be a symptom of a repressive examination-based struggle for educational opportunities. It can also be seen as an example of students asserting their agency, with the financial support of their families, in maximising such opportunities. This leads to commodification of education in which tutors advertise themselves and use various strategies (e.g., humours, encouragement, “language enhancement” elements) to attract customers. The promotion of tutors’ qualifications results in a greater level of trust from students, as shown in the current study and other studies (Šťastný, 2017; Yung and Yuan, 2018). Although advertising tutors’ qualifications and pleasing students do not necessarily mean quality teaching, students can easily be persuaded that tutors are more competent than schoolteachers whose academic backgrounds are usually not advertised. In this regard, policies that regulate advertising practices in the tutorial industry should be in place to avoid misleading or false representations of tutors’ effectiveness (see Bray and Kwo, 2014). Still, a potential threat to schoolteachers is whether they should also publicise their qualifications and act like stage-actors to appeal to their students. This may, however, result in marketisation of education and distort the role of schoolteachers. A tension is that considering schoolteachers as less effective because they do not promote themselves or cannot meet students’ immediate and somewhat superficial psychological needs does not do justice to schoolteachers.

Students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of tutors and schoolteachers have implications on the prevalence of private tutoring and its washback on mainstream schooling. While the “shadow education” metaphor implies private tutoring follows and supplements the mainstream (Bray, 2009; Stevenson and Baker, 1992), its expansion has made the sector grow “out of the shadows” (Aurini et al., 2013). This may further reinforce the perceived insufficiency of schoolteachers and mainstream schooling. However, do students participate in private tutoring because they feel that their schoolteachers are not effective in the first place? Or do they participate in tutoring and then find their schoolteachers not as effective as their tutors who may have influenced their perceptions? This seems to be “the chicken or the egg” issue which needs further investigation.

Overall, through the critical lens, the findings from this study have provided solid evidence of students’ utilitarian learning orientations, commodification of education and superficial and immediate psychological learning needs. A limitation of this study is that the students are essentially self-selecting and their perceptions may have already been influenced by their participation in tutoring for a period of time. This is inevitable for a study like the current one which requires the participants to have experienced both tutoring and schooling for meaningful comparisons. Despite this, studies which examine how students who have no tutoring experience comment on the effectiveness of their schoolteachers with reference to their feelings of tutors may yield different and interesting findings. Another limitation is the study’s focus on students’ learning of English in cram schools in Hong Kong, although its findings can shed light on other parts of the world where private tutoring is prevalent or expanding. Further research may be extended to other contexts and focus on students’ perceived effectiveness of other modes of tutoring (e.g., small-group and online tutoring) and how they compare tutors and schoolteachers in other subjects.
