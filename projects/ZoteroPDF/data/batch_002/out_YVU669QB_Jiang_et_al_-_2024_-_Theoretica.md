# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Machine translation Theoretical perspectives Individual factors Contextual factors

Despite the increasing popularity of machine translation in second language (L2) writing, the theoretical perspectives and complex factors shaping its use remain under synthesized. This article reviews research on machine translation use in L2 writing to identify major models and factors that shape teachers' and students' employment of machine translation. Theoretical per. spectives underpinning machine translation research are first synthesized to categorize machine translation into three models: a linguistic processor, a mediational artifact, and a translanguaging proces. What then reviewed are empirical studies, revealing a predominant focus on linguistic factors in terms of how machine translation shapes L2 writing. More recent research has also examined person-related factors and taken the effectiveness of machine translation as conditioning upon individual differences of teachers and students. Contextual factors in interpersonal, instructional, and institutional settings and ideological factors are also identified. A conceptual framework is then developed to illuminate the interrelatedness of the identified factors during the process of using machine translation. The study argues for a need to avoid taking machine translation as a politically neutral participant in L2 writing. Implications for enhancing the effectiveness of machine translation use in L2 writing and suggestions for further research are also provided.

# 1. Introduction

Machine translation (MT) refers to the automatic production of text from one language to another through a computer program (Poibeau, 2017). Seminal examples of MT software include Google Translate, Deep L, and Microsoft Translator. Although it is not uncommon for educators to ban its use in some circumstances, MT has become a ubiquitous tol when students write in a second language (L2) (Godwin-Jones, 2022). Along with the evolution of MT technology, MT-enabled L2 writing is becoming a norm rather than an exception.

Past studies mainly explored the efectivenessof MT in L2 writing, with a focus on the functional propertie of MT (Chang et al. 2022; S.-M. Lee, 2022a). Nevertheless the use of MT is subject to multiple person- and context-related factors (Cancino & Panes. 2021). Unfortunately, cant attention has en paid to the exploration of thee factors and the theortical models underpinning various ways of MT use. One reason may be due to a predominant focus on quasi-experimental sttings (which tend to be insensitive to various individual and contextual factors), and an overt focus on examining the efectivenessof MT in previous studies (e.g., Gokgoz-Kurt,

2023; S.-M. Lee, 2023; Jolley & Maimone, 2022). Given that the effctiveness of MT is contingent upon a range of factors, it is imperative to synthesize how MT itelf has been conceptualized and, more importantly, what and how various factors shape the effectiveness of MT use in L2 writig. To addres the research void, this paper aims to (1) understand how MT has been conceptualized from various theoretical perspectives; (2) synthesize the inguisic, individual, contextual, and ideological factors that shape MT use in L2 writing; and (3) develop a framework to theorize the complex relations of various factors at work in the proces of using MT in L2 writing. The notion of ffectiveness i conceived in this paper as leaner engagement with or response to MT, or student uptake of L2 language features rendered by MT in L2 writing. This paper generates new insights into the value of MT in L2 writing with a scoping review, which is  form of knowledge synthesis that addresses an exploratory research question aimed at mapping key concets, types of evidence, and gaps in research related to a defined area or field by systematically searching, selecting, and synthesizing existing knowledge" (Colquhoun et al., 2014, p. 1293-1294). The study presents a comprehensive overview of the nature of MT use and the pertinent factors. The guiding question is: What theoretical models and factors shape machine translation use and the efectiveness of such use in L2 writing?

# 2. A brief overview

The historical development of MT has progressed through four stages. The pionering period from 1949 to 1966 marked th first stage of MT's development, witnessing its birth and the emergence of basic approaches, such as the direct translation model (Hutchins, 2023). Between 1967 and 1989, the second stage of MT's progression unfolded, characterized by the development of linguistic rule-based systems and the expanding adoption of MT for commercial purposes (Hutchins, 2023). Since the 1990 s, the third stage has seen the rise of corpus-based approaches, exemplified by example-based MT and statistical MT (Hutchins, 2023). The fourth stage has been revolutionized since the mid-2010 s with the extensive application of neural MT using deep learning approach (Koehn, 2020; Poibeau, 2017). Throughout the evolution of MT, spanning from early systems to the current neural MT, there has been a consistent improvement in the quality of MT (Wang et al., 2022). Given the advancements in MT technologies, in recent years, the use of MT has become a growing interest for L2 writing researchers and practitioners (Le, 2020; Lo, 2023; Zou et al, 2023). Over the years, MT has been used to support 2 student writers by providing asource of vocabulary and grammatical structures for rference (Alrajhi, 2022), offering immediate and individualized feedback on students' writen works (S.-M. Lee, 2022b), and bridging the linguistic gaps in superdiverse multilingual classooms (Kell & Hou, 2022). While everal studie ave rported mpiricalevidence for theefftiveness of MT use in various L2 writing contexts (e.g., Chung & Ahn, 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Tsai, 2022), the use of MT in L2 writing is not without controverses. Some key ssues include inaccurate translation generated by MT systems (S.-M. Le, 2022a), student writers overreliance on MT (Y-J. Lee, 2021), insensitive to culture-specific writte languages (Zhou et al., 202) implicit forms of language ideologies (such as the Standard English ideology) (Rowe, 2022), and ethical considerations over plagiarism (Groves & Mundt, 2021) Setting against the backdrop, important questions need to be asked about the nature of MT use, such as how MT systems are conceptualized by L2 writing teachers and researchers, and what may be the factors that inluence the varied perceived effectiveness and concerns regarding MT use in L2 writing. These questions motivated the current scoping review.

# 3. Method

This review was done following five steps: (1) \*identifying the research question'"; (2) "identifying relevant studies; (3) "study selection'; (4) "charting the data"; and (5) "collcting, summarizing, and reporting the results" (Arksey and OMalley, 2005). This five-step methodological framework has guided many previous scoping reviews in education (e.g., Jiang et l. 2020; Lu et al., 2022; O'Flaherty & Phillips, 2015) and offers a useful guideline for our review procedure.

# 3.1. Literature search

The literature search was systematically conducted in Web of Science, EBsco, and Scopus. As suggested by Riazi (2016), these databases were chosen for two purposes. First, they are comprehensive databases in education and applied linguisics. Second, they support the Boolean operands (AND, OR, and NOT) to form search strings. Guided by the research question, three search strings were constructed using Boolean operands. The first group of terms comprised second language writing L2 writing, bilingual writing, foreign language writing, mulilingual writin, and translingual witing. Concts related to MT formed the second group: machine tanslation, MT, online translator, online translation, web-based translation, automated ranslation and Google Translate. The common acronyms of the two terms "second language writing (L2 writing) and \*machine translation' (MT) were used to ensure that the review was comprehensive. The initial search aimed to identify Social Sciences Citation Index (ssci) articles published prior to June 2023, and the electronic search yielded 993 results. The rationale of the selection criteria concords with Heggernes' advice (2021).

We first removed 355 duplicates and used the rest 637 references for the initial review. Following that the abstracts and tites were manually checked against the selection criteria(described as follows). A total of 549 articles that were irrlevant to MT or language education was excluded. The full texts of the remaining 88 articles were further assessed. To include articles published for an inter national audience and given that English is widely used as an academic lingua franca in current international publishing, we included articles published in English and in sCl indexed journal. We acknowledge that it i a limitation for the current study to exclude nonsSCI articles and those published in languages other than English. We consider it an important direction for future review studies to include other publication types and languages. Our decsion to focus on ssCI articles is grounded in a need to include internationally peer-reviewed articles in indexed journals, and practicall, to make the scoping review more manageable and focused. This decision is also informed by Heggernes' (2021) and others practice. We made final decisions about whether an article was included based on a close reading of the full manscrit. Scsively, the reference lists of the included articles wre alo scanned, and eight more articles were added after a second search of publications prior to December 2023. We did not set a beginning year with an attempt to be as inclusive as possible. The whole process is presented in Fig. 1.

The final pool of studies comprised 29 articles published from 2009 to 2023 and adopting the mixed-method $( \mathbf { n } = 1 3$ , quantitative $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ , and qualitative $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ ) research designs. The reviewed studies consisted of approximately 1502 student and 273 teachers as participants from primary schools $( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ , secondary schools $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ , and universities ${ \bf ( n = 2 3 }$ ) across nine countries, including South Korea $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ , China $( \mathbf { n } = 9 )$ , the United States $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ , Australia $( \mathtt { n } = 1 )$ , Chile $( \mathtt { n } = 1 )$ , Malaysia $\left( \mathbf { n } = 1 \right)$ , Norway $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ , Saudi

# 3.2. Data analysis

The data analysis comprised three phases. First, we read through the identified studies to reveal any theoretical perspectives underpinning the MT research. The theoretical perspectives were then clasified into three categories: cognitive, sociocultural, and critical. Fllowing that we explored how MT and MT use have been conceptualized. After reading through the identified studies, three models emerged: MT as a linguistic processor, MT as a mediational artifact and MT as a translanguaging process Second, based on the three theoretical models, we identified the factors that shape MT use and summarized them into four main categorie, including linguistic, person/individual, contextual, and ideological factors. These categories and subcategories are presented in Table 1. In the third phase attntion was ao pad  ther dails, inuig thr afiliations, ublication rs, rerh context, participnts, and data collection and analysis. To ensure the reliabilit of hi review, the first two author carefully red ach article independently and then exchanged coding results to enhance intercoder reliability, which reached $9 6 \%$ of agreement after two rounds of comparing and discussing the coding results. The third author was then invited to double check the coding results through one additional discussion, through which all the disagreements were resolved.

# 4. Conceptualizing machine translation in L2 writing

Our review reveals three main theoretical paradigms underpinning the conceptualization of MT and its role in L2 writing: the cognitive, sociocultural, and critical perspectives. The three perspectives indicate that MT use has been conceptualized into three models: a linguistic practice, a sociocultural medation, and a critcally orinted translanguaging actvity. The studies flling into each perspective are summarized in Table 2, which displays a general distribution of extant research across the three theoretical perspectives.

First, a substantial number of MT studies has been informed by cognitive theories (e.g., Cognitive Load Theory, Information processing model in second language acquisition, which takes L2 writing as a process of encoding and decoding between two distint Ianguages (McLaughlin et al., 1983; Plss et al., 2010). Accordingly, MT is often defined as a model of natural language processing system with machine learning mechanisms based on statistical probability method or the more advanced artificial neural techniques (Lewis-Kraus, 2016). The underlying assumption is that MT can promote L2 writing by providing target output and thus afords an opportunity for 2 writers to notice the gaps and dissonances between ther firs anguage (L1), intrlanguage, and the tart linguistic output rendered by T Therefore, the cognitive perspective conceives ofMT as a linguistic processr that gnerates and delivers target linguistic output with the expectation that L2 writers would process and uptake the output. It should be noted that such a cognitive model is oten monolinguall oriented, taking MT-assted L2 writing as a process of helping L2 writers advance towards standardized use of target language with monolingual norms, which view languages as independent and bounded systems that vary in lexis, grammars and forms (Canagarajah, 2013).

Second, the sociocultural perspective conceptualizes MT as a mediated artifact/tool for L2 writing and MT use as a socially mediated process. Acording to the sociocultural theory of mind (Vygotsky, 1978), L2 learners are \*individual()-acting with medational means (Wertsch, 193, p.12) who can achieve their learning objects with "socioculturally constructed mediational means" which include both physical (e.g., online dictionary) and symbolic ools (e.g., language) (Lantolf et al., 1995, p. 109). As one such mediational too, MT mediates L2 writing performance and development, and MT use is not taken as merely linguistic processing but also a social interaction between machines, persons (e.., teachers, leaners), and context (Jiang & Yu, 2020). Inths sense, theefficacy of MT in 2 writing lies not just in the tol itself but also in the complex and sociall situated processes of tool use (Godwin-Jones, 2022).

Another emerging perspective is a criticall oriented theory of translanguaging (Li, 2018), through which MT is theorized as a translingual and digital multimodal composing tool for bilitrate and bilingual composing and the capabilit of using MT as falling within learners' translingual and multimodal repertoire (Kely & Hou, 2022; Rowe, 2022). Such a theoretical perspective does not take languages as bounded systems and highlights L2 leaners social-politiclly constructed linguistc reertoire t transcend linguistic and non-linguistic boundaries. It is inovative and liberating in that it aims to "empower pupils by recognizing the reality of their fluid linguistic practices rather than their primary identifier being a perceived deficiency in English" (Kell & Hou, 2022, p. 545)

Accordingly, the notion of L2 writing is reconstructed as biliterate composing practices, which refers to writing practices that involve two or more named languages (Rowe, 2022, p. 3). Using MT in L2 writing is thereby part of the biliterate composing practice, which refutes monolingual ias and positions students' multilingual and multimodal practices as valuable for L2 writing. Such a model takes MT-assisted L2 writing as composing in multiple languages (rather than as shifting from one language to another) with a purpose to not only benefit students' L2 writing development but also to shift the conventional monolingual norms and ideologies towards multilingualism in L2 writing classroms (Rowe, 2022). In this regard, MT use is defined as a translanguaging proces, within which the notion of language is reconceptualized as "a multilingual, mult-semiotic, multisensory, and multimodal resource for sense- and meaning-making" (Li, 2018, p. 22).

# 5. Factors shaping machine translation use

# 5.1. Machine translation as a linguistic processor

Research that modelsMT as a inguistic processor has been mostly interested in the linguistic features of MT-related written texts e. g., Chung & Ahn, 2022; Stapleton & Leung, 2019). To date, reearch informed by this perspective (e.g., Chon et al., 2021; Tsai, 2019) has shown that writing tak, MT input quality, and MT output quality are key linguistic factors shaping how students, teachers, and other MT users perceive MT use in L2 writing.

# 5.1.1. Writing tasks

Studies have investigated the role of writing tasks across genres in shaping the efficacy of MT as alinguistic processor in L2 writing. For instance, in Alrajhi's (2022) study, students were required to use L2 to write four texts of different genres: narrative, descriptive. expository, and persuasive genre, and then used Google Translate to convert the writing into MT-assted L2 texs. The result showed that MT-assted L2 texs contained more content words in expository and persuasive genres and more advanced words in narrative and descriptive genres. With the persuasive genre, MT alsoyielded higher grammatical accuracy. When comparing students texts (without using MT) with MT-assisted texts, MT-assisted texts performed better in the number of advanced words and content words in descriptive, expository, and persuasive genres. Tsai (2019) also gave a similar writing task to students, who were divided into three groups, with each group completing one of three task genres: reflection, scientific description, and persuasion. The MT-assisted and non-MT-assisted L2 writigs were compared acrosthe three task genres (Tsai, 2019). The finding showed that MT-assted writings performed better in lexical density, variation, and sophistication with reflective and persuasive genres than the descriptive genre.

MT's strengths in assting narrative and argumentative writing were also examined through comparing students' L2 writing with MT-assisted L2 writing (Chung & Ahn, 2022). The findings showed that the assting role of MT varied acros writing tass. For narrative writing, MT was found to enhance lexical variation,sophistication, and density, whereas for argumentative writing, MT assisted mostlysyntactic complexity. MT was also found to improve syntactic complexity in narrative writing and lexical variation in argumentative writing. These findings suggest that the effect of MT as a linguistic processori often contingent upon writing task genres.

# 5.1.2. MT input quality

Another factor that shapes the efectiveness of MT as a linguistic processor is related to MT input quality, which refers to the accuracy and complexty of L1 texts that are inputted into MT for translation into L2. The accuracy of L1 input afecs whether L1 information can be accurately processed through MT. For instance, Tsai's (2022) study showed that misuse of commas in the L1 input text could result in grammatical mistakes in the L2 texts rendered by MT. The processing outcome of MT is also related to the complexity of 1 input texs. Several studies show that when L1 input text contained more complex information, the L2 texts rendered by MT tended to be of higher lexical (Tsai, 2022) and syntactic complexity (Chon et al., 2021).

# 5.1.3. MT output quality

MT output refers to the output texts generated by MT directly prior to any human edits. The quality of MT output texts is often discussed as a crucial factor that affects the perceived efficacy of MT as a linguistic processing system and students uptake of MT output. MT output quality is ften measured through complexity and accuracy in MT output. Compared with students' L2 writing, research shows that MT output often appears superior in lexical and syntactic complexty, with more dvanced (S.-M. Lee, 2022a; al, 2019) and diverse vocabulary (Tsai, 2019). Research also shows that MT output can offer students more word choices (Alrajhi, 2022)

IT-assisted L2 texts also showed better readability (S.-M. Lee, 2022a).

Although MT could provide students with more lexical choices, such choices were not always appropriate and could lead to incomprehensible sentences (S.-M. Lee, 2022a), erroneous sentence structures, and lacking cultural consideration (Groves & Mundt 2015). S.-M. Lee(2022a) also observed problems with vocabulary and grammar accuracy. Despite these problems, MT output was sometimes reported to be more accurate in lexical and grammatical choices than students self-generated text in general (Tsai, 2022). Groves & Mundt (2015) also noted that MT could \*compensate syntactical gaps between the languages" by accurately presenting L2 language usage that does not exis in 1 (p. 117). Overall to date, research on MT output quality yelded mixed results. This may be due to variations in MT system properties and MT input textual quality.

# 5.2. Machine translation as a mediational artifact/tool

When conceptualizing MT as a mediational artifact/tool, researchers have expanded the foci of MT research from the inguistic features of MT-assted texts per se to the sociocultural and relational impact of various person-related and contextual factors on the effect of MT use in L2 writing. This aligns with the person-centered and sociocultural turn in L2 writing research. Specificall, the person-related individual factor involves both learners and teachers, and contextual factors are often conceptualized in relation to institutional and instructional contexts at the macro level, and interpersonal interactions or group dynamics at the micro level (Godwin-Jones, 2022). These individual and contextual factors play an esential role in affecting how MT is received/integrated in various classroom settings (or L2 writing activities because MT as a mediational tol is eentiall socilly oriented and intertwined with humans and contexts (Jiang & Yu, 2020; Jiang et al., 2020).

# 5.2.1. Student-related factor

The student-related factors include learner beliefs, writing strategies, L2 proficiency, and digital literacy.

5.2.1.1. Learner beliefs. Learner belef efer tostudents opinions about MT and it use in L2 writing. Our review identifies two types of learner beliefs: T-relatd beles and Translation-relatd belief.MT-related belef efer to belies aout the quality/ability of MT. Students mostly hold positive views towards MT'squality/abilit, affirming its value in L2 writing (Alrajhi, 2022; Chang et al., 2022; S.-M. Lee, 2020; Nino, 2009; Tsai, 2019; Yang et al., 2023). They found MT helpful in enhancing L2 writing complexity, acuracy, and fluency. Yang et al's (2023) study reported that students also placed a higher value on MTs speed of translation. On the other hand some students, due to the unstable ability of MT, doubted MT's usefulness (Garcia & Pena, 2011; Yang et al., 2023; Zhou et l., 2022) and rejected MT use (Chung & Ahn, 202; Tsai, 2019). Some considered MT a valuable source only at the lexical and phrasal levels but not the syntactic and discourse levels (S.-M. Le, 2020; Zhou et al., 2022). Some students expressed a strong wish to len effctive use of MT (Yang et al., 2023).

Translation-related beliefs involve eliefs about translation and writing resources. Beiler and Dewilde (2020) revealed two opposite translation orientations in an L2 writing context. One group of students viewed translation as an essential part of L2 writig and hence held positive orientations towards MT. Another group believed that translation should be avoided in L2 writing and hence, they also avoided MT use. In addition, beliefs about the trustworthines of MT also shaped how students viewed MT when compared with other writing assing toos. While some students trusted MT (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020), others ut more trust in other writing assing tools such as online dictionary (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Chung & Ahn, 2022).

5.2.1.2. Writing tategies. L2 writing strategies are defined as \*teachable, dynamic thoughts and behaviors that leaners consciously select and employ in specific contexts to improve their self-regulated, autonomous L2 writing development for effective task per. formance and long-term proficiency" (Oxford, 2017, p. 272). In the context of MT use, students often used two strategies: inguistic strategies and mediational strategies. inguistic strategies focused on students intralingual and interlingual use of MT as a resource to mediate their writing. Students primarily used thre ntralingual strategies. The first was intralingual input choice, deciding what to input into MT as source/input text. Chung and Ahn (2022) found that more proficient L2 learners preferred to input sentences, while less proficient did not have a fixed mode of input choice. Garcia and Pena (2011) also found that beginner L2 learners had varied syntactic complexity preferences, with some preferring to use more complex sentence structures. Another strategy was intrlingual input modification. When students were unsatisfied with MT output, they would choose to revise the L1 input to obtain better L2 translations (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). The third intralingual strategy was intralingual output exploitation, which was closely related to the strengths of MT output. Students preferred to translate vocabulary through MT for the purposes of selecting more appropriate words, checking uncertain words, or searching for specialized vocabulary (Chung & Ahn, 2022; Garcia & Pena, 2011; S.-M. Lee, 2020, 2022b; Y-J. Lee, 2021; Rowe, 2022; Tsai 2019). They also used MT tocorrect writing errors, and MT was found tobe the most useful in articles and preositions (-M. Le & Briggs, 2021). espitestudents vocabulary translation preference, they translated paragraphs or the whole text and did post-editing when assignment deadline was close (Zhou et al., 2022).

The interlingual strategies that students employed were the changes made in the translation languages and the sequence of using two languages. Multilingual students not only translated between L1 and L2 but also used the MT output language in the writig processto obtain the most suitable L2 expressions (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). Zhou et l. (2022) presented how two students used L1 and L2 in MT. One student first wrote an essay in L1, then used MT to translat alarge part of the main body and selftranslated the rest. Another student preferred to write topic sentences in L2 and supporting ideas in L1 first. Afer translating the 1 writig part through MT, the student then post-edited the MT output.

Students' mediational trategies refer to the strategies of using materials and personal resources to counteract potential limitations of MT. Students reported their use of dictionaries thesauruses, the intnet or reading materials to further support their MT use (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Zhou et al., 2022). Some students also consulted their peers or teachers for translations (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). These mediational strategies were often reported to be conducive to students' MT use in L2 writing.

5.2.1.3. L2 proficiency. The third factor that shapes students use of MT as a mediational artifact is 2 proficiency (Zhou et al., 2022) The asstig role of MT varied acos different 2 proficiencie.While a recent study by Lo (2023) reorted a similar positive effect of MT use between learners fdifferent L2 proficiencies on the suces in recalling words used in L2 writing over a short time, previous research shows that MT's asstance to L2 writing was greater for les proficient leaners than for the more proficient, particularly in word counts (Garcia & Pena, 2011) and error correction in MT-assiste L2 writing (Tsai, 2022). Chung and Ahn (2022) also found that While higher proficiency students MT-asstd 2 writing had better performance in coordination, accuracy, clause length, and lexical variation, lower proficient students' L2 writing outperformed in lexical density, lexical sophistication, and coordinated phrase ratio. Nonetheles, compared with ow-proficient learners, the more proficient who made fewer mistakes showed a higher rate of sucessul error correction with MT-generated outputs (S.M. Lee & Briggs, 2021). While the low-proficient learners made mistakes more frequently, they made fewer error corrections (S-M. Lee 2022b). A plausible explanation could be that thee students ften encounter obstacles when attempting to identif and rectify erors in MT outputs due totheir inadequate L2 knowledge and writig ability Yang et al., 2023).

5.2.1.4. Digital litercy. Digital literacy is another critical factor that has been noted by MT reearchers (Cancino & Panes, 2021; Chon et al., 2021; Groves & Mundt, 2015; Zhou et al., 2022) but has not been closely examined. MT researchers take MT use as digital literacy practices (Rowe, 2022) and putting forward the concept of "machine translation literacy" (Bowker & Ciro, 2019). Zhou et al (2022) argued that MT-literate students should be capable of understanding the strengths and limitations of MT and use MT in appropriate ways. Darvin (2023) further argues that MT serves both \*an affordance for one learner and "a constraint for another" due to its inherent "sociotechnical structures, which refer to the linguistic and semiotic forms that constitute platform design and that have been arranged to serve both social and technical purposes in ways that afford and constrain various online actions" (p. 41). Thereby, for students who use MT in L2 writing, thir learning is largely conditioned upon whether and to what extent they have the necessary digtal literacy to recognize the implicit power of sociotechnical structures (Darvin, 2023). Otherwise, there is a possbility for students particularly those who do not know how to critically and effctively ealuate T outut, to develop an addiction to using MT merely for speed and convenience in translation and writing (Yang et al., 2023). Nevertheles, although studies have recognized the importance of MT literacy and digital literacy, research has yet to systematically investigate what constitutes digital literacy in effective MT use and how such literacy can be cultivated among L2 student writers.

# 5.2.2. Teacher-related factor

Teacher-related factors included teacher beliefs, pedagogic practices, and MT detection ability. Teacher beliefs refer to teachers beliefs about whether/how MT should be used. Those who advocated MT usetook MT use in L2 writing as a normal phenomenon in this digital era, and believed that students could benefi from using the technology (Stapleton & Leung, 2019). MT opponents argued that MT would weaken students learning motivation and be detrimental to their independent thinking (Stapleton & Leung, 2019).

Teachers aso differed in their belefs about when MT should be used. At the lexical level, some teachers elieved that MT should be used only for word translations or checking. For instance, the teacher in Zhou et al.s study (2022) advised students to use MT for repetitive vocabulary searches. Other teachers were found to be against using MT as a bilingual dictionary for single-word translations (Stapleton & Leung, 2019). Some teachers cannot accept M use for language-checking purposes but acceted its use for idea-checking (e.g., idea generation and presentation) Stapleton & Leung, 2019). Different teacher belief also existed in MT us for low-proficient L2 learners. In Stapleton and Leung's (2019) report, one teacher believed that MT could asst es proficient learners, while another teacher disagreed out of a belief that MT use would hinder language development (Groves & Mundt, 2021). Some teachers also believed that MT-assted writing cannot be regarded as a true representation of students' writing competence (Groves & Mundt, 2021). Such beliefs tend to negatively shape MT use in practice.

Another teacher-related factor is pedagogic practice. Stapleton and Leung (2019) reported that if MT was allowed in L2 classrooms, teacher guidance should be provided to studentsto ensure the efectivenessof MT. Nevertheless such guidance remains barely available in classroom practice. One exception is a qualitative study conducted by Y-J. Lee (2021), who reported how a teacher continuously worked together with students by providing continuous support to students' MT use in L2 writing, leading to students successul prction f acurate sentence. Such teachr support ower, i condtioned upon whthr teachrs are willing to revisit their expert status in front of both students and MT. One key finding in Nino's (2009) study revealed that most teachers used translation (without using MT) as a teaching strategy to facilitate L2 education, with the aim of achieving diverse pedagogical objectives, including written production. In contrast, only a small number of teachers integrated MT technology into their teaching practices. This disparity appears to stem from teachers limited knowledge and understanding of MT. Many teachers remain cautious about MT use and adopt a practical wait-and-see attitude before incorporating it into their pedagogic practice.

MT detection ability refers to the ability to distinguish MT-assisted L2 writing from non-MT-assisted L2 writing and detect any traces of MT use in students' MT-assted L2 writing. Researchers have explored teachers' MT detection ability in two different conditions: being and not being informed of MT use before teachers assessed students' L2 writing. Stapleton and Leung (2019) used Google Translate to translate students' Chinese texts into English and invited teachers to grade MT-translated L2 texts and students non-MT-assted L2 texts. The reults of individual interviews with the teachers indicated that only two out of the 12 teachers suspected MT use in students L2 writing before they were informed of the existence of MT use by the researchers. In another study by Maimone & Jolley (2023) similar results were reported, indicating that with the advancement of MT systems, it may become more dificult for Ianguage teachers to accurately detect MT use. Such dificulty may further explain teachers reservations about MT use in L2 writing.

# 5.2.3. Interpersonal context

Using MT as a mediational artifact/tol is also shaped by interpersonal context, acontextual proces within which students interact with each other when using MT. Research shows that peer interaction and discussio often contribute t the efective use of T among students (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). Collaborative pr feedback on MT outputs has been shown to promote students uptake of MT as a writing assistance (Y-J. Lee, 2021). In multilingual classrooms, more active use of MT was ofen found among emergent bilingual learners who used MT as a multimodal digital tool that helped them crosslinguistic barrers (Rowe, 2022). Previous research also reported that the interpersonal communication needs between parents of multilingual students and schools can also promote MT use For instance, Kell and Hou (2022) described how a student used MT to ass schoo communication with other students parents who spoke a different language.

Another interpersonal context that contributes to MT use is the interactional setting within which multilingual students use their heritage language for transnational family communication. In such settings, the diasporastudents often use MT to communicate with members in their home communities (Kelly & Hou, 2022) and to maintain their identity as multilingual writers who create texts for their home language audience (Rowe, 202). Such interpersonal communication needs among multilingual language users are found to boost MT use.

# 5.2.4. Instructional context

Instructional context refers to settings where MT training and guidance are made available to students, though not necessrily offered by teachers. Cancino and Panes (2021) compared the writing performance of students who received 90-minute training before using MT and those who used MT without any MT instructions. Those who attended the training enhanced their comprehension of Google Translate, incuding its basic featres, merits and demerit, and tips for effctive use. Besides theoretical instruction, these students also underwent hands-on training on how to efficiently use Google Translate. The results showed that MT training better-engaged students in L2 writing by enabling students to search for more words, writ longer texts and produce more accurate L2 texts. Diffrent from Cancino and Panes one-shot instruction session, Chang et al. (2022) provided  semester-long MT instruction in a recursive way to compare the efect of MT on L2 writing between an experimental group who received training and a control group that did not have training. The finding showed that training could enhance syntactic complexity, particularly in the mean length of clause and text's accuracy. Nonetheless to date, MT training and guidance appear to be mostly researcher-designed and implemented. Further research on teachers' involvement in MT training and instruction is merited.

# 5.2.5. Institutional context

Despite the potential of MT in facilitating interpersonal communication and individual L2 writing, its mediation role is subject to contextual influences at the institutional level, which can be summarized as institutional policy and concerns over academic integrity regarding MT use in L2 writing. In some contexts, such as Korea, MT was prohibited in L2 classrooms (Y-J. Lee, 2021). In this MT-unfriendly environment, students were under pressure to conform to the institutional prohibiting policy, despite the potential benefits of MT. Underlying the institutional policy that prohibits MT use in L2 writing is a widespread public concern over a lossof academic integrity and a fear of AI-assisted plagiarism (e.g., D'Andrea, 2023).

According to Pecorari (2002), plagiarism refers to \*an object (i.e, language, words, text) which has been taken (or borrowed stolen, etc.) from a particular source (books, journal, Internet) by an agent (student, person, academic) without (adequate) acknowledgment and with or without intention to deceive" (Sutherland-Smith, 2008, pp. 70-71). Based on these criteria, MT is often regarded as a ghostwriter, and MT use a type of plagiarism if students include MT outputs as part of their L2 writing without acknowledging is use or in other unethical ways. Nevertheles, to date, whether/how plagiarism can be redefined and how to strike a balance between MT use, plagiarism, academic integrity, and institutional policy remains an open question.

# 5.3. Machine translation as a translanguaging process

An emerging body of iterature conceptualizes MT as a digital multimodal tool and models MT use as a translanguaging proces. This line f inquiry call for students to take gentive role in employing MT as a digital multimodal tol and using T to capitalize on (and further enhance) their linguisic, cultural, and communicative repertoires in L2 writing, which is reconceptualized as multimodal (L. Jiang, 2023; L.J. Jiang, 2017, 2018) and bi/multiliterate composing (Belcher, 2017; Rowe, 2022). As such, researchers have integrated a critical (and asset-based) perspective into MT reearch aiming to reosition L2student writers from deficient writers in the target language to bilingual/multilingual authors and support the flourishing of ilingual/multilingual composing through \*offering in-the-moment pelling and vocabulary support through MT within and acros multiple languages (Rowe, 2022, p. 1). The use of MT along this line of inquiry, nevertheles, i conditioned upon a range of ideological factors that have been seldom examined in most MT research. To date, researchers have highlighted the role of ideological factors in affcting the efficacy of MT use as a translanguaging process, including the monolingual bias, the standard language bias, and the translanguaging stance.

# 5.3.1. The monolingual bias

The use of MT as a translanguaging proces is subject to the impact of monolingual bias, which refers to a viewpoint that takes monolingualism (i.e, people who speak only one language) as the norm in human communication (Li, 2018). Previous researchers reported that MT (such as Google Translate) is not \*a neutral participant" in L2 writing and human interactions (Rowe, 2022, p. 21) because as an AI-assted tol, MT operates under a fixed view of languages as bounded, named, and standardized systems and a model of bilingualism as two binary and bounded languages (Rowe, 2022, p. 21). Such a view and model, although to some extent, legitimate the role of translation as an interlingual practice, is in confict with a translanguaging orientation that takes bi/multilingual composing practices as fluid and typical of many bi/multilingual communities (Rowe, 2022).

The monolingual bias can lead to resistance to MT use, particularly by those students and teachers who are monolingually biased. For instance, Beiler and Dewilde (2020) summarized that some students did not want to use MT because they considered L2 writing as a process of producing monolingual texts and thereby using MT as nothing more than an unnecessary burden. Some students also believed that MT would harm the formation of a monolingual thinking mode, which is traditionally believed to be a superior form of language competence in L2 writing (Garcia & Pena, 2011). Prior research (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020) also reports that some teachers and students even considered reduced/no use of MT a  sign of successul target language development, leading to limited use of T in L2 writing.

# 5.3.2. The standard language bias

The standard language bias refers to a view that takes native-ness as a superior form of language competence (Kachru, 1994) Previous research reveals that MT outputs only represent certain varieties of language'" but carry hidden messages about \*appropriate" or "standard" language use (Rowe, 2022). Such a standardized language bias leads to two isues regarding MT use. The first issue is the tendency to position MT as the expert i target language use, with uncritical adoption of MT oututs as the standard) and neglection of others expertise (Rowe, 2022, p. 20). Moreover, prior studies also reported that L2 students would then take MT as an answer key and fail to\*acknowledge the richness and complexit of human interaction, identit, and ulture (Urlaub & Dessin, 2022, p. 57) in L2 writing.

The second issue is the hidden material inequalities in the provision and ordering of results rendered by MT systems, particularly for \*relatively low-resource language in the economy of big data" (Darvin, 2023,p. 40). For instance, Rowe (2022) reported a student Who wanted to translate betwen English and Tagalog in Google Translate, but could only find the named language choice Pilipino rather than Tagalog. The lack of Tagalog as one language in MT reflected its inequality in rendering inguistic support for certain languages, particularly those indigenous languages. Such unequal linguistic resource distribution was also found in MT between English as L1 and Malay and Chinese as L2 (Groves & Mundt, 2015). As Angermeyer (2022) expressed, \*machine translation thus creates new opportunities for "linguistic injustice" and "social inequality" (p. 16-17).

# 5.3.3. The translanguaging stance

Prior studies also show that the successful use of MT as atranslanguaging proces necessitates a translanguaging stance, which is a political stance to go beyond the superficial boundaries between languages and to take bi/multilinguals fluid language practices as belonging to a unitary communicative repertoire (Li, 2018). In relation to MT use, a translanguaging stance refers to "a way of understanding the routine moment-to-moment flux and bricolage of translating as an activity, where translators draw on their multilingual repertoire and artifacts in the environment, such as the internet, dictionaries, and databases, in coming up with a translation equivalent" (Baynham & Le, 2019, p. 53). With such a stance, researchers no longer take MT use merely as linear use for wrtentext production but s anon-linear hybrid and fluid use of multimodal resources for communication in L2 writing activities. Such a stance also emphasizes students' \*multi-competence" (Cook & Li, 2016) in L2 writing. In other words, what a student can do with MT in L2 writing is more than writing a text but an integrated use of MT as a communicative resource together with other semiotic resources available in their chool learning community (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Kell & Hou, 2022) and home language community (Rowe, 2022). Such a stance is important in positioning MT as contributing to not only L2 writing development but also to multilingualism and multilingual education in L2 writing classrooms in the contemporary world of migration and globalization.

# 6. Discussion

# 6.1. Contribution of the study to theory

The theoretical contribution of the review is twofold. First, we identified three theoretical perspectives (i.e, the cognitive, sociocultural, and critical) in MT research and conceptualized MT into three major models: a linguistic processor, a sociocultural mediation, and atranslanguaging proces. Such concetualization provides acomprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of MT and illustrates the complexity of MT use as a linguistic, interactive, and sociopolitical phenomenon in L2 writing.

To further understand various factors in the proces of MT use from the three theoretical erspectives, we develop a framework (see Fig. 2) o lluminate how the idntified factors interweave atthe linguistic person/individual, contextual, and idological levels. At the linguistic lel, MT is normall taken as a linguistic processor that mainly decodes and encodes from one language to another. This line of research indicates that the efectiveness of MT in L2 writing depends not only on the genres of the writing tasks but also on the linguistic accuracy and complexity of MT inputs and outputs.

When MT is defined from a sociocultural perspective, MT is not just viewed as mere producers of linguistic output. Rather, T is embedded into social contexts as a mediational tol, the efficacy of which is subject to a range of individual and contextual factors (Godwin-Jones, 2022). At the individual level, the complexity of variables i relation to both students and teachers work together to shape the efetivenes of MT use in 2 writing. tdnts' L2 proficiency, writing straties, belifs, and digil literacy, as manfested in their engagement with and attitudes towards MT use, are important factors influencing how students act as social agents who manage their L2 writing with MT. Teacher beliefs, pedagogic practices, and MT detection ability in relation to MT use are also important, shaping the opportunities for students to engage with MT. At the contextual level, studies have shown that students use of MT is inluenced by whether and how they interact with peers, teachers, and significant others (such as ilingual others in home language communities), whether/how MT training/scaffolding are rovided to them, as wellas institutional policies regarding academic integrity and plagiarism when MT use is involved in L2 writing.

From a critical perspective, MT is viewed as atranslanguaging process with the purpose of promoting multilingualism and bi/ multilingual composing in traditional L2 writing classrooms. Such orientation treats MT use as part of students unitary inguistic and cultural repertoires. Such an asset-based orientation towards L2 student writers, however, is subject to a range of ideological factors, including the monolingual bias, the standard language ideology, and the translanguaging stance. Studies have shown that critical use of MT as a translanguaging process is conditioned upon whether or not MT users can become aware of the hidden sociotechnical structures of MT programming (Darvin, 2023), which may lead to limitations of using MT as an \*expert' in standard language use (Rowe, 2022).

The framework also presents the potential interactions between the linguistic, person/individual, contextual, and ideological factors. On the one hand, MT and its use are mediated by linguistic and student-related factors, including L2 proficiency, beliefs, writing strategie, and digital literacy; on the other hand, MT use is also situated in mult-layered societal setings, which comprise interpersonal, instructional, instittional, and idologil contexs. Such interaction of factors at varios levels can be illustrated with Rowe's (2022) study, within which the teacher's use of MT was closely related to the teacher's translanguaging stance to afirm her students' linguistic and cultural repertoires as an aset for her promotion of bi/multilingual composing in the linguistically and culturall diverse language classrooms. et as pointed out by Rowe (2022), students responses to MT use were affcted not only by their L2 proficiencie or beliefs about MT but also by monolingual and standard language biases that positioned MT as the expert" and MT output as the standard in targt language use Therefore, to maximize the eficy of MT, it is importat to pair the use of dgital translation tools with critical digital literacy practices that interrogate their consumption and use' (Rowe, 2022, p. 22).

# 6.2. Implications

The above discussions carry several important implications. First, for MT researchers and practitioners it is important to develop a holistic view of MT and its use in L2 writing. This entails a disposition to place the three theoretical models of MT (i.e., alinguistic processor, a mediational artifact, and atranslanguaging process on a continum rather than treat them as conflicting with each other. With a holistic and continuum thinking, inary treatment of MT as either a friend or foe to L2 writing can be avoided and then it is more likely for comprehensive institutional policies regarding MT use in L2 writig to be achieved. To develop such a holistic view of MT use in L2 writing, theris also a nedto revisit the goals and nature of  writing itelf (Jiang et al., 2020). Critical questions can be asked: Is L2 writing about lening to write in an L2 asthe ultimat target, or is i about developing L2 learners from monolingual writer nto bi/multiligual composers? As Wiliams (2006) stae, If students can see that communicating in another language is not simply a matter of plugging words into a formula that can be calculated by a machine, they will begin to understand language and communication as complex and multilayered (p. 572). As such, there is need to develop a person-centered approach to MT use rather than to take MT merely as a linguistic system. This means an orientation to take MT use in L2 writing as more than language learning, but to equip L2 writing learners with multi-competence (Cook & Li, 2016) and becomes "genuine L2 users, not as imitation natives" (Cook, 2001, p. 419).

An important caveat is to avoid taking MT as a politically neutral participant in L2 writing and develop a critical awareness of its buil-in language ideologies. As a system based on big data and neural technologies, MT often operates under certain language ideologies, such as monolingual and standard language biases (Rowe, 2022). To some extent, with embedded sociotechnical structures and designs, MT as a tool has the power to make inequalitie in language resource distribution and acces more implicit, hidden, and subtle (Darvin, 2023). It i at this point we reinforce an important nd for teachers and students to develop critical digital literacy in using MT, with which they can be more critical about MT consumption and use in L2 writing (Darvin, 2023).

Moreover, learner differences in understanding and responding to MT and its use cannot be neglected. For example, students with Iow L2 proficiency often lack the competencies to judge MT outputs and may feel unnecessary and reluctant to do post-editing upon receiving MT outputs (S-M. Lee 2022b). These students may use MT with fewer error corrections and les inguistic development in 2 writing. To tackle such issues, teachers can inform students of the aims and goals of MT use in advance and give more specific follow-ups to explain the targeted L2 forms in MT outputs. Some students who use MT inappropriately may also engage in plagiarism, highlighting the need to educate them on responsible use of MT in their L2 writing.

# 6.3. Further research directions

While prior research predominantly focused on the effctiveness of MT as an artificial system (S.-M. Lee, 2023), more attention should be paid to individual, contextual, and ideological factors that shape the use of MT in situated educational contexts. While a range of cognitive, emotional, and societal factors have been identified to shape technology use in second language education (Thorne & May, 2017), only some of these factors (e.g., L2 proficiency, learner belief, writing strategy) have been empirically explored in existing research on MT use in L2 writing. To advance this line of inquiry, future research can explore how other person-related factors such as earlier experience, learning styles, motivation, identit, 2 writing goals, digital competence, affct how L2 student writers respond to MT.

In terms of contextual factors, the interpersonal and instructional contexts in which MT is used have been lessdiscussed in existing MT research. Future research can examine in detail how students of linguistic and cultural diversity interact and build rapport in the process of negotiating MT use and how instructional scaffolds for MT use can be designed and implemented by L2 writing teachers. Future research can also investigate the relationship between contextual factors, behavioral intention to use MT, and actual use of MT through technology acceptance models/theories (se Al-Emran & Shaalan, 2021, for details). Moreover, this review also shows that most MT research has been conducted from the cognitive perspective (see Table 2), with limited atention to the underlying monolingual and standard language biases and the sociotechnical sructures of various MT programming systems. Echoing Rowe's (2022) and Darvin's (2023) arguments, we suggest that MT is not a politicall neutral participant in L2 writing and hence, more critical research on the ideological factors is warranted to reveal the "agency of MT as an artificial system in contrllig students (and teachers) ccessto particular varieties of target anguages and how such hidden gency would further shape learner agency in MT use.
