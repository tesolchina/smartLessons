# Abstract

Acceptance of claims made in scientific research articles depends on the stance authors take and their resources for appraisal (Martin and White, http://www.grammatics.com/ appraisal). Stance has been defined as ‘the ways authors project themselves into their texts to communicate their relationship to subject matter and the readers’, (Writing Texts, Processes and Practices (1999)), while appraisal represents the ways authors’ evaluations, attitude and emotions are expressed and managed interpersonally (http://www.grammatics.com/ appraisal/AppraisalGuide/Unframed/Appraisal-Overview.htm).

This paper explores some appraisal resources employed by authors of research articles, and the means by which scientific authors are positioned interpersonally and intertextually. It looks at resources by which authors express their attitude and certainty to claims, and create solidarity between themselves and their readers. The paper explores three categories of markers: attitude, certainty, and common knowledge markers, and its main aim is to compile a taxonomy of the lexical and discourse-based realisations of these markers and their pragmatic functions, as they are manifested in RAs from the field of electronic and electrical engineering.

The analysis indicates that employment of these markers by authors assists them in asserting their authority and expertise by presenting claims as given based on shared knowledge and consensual understandings, exploiting the complex dynamics of power and solidarity in order to gain readers’ agreement and community consensus.

# 1. Introduction

The research article occupies a prominent position in research publications, and is considered the main means employed by the hard sciences for the dissemination of knowledge, the publicisation of claims, and their ratification. The structure of an article, its language and style, the author’s persona and use of the literature are mainly determined by the social structure of the scientific community, the process of negotiation through which the community constructs knowledge, and in effect, the way a discipline’s gatekeepers expect them to be and find them more persuasive (Myers, 1990). Acceptance of claims depends on the stance authors take and their resources for appraisal (Martin, 2000; White, 2002, 2003, http://www.grammatics. com/appraisal). Stance has been defined as ‘the ways authors project themselves into their texts to communicate their relationship to subject matter and the readers’, and the ways their persona is socially defined (Hyland, 1999a: 101). Hyland writes that stance has three components: evidentiality, affect, and relation. Evidentiality refers to the writer’s expressed commitment to the truth of propositions and their strategic manipulation for interpersonal goals. Affect involves the declaration of a range of attitudes, including emotions, perspectives and beliefs. Relation concerns the extent to which writers choose to engage with readers, and their degree of intimacy or remoteness (1999a: 101). Along similar lines, Conrad and Biber (2000) regard stance as comprising both epistemic (commenting on certainty, reliability, and limitations of propositions) and attitudinal (conveying attitudes, feelings, or value judgments) stance, and use the term as cover term for the expression of personal feelings and assessments in both of the above domains. In agreement with the above, appraisal has been defined as the ways authors’ evaluations, attitude and emotions are expressed and managed interpersonally (http://www.grammatics. com/appraisal/AppraisalGuide/Unframed/Appraisal-Overview.htm). Attitudinal values can be managed and negotiated interpersonally, and constitute the means by which writers vary and negotiate arguability by adjusting the dialogic status of propositions. These negotiations of arguability are referred to in the Appraisal framework as engagement (http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/stage5- Engagement.htm). Authors can engage with alternative positions by ‘acknowledging’ and ‘entertaining’, ‘disclaiming’ (‘denying’ and ‘counter-expecting’), and ‘proclaiming’ (‘concurring’ and ‘pronouncing’) propositions (White, 2003).

This paper looks at resources by which scientific authors ‘disclaim’ alternative positions and ‘proclaim’ their own (http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/stage5- Engagement.htm), by stating their personal attitude and opinion towards propositions, expressing their certainty and conviction to claims, and strengthening their positions by making explicit allusions to common knowledge. It classifies these resources under three types of marker: attitude, certainty and common knowledge markers. Such formulations are shown to ‘contract’ the dialogic space between authors and readers (http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/stage5-Engagement. htm), imposing either directly or indirectly opinions and interpretations on readers while presenting them as given and consensual. The main aim of this paper is to provide a taxonomy of these markers, drawn from a small corpus of RAs from the field of electronic and electrical engineering, and to investigate the ways scientific authors exploit the complex dynamics of power and solidarity in order to solicit readers’ acceptance for claims.

The findings of this paper are part of a larger PhD study on engineering rhetoric, which analyses both RAs and students’ writing (Koutsantoni, 2003).

# 2. Materials and methods

The choice of discipline was instigated by the limited attention electronic and electrical engineering has received in studies on scientific discourse. Scientific discourse and its conventions have been investigated by a number of researchers (Bazerman, 1988; Myers, 1989, 1990; Hyland, 1996a, 1996b, 1998a, 1998b, 1999a, 2000, 2001a, 2001b, 2002a, 2002b; Salager-Meyer, 1994; Vartalla, 1998; Kuo, 1999; Martinez, 2000; Soler, 2002, to name but a few). Electronic and electrical engineering features only in Hyland (1998a, 1999a, 2001a, 2001b, 2002a, 2002b) and in Kuo (1999), but it has not been investigated exclusively.

The corpus of this paper consists of 34 articles taken from relatively recent issues of leading electronic and electrical engineering journals, namely The International Electronic and Electric Engineering (IEEE) Transactions on Communications, Information Theory, Magnetics, Biomedical Engineering, Multimedia, Image Processing, The IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and The International Journal of Electronics, dating from 1989 to 2000.1 These particular journals were selected because they were found to be referenced in students’ work, and because specialist informants recommended them as key journals in their field. Some of the articles that were analysed were actually referenced in students’ work, while others were randomly chosen.2

The methodological approach adopted in this thesis was both qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative approach served to identify frequency of occurrences and to produce comparable data, while the qualitative approach was used to identify pragmatic usage. Certain lexical and discourse-based items that indicated attitude, certainty and alluded to common knowledge were identified and counted. Following that, the functions of all the items were examined qualitatively based on their actual occurrences in context. My corpus of materials is not electronic, so the counting of items was conducted manually and particular attention was paid to the context in which they were used. The frequency of occurrence of each group of items was calculated in percentages.

# 3. Taxonomies of attitude, certainty, and common knowledge markers

The taxonomies of attitude, certainty, and common knowledge markers this paper presents are based on a combination of attitude markers, certainty markers, emphatics and boosters taxonomies suggested by researchers, such as Vande Kopple (1985), Crismore et al. (1993) and Hyland (1998a, 1998b, 1999a, 1999b, 2000), together with some additions and modifications informed by the materials of this study.

Attitude markers have been defined as devices that express writers’ affective values, and their attitudes towards the propositional content and/or readers (Vande Kopple, 1985; Crismore et al., 1993; Hyland, 1998b, 1999a, 1999b). Emphatics have been defined as devices that allow writers to underscore what they really believe or want their readers to believe (Vande Kopple, 1985) and as devices that emphasise force or writers’ certainty in the message (Hyland, 1998b, 1999a, 1999b). Certainty markers are defined as items that express writers’ full commitment to the truth-value of the proposition (Crismore et al., 1993), while boosters are maintained to allow writers to express conviction and assert a proposition with confidence (Hyland, 1998a, 2000).

All the above types of marker present authors’ views as obvious based on shared knowledge, and presuppose readers’ endorsement of these attitudes, conviction, and certainty on the basis of shared understandings. However, there are certain words and expressions that exclusively underscore authors’ beliefs by presenting them as given, as knowledge shared by all members of the community. I call this type of marker common knowledge markers, and differentiate it from the other two as it explicitly invokes received knowledge and takes certain propositions for granted.

The research on use of what have been referred to as attitude markers, boosters, certainty markers, and emphatics in scientific writing has not provided us with detailed taxonomies of linguistic expressions that fall into each of these categories. Vande Kopple (1985) proposed that emphatics include items such as clearly, undoubtedly, it’s obvious that, and that attitude markers are expressed by words and clauses such as surprisingly, I find it interesting that, and it’s alarming to note that. Crismore et al.’s (1993) certainty markers taxonomy includes ‘adverbs’ like certainly, while their attitude markers taxonomy includes ‘expressions of surprise, of thinking that something is important, of concessions, agreement and disagreement’, ‘higher verbs expressing attitude’ (I hope, I agree, I disagree) and ‘sentence adverbials’ (unfortunately, most importantly) (Crismore et al., 1993: 53). Hyland (1998a, 2000) investigated frequency of use of boosters by searching for items that were listed in grammars, dictionaries or earlier studies, as well as from the most frequent items in the texts themselves. The most frequently occurring devices in his data include verbs such as show, find, determine, demonstrate, will, and know, adverbs such as clearly, and particularly, and expressions such as the fact that (Hyland, 2000: 91). These researchers’ suggestions were helpful indications of the kind of items that usually function as attitude, certainty and common knowledge markers, and formed the starting point of the taxonomy that is presented in this paper. The taxonomies have, however, been enriched with other items that were identified in this particular corpus of RAs and were found to define authors’ attitudinal and epistemic stance.

# 4. Attitude markers

The analysis of this particular corpus of RAs indicated that attitude markers comprise:

. evaluative adjectives (such as significant, interesting, important) evaluative, intensifying, and attitudinal stance adverbs (such as significantly, considerably, unfortunately, respectively)   
. obligation and necessity expressions and modals (it is necessary, must, should), and   
discourse-based negative evaluations of previous research.

The frequency by which each category occurs in the corpus is shown in Table 1.

Evaluative adjectives are the most frequently occurring linguistic realizations of attitude markers $60 \%$ of all items). They are expressions of authors’ appreciation, that is, evaluation of propositions, methods, results, or points (Martin, 2000, http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/Guide/Unframed/stage3-Attitude-Appreciation.htm). These adjectives are considered to render the text more subjective, as they ‘add either a positive or negative judgment to the modified noun, and reflect the writers’ favourable or unfavourable position towards the modified noun’ (Soler, 2002: 155):

1. For test pattern generation the ability to propagate fault effects to the primary outputs is very important and the ExOr gates in this circuit play a crucial role (Moore, 1998).   
2. There are fundamental difficulties associated with the design and analysis of such systems (Williams, Benson & Duffy, 1997).   
3. The ULTRAHIGH frequency (UHF) band has become increasingly attractive for medical and biological implant communications (Scanlon, Burns & Evans, 2000).

Evaluative adjectives with positive values can emphasise the importance of the research area and function, therefore, as justifications of researchers working in it:

4. The camera tracking module is the most crucial part of virtual studio systems (Xiroudakis, Drossopoulos & Delopoulos, 2001).   
5. The most promising solution to this challenging task seems to lie in data handling techniques (Bassia, Pittas & Nikolaidis, 2001).   
6. One of the major advantages of a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system is its flexibility (Halford & Brandt-Pearce, 1998).

They are additionally employed to stress the originality of the authors’ work:

7. In this paper a novel methodology for direct mapping on N-dimensional. . . is presented (Soudris et al., 1998).   
8. The evolutionary strategy we adopted is an example. . . (Robertson, Miller & Thompson, 1996)   
9. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the experimental results obtained from the analysis of BS recorded from controls and patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction show very reliable and robust performance (Hadjileontiadis, Liatsos, Mavrogiannis, Rokkas & Panas, 2000).

Such adjectives are also employed to positively or negatively evaluate previous research, methods, algorithms, or models, emphasise authors’ intertextual positioning, and their ‘endorsement’ or ‘disendorsement’ of attributions (http:// www.grammatics.com/appraisal/appraisalGuide/UnFramed/stage4-Intertextuality.htm):

10. Perturbation techniques are widely used to determine unknown dialectic properties (Donovan et al., 1993). They provide very accurate results when used with controlled geometries over an appropriate frequency range (Williams, Benson & Duffy, 1997).   
11. These techniques are often unreliable and limited to special cases (Vassiliadis, Angelidis & Sergiadis, 1993).

Appreciation can also be expressed with evaluative adverbs, such as successfully:

12. A guard ring structure has been demonstrated successfully by Zhu et al. (1985). (Irvine & Woods, 1997)   
13. We see that the estimator performance improves significantly as the observation interval length is increased (Hebley & Taylor, 1998).

Expressions of appreciation are intensified and emphasised with intensifying adverbs, such as highly:

14. Electromagnetical tracking has been widely adopted, since it can be highly

accurate (Xiroudakis, Drossopoulos & Delopoulos, 2001). 15. The estimator is remarkably insensitive to symbol timing offsets over a wide range of offsets (Hebley & Taylor, 1998).

The meaning of evaluative adjectives and adverbs acquires significance within the understandings of the particular disciplinary community, and depends on the value-system of the scientific community in which discourse is generated (Soler, 2002). Whether a method is novel, a result accurate, or a structure has been demonstrated successfully, ultimately depends on what the particular disciplinary community considers novel, accurate or successful, in accordance with its standards and ideals. These adjectives on the one hand express authors’ appreciation of models, techniques, or methods, and impose it on readers, since, if a difficulty is evaluated as fundamental or a solution as most promising, readers are guided into seeing them this way too. However, as it is the community which assigns positive or negative values to these adjectives (Hunston, 1989), they also allude to shared understandings within the community and emphasise community membership.

Adverbs constitute $1 5 \%$ of all attitude markers. In them are included what Conrad and Biber (2000) refer to as attitudinal stance adverbs that convey feelings or expectations ((un)fortunately, surprisingly, amazingly). Such adverbs evaluate claims in affectual terms, which ‘foreground authors’ subjective presence’ (http:// www.grammatics.com/appraisal/appraisalGuide/UnFramed/stage1-AttitudeAffect.htm). Formulations with such adverbs and adjectives usually engage readers in disclaiming propositions. By using them, authors invoke alternative propositions only to deny and replace them, and therefore contract the dialogic space, as they reject alternative positions and emphasise the one put forth. At the same time, however, they try to establish an interpersonal bond with readers, asking them to see their affectual responses as justified and valid in some way (http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/appraisalGuide/UnFramed/stage1-Attitude-Affect.htm):

16. From the available studies related to BS analysis, only two take into account the necessity of separating bowel sounds from inevitable superimposed noise and extracting their original structure before any further diagnostic evaluation (8), (9). Unfortunately, the method used for noise reduction in [8] was based only on assumptions . . . (Hadjileontiadis, Liatsos, Mavrogiannis, Rokkas & Panas, 2000)   
17. Forest and Mitchell (1993) found the performance of their random mutation hill-climber (RMHC) vastly superior to both the NAHC and SAHC on a set of theoretical fitness functions (Royal Road) designed to study GA performance. Unfortunately, the RMHC is of no use in practical search spaces due to its inability to escape local optima (Robertson, Miller & Thompson, 1996).

Other linguistic means used to express authors’ opinions are obligation and necessity expressions and modals $1 8 \%$ of all attitude markers), which focus attention and emphasise important points (Hyland, 2001a). Authors pronounce their positions towards certain points, make it clear that they consider them important, and stress how important they believe it is to take certain actions. Authors are foregrounded as the responsible sources of the utterance as they claim the authority to declare certain actions as necessary and direct readers towards particular directions (Hyland, 2001a, 2002b):

18. Another fact that should not be neglected is the realisation of self-checking capabilities within an array (Soudris et al., 1998).   
19. It must be noted that the processing of the same fluorescent signals with the implementation of the single algebraic algorithms which are based on the intensity difference of the recorded spectra did not have the same rate of success (Rovithakis et al., 2001).   
20. The authors claim that the watermark must be placed in perceptually significant regions of a signal (Bassia, Pittas & Nikolaidis, 2001).

Such devices are classified as directives (Hyland, 2002b) and constitute an explicit expression of authors’ desire to control their readers’ inferences, to lead them towards actions that they consider to be correct, and to impose their opinion on readers in this way. However, the implication is that these courses of action are necessary for accurate understanding of procedures (Hyland, 2001a), for the benefit of the whole scientific community and the progress of the discipline, and stress therefore the collective nature of scientific endeavour. The interplay of power and solidarity and the fact that they are manifested with the same linguistic means become rather clear in such cases. Despite the belief that power precludes solidarity and that solidarity operates only in the absence of power (Hodge & Kress, 1988), it has been argued that in reality they entail each other (Tannen, 1986). Tannen has demonstrated that controlling others involves them in a relationship (power entailing solidarity), the same way that claiming intimacy has an element of control (solidarity entailing power). By emphasising certainty in and attitude towards claims, and by presenting them as given and shared, authors control readers’ inferences and demand their agreement and sharing of their views (power entailing solidarity). On the other hand, by alluding to shared understandings and common knowledge they ‘oblige’ readers to see views presented as consensual and to agree with them (solidarity entailing power). The use of directives in the form of obligation and necessity expressions by scientific authors displays a desire to control the thoughts, inferences, and actions of their readers, and to demonstrate power, but with a view to soliciting their agreement and involvement, and, therefore, their solidarity.

Apart from lexical realisations of attitude markers, discourse-based expressions can express authors’ attitude towards propositions. Such discourse-based expressions are expressions that constitute negative evaluations of previous research $( 6 \%$ of all attitude markers). Negative evaluation can be made both explicitly and implicitly. Sentences may contain what appraisalists refer to as ‘inscribed’ values of negative appreciation or judgment (http://www.grammatics.com/appraisal/ Guide/Unframed/stage2-Attitude-Judgment.htm) (for instance, nouns such as shortcome, disadvantage, or problem) together with other features that ‘evoke’ negative judgment in the form of limitations and gaps in knowledge:

21. A major shortcome of those techniques is that although they give useful information regarding the mechanical and geometrical features of the vessel they do not acquire data related to the biochemical composition of the tissue (Rovithakis et al., 2001).   
22. Fault-tolerant array design is generally not supported at all by the existing array complier systems (. . .). This approach has several disadvantages. It is only applicable to mesh-type architectures. . . (Soudris et al., 1998)   
23. Characterisation of this infrared channel has been performed using experimental measurements (1), (2) and simulation through ray-tracing techniques (3), which both have drawbacks as the primary technique for modelling (Carruthers & Kahn, 1997).   
24. Knowledge of bowel sounds (BS) has advanced little since Cannon’s pioneering work [1], which used the sounds as a way of studying the mechanical activity of the gastrointestinal tract. This lack of interest in abdominal auscultation is due in part to its lack of support in scientific fact and definitely not due to its lack of diagnostic information. Bowel sounds patterns in normal people have not been clearly defined as only a small number of them have been studied (2)– (5). The trivial signal processing methods which have been involved (6), (7) have also been a problem (Hadjileontiadis, Liatsos, Mavrogiannis, Rokkas & Panas, 2000).   
25. Some results in testing exclusive-OR CLA adders are given by Gizopoulos et al. (1996a,b). However, although Gizopoulos et al. (1996a,b) give a non-minimal 12-test set for a 4-bit exclusive-OR CLA, their haphazard choice of test vector leads to non-minimum test sets for block CLAs. They suggest modifying the CLA logic to avoid this increase in test size but this is not necessary, as is shown later (Moore, 1998).

Negative judgments can also be made implicitly, with absence of items that carry negative value, but with tokens that evoke negative judgment from readers (http:// www.grammatics.com/appraisal/appraisalGuide/UnFramed/stage2-AttitudeJudgment.htm):

26. Of the previous papers on parallel acquisition none of them have focused on optimal detection rules for frequency-selective fading channels (Rick & Milstein, 1998).   
27. The numerical study of implanted UHF sources within a realistic model of the human body has not yet appeared in the literature (Scanlon, Burns & Evans, 2000).

Even though the use of none or not yet are general indications of negativity, there is no explicit accusation of limitations or gaps in previous research in the examples above. However, the sentences have the ability to evoke negative judgments of limitations or gap of knowledge to readers who are familiar with the field. As such, they allude to shared understandings and communality of opinion.

Negative evaluation of previous research is the expression of overt disagreement and criticism of previous research using evaluative language with negative values. By using it authors convey negative judgment of other researchers or negative appreciation of their models, techniques, results, etc., or disclaim and deny alternative positions. Authors impose their negative evaluation to readers, as ‘deny’ values are essentially non-negotiatory with respect to alternative positions (White, 2002).

Disagreement is traditionally seen as ‘disaffiliative’ and as ‘largely destructive of social solidarity’ (Heritage, 1984: 269), and as an exhibition of power in the sense that it enforces authors’ evaluations and opinions on readers. In reality, however, it can be seen as representing scientists’ attempt to make readers see their point of view, bring authors and readers together in criticising previous research only in order to make clear that they agree that more research is needed in order to rectify the existing limitations and oversights, which is necessary for the benefit of the whole of the community.

# 5. Certainty markers

In the RAs analysed, certainty markers were found to comprise:

certainty adverbs (such as clearly, obviously);   
certainty adjectives (such as obvious, apparent, evident);   
verbs such as will and be going to; and demonstrate and show;   
discourse-based expressions of confidence in results or contributions of research.

The frequency of occurrence of each category is shown in Table 2.

With certainty markers authors emphasise their certainty and conviction to claims and ideas. Typical ways are adverbs and adjectives that express certainty and conviction as regards the interpretation of results (30 and $20 \%$ of all items, respectively):

28. Clearly, this is a valuable tool and increased confidence will help to address some problems that have otherwise not been tackled (Williams, Benson & Duffy, 1997).   
29. It is clear that the overall level of agreement between two sets of results is excellent (Williams, Benson & Duffy, 1997).   
30. From this figure it is evident that. . . (Larsen & Frost, 1997)   
31. From this table it is apparent that . . . (Rovithakis et al., 2001)

Their use can be motivated by epistemological reasons and be based on the results and findings themselves, and combined with social goals in scientific communities, such as gaining agreement and consensus by appealing to common knowledge and shared understandings. Hyland (1998a, 2000) maintains that expressions of certainty impose views on readers, control readers’ inferences, do not allow room for disagreement or negotiations, and regard readers as passive recipients of ideas unable to make their own evaluations and judgements. However, as Hyland (1998a) adds, expressions of certainty work towards the acceptance of claims by addressing readers as knowledgeable peers who are familiar with the ideas presented and able to follow the author’s reasoning. By saying that an observation is clear or obvious authors imply that it is so not only to themselves, but should be to their readers as well, based on their ability to make the same inferences (Hyland, 1998a). They also make it very difficult for readers to disagree with or oppose the claim, as readers who do not find the claim obvious or clear may ‘suspect their own judgments’ rather than the authors’, and think that ‘they are missing the obvious’ (Hoey, 2000: 33–34).

Table 2 Frequency of lexical and discourse-based expressions of certainty markers   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="6">Certainty markers</td></tr><tr><td>Adverbs</td><td>Adjectives</td><td></td><td>Will/going to Demonstrate/show</td><td>Discourse-based expressions of confidence in</td><td>Totals</td></tr><tr><td>No of items</td><td>47</td><td>31</td><td>21</td><td>12.</td><td>47.</td><td rowspan="2">158</td></tr><tr><td>Percentages</td><td>30%</td><td>20%</td><td>13%</td><td>8%</td><td>30%</td></tr></table></body></html>

Certainty adjectives and adverbs are also used to express values of ‘proclaim’: ‘expect’ (former term) or ‘proclaim’: ‘concur’ (revised term) in the engagement framework (White, 2003: 5):

32. Of course this is a particular implementation of the ripple-carry adder cell and as such is not very interesting to the general testing of CLA adders (Moore, 1998).   
33. Obviously, grid nodes that do not possess any discriminatory power should be discarded (Kotropoulos, Tefas & Pittas, 2000).

Such evaluations can be said to be averrals which are expressed as though deriving from a source, in this case, implied consensus (Hunston, 2000). As White writes, ‘such formulations present propositions as uncontentious, as given, being in accord with what is generally known or accepted’ (2003: 5). They ‘explicitly invest in the viewpoint being advanced’, and ‘head off contradictions’ or ‘rule out possible alternatives’ (White, 2003: 5), while at the same time presenting them as given, as generally held and as consensual (White, 2002).

Other ways of expressing certainty include verbs such as show and demonstrate:

34. The performance of Gas has been shown to be better than that of. . . (Irvine & Woods, 1997)

35. We have demonstrated that the statistical phenomenon of self-similarity can be observed in a deterministic model of data transfer (Deane, Smythe & Jeffries, 1996).   
36. We will show that a single parameter of the channel impulse response, the normalised delay spread, is an excellent predictor. . . (Carruthers & Kahn, 1997) . . and will and going to, which are often combined with show and demonstrate:   
37. The work described below will therefore have direct implications for future studies in these systems (Scanlon, Burns & Evans, 2000).   
38. Our analysis will clearly show that one has to apply. . . (Hadjileontiadis & Panas, 1997)   
39. It will be demonstrated that the output of the DIPA is a linear function. . (Efstathiou & Papadopoulos, 2000)

Expressions of certainty with will, and going to constitute $1 3 \%$ of all certainty markers, while certainty is expressed with demonstrate and show at $8 \%$ . The verbs demonstrate and show carry the assumption of an objective fact (Myers, 1992), and pronounce authors’ certainty and conviction regarding what the research has accomplished or can accomplish. Uses of the modal verb will and the verb be going to pronounce authors’ certainty in expected outcomes (Hyland, 1998a) and the implications of the research. Formulations with all the above verbs channel readers towards seeing that the aims set out are accomplished or will be accomplished, and underscore what authors want their readers to believe.

Authors also express certainty by discourse-based expressions of confidence in results or contributions of their research $30 \%$ of all certainty markers). These may not contain items from the above categories, but it may be the general tone of the sentence that expresses this confidence, together with positive evaluative nouns such as advantage, novelty, etc., or verbs such as be able to, ensure, guarantee, or verify. These discourse-based expressions of confidence can be instigated by certainty that derives from hard data and the desire to give certain knowledge and indicate great commitment to claims. It is argued that with such formulations authors pronounce their evaluation of results and guide readers towards also evaluating them positively:

40. Although the development in this paper is necessarily complex it does not hide the clear minimality of the test sets (Moore, 1998).   
41. The overall gains are smaller; however, the pilot-signal-based erasure flagging once again proves to be the most accurate method (Welburn & Cavers, 1999).   
42. The WTST-NST filter used in this study proved to be a very efficient tool for noise removal and the enhancement of BS morphology (Hadjileontiadis, Liatsos, Mavrogiannis, Rokkas & Panas, 2000).   
43. In this experiment we had 100% success in watermark detection (Bassia, Pittas & Nikolaidis, 2001).   
44. The results verified that the method is inherently robust to this kind of attack

(Bassia, Pittas & Nikolaidis, 2001).

45. One additional advantage of the proposed approach is that features are distinguished without enlarging the key-color region and in a well-defined and accurate manner, in contrast to marker-based approaches (Xiroudakis et al., 2001).

Such expressions also acquire significance within the discourse and the understandings and value system of this particular discourse community. The elements of methods, techniques, tools that are referred to as being advantageous are considered to be so depending on the research that has been conducted before, the gaps in that research, the community expectations of any new research in the field, and its needs. Even though such expressions impose evaluations on readers, they do so by creating a sense of solidarity between authors and readers; the dynamics of power and solidarity once again at play. This is especially obvious when the evaluation is implicit and the positive judgment is evoked:

46. We avoid using ‘tricks’ (e.g. to reduce the resolution of the original image in order to claim a faster algorithm execution or to report computational time on more powerful platforms, etc.) (Kotropoulos, Tefas & Pittas, 2000)   
47. The probabilistic mutation was implemented in the following way (. . .) No optimisation of the populations size was attempted, nor did we try to ascertain the most advantageous probability density function (Robertson, Miller & Thompson, 1996).   
48. A similarity in first and second heart sound is assumed in both previous schemes (. . .). In our scheme, the LOREE algorithm searches for true locations of the two heart sounds, without assuming similarity in the two heart sounds (Hadjileontiadis & Panas, 1997).

In the above examples, readers are expected to positively evaluate authors’ techniques, methods, tools, or results on the grounds that are not similar to previous ones. Even though there are no inscribed negative judgment values as regards previous studies nor positive judgment values as regards the present one, readers are expected to evaluate them negatively as being erroneous or as having limitations based on shared understandings that enable them to see the positive value of the techniques, methods, tools, or results presented.

# 6. Common knowledge markers

Common knowledge markers consist of devices that stress common knowledge of authors with readers. They were found to include:

. evaluative adjectives, such as well-known or common   
. expressions of generalised attribution (van Leeuwen, 1996) such as it is known, it is widely accepted.

Table 3 displays the frequency of occurrence of each of the two categories:

Table 3 Frequency of lexical expression of common knowledge markers   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">Common knowledge markers</td></tr><tr><td>Expressions of general- ised attribution</td><td>Adjectives</td><td>Totals</td></tr><tr><td>No of items</td><td>6</td><td>15</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Percentages</td><td>29%</td><td>71%</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

The function of this type of marker is to stress authors’ commitment in propositions and to add to the argumentative force by presenting the view as one which is not theirs alone, but one which is shared with the wider community or with relevant experts (White, 2002). Common knowledge markers also indicate endorsement of sources which are highly respected in the field and carry the status of objective facts. At the same time authors emphasise their own status as members of this scientific community by showing awareness of these sources and by showing their relevance to their work.

Seventy-one per cent of common knowledge markers are adjectives, such as wellknown, or well-established, which are appreciations of techniques, methods, algorithms and give positive social values to these techniques, methods, or algorithms based on the value system of this particular discourse community:

48. For that purpose the well-established back-propagation algorithm (38) is utilized (Rovithakis et al., 2001).   
49. A well-known BIST technique is the signature analysis (Soudris et al., 1998).   
50. The designer of the synthesiser can apply most of the well-known techniques (prescaling, down conversion) to the feedback line of the loop (Efstathiou & Papadopoulos, 2000).

Common knowledge markers can also be adjectives such as usual or common, which convey normality. Such adjectives are used to justify authors’ methodological choices by indicating that the methodological procedures they use are standard and used by everyone in the field. They also indicate that they are familiar to everyone in the field, take certain knowledge as given and as shared among authors and readers, and create an atmosphere of solidarity:

52. When only a finite set of input–output vectors is given, a common approach is to use some of these pairs for training and the rest for testing the efficiency of the network designed (Kotropoulos, Tefas & Pittas, 2000).   
53. As usual in such cases, we express the latter integral over the finite interval from. . . (Jackson, 2000)

Common knowledge markers also consist of expressions of generalised attribution, such as it is well known, it is true, it is widely accepted, which are used to refer to points that are considered facts in the community and are self-explanatory $1 9 \%$ of common knowledge markers). By using them authors make ‘high externality’ claims (Pinch, 1985), type 5 claims in Latour and Woolgar’s (1979) taxonomy of claims, and refer to taken-for-granted facts that are no longer contested. Authors use this sort of marker to support their own claims and therefore strengthen them, by stressing the fact that they are based on knowledge that everyone in the field is (or should be) familiar with. Such markers are attributions, the source of information of which is received knowledge, which as Hunston (1993: 62) maintains, ‘pushes the statement up the certainty scale’. They also indicate endorsement of sources which are highly respected in the field and carry the status of objective facts. At the same time, authors emphasise their own status as members of this scientific community by showing awareness of these sources and by showing their relevance to their work:

# 7. Conclusion

This paper has looked at appraisal resources of scientific authors, and has attempted to compile a taxonomy of their lexical and discourse-based realisations, as manifested in a small corpus of electronic and electrical engineering research articles. Three types of marker have been investigated: attitude, certainty and common knowledge markers, which express authors’ attitudes and opinions, certainty and conviction to propositions, and allude to shared understandings within the community. It was argued that all the above markers define authors’ epistemic and attitudinal stance towards propositions and engage readers in the construction of claims.

The use of these linguistic devices is closely linked to the functions of the RA as a genre, its employment as the mains means for the publicisation and ratification of claims in the hard sciences and engineering, and its essentially persuasive nature (Latour & Woolgar, 1979). Epistemological reasons, such as evidence from hard data and experimental results, and the achievement of social goals in scientific communities, namely the need for negotiation of knowledge before claims are accepted and consensus is reached, are the main motivating factors behind their employment.

It was shown that attitude, certainty and common knowledge markers limit the room for negotiation of claims by imposing attitudes, interpretations, and assessments of truth-value, and by predisposing readers towards certain inferences. However, they also allude to shared understandings within this community of engineers, and its shared value system. By exploiting the complex dynamics of power and solidarity, they prove to be very powerful resources for engineers in their effort to create research space for themselves, assert their learned authority and expertise, solicit readers’ acceptance of claims, and reach consensus.

The taxonomies of attitude, certainty and common knowledge markers presented in this paper are specific to the discourse community of electronic and electrical engineering. As was indicated earlier, engineering discourse is underrepresented in studies of scientific discourse and conventions, which means that the findings of this paper could have important pedagogical implications for the teaching of EAP. The RAs analysed in this study constitute successful examples of academic communication since they have achieved publication and have gained accreditation by gatekeepers. The models of rhetorical behaviour identified in them could, therefore, be used to devise discipline-specific EAP teaching materials and strategies for students preparing to enter engineering communities, and familiarise prospective engineers with the rhetorical behaviour that is considered appropriate by this disciplinary community.

Since the corpus of this study is rather small, more studies on the linguistic expression and pragmatic usage of these types of marker in RAs from the field of electronic and electrical engineering and other fields could validate the findings of this paper, and would be of great use to EAP educators.
