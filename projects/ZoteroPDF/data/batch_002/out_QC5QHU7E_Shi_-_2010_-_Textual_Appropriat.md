# Textual Appropriation and Citing Behaviors of University Undergraduates

# LING SHI

University of British Columbia

This article explores the citing behaviors of 16 undergraduates in a North American university. After completing a research paper for their disciplinary courses, each participating student was interviewed to identify in his/her writing words and ideas borrowed from source texts and to explain why and how the relevant texts were appropriated with or without citations. Analysis of students’ writing and comments illustrates how they relied on source texts for various aspects of their essays, some of which they believed required citations while some of which did not. Results showed that they tried to strike a balance between the need to cite published authors to gain credit for the scholarly quality of their writing and the desire to establish their own voice by limiting the extent to which they cited other texts. Some students also reported how they chose between quoting and paraphrasing (though the latter sometimes contained direct copying) on the basis of their ability to rephrase other’s words and their understanding of the different roles played by the two. The study indicates the degree to which citational acts are discursive markings of learning and knowledge construction.

# INTERTEXTUALITY

One theoretical perspective for research on students’ citing behaviors is the concept of intertextuality which suggests that each academic text is populated with other texts organized to generate new knowledge claims (Fairclough 1992). Researchers have found the concept useful in interpreting how students acquire academic literacy. For example, Starfield states that university students need to learn to interact with various texts which ‘circulate as currency’ (2002: 125) and develop citation skills to accumulate their own ‘textual capital’ (2002: 126). Young and Gaea (1998) suggest that citation skills develop along with one’s disciplinary knowledge and students achieve knowledge transformation by integrating content as interpreted evidence. While working with multiple source texts, many students, however, have produced ‘patchwriting’ by copying from a source text and then deleting or changing a few words and altering the sentence structures, a textual strategy that leads to accusations of plagiarism (Howard 1992, 1995). Such accusations, as Pennycook (1996: 226) states, are ‘inadequate and arrogant’ especially to L2 students from a culture that views borrowing and memorizing others’ words as a legitimate learning strategy. In order to understand issues embedded in students’ citation practices, Chandrasoma et al. (2004: 171)

propose that we should ‘do away with the notion of plagiarism in favour of an understanding of transgressive or nontransgressive intertextuality’.

# PREVIOUS RESEARCH

# Reliance on source texts

A number of researchers compared student-generated texts with their source texts and found that students relied on source texts in their writing (Campbell 1990; Moore 1997; Shi 2004). Among them, Campbell (1990) noted that copying was a major strategy used by both L1 and L2 writers. In two other studies (Moore 1997; Shi 2004), L2 undergraduates were found to rely more than their L1 counterparts on source texts in their summary writing. Close comparisons of students’ texts also revealed that L2 students tended to use implicit attributions, such as ‘it is said’ or ‘the first idea is . . .’, to summarize propositions compared with their L1 peers who tended to mention the individual authors explicitly (Moore 1997; Shi 2004). The varied performances of the participants lead to the question of how students conceptualize textual borrowing or plagiarism.

# Inability to identify plagiarized texts

To explore students’ perceptions of plagiarism, a second strand of research explored students’ abilities to identify plagiarized texts by using questionnaires that contained examples of edited rewritten versions with their sources (McCormick 1989; Deckert 1993; Roig 1997; Chandrasegaran 2000). The edited rewritten texts contained what researchers believed to be either models of correct use of sources or texts that were copied or paraphrased with or without acknowledgement. For example, McCormick (1989) included three rewritten samples that had direct copying of phrases of 7, 13, and 15 words, respectively, without quotation marks. Together, these questionnaire surveys revealed that many students, either with L1 (McCormick 1989; Roig 1997) or L2 or a non-western background (Deckert 1993; Chandrasegaran 2000), had problems distinguishing the ‘plagiarized’ texts. Gray areas surrounding plagiarism concern the degree of reformulation or paraphrasing. Students, especially those from an L2 culture, are sensitive to the complexities of plagiarism (Pennycook 1994).

# Nontransgressive plagiarism

A third strand of research used students’ comments to clarify their inappropriate textual borrowing or plagiarized texts identified by researchers. These studies could be further distinguished based on whether the analysis focused more on students’ texts (Pecorari 2003, 2006) or interview data (Hull and Rose 1989; Dong 1996; Spack 1997; Currie 1998; Ange´lil-Carter 2000; Starfield 2002; Chandrasoma et al. 2004; Petric´ 2004; Thompson 2005). Those that focused more on students’ voices from interviews were case studies. The rich interview data in these case studies suggest evidence of unintentional plagiarism. Students were reported to defend their unacknowledged use of source information in terms of how they understood common knowledge (Chandrasoma et al. 2004) or relied on memorized and internalized knowledge (Petric´ 2004). There was also evidence that inappropriate use of citations was tied to students’ confusion of how to cite (Thompson 2005), unsuccessful attempts to develop authorial selves (Starfield 2002), underdeveloped skills of reading comprehension as well as critical thinking in relation to the authors’ stance (Spack 1997; Ange´lil-Carter 2000), and limited content knowledge that hindered them from selecting relevant and important references (Dong 1996; Chandrasoma et al. 2004). Being primarily concerned with how their teachers would judge their work, some students actually found patchwriting an efficient strategy for survival (e.g. Hull and Rose 1989; Currie 1998; Chandrasoma et al. 2004; Petric´ 2004). These findings suggest that plagiarism is a problem of academic literacy rather than that of dishonesty (Ange´lil-Carter 2000).

The aforementioned case studies, however, provided limited or a less comprehensive description of students’ texts. Recognizing this limitation, Pecorari (2003, 2006) analyzed excerpts of 17 graduate students’ thesis writing in different content areas. Based on comparisons of passages from student texts and the cited sources, Pecorari (2003) found that students’ citations were not transparent as most of them had passages in which 50 per cent or more of the words were from the sources without acknowledgment or quotations. However, like those in the case studies, these students indicated no intention to deceive at the interview. The interview data revealed individual student writers’ understanding of the nature of source use. Citation is, as Pecorari (2003: 324) put it, ‘an occluded feature of academic writing’ because the ‘real nature of source use is only known to the writer’. Further exploring these students’ occluded use of citations, Pecorari (2006) identified that about 18 per cent of the total source mentions in students’ texts were actually from secondary sources without acknowledging the original author. Uncertain about such practice, one student said she relied on her advisor for guidance. However, since such occluded features were a blind spot for readers, Pecorari (2006) expressed a concern about how these students might graduate with the wrong impression that their citation practices were in compliance with the standard practice.

# The present study

The above review suggests that researchers that used both textual and interview data have provided more insightful information since citational acts are subjective and private. However, these studies have either provided a limited description of students’ text in terms of quantities and weightings of various types of use of citations or textual appropriation, or solicited students’ comments based on seemingly plagiarized texts identified by the researcher who examined passages of students’ texts that contained citations. In the latter case, portions of texts were excluded from the analyses when they ‘included no citations’ (Pecorari 2003: 322). What is missing here is a great amount of textual borrowing not indicated by citations. Since textual borrowing is a subjective act guided by, what Pecorari (2006) has noted, students’ own inferred rules, research needs to explore how students identify their own textual borrowing and explain why they make the borrowing and whether each borrowing is cited or not cited. Such research could also symmetrically compare students’ views in terms of how they apply textual borrowing or citations to quotations, paraphrases or summaries. To tap these issues, the present study uses undergraduates’ self-reflections to explore three research questions:

(i) Why do students appropriate source texts and cite them in their writing?   
(ii) Why do students appropriate source texts but not cite them in their writing?   
(iii) How do students apply principles of textual borrowing to quotations, paraphrases or summaries?

# METHOD

# Participants

Sixteen undergraduates in a North American university responded to an advertisement and volunteered to participate in the study. Of the 16 participants, 4 were science majors and the rest were in Arts and Social Science (Table 1). The initial letters of the pseudonyms indicate the first language of the students: $\mathbf { \ddot { E } } ^ { \prime }$ for English (Elmer, Edward, and Eddy), ‘C’ for Cantonese (Carmen, Carl, Candy, Carol, Cathy, and Cary), $\mathbf { \nabla } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { M } ^ { \prime }$ for Mandarin (Martin, Mark, and May), $ { ^ \prime }  { \mathrm { J } ^ { \prime } }$ for Japanese (Jane), $^ { \prime } \mathrm { K } ^ { \prime }$ for Korean (Kate), $\mathbf { \ddot { \Delta } } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { R ^ { \prime } }$ for Romanian (Rose), and $\mathbf { \prime p \prime }$ for Polish (Polly). Participants who regarded English as their second language, including Carmen and Carl who were born in North America, all spoke their first language at home. Among them, Jane, Kate, and Rose had just arrived as international students and were literate in their home language. The rest were not literate in their first language as they had all or most of their schooling in local North American schools. These students, unlike those who were literate in their first language and might therefore bring different ideas about citation practices from their home cultures, were more like their North American born monolingual peers in terms of learning to cite, a difficult task for all university students.

# Writing assignments

Participants were asked to bring to the interview a research paper they had just written for a course as well as the source texts they used (see Appendix A in the supplementary data for the online version of the article). Depending on the courses they were taking at the time, most students brought their research papers for 100 level (first year) courses in English (8), history (1), film studies (1), and biology (2). The rest brought their research papers for 200 or 300 level (second or third year) courses in political science (3) or women’s studies (1). The average length of these papers was 1,805 words. The course handouts that explained the assignments all had a warning against plagiarism and directed students to the university or faculty websites on plagiarism. In other words, the participants were aware of the importance of attributing appropriated materials in their research paper assignments.

# Interviews and data analysis

I met the 16 students separately and conducted discourse-based interviews (Odell et al. 1983). Each interview lasted for an hour during which the student was asked to compare his/her own text with the source texts to identify and comment on texts appropriated, whether cited or not cited (see Appendix B in the supplementary data for the online version of the article for interview questions). Since citations without quotation marks signal the borrowed content whereas those with quotation marks signal the borrowed language in which content is presented, I also solicited students’ comments on their decisions of using quotes, paraphrases, or summaries for texts appropriated. The term ‘plagiarism’, though mentioned by some students, was carefully not used by me so as not to bias students’ views. Based on the interview data, a total of 187 units of textual appropriation were identified together with students’ comments. There were occasions when students identified units of textual borrowing but did not make any comments. Such units were excluded as the lack of explanation from students in these cases might be a significant problem worthy of another study.

There is no consensus on how much language must be copied to be deemed plagiarism. For example, students have been advised to cite when copying a string with a minimum of three words from a source text (e.g. Hodges 1962). For the present study, a unit of textual appropriation was defined as a sentence or several sentences that contained words or ideas borrowed from source texts. The longest unit in the present data contained seven sentences with a total of 164 words. The boundaries of the units were set by students themselves who connected each unit to one specific borrowing and citation decision. After repeated readings of students’ explanations, a coding scheme was developed based on some key words used by students (e.g. support; new information). The purpose of using students’ own language was to be more accurate about students’ perspectives. This approach would also help produce ‘consensual readings’ of the narrative data (Denzin 1997: 232) and, therefore, catch ‘both the variation and central tendency or typicality’ (Watson-Gegeo 1988: 585). To check intercoder reliability, a research assistant was trained to use the scheme and then coded 10 per cent of the data on her own. The agreement between the researcher and the research assistant reached 84 per cent. The discrepancies were then solved by revising some of the categories.

Table 2 presents the revised coding scheme. Fourteen reasons were identified under three major factors that influenced students’ use of source texts and citation decisions. First, the participants were concerned about the functional or rhetorical role of the borrowed texts in terms of whether it could provide support, help develop or form one’s own idea or form the basis of a key point. Such concerns demonstrate that the present students, unlike those in previous research (e.g. Chandrasegaran 2000), did have an understanding of using textual borrowing rhetorically to legitimize their own claims.

In addition, the participants were making interpretations of the source information to determine whether it was new information, fact, research finding, background information, common knowledge, or information from a credible source. These reasons indicate that, apart from background information that was identified in previous research (Pecorari 2003), there were various other inferences that the present students made about which type of source information needed to be borrowed with or without citations.

Finally, the participants described how their learning experiences influenced their use of source texts and citations. Such experiences included how they identified words of others, wrote from knowledge accumulated as result of learning, followed teachers’ preference, and understood that there was no need to cite everything including references that were cited earlier in the text or in the reference list. Table 2 shows that the relevant mentions were also coded in terms of a quote, paraphrase or summary1 when information was available. The fact that the relevant information was not available for some units will be discussed in the findings section.

# FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

Since students’ decisions were based on more than one reason for some units, the 187 units of textual appropriation generated a total of 236 explanations of why and how source texts were used (Table 3). Over one-third of the explanations given (85) were related to the functions served by using the source texts, about one-third (77) were related to the interpretations of previous works, and slightly under one-third (74) were related to reasons of learning to cite. Of the 236 explanations provided, 159 (67 per cent) illustrate why students ended up citing the work. Students also explained how they applied the principle of textual borrowing by quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing the source texts a total of 122 (out of 236) times. I will analyze how participants used source texts, focusing on their understanding of whether citing was required or not.

# Reasons mentioned more frequently for citing texts borrowed

The present students, as a group, seemed to mention some reasons for taking something from the source text more frequently for citing and others more frequently for not citing. The only reason that did not favor either citing or not citing was background information that was mentioned three times for citing and three times for not citing. Figure 1 presents the eight reasons mentioned more frequently by students to explain why a unit of textual borrowing was acknowledged.

# Securing support for one’s writing

Support was the most frequently mentioned reason (48) by students for using source texts with citations (Figure 1). The two occasions when it was mentioned for not citing were double coded with reasons of no need to cite everything and result of learning that typically led to no citations. Among those referring to support as the main reason for citing, many commented on how they searched for materials to cite from various published authors to support their arguments.

a Students mentioned in 236 instances how they relied on source texts. Among them, 122 were accompanied with explanations of whether they used source texts by quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing.

The following is a typical example of how Jane took pains to find something to cite.2

Example 1

A unit of textual appropriation in Jane’s paper titled ‘Domination of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japanese Politics’:

Keeping the dominance in the diet [parliament] made LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] able to influence the policies dramatically.

Figure 2: Leading reasons given for use of source text, when not citing

The dominant party is generally able to get its own way in policymaking issues in the parliament. (Stockwin 1998: 121)

Jane’s reason for citing, which has been classified as an instance of support:

This is something else that I got from the textbook . . . I have to find what was said previously to back up my writing. So that’s why I keep putting in references. . . . I had this idea that if you have dominance in the Diet, you must have big influence in the parliament. I just assume that it should be the case but I was just worried because it might not be the case. So I just went through all the books trying to find if somebody was actually saying the same thing. . . . So those are the little things that I went through and made me so tired.

The fatigue Jane expressed at the end shows the enormous time and energy she had spent searching for citations that would support her basic intuition about parliamentary influence. Jane’s comment suggests that she had learned to both trust and check her insights, even as she realized that further evidence beyond her own hunches needed to be found and included in her work. This contrasts markedly with the participant in Thompson (2005) who felt that it was necessary to always find a support because, as a student, he had nothing original to contribute, Jane seemed to have a scholarly sense of following one’s hunches, with enough confidence that one did not give up until either finding the evidence or realizing it was not there.

The students’ interest in securing support from source texts was also evident when in 12 instances participants commented on how they presented a key point through the voice of a cited author. For example, in explaining how she argued for the importance of parents’ encouragement for kids learning to play the piano, Cathy said that she decided to use the citation ‘to show it was an important factor’. The reliance on source texts to frame important points was also shown in five instances of students citing research findings and 15 instances of drawing information from a credible source. Martin believed that citations ‘gave some authenticity or authority over [his] essay’. Like Martin, Carol explained that she cited from Milroy and Milroy (1999) about how English was an essential tool for working-class children because ‘quotes or citations . . . [had] been proven and recognized’. By using such a citation, Carol said her message was that ‘[i]t is not just what I am saying, it is from a published author’. These comments reveal how students draw on others to show that they are not alone in thinking and thus to gain credit for their own writing.

# Learning to cite

Students were also motivated to cite materials for two additional reasons related to what I am terming learning (Figure 1). As learners, the participants chose to cite when they recalled teachers’ preference for extensive citation (5) or when they saw source texts as others’ words and ideas that were worth quoting directly (37). In the following example, Edward explained how he attributed the ownership of the word ‘localization’ to an author (the co-authors of the original text were missing in both his writing and comment):

Example 2

A unit of textual appropriation in Edward’s paper titled ‘Nowhere to Turn: Drug Abuse as a Cause of Homelessness and Poverty in Vancouver’:

In his essay ‘‘Drug Dealers,’’ Caulkins describes the ‘‘localization’’ of certain areas of the city for drug use as a major problem leading to the augmented organization of drug dealers in Vancouver (Caulkins 326).

Edward’s reason for quoting, which has been classified as an instance of other’s words:

I used quotations for ‘‘localization’’ because it’s a word Caulkins used. It is his word. . . . He describes the ‘‘localization’’ of certain areas of the city for drug use . . . I usually cite if it’s something that most people wouldn’t use. . . . Just like if I was to hear ‘‘localization’’ before, I probably wouldn’t know it means that much before reading.

It is interesting to note that Edward felt that the original author owned the word because any average person like himself would not have used the word in such a context. Also regarding themselves as average people, Martin and Mark said that citing words from published authors would save them the trouble of providing supporting details. As a student, Martin said that instructors always cast doubt on ideas he claimed as his own. For example, in explaining why he cited Hirsch (1990) when writing about Woody Allen’s family, Martin said ‘If I didn’t cite that, the instructor would say, ‘‘Where did you get this? Who said this? How did you know who said this?’’’ In comparison, Mark acknowledged the sources when ‘the language is powerful’ because, as he explained, ‘If you just present something really stunning people won’t believe you’. Mark’s lack of confidence in using his own words echoed that of L2 students in previous studies (e.g. Ange´ lil-Carter 2000; Chandrasoma et al. 2004).

Learning ‘facts’ and ‘new information’ in various academic disciplines

Compared with the above reasons, students were divided on whether fact and new information required citing, although they favored citing (Figure 1). The participants distinguished facts (things exist or performed) from ideas and opinions. For example, Edward interpreted chemical characteristics of drugs as facts that had to be cited, whereas Eddy regarded current or historical events as facts that needed no acknowledgement. The different decisions made by students imply that the debt owed to authors for facts differs across disciplines. If facts about drugs are derived from scientific research, facts of current or historical events are public knowledge. Students’ citing behaviors are thus connected to their variable learning and practices in different disciplinary communities.

Like the notion of fact, the concept of new information reveals the role of individual learning experiences. For example, the present students cited such new information as:

‘Influences from early in our lives such as childhood trauma . . . or alcohol abuse can contribute to initial experimentation with a drug’ [a citation given by Edward and the material to which the citation applied came from Jones (1998)];   
‘The most significant side effects of antibiotics, however, is [sic] the depression of the immune system’ [a citation given by Mark and the material to which the citation applied came from Hauser and Reminngton (1982)]; and   
that the reformed Indian Constitution ‘articulated the principle of equality of all citizens irrespective of caste, community, race or sex’ [a citation given by Rose and the material to which the citation applied came from Desai (1973)].

One can easily imagine that, on the one hand, some of these students’ peers might not consider such information as new knowledge and, on the other hand, the same students might choose not to cite later when they become acquainted with such information. By comparing students’ citing behaviors, the present study suggests a dynamic process of learning and claiming ownership of knowledge. Judgements on textual appropriation, whether appreciated or illegitimate, are grounded in the context of epistemologically and socially constructed academic literacies.

# Reasons mentioned more frequently for not citing texts borrowed

Since all of the reasons were offered to explain chunks of texts which the students identified as appropriated, a citation would be expected in every case. It is, therefore, highly significant to examine cases when students did not give a citation. Of the 14 reasons for using source texts, five were mentioned more often for not citing than citing (Figure 2).

# Interpreting source information as common knowledge/term

$\mathrm { ~ I n ~ } 1 5$ instances, the present students interpreted source texts as common knowledge/term and, therefore, did not cite them in their writing (Figure 2). For example, Cathy said that she did not cite the statement that ‘musical success is an innate gift’ which she read from a book because it was ‘something that [she had] grown up with’. Other appropriated texts that students considered common knowledge included statements that ‘the industrial policy [of the government] is the driving force for economic growth [of Japan]’ (Kate); that ‘[t]he baby boom that took place from the mid 1940s throughout France had created, by the middle of the 1960s, many thousands of new undergraduates’ (Carl); and that ‘the human use of antibiotics helped the natural selection of bacteria’ (Mark). The following example illustrates how May generalized Starbucks’ way of preparing coffee to a common sense of how to keep food fresh:

Example 3

A unit of textual appropriation in May’s paper titled ‘Starbucks Coffee’:

Moreover, Starbucks prepare the coffee beans in a sanitary and safe environment that keeps the coffee fresh.

May’s reason for not citing, which has been classified as an instance of common knowledge:

I got this from the book. . . . But actually it’s kind of common sense because you have to put food in a bag or something so it doesn’t go stale. I think it’s just kind of related to all the food.

Compared with May and those students who distinguished common knowledge based on their own understandings and interpretations, other students made similar decisions based on whether the source information was introduced in a textbook (Eddy) or a lecture (Mark), or frequently mentioned in reading materials (Jane). Jane, for example, did not cite the appropriated text about the dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan because, in her words, ‘I read them in so many places and textbooks so I thought that was just like a general understanding of this whole issue.’ Such comments illustrate that when certain information is recognized by students as public or owned by many, it becomes base knowledge of which students would claim ownership. Although previous research has also reported how one student did not cite common knowledge acquired through personal experiences (Chandrasoma et al. 2004), the present study provides insights of how a group of students across disciplines arrive at such an interpretation in each specific case.

# Learning not to cite

Students also attributed some of their decisions not to cite to various learning experiences (Figure 2). Specifically, they chose not to cite when the appropriated texts matched their knowledge accumulated as a result of learning (18) or was something they believed not worth citing otherwise they had to cite everything (11). To avoid using too many citations, three students (Carol, Cary, and Martin) said that they did not cite a reference cited earlier in the paper or included in the reference list. As an example, Cary referred to her learning experiences when commenting on the following unit of textual appropriation:

Example 4

A unit of textual appropriation in Cary’s paper titled ‘One Type of Spontaneous Mutations is Point Mutation’:

However, spontaneous mutation occurs more frequently than induced because spontaneous mutations can occur simply due to natural radiation, and during replication in DNA.

Cary’s reason for not citing, which has been classified as instances of the result of learning and no need to cite everything:

Well, I didn’t cite these because I know that there is natural radiation. . . . I got it from lecture and the books I used. . . . I learned since I was in high school. . . . I don’t think we really have to cite everything, right?

Although the above comment might be interpreted as common knowledge, it is coded as result of learning based on Cary’s own account of how she learned the information in high school. Like Cary, Eddy explained that he did not cite the term ‘unitary actors’ because it was ‘a part of lingo of political science [he had] been studying for a number of years’. Also commenting on the development of one’s own knowledge based on learning, Carol said, ‘When you read an article, you absorb the ideas then it becomes your own’. The participants believed that they were entitled to claim ownership of words and ideas learnt previously or internalized. As two other students explained explicitly when commenting on certain texts appropriated, ‘I’ve learned this in class so it is considered personal knowledge’ (Carmen); ‘I know it before then I don’t think I really have to cite it’ (Cary). These explanations for not citing illustrate how citation practices go hand in hand with students’ learning and accumulation of knowledge.

Claiming authorship of ideas and learning to construct knowledge

Compared with the above reasons, the reason to use course texts to form one’s own point was bidirectional (for both citing and not citing) though it was mentioned more often for not citing than citing (Figure 2). Among those who mentioned how they appropriated texts to form their own points, Carmen, in his Biology research paper, explained how he came up with the statement about ‘a direct relationship between light intensity and accumulation of newrosecretions’ based on the information from Cymborosky (1983) that ‘accumulation of neurosecretions is the highest during the night when crickets are supported to move at the highest levels’. In Carmen’s words, ‘I came up with this based on what this person found. . . . So it was what I inferred from the study. This was what I came up with myself’. Although it was arguable how different the two statements were, Carmen believed that, as a legitimate process of learning and constructing knowledge, he was entitled to take the ownership of the inference he made. Carmen’s choice also reveals, as one anonymous reviewer of the paper noted by citing from Sinclair (1986) and Tadros (1993), an intention to aver or to put forward a claim on the basis of one’s own authority.

Unlike Carmen, other students mentioned how they appropriated texts to form their own points together with other reasons for either citing or not citing. The relevant cases further illustrate how students support or claim their ownership of ideas in the context of learning. For example, Mark cited a reliable or credible source to support his understanding that antibiotics can be harmful. In comparison, Cary, in the following example, claimed ownership of the knowledge of point mutation in DNA as a result of learning and, therefore, did not cite the source:

Example 5

A unit of textual appropriation in Cary’s paper titled ‘One Type of Spontaneous Mutations is Point Mutation’:

Point mutation also divides into different categories that include base-pair substitution in the DNA, and insertion of deletion in a base pair. Base pair mutation happens when there is a replacement of one nucleotide in a chain of amino acids. . .

Cary’s reasons for not citing, which have been classified as instances of forming one’s own point and result of learning:

I know it from a course last term. I just vaguely remember it.   
I think it’s mine, the idea and wording. I think it’s just my idea.

The above examples illustrate how students might make different citation decisions when appropriating source texts to form their own points. If students’ citation decisions are based on various combinations of reasons related to their complex process of learning and constructing knowledge, the present findings highlight the important role of self-reflections in exploring the subjective act of citing.

# Quotations, paraphrases and summaries

A total of 122 (out of 236) mentions of reasons were accompanied with students’ explanations of whether the relevant units of textual appropriations were presented as quotes, paraphrases or summaries. Most of these identifications referred to texts cited (Table 4). Of the 122 mentions, only 14 (3 for paraphrases, 11 for summaries) were for texts not cited, which was about 18 per cent of total mentions (77, Table 3) for not citing. In addition, probably because quotations were visible, about 86 (out of 122) mentions were for textual borrowing quoted, leaving only 36 for texts either paraphrased (17) or summarized (19).

a Of the 236 units or instances in which students explained how they relied on source texts, 122 were accompanied with explanations of whether they used source texts by quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing, whereas 114 were left unexplained.

Limited identifications for formats of textual borrowing

The limited identifications for the formats of textual borrowing not cited or as paraphrases or summaries are worth noting. During the interviews, when prompted to identify how they appropriated the source texts, some students failed to do so with typical responses, such as ‘I remember reading about that but I don’t remember whether I rephrased it or not’ (Polly), or ‘The idea is from the source but I don’t remember I used the words or not’ (Carol). Martin said he could not specify whether an appropriated text about Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen’s childhood was paraphrased or summarized because he ‘got the idea from different books’. Such responses or excuses could suggest students’ hesitations in talking to the researcher about how they missed the citations at the interview, an indication of the epistemological status of the data.

One might also think that these students need to upgrade their note-taking skills so as to record source information accurately (e.g. Pecorari 2003). However, a close reading of students’ comments revealed that their inability to remember the source was frequently mentioned together with reasons for using source texts to present result of learning and common knowledge or term which typically led to no citations. For example, arguing that it was impossible and unnecessary to remember and cite all source information, Eddy said, ‘I guess my vocabulary was applied to IR (International Relationship). It’s part of me now. Obviously it was something that I picked up through a lecturer, through experts, but I couldn’t tell you where I got that because it’s just part of my vocabulary.’ Eddy’s comment implies that while some borrowed texts could be accurately cited by improving the note taking process, others are appropriated without acknowledgement deliberately by students who choose to establish their own voice by claiming ownership of the relevant knowledge or achievement of academic literacies.

# Understanding the roles of summaries, quotes and paraphrases

In instances when students did identify the format of their textual borrowing, some described how they arrived at such decisions. Students’ accounts suggest that while summaries were used to report a large amount of information concisely, quotes and paraphrases seemed to play different roles to individual students. For example, some students said that quoting was chosen over paraphrasing when they ‘did not know how to paraphrase it’ (Carl) or could not ‘think of another way to say it’ (Cathy). In comparison, when explaining their choices of paraphrasing over quoting, Rose and Carmen said that paraphrasing was the skill preferred at the university compared with quoting which they learned to use at high school. Two other students, Elmer and Carol, said that they chose to use paraphrases when citing secondary sources because they did not know if they could use quotations for such information. In the following account, Polly said she decided to paraphrase because she believed that quoting was not appropriate at the beginning of the paper:

Example 6

Polly’s reason for paraphrasing a unit of textual borrowing

I rephrased these from the article. . . . I think I maybe copied that word for word and then rephrased it. I changed the wording around a bit and then cited it. Because it’s really early in the paper, and I figure it would have looked really silly to start quoting . . . It doesn’t look as nice, I think. It’s really a general introduction and background.

Concern for plagiarism

While explaining their choices between paraphrasing and quoting, some students expressed a concern for plagiarism or an uncertainty about whether they had paraphrased some source texts enough. Although they believed that quoting was irrelevant when they changed the source text slightly, these students were uncomfortable when they noted a close resemblance between the source texts and their writing. As an example, the following is a comparison of the source text and the unit of textual borrowing that Polly commented on in the previous quote (words identical in Polly’s text and source text are highlighted):

Example 6 (continued)

A unit of textual appropriation in Polly’s paper titled ‘GM Crops or Franken Foods: An analysis of the Rhetoric of Activis’:

The first successful cross-species gene transfer to plants took place in the early $1 9 8 0 ^ { \prime } s$ , and by 1998 more than 26 percent of the cotton and 40 percent of the soybean acreage in the US was planted with GM crops. (Shields 2000)

The corresponding source text from Shields (2000: 18):

The first successful gene transfers in plants took place in the early 1980’s, and by 1998 more than 26 percent of the cotton and 40 percent of the soybean acreage in the US was planted with GM crops containing a gene for herbicide resistance.

Noticing the direct copying in their writing such as the above, Polly and other students (e.g. Carmen, Eddy, Mark), wondered whether they should have quoted the source texts. In the following comment, Eddy also expressed uncertainty about whether he should have acknowledged the source when summarizing the information about how an Iraqi citizen would be eliminated if he/she openly criticized Saddam Hussein:

I got my idea from The Economist. . . . I mean, I took it from their argument but incorporated it into my own . . . overarching description of the situation. . . . And I guess that’s sort of a borderline. If you really want to be strict, then I probably should have quoted or cited that. . . . Use the judgment call. ‘Am I plagiarizing or not?’ Maybe I should have cited that.

The concern about plagiarism expressed by Eddy and others further explains the limited identifications of the format of textual borrowing among the present students. Participants might be reluctant to identify how they borrowed source texts because they were not sure how much to paraphrase, so the relevant text did not need to be quoted, nor were they sure if it was OK not to cite when certain information was summarized using entirely one’s own words. In addition, they might not want to talk about their plagiarized texts with the researcher who might disagree with them on this sensitive issue. The epistemological status of the data complicates the findings of a dynamic learning process of choosing between not only citing and not citing but also quoting and paraphrasing. As the process is a blind spot for teachers, students have to rely on their own judgement call in making these choices.

# CONCLUSION

The present study illustrates the sophistication and range of the participating students’ understanding of the role of textual borrowing and citation by analyzing students’ self-reflections on not only units of textual appropriation cited but also those not cited. Results show that the citing behaviors of novice scholarly writers (in the case of undergraduates) are guided by a complex set of factors including functional uses of cited works, citers’ interpretations of source texts, a learning process to accumulate one’s own knowledge and textual capital, as well as a choice between quoting and paraphrasing. The study indicates the extent to which students attempt to maintain a balance between a reliance on source texts for support and an attempt to establish their own voice by choosing not to cite. On the one hand, the participants cited source texts that contained similar ideas so that their opinions were bolstered and secured. On the other hand, the participants understood that not everything needed to be cited and would simply draw on, rather than cite directly, source texts that matched either common knowledge or what they had learnt previously. Students’ citational acts are situated in a learning context where certain information seems supportive or irrelevant, new or learnt, owned by a particular author or shared by many others. As there are no fixed rules, some participants wondered when a citation would be appropriate and whether they should quote or paraphrase texts borrowed.

Citing a source text is more than providing a name and a date; it is a subjective process of deciding how to make meaning out of the available resources. Students are still learning the general principles and guidelines. As they learn the parameters of appropriate use, students can easily go across the unmarked borders of appropriate borrowing and lapse into unintentional plagiarism. For example, some people might disagree with Cary who considered spontaneous mutation that occurs during replication in DNA as knowledge learnt previously, and therefore did not cite the source when presenting the information; others would see Polly’s text (Example 6), though cited, as almost a direct copy of the original text and, therefore, a clear example of plagiarism. The present study suggests that appropriate or inappropriate textual borrowing cannot be determined by general context-free criteria. The judgement is negotiated, localized, and contingent. Given the students’ understanding of appropriate citation found among this sample, students’ textual appropriation, appropriate or inappropriate, could be viewed as evidence that students are learning this important academic writing skill of intertextuality and learning about it in ways that relate to the expression of their own ideas and acquisition of academic literacies.

Like other studies that focus on participants’ post hoc self-reports, the present data analyses might have not represented students’ citation practices with accuracy. Holstein and Gubrium (2004), among many others, have pointed out that responses from the interviewees represent a dynamic meaning-making process done in collaboration with the interviewer or in the direction designed by the interviewer. For example, participants might have also used ‘familiar narrative constructs’ to comment on their textual appropriation rather than providing the lived experiences or ‘meaningful insights into their subjective view’ (Miller and Glassner 2004: 127). As I pointed out earlier, some students might have hesitated to comment on their textual borrowing for fear that the interviewer would disagree with their citation practices. Readers are thus advised to be aware of the epistemological status of the interview data.

Despite the limitations, the study sheds some light on how and why some students borrow texts and, therefore, provides teaching implications. Instructors are advised to use specific examples or cases, such as those identified in the present study, to help students learn how to make value judgements around the use of prior texts based on the degree to which those texts belong to others, or represent either new or common knowledge. Since there is no hard and fast set of rules on citation practices in scholarly texts, students need assistance or direct instruction. I tried out this teaching strategy in a university writing workshop where the discussion on whether to cite or not to cite in each case aroused heated discussions. Many students said it was their first experience to discuss, share, and clarify their individual and subjective acts of textual borrowing.

The present study also generates implications for follow-up research. One research focus could be on how citing behaviors mark high-level students’ (juniors, seniors, or grad students) development of disciplinary knowledge. Case studies comparing students’ self-reflections on their use of citations in a longer period of time would identify how students learn to use citations as standard symbols of their discipline and shape their own positions among recognized networks of references. Another research focus could be the teacher’s perceptions of the students’ citing behaviors in terms of, for example, how successful the student writers are in learning the conventional citing forms and whether they are right to omit citations for information they think is common knowledge. Relevant findings would reveal disciplinerelated differences that may well speak to distinctions that instructors in these fields may wish to address directly with students. Together, these studies should build up a theory of citing as a process of learning for novice academic writers.

# SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Supplementary data is available at Applied Linguistics online.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This study is part of a larger project on students’ textual appropriation funded by a Standard Research Grant of Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. I thank the participating students, Sin Heng Celine Sze for her help in transcribing and analyzing the data, and John Willinsky, Lynne Earls, and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on an earlier draft of the article.

# NOTES

1 One student (Kate) referred to four of her units as translations from a source in her first language. Another student (Martin) said he created a quote himself but attributed it to a credible author. Since these cases raise different issues and also represent a small proportion of the data, I decided not to deal with them in the present analyses.
