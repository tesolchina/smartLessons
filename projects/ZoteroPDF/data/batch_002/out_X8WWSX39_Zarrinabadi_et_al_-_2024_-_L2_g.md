# ABSTRACT

This article reports on a study that examined the relationship between language learners’ L2 grit and language mindsets and their attitudes toward CALL. The participants of the study were 625 EFL learners $( \mathsf { m a l e } = 1 6 5 , \ 2 6 . 4 \% )$ female $=$ 460, $7 3 . 6 \% )$ ) with the mean age of 24.4 years $\left( S D = 1 . 7 4 \right)$ ). They were asked to respond to questionnaires on language mindsets, L2 grit, and attitudes toward CALL. The data were analyzed through regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicated that fixed mindsets predicted the effectiveness of CALL negatively and exhibition to CALL positively, whereas growth mindsets positively predicted the effectiveness of CALL. The results also indicated that persistence of effort positively predicted surplus value of CALL and teacher’s influence on CALL, and consistency of interest predicted degree of exhibition to CALL.

# Introduction

Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is becoming more and more popular due to the growing tendency among learners to use the Internet and their computer screens for their learning activities. Research has shown that learners might have different beliefs about the effectiveness and usefulness of CALL (Ayres, 2002; Stevens, 1991; Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009; Wiebe & Kabata, 2010), most of which are positive about its effectiveness. While a considerable bulk of research has been done to understand learners’ perceptions of CALL (e.g. Ayres, 2002; Christie, 2001; Heller, 2005; Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009) or to compare students and teachers’ perceptions with each other (e.g. Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009; Wiebe & Kabata, 2010), less research is conducted on the antecedents of these perceptions. Recently, research in educational technology has showed that learners’ characteristics related to how to deal with failure and setback and perseverance in learning can influence their beliefs about electronic learning (e.g. Aparicio et  al., 2017). In regards to language learning, however, there are little indications in the literature on how such characteristics can influence language learners’ perceptions and attitudes about CALL. For example, there are little indications in the literature what ideas the learners with growth mindsets have about CALL and its effectiveness, or whether learners with fixed mindsets do not use CALL a lot or whether they use it because it is less anxiety-provoking than face-to-face classes. Moreover, it is not evident what persistent language learners think about the effectiveness of CALL and its surplus value. In this article, we argue that learners’ beliefs about fixed or malleability of language ability (i.e. fixed and growth mindsets, Lou & Noels, 2017, 2020; Noels & Lou, 2015) and their perseverance and passion for long-term goals (i.e. grit, Duckworth et  al., 2007; Teimouri et  al., 2022) have the potential to predict learners’ attitudes about the effectiveness of CALL and its surplus value, the role of teacher in CALL, and degree of exhibition to CALL. Therefore, this study examined the structural relations between language mindsets, L2 grit, and attitudes toward CALL.

# Language mindsets

The notion of mindsets is rooted in the ideas of educational psychologist, Carol Dweck, who believed that people have implicit theories or mindsets about different human characteristics such as leadership, intelligence, and personality (Dweck, 2006; Dweck & Leggett, 1988). Dweck believed that individuals have two primary mindsets (implicit theories). These include growth mindset or incremental theory, which is concerned with the idea that one’s ability is malleable and people can improve that ability by hard work and employing suitable strategies, and fixed mindset or entity theory which points to the idea that ability is stable and cannot be altered (Dweck, 2006; Dweck & Leggett, 1988). The notion of mindsets was introduced to language learning and teaching in the 2010s (Lou & Noels, 2017; Mercer & Ryan, 2010; Noels & Lou, 2015), and the research on the implications of language mindsets for language learning and teaching is increasing rapidly (see Lou & Noels, 2020; Lou & Zarrinabadi, 2021 for a review). A growth language mindset denotes that one’s language ability is changeable and can be improved by hard work and using learning strategies, whereas a fixed language mindset refers to the belief that language ability is unchangeable and one has a relatively stable level of language ability which cannot be altered much (Lou & Noels, 2019, 2020; Noels & Lou, 2015). Past research has shown that growth mindsets positively predict learning goals and mastery responses (Lou & Noels, 2017), writing motivation and feedback-seeking behavior (Waller & Papi, 2017), self-efficacy (Bai & Guo, 2021), effort regulation (Bai et  al., 2021), feedback inquiry (Papi et  al., 2020), development avoidance and approach (Papi et al., 2019) and grammar learning strategies and grammar scores (Zarrinabadi et  al., 2021); while fixed language mindsets positively predict factors including cost of feedback-seeking (Papi et  al., 2020), feedback avoiding behavior (Waller & Papi, 2017) and fear of failure (Lou & Noels, 2020). Past research has also ideated that growth mindsets are negatively correlated with anxiety (Bai et  al., 2019) and fear of failure (Lou & Noels, 2017). In contrast, fixed mindsets are negatively correlated with learning goals and mastery responses (Lou & Noels, 2017) and willingness to communicate (Zarrinabadi, Lou et  al., 2021).

# L2 grit

Grit has recently been introduced as a welcome appendage to the language learning literature (see Teimouri et  al., 2022). The notion of grit was originally conceptualized by Duckworth et  al. (2007) as perseverance and passion for achieving long-term and higher-order goals. Specifically, Duckworth et  al. (2007) describe grit as ‘working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress’ (pp. 1087–1088). Early research on grit has shown that it can significantly predict learners’ achievement (Duckworth et  al., 2007; Duckworth & Quinn, 2009). Duckworth et  al. (2007) state that grit includes two fundamental constructs: consistency of interest and perseverance of effort. The former refers to the individual’s consistency of passion to achieve their higher-order goals even after failures, challenges, and obstacles, while the latter refers to one’s tendency to invest energy and effort over long periods of time (Duckworth et  al., 2007; Duckworth & Gross, 2014). Past research has shown that grit correlates positively with personality traits (Credé et  al., 2017), well-being (Datu et  al., 2016), and engagement (Datu et  al., 2016), and is a significant predictor of achievement in different domains (Duckworth et  al., 2007).

During the past few years, several studies have examined grit in regards to language learning and teaching (Alamer, 2021; Changlek & Palanukulwong, 2015; Chen et  al., 2021; Feng & Papi, 2020; Kramer et  al., 2017; Lake, 2013; Robins, 2019; Teimouri et  al., 2022; Wei et  al., 2019; Yamashita, 2018). These studies indicated that high levels of grit are positively associated with higher subjective happiness, hope, curiosity, and flourishing (Lake, 2013), motivation (Changlek & Palanukulwong, 2015), vocabulary learning (Kramer et  al., 2017), ideal L2 self (Feng & Papi, 2020), growth mindsets, joy, and WTC (Teimouri et  al., 2022), and negatively correlated with anxiety (Changlek & Palanukulwong, 2015) and fixed mindsets (Khajavy et  al., 2021; Teimouri et  al., 2022). The research findings also showed a positive, but weak, correlation between English scores and grit (Robins, 2019; Wei et al., 2019; Yamashita, 2018). Finally, past research has also indicated that persistence of effort and consistency of interest are positively correlated with growth mindsets (Khajavy et  al., 2021; Teimouri et  al., 2022) and negatively correlated with fixed mindsets (Khajavy et  al., 2021). Based on these findings, we expected that growth mindsets would correlate with L2 grit positively and fixed mindsets would correlate with it negatively.

# Attitudes toward CALL

There is ample evidence in the literature that CALL is an effective method for teaching language, particularly regarding skills such as reading, writing, or spelling. A review of the CALL literature has shown that CALL researchers follow three main lines of inquiry: (1) research on software to find the best strategies for software design, (2) research on the learning tasks and how to structure them so as to create optimal learning conditions, and (3) research on learners, their interaction with the electronic learning environment, and the role of their individual differences (Chapelle, 2003; Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009). The research on the role of individual differences has shown that factors such as attitudes (Ayres, 2002; Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009), motivation (Lamb & Arisandy, 2020; Ushioda, 2011), and anxiety (Bashori et  al., 2020; Hong et  al., 2020; Kessler, 2010) play an essential role in learners’ engagement and interaction with CALL.

This study aimed to examine learners’ attitudes toward CALL and their links with language mindsets and L2 grit. To this end, we used the CALL attitudes model and scale by Vandewaetere and Desmet (2009) to understand learners’ attitudes toward CALL. Their scale includes attitudes toward the effectiveness of CALL, which is concerned with the extent to which learners perceive CALL to be effective for L2 learning (Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009). Moreover, teacher influence deals with the extent to which teachers’ attitudes, encouragement, and enthusiasm influence learners’ attitudes toward CALL, while the degree of exhibition to CALL is concerned with the inhibition or exhibition that learners feel when they want to use CALL. Vandewaetere and Desmet (2009) used this set of beliefs to understand learners’ ideas about the extent to which using CALL, versus face-to-face communication, creates anxiety, shyness or confidence in learners when trying to learn L2 via computers. Finally, surplus value of CALL is concerned with the idea that CALL has positive effects on learning because it gives more flexibility to learning (Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009).

# This study

In this study, we predicted that growth language mindsets would positively predict attitudes toward CALL as research has shown that growth language mindsets are positively related to approach goals and intention to learn and continue (Lou & Noels, 2017). We also predicted that fixed mindsets would negatively predict attitudes toward CALL because those who believe that language ability cannot be changed would probably see less use in doing computerized activities to improve one’s language ability. Also, as fixed mindset is positively associated with anxiety (Bai et  al., 2019), we hypothesized that it would positively predict degree of exhibition to CALL since it provokes less anxiety in the model by Vandewaetere and Desmet (2009).

We also hypothesized that L2 grit would positively predict attitudes toward CALL as those who make more effort and are interested in language learning would probably perceive CALL activities useful and effective, see surplus value in it, and would probably use CALL more when they are encouraged by their teacher. Research has also indicated that grit is positively linked with satisfaction with e-learning and its quality (Aparicio et  al., 2017). Moreover, we predict that those who keep interest in language learning would probably feel less inhibited to use computers for language learning and would show higher exhibition to CALL and computerized learning activities. Overall, the following research questions were investigated in the current study.

1. How do growth language mindsets predict attitudes toward CALL? 2. How do fixed language mindsets predict attitudes toward CALL? 3. How does L2 grit (consistency of interest and perseverance of effort) predict attitudes toward CALL?

# Method

# Participants and procedure

The participants of the study were 625 EFL learners from different language institutes in Isfahan, Iran. They were both male and female students $( \mathrm { m a l e } ~ = ~ 1 6 5 , ~ 2 6 . 4 \%$ ; female $= 4 6 0 , 7 3 . 6 \%$ with the mean age of 24.4 years $\langle S D = 1 . 7 4 \rangle$ ). All participants were volunteers and were Farsi native speakers. The participants proficiency level was intermediate based on the results of Oxford Placement Test (OPT). All of the students had experience learning English using online platforms and were taking online general English classes at the time of data collection (Covid-19 era). We distributed the questionnaire items using a google form link. The items of the questionnaire were all in English. We included a consent form on the first page of the online questionnaire and asked the respondents to approve it prior to answering the items. The process of data collection took about 2.5 months, from November 2020 to mid-January 2021.

# Instruments

# Language mindsets inventory

We adapted 12 items from the mindset scale used in previous studies (e.g. Dweck, 1999; Lou & Noels, 2017,  2019, see the Appendix). The respondents answered six fixed mindset items and six growth mindset items on a six-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Example items included ‘Your foreign language ability is something about you that you cannot change very much’ (fixed mindset) and ‘How good you are at using a foreign language will always improve if you really work on it’ (growth mindset).

# L2 grit scale

The language-specific grit scale developed and validated by Teimouri et  al. (2022) was used to measure L2 grit. This six-point Likert-type scale measured two aspects of grit, including persistence of effort and consistency of interest. Five items were used to measure persistence of effort (e.g. ‘I put much time and effort into improving my English language weaknesses’). Four items were used to assess consistency of interest (e.g. ‘I am not as interested in learning English as I used to be’ reverse scored).

# Attitude towards CALL questionnaire

In order to examine the participants’ attitude towards use and effectiveness of CALL, twelve items from Vandewaetere and Desmet (2009) were employed to measure effectiveness of CALL vs. non-CALL (3 items, e.g. ‘Learning a foreign language assisted by computer is not as good as learning it by oral practice’ reverse-scored), surplus value of CALL (3 items, e.g. ‘My language learning will proceed more when this is assisted by a computer’), teacher influence (3 items, e.g. ‘Teachers attitude towards CALL largely defines my attitude towards the use of computers in language learning’), and degree of exhibition to CALL (3 items, e.g. ‘I feel less inhibited when communicating in the foreign language via computer (chat) than in a face-to-face situation’). All items were measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree).

# Data analysis

We used IBM SPSS 22 for preliminary data cleaning and screening and also calculating descriptive statistics. In addition, we utilized AMOS 24 to perform confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). To determine the best-fitting model, we used a combination of fit indices such as Chi-square Goodness of Fit $( \chi ^ { 2 } )$ , Normed Chi-square $( \chi ^ { 2 } / d f = 1 - 3 )$ ), Comparative Fit Index $\mathrm { { C F I } } \ \cong \ 0 . 9 0 )$ , Standardized Root Mean Square Residual $( \mathrm { S R M R } ~ \leq ~ 0 . 0 8 )$ ), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA $\leq 0 . 0 6$ ; Brown, 2006; Hu & Bentler, 1999). Moreover, we used Cohen’s $f ^ { \ 2 }$ to determine the effect sizes with the following estimates: $f ^ { 2 } = . 0 2$ small effect; $f ^ { 2 } = . 1 5$ medium effect; and $f ^ { 2 } = . 3 5$ large effect (Cohen, 1992).

# Results

# Preliminary analyses

Descriptive statistics including the number of items in each construct, range, mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis are provided in Table 1. The normality assumption was met since skewness and kurtosis values were within the acceptable range of $\pm 2 . 0$ $( \mathrm { K i m }$ , 2013). There were no missing values since all items were set as required in the online questionnaire. Moreover, we identified univariate outliers via standard scores and detected multivariate outliers using Mahalanobis $\mathrm { D } ^ { 2 }$ (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2018). As a result, 23 outliers were removed from the data set and 602 valid cases were kept for further analyses.

# Assessing the measurement model

In order to assess the construct validity of the scales used in this study, the items of each scale were subject to CFA using AMOS 24. Following Kline (2015), the CFA models were modified by omitting the items which had factor loadings lower than .40. In addition, the modification indices were observed for each CFA model and the corresponding error variables were correlated. The fit indices for the final CFA models are presented in Table 2. In the first step, the mindsets scale’s structural validity was checked using a two-factor model of fixed and growth mindsets. All 12 items had loadings above .60. The error variances of items growth1 and growth2 were correlated. As reported in Table 2, the final model had a good fit.

Next, using a two-factor model, the structural validity of the L2 grit scale was examined. The two constructs were persistence of effort and consistency of interest. We had to remove item coi1 from the consistency of interest subscale due to the low factor loading of .36. Additionally, as suggested by modification indices for the persistence of effort subscale, we correlated the error variances of poe1 and poe2 and also poe3 and poe4. The final model for the L2 grit scale included 8 items and achieved an excellent fit (see Table 2).

Additionally, the construct validity of the CALL scale was assessed using a four-factor model which comprised of effectiveness, surplus value, teacher influence, and degree of exhibition (3 items each). CFA results demonstrated that all items were highly loaded on their respective constructs with no factor loadings lower than .61. As shown in Table 2, the CFA model for this scale indicated an excellent fit.

Finally, in addition to individual CFAs, we conducted a complete CFA model with three constructs altogether. This CFA model achieved an excellent fit: $\chi ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ 2 9 1 5 . 7 8 2 \ :$ , $d f = 1 2 8 1$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / d f = 2 . 2 7 6$ , $\mathrm { C F I } ~ = ~ . 9 4 6$ , $\mathrm { S R M R } \ = \ . 0 6 2$ , RMSEA $=$ .046. Moreover, the complete CFA allowed us to investigate the discriminant validity of the whole measurement model via the latent correlations among all variables (see Table 3).

Table 3 reports the Cronbach’s $\mathtt { a }$ , composite reliability (CR), the average variance extracted (AVE), maximum shared variance (MSV), square root of the AVE, latent correlations, and heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT). As shown in Table 3, the reliability indices ranged from .741 to  .926 for all of the constructs (above .70 is acceptable; Hair et  al., 2010). The latent variables’ AVE ranged from .511 to .806, suggesting acceptable convergent validity as all AVE values were greater than the threshold of .50 (Byrne, 2010). Additionally, the criteria for discriminant validity were met since the square root of the AVEs were larger than the respective correlations and MSVs were lower than the AVEs (Hair et  al., 2010). Besides, HTMT analysis indicated satisfactory discriminant validity as all HTMT values were smaller than .90 (Henseler et  al., 2015).

# Structural equation modeling

In order to examine the role of language mindsets and L2 grit on attitudes towards CALL, the hypothesized structural model was submitted to AMOS 24 with maximum likelihood estimation. As illustrated in Figure 1, in the hypothesized model, mindsets and grit were considered as predictors of attitudes towards CALL with four subscales of effectiveness, surplus value, teacher influence, and degree of exhibition. All possible paths were added in the initial model. SEM results revealed the following fit indices: $\chi ^ { 2 } = 9 3 4 . 4 8 5 , d f = 4 3 3$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / d f { = } 2 . 1 5 8$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 4 9$ , $\operatorname { S R M R } \ = \ . 0 5 0$ , RMSEA $=$ .044.

In the next step, all non-significant paths (shown as gray dashed lines in Figure 1) were removed and the model was tested again. The results of SEM for the corrected model showed an excellent fit to the data: $\chi ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ 9 4 3 . 2 4 5$ , $d f = ~ 4 4 3$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / d f = 2 . 1 2 9$ , $\mathrm { C F I } ~ = ~ . 9 5 $ , $\operatorname { S R M R } \ = \ . 0 5 2$ , $\mathrm { R M S E A } = . 0 4 3$ . The path estimates and the corresponding effect sizes are reported in Table 4.

Results of SEM with regard to mindsets revealed that fixed mindset negatively predicated effectiveness of CALL $( \beta ~ = ~ - ~ . 2 0 , ~ p ~ < ~ . 0 1 , ~ f ~ ^ { 2 } ~ =$ .04, small effect size) and positively predicted degree of exhibition to CALL $( \beta = . 1 0 , p < . 0 5 , f ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 9$ , small effect size). Additionally, growth mindset positively predicated effectiveness of CALL $( \beta = . 3 2 , \ p < . 0 0 1$ , $f ^ { 2 } = . 1 1$ , medium effect size).

As for L2 grit, SEM results showed that persistence of effort positively predicted surplus value of CALL $( \beta = . 1 7$ , $p \ < \ . 0 0 1$ , $\textit { f } ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 9$ , small effect size) and teacher influence $( \beta ~ = ~ . 1 5$ , $p \ < \ . 0 1$ , $\textit { f } ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 2$ , small effect size). Moreover, consistency of interest positively predicted degree of exhibition to CALL $( \beta = . 1 3 , p < . 0 1 , f ^ { 2 } = . 0 1 8 $ , small effect size).

# Discussion

The results indicated that fixed mindsets predicted the effectiveness of CALL negatively, whereas growth mindsets positively predicted it. A probable reason for this finding might be that those individuals who believe that language ability is stable and unchangeable would probably feel that using computers and computer-assisted activities might not help them improve their language ability. In other words, such people may not believe in the effectiveness of CALL as they think that their intended effort and energy investment would not lead to any improvements in their language ability (Lou & Noels, 2017). In contrast, those who endorse a growth mindset would probably believe that using computers and computer-assisted instruction (perhaps in addition to their language learning activities) would help them to improve their language ability. This is generally in line with the previous research which found that growth language mindsets are positively associated with positive beliefs about computer and internet-related instruction (Bai et  al., 2019) and investing more effort for language learning (Lou & Noels, 2017). This study adds to the existing literature that growth mindsets are connected to higher effort and energy investment not only in conventional learning environments (e.g. face to face classrooms) but also in computer-mediated contexts.

In addition, the results also confirm the findings of Zarrinabadi et  al. (2021) in that they show positive correlation between using learning strategies (here computer-assisted activities) and growth language mindsets. In addition, the results of the study revealed that fixed mindsets positively predicted the degree of exhibition to CALL. Having a look at the items related to the degree of exhibition to CALL subscale (e.g. ‘I feel less inhibited when communicating in the foreign language via computer (chat) than in a face-to-face situation’ and ‘in a face-to-face learning situation (classroom) I often experience anxiety when speaking in the foreign language’) shows that this scale mainly deals with the use of CALL due to its level of anxiety compared to face-to-face language use (Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009). Past research has shown that learners with a fixed mindset (versus those with a growth mindset) tend to feel more anxious (Lou & Noels, 2017, 2019, 2020). Thus, it seems reasonable that those with a fixed language mindset prefer to use CALL as it may provoke less anxiety and fear of failure than face-to-face communication.

Moreover, contrary to our expectations, growth mindsets did not predict degree of exhibition to CALL, surplus value of CALL, and teacher influence on CALL; however, the results showed that there was no link between fixed mindsets and teacher influence on CALL which might be because those who believe that language ability is unchangeable might not be affected and encouraged by others’ (e.g. teachers’) beliefs and attitudes. Moreover, those who believe that effort investment and strategy use do not improve language ability (fixed mindset) would probably see no value in employing computer-assisted activities to improve their language knowledge.

As for the relationship between L2 grit and attitudes toward CALL, the results showed that persistence of effort predicted surplus value of CALL and teacher’s influence on CALL, while consistency of interest only predicted degree of exhibition to CALL. This is possibly because those who persistently try to learn English give more value to computer-assisted activities as a way of improving their language ability. Moreover, teachers’ enthusiasm and encouragement can also play a significant role, so learners may try harder to achieve their language learning goals. Therefore, if language teachers attach importance to CALL activities, the learners would probably make more effort to learn L2 via computerized activities. As for the relationship between consistency of interest and degree of exhibition to CALL, it can be argued that those who aim to sustain their interest in learning L2 would probably seek methods that pose less stress and anxiety (e.g. CALL). Given the negative relationship between grit and anxiety (Teimouri et  al., 2022), it seems reasonable that grittier students seek conditions that provoke less anxiety and create a comfortable learning environment. These findings are also in line with the findings of Aparicio et  al. (2017) who reported that grit positively affected satisfaction with e-learning and perceptions about the quality of e-learning.

# Conclusion

This study examined whether L2 grit and language mindsets could predict EFL learners’ attitudes toward CALL. The results indicated that fixed mindsets predicted the effectiveness of CALL negatively, while growth mindsets positively predicted it. Likewise, persistence of effort predicted surplus value of CALL and teacher’s influence on CALL, whereas consistency of interest only predicted degree of exhibition to CALL. It can be concluded from the findings of this study that learners’ implicit theories and psychological characteristics play a significant role in the extent to which they believe in the usefulness and effectiveness of CALL and the extent to which they utilize it for language learning. This study also introduces two new antecedents for learners’ perceptions about the value and effectiveness of CALL (Vandewaetere & Desmet, 2009). Language teachers and teaching programs that wish to create more favorable attitudes toward CALL can use growth mindset interventions to foster learners’ growth mindsets and, consequently, their CALL perceptions. Language teachers can use CALL activities to support learners with different mindsets. For example, fixed mindsets positively correlated with the degree of exhibition probably because CALL activities pose less anxiety and stress. Therefore, teachers can take advantage of CALL to teach English to learners with a fixed mindset who might feel more stress and inhibition in face-to-face activities than in online ones. In addition, since learners’ growth mindsets positively correlated with beliefs about effectiveness of CALL, teachers can use this opportunity to encourage learners. If they want to improve their language ability, one good strategy is to engage in computerized activities made available to them through their teacher or through the software and CDs that accompany their coursebook.

The results of this study can be followed in several ways. Future research is recommended to examine the extent to which learners with fixed and growth mindsets engage in CALL. Moreover, future research can investigate whether grittier students participate more in online and CALL activities. There are indications in the literature that teaching methods such as flipped classroom strategy might positively influence learners’ psychological characteristics (e.g. self-concept, Zarrinabadi & Khodarahmi, 2020). Therefore, future research can examine whether CALL-based teaching techniques can foster growth mindsets and L2 grit in language learners. We also recommend that future research look into the language learners’ experiences of using CALL (e.g. speaking L2 face to face or via computer interfaces) to present a better picture of the relationship between learners’ characteristics and their attitudes towards using CALL. Thus, future researchers are suggested to collect more learners’ CALL experiences (e.g. types of platforms used, kinds of CALL activities that learners participated in, and the roles teachers played) so as to elaborate more on the ways that fixed-mindset learners, growth-mindset learners, learners with (or without) persistence of effort, and learners with (or without) consistency of interest would find CALL to be effective (or ineffective).

The results of this study should be generalized with caution due to some limitations. First, this study relied on self-reported data as its main source of information; consequently, the results of the study are limited to the shortcomings of self-report data collections and analysis. The results are also limited to the specific context of the study’s specific sociocultural background. The way CALL has been adopted across different pedagogical contexts varies; therefore, further research in other contexts is needed before generalizing the findings of this study.

# Appendix

# Language mindsets scale (adapted from Lou & Noels, 2017)

1. You have a certain amount of language ability, and you can’t really do much to change it.   
2. Your foreign language ability is something about you that you can’t change very much.   
3. To be honest, you can’t really change your language ability.   
4. No matter who you are, you can significantly change your language ability.   
5. You can always substantially change your language ability.   
6. No matter how much language ability you have, you can always change it quite a bit.   
7. To a large extent, a person’s biological factors (e.g. brain structures) determine his or her abilities to learn new languages.   
8. It is difficult to change how good you are at foreign languages.   
9. Many people can never do well in foreign languages even if they try hard because they lacknatural language intelligence.   
10. You can always change your foreign language ability.   
11. In learning a foreign language, if you work hard, you will always get better.   
12. How good you are at using a foreign language will always improve if you really work on  it.
