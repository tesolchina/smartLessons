Drawing on Appraisal theory within Systemic Functional Linguistics, this study employs a corpusbased approach to examine how EFL writers of high- and low-scoring argumentative essays use Engagement resources both individually and in combination to construct arguments within the argument chain at the paragraph level. The quantitative analysis reveals that while both groups use Contract Heterogloss more frequently to assert claims and conclusions, low-scoring writers heavily depend on Pronounce, whereas high-scoring writers utilize a diverse range of Contract Heterogloss. The qualitative analysis indicates that high-scoring writers develop and strengthen their assertive claims by presenting solid reasons and credible evidence to engage with potentially dissenting readers. These elements are incorporated into their writing through combinations of Engagement resources, such as Counter $^ +$ Entertain/Deny/Justify and Endorse/Entertain $^ +$ Entertain. However, low-scoring writers failed to adequately support their claims by skillfully deploying Engagement resources across different stages of argument, ultimately weakening the persuasiveness of their arguments. Our findings highlight the importance of providing students with instruction on Engagement strategies and their persuasive impact from a dialogic perspective. The identified strategies can therefore serve as pedagogical tools to assist students in constructing effective arguments by adeptly utilizing Engagement resources, facilitating interaction with external viewpoints and readers.

# 1. Introduction

Argumentative essays are widely recognized as a fundamental genre in academic writing across various university contexts. To fulfll the communicative purpose of persuading the reader to consider or accept the writer's viewpoints on a contentious isue, writers must undertake a series of tasks. Firstly, they need to develop a position through extensive reading. Subsequently, they argue for this position by providing justifiable reasons and supporting evidence, whileffectively countering opposing views. These tass demand that students grasp both the structure of argument and the linguistic resources for evaluation and persuasion, often posing challenges for students as a result (Stapleton & Wu, 2015; Wingate, 2012).

Previous research has investigated how writers employ evaluative language in argumentative essays to construct arguments and cultivate reader-writer relationships. These studies typically utilize Martin and White's (2005) Appraisal theory within a Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) framework to analyze how writer convey their evaluations through three systems: Atitude (evaluating emotions, people, things, and phenomena), Engagement (evaluating proposals and propositions), and Graduation (adjusting the values of Attitude and Engagement). They have holistically demonstrated the use of individual Attitude, Engagement, and Graduation resources at the clause level in argumentatie esays (e.g, Brooke, 2014; Coffin, 2002; Dong & Li, 2020; Lam & Crosthwaite, 2018; Lee, 2015; Liu, 2013; Xiang & Xiao, 2009). However, evaluative meanings extend beyond clause boundaries, with each evaluative expression interacting with others to shape an evaluative stance as the text unfolds (Lemke, 198; Martin & White, 2005). Therefore it is crucial to analyze how writers employ Engagement resources both individually and in combination beyond the clause level to establish a persuasive position in argumentative essays.

Some studies have examined how writers employ Engagement resources within the schematic structure of argumentative essays at the text (global) level, mainly focusing on the Thesis stating the writer's primary position of an esay) and Reinforcement (restating the thesis of an essay) stages. However, there appears to be a gap in the analysis of Engagement usage in the Point and Elaboration structure of argument at the discourse semantic (paragraph) level (se section 2.2). Le (2014, 2019) analyzed Engagement resources within this structure and uncovered a "dialogic interplay' between Engagement resources and the corresponding impacts on constructing persuasive arguments. However, the studies did not quantitatively investigate their combined use. Skilflly combining Engagement resources can enable writers to engage more sophisticatedly with alternative viewpoints and readers while advocating their positions. Consequently, it i worthwhile to further explore this area of inquiry by examining the deployment of Engagement resources at the paragraph level, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Therefore, our study adopts a corpus-based approach to investigate how EFL writers of high-scoring and low-scoring argumentative essays use Engagement resources at the paragraph level. Quantitatively, it examines the individual and combined use of Engagement resources within each element of the \*argument chain' (see section 2.2): claims, reasons, evidence, and conclusions. Qualitatively, it examines the interaction of Engagement resources along theargument chain as the writers argument develops and the efects yield on the persuasiveness of the argument. The identified Engagement stategie can serve as corpus-based resources for helping students in similar institutions better master the essential writing skillof using Engagement resources to build compelling arguments.

# 2. Theoretical background

# 2.1. The Engagement system within the Appraisal theory

The Engagement system is one of the three interpersonal meanings outined in the Appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005). It provides a systematic framework for analyzing evaluative language that enables writers to express proposals and propositions and negotiate them with prior utterances and anticipated responses from readers. Within this dialogic framework, the Engagement system is categorized into Monoglossia and Heteroglossia.

Monoglossia (bare assertions) refers to propositions that present a viewpoint as an indisputable fact without acknowledging alternative viewpoints (e.g.: Private tutoring is helpful to children's academic performance. HS-1). In contrast, Heteroglossia refers to statements that signal the writer's anticipation of and allowance for alternative viewpoints (e.g.: In addition, the intensity of private tutoring may have an impact on students' physical and mental condition. HS-6).

Fig. 1. The Engagement system (Martin & White, 2005; White, 2012).

Based on the degree to which a statement makes space for alternate views, Heteroglossi is further classfied into Contract and Expand (Martin & White, 2005). Contract resources (Deny, Counter, Concur, Pronounce, Endorse, Justify) indicate the writer's recognition of altenative perspectives but reduce the dialoic space for neotiation with them. However, Expand resources (ntertain Acknowledge, Distance) open up more room for alternative views to be considered.

According to Martin and White (2005), Deny invokes contrary opinions to the writer's view and dismisses them outright, while Counter invokes certain normal expecttions but rlaces them, both resulting in a contraction of the dialogic space. Linguistic items such as no and not often realize Deny, while items such as although and however typically realize Counter.

1) Private tutoring is not [Deny] conducive to children's physical health. (HS-2)   
2) However [Counterl], with appropriate use f technology, teachers still [ounter] ocupy an important role in language class HS] 17)

In Example 1, the writer acknowledges that some readers may hold the opposite view regarding the impact of private tutoring on children but directly denies such a view with the use of not In Example 2, the writer acknowledges the expectation that technolog wil replace teachers in language classes but counters this expectation using however and still.

Concur constructs the writer's proposition as aligning with that of readers or as a commonly shared view, thereby limiting the dialogic space for altenative views. As ilustrated in Example 3, the writer presumes that reader also acknowledge the ignificance of study time to exam grades and signals explicit agreement with them by using obviously.

3) Obviously [Concur], for many subjects, the grade depends on the time a student spends in studying. (HS-1)

Pronounce construes a position as highly warrantable, thereby suppresing alternative perspectives.It frequently involves the use of expressions such as in fact, the facts of the matter are ... and really etc.

4) In fact [Pronounce], female can be fully capable of being engaged in careers that were traditionally viewed as masculine careers and vice versa. (HS-15)

Justify reinforces a proposition by presenting it as being supported by reasons, thus strengthening the position being advanced while reducing the dialogic space for alternative viewpoints. Typical linguistic realizations of Justify include because and since, as shown in Example 5.

5) Private tutoring enhances students academic aility because [Justify] it fosters students practical tes-taking skill and general cognitive ability. (HS-4)

Endorse presents a cited proposition as being highly valid and persuasive, typicall realized through the use of reporting verbs such as show, reveal, demonstrate, and prove. For instance:

6) A US study shows [Endorse] that women's presence in upper management is related to various improvements, especially in innovation. (HS-13)

The Expand resource, Entertain, creates more rom for altenative perspectives to be considered and is typically realized through modal auxilire (e may, might, coud), mdal aunts (e perps, probably, defitely), moda atribute (e. it's osl tat ., it's likly that .), and appearance-based conjecture (e.: i seems, i appears). In Example 7, the use of Entertain item \*could" acknowledges the role that social mediaplays in connecting family members as one possbility whil allowing for other viewpoints to be considered.

7) Meanwhile, social media could [Entertain] bridge the gap of different generations in the family members. (HS-7)

Acknowledge involves incorporating external information and conveys the writer's dialogically neutral stance towards it often realized through the use of reporting verbs such as say, report, and describe. For instance.

8) A UnIcEF report said [Acknowledge] that gender equality means that woman and man have acess to the same resources and opportunities ... (HS-15)

Distance signals the writer's disassociation from the referenced claim and is commonly realized through the use of reporting vers like claim or allege. For instance.

9) Some scholars claim [Distance] that the impact of private tutoring concerning academic performance can be positive. (HS-3)

# 2.2. The concept of argument chain

The term "argument chain' is introduced in Writing Critically 3: Argumentative Writing (Zhang, 2016), the textbook used in the writing course from which the data for this study were collected. Acording to the textbook, argumentative writing involves creating compelling arguments by using reasoning and selected evidence to persuade readers of a particular viewpoint. When constructing an argument within a body paragraph of an argumentative essay, writers need to establish a claim, present reasons for their positions, provide supporting evidence, and draw a conclusion. This paragraph-level structure is referred to as the argument chain in the textbook, with these four elements considered key components within it.

The structure of argument chain reflects that of a body paragraph within a traditional five-paragraph essay: the claim mirrors the topic sentence, introducing the paragraph's central idea; reasons and evidence serve as supporting sentences, expanding upon the central idea; and the conclusion reinforces the topic sentence.

Furthermore, the structure of argument chain partiall aligns with the SFL description of the Point and Elaboration structure at the paragraph level, occurring within the Series of Argument stage in the schematic structure f argumentative essays at the text (global) level (IdentificationThesis Statement^Series of Arguments^Reinforcement of Thesis^Recommendation) (Write it Right, 1996). The Point stage presents the writer's general claim, while the Elaboration stage supports the claim by providing evidence, evaluation, examples, and suggestions (Lee, 2014, p. 285), corresponding to the elements of reasons and evidence within the argument chain.

Example 10, taken from a high-scoring essay in our corpus, illustrates the four elements of the argument chain.

10) Private tutoring deteriorates the students' relationship with parents. [Clam] Commonly, full chedules of courses and separately busy lif causes the deficiency of communication and interaction between parents and students, providing possbilities of worsening parent-child relationship. [Reason] Zhang et al. (2020) points out that while the intensity of private tutoring rises, the parent-child relationship worsens dramatically, moreover, one of the key reasons of the phenomenon is ssociated with time spent on tutoring and lack the opportunities of communication. [Evidence] Overal, private tutoring has become a obstacle for parent-child relationship inevitably. [Conclusion] (HS-3)

# 3. Literature review

Previous research has primarily examined Engagement resources in argumentative essays, focusing on two main areas of inves. tigation. The first area involves comparing the use of these resource between writers of English as a First Language (L1) and those of English as  Second or Foreign Language (ESL/EFL). The second area of study involves comparing their usage in essays written by ESL/ EFL students that receive high scores and low scores.

Studies in the firt research strand have noted a general tendency among EFL writers to overuse Contract Engagement resources such as Pronounce and Deny, while underusing resources like Counter and Endorse (e.g., Dong & Li, 2020; Xiang & Xiao, 2009). This imbalance ften leds to an overassertion of authorit in ther writing. Additionall, it has been bseved that E wiers demonstrate a narrower range of linguistic expressions for Expand resources, relying heavily on modal verbs (e.g., can) and certain reporting vers (e.g, think, believe). These findings highlight the necessity of providing explicit instruction in academic writing pedagogy on the available Engagement resources and their appropriate use (Xiang & Xiao, 2009).

Studies in the second research strand have shown a positive correlation between Engagement use and argument ffectivenes, impacting the essay score overall (e.g., Brooke, 2014; Liu, 2013; Wu, 2007). High-scoring argumentative essays often use Attribute resources (Acknowledge, Endorse, and Distance) to foreground the writer's argument through incorporation and interaction with external perspectives (Brooke, 2014; Wu, 2007). Additionall, igh-scoring esays employ Counter and Deny more frequently to refute alternative views and establish the writers position (Wu, 2007). On the other hand, low-scoring essays depend heavily on Monoglossia or Pronounce to asert the validity of their views, conveying an unjustified sense of certaint, especially in the absence of substantial support (Brooke, 2014; Wu, 2007).

In addition to the disparities observed in the use of individual Engagement resources between high- and low-scoring essays, certain combinations of these resources have emerged as effectie strategies for crafing persuasive arguments in high-scoring essays (Lan caster, 2014; Lee, 2010, 2019; Miller et al., 2014; Wu & Allison, 2003, 2005). These strategies facilitate negotiation between the writer's perspective and altenative viewpoints, as well as potential reader responses, thereby enhancing the overall argumentation and essay score.

For instance, Miller et al. (2014) found that the Concur $^ +$ Counter and Monogloss $^ +$ Endorse strategies enable high-scoring essay writers to construct compelling arguments that consider diverse viewpoints, ffectively persuading potentially resistant readers. Conversely, low-scoring essay writers lack such strategicll combined use f these resources but tend to rely on using Engagement resources such as bare assertions, Deny, and Pronounce individually. This approach leads to insufficient support for claims and a failure to engage effectively with readers and source texts.

Lee (2010) noted that the Endorse $^ +$ Acknowledge and Endorse $^ +$ Distance strategies reinforce the writer's argument in high-scoring essays by incorporating evidence from source texts and fostering a dialogue with alternative views, thereby creating a persuasive and multi-vocalized argument. In contrast, low-scoring essay writer ofte fail to employ these Attribute trategie, leading to ineffective integration of evidnce and weakened persuasive impact. This is partl ecause they are unaware of thesestrategies and when and how to effctively use them to connect with their own voice. While expert writers may be more familiar with and adept at mastering this aspect of academic writing, it may not be explicitly taught to novice writers (Swales, 2004). Therefore, it becomes essential to adopt a \*dialogic pedagogy" approach, which can equip students with Attribute trategies for incorporating evidence while constructing arguments and help them understand the dialogic effcts of these strategies in creating a voice with balanced assertion and persuasion (Lee, 2010).

Some studies have specifically examined the combined use of Engagement resource in relatin to different stges of argumentative essays, focusing on the Theis and Reinforcement stages at the text level, as well asthe Point and Elaboration structure at the paragraph level (refer to section 2.2). Wu and Allison (2003; 2005) noted that in both the Thesis and Reinforcement stages, high-rated essay writers mitigate the strength of their views and expand the dialogic space by using combinations of Entertain $^ +$ Pronounce/Acknowledgement/Endorsement, but low-rated essay writers often neglect such sophisticated deployment. Lee (2019) demonstrated a tendency to utilize Pronounce $^ +$ Justify throughout the Thesis, Elaboration, and Reinforcement stages in high-scoring essays. Additionall, she analyzed the \*dialogic interplay" regarding how Engagement resources, when used in combination, interact with each other and with different stages of argument to establish a firm yet justified position as an argument evolves.

Moreover, the sequencing of combinations of Engagement resources can yield different persuasive efects in constructing the writer's argument (Lancaster, 2014). For instance, employing the Contract $^ +$ Expand sequence enables the creation of a cautious position supported by evidence, whereas the reverse sequence, Expand $^ +$ Contract, may project an impression of overly bold or unjustified propositions.

In summary, previous research has revealed that skilflly utilizing Engagement resources in combination can help writers construct more convincing arguments. Indee, the strategically combined use of Engagement is a salient feature in expert academic writing (Xu & Nesi, 2019). Authors of published research articles employ a broader range of combinations to challenge alternative viewpoints while maintaining a balanced critical voice (i.e., Entertain $^ +$ Deny/Counter/Entertain), or to reinforce their views while limiting the dialogic space for alternative voices (i.e., Counter $^ +$ Deny, Pronounce $^ +$ Counter).

All previous findings suggest that exploring how Engagement resources are combined for use can complement examining their usage individuall, revealing sophisticated strategies for developing the writer's own viewpoints against the backdrop of alternative perspectives. Enhancing students awareness of and proficiency in these strategies willbe crucial in academic writing pedagogy. Quality argumentation depends not only on the frequency of Engagement resource usage but, more importantly, on their trategic deployment (Ho & Li, 2018; Lee, 2010).

However, previous studies on the combined use of Engagement resources appear to have relied more on interpretive observation than on quantitative measurement. Furthermore, the analysis of Engagement deployment within all stages of argument at the paragraph level stil sems to be underexplored. To bridge this gap, the current study conducts a corpus-based analysis of how writers of high-scoring and low-scoring argumentative essays employ Engagement resources both individually and in combination. This analysis focuses on their use within the four key elements of the arument chain: clams, reasons, evidence, and conclusions. It investigates how Engagement resources are employed in the two sets of esays to persuade the reader of the writers argument within a body paragraph. Specifically, we aim to address two research questions:

1. How do high-scoring and low-scoring esay writers use individual Engagement resources across the argument chain to construct arguments and interact with the reader?   
2. How do high-scoring and low-scoring essay writers use combinations of Engagement resources across the argument chain to construct arguments and interact with the reader?

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Context of data

The argumentatie essays analyzed in our study were collected from ENG780, a mandatory academic writing course designed for English majors at a Project 211 University in China. Ths course spans 16 weeks with weekly 90-min sessions taught annuallyby the first author during the spring semester from 2018 to 2022. Over this period, the first author conducted a total of five clases, each accommodating up to 20 students who were in their second semester of their first year at the university. Despite their intermediate to advanced general English proficiency, these students had limited exposure to academic English during their secondary education. As a result, allstudents were required to complete a course focused on academic English writing in their first semester before enolling in ENG780. This prerequisite course covered essy types, structure and organization, coherence and cohesion, grammar, punctuation, mechanics, and citation, but it did not provide specific guidance on writing academic English argumentative essays or using Engagement resources in this genre.

In ENG780, these students received comprehensive instruction on academic argumentative writing, as outlined in the eight units of their textbook. This instruction includes making claims, supporting them with evidence and reasons, refuting counterarguments, and drawing conclusions. Two of the eight units under the Language Study" section discuss hedging language and its various categories, such as modal auxiliary verbs, probabilit adjectives and adverbs, adverbs of frequency, and certain inroductory verbs. The textbook only explains the function of these categories in terms of adjusting the level of certainty of propositions, illstrated with just a single xample for each atory, which is out of contxt and sems to e fabricatd for pedagogical puroses. However, it nlect to explain their functions in interacting with alternative views, anticipating responses from readers, and building writer-reader relationships.

As a supplement to the textbook, the instructor created a handout (see Supplementary Data) that introduces additional types of evaluative language within the Engagement framework. Due to practical constraints, the handout mainly offers a broad explanation of the interpersonal functions of these types. I also includes limited examples of some categories sourced from a corpus of doctoral theses (Geng & Wharto, 2016), reresentig a diffrent genre compared to argumentative essays. However, with reference to this handout, the instructor explained the entire Engagement framework and the interpersonal functions of all Engagement resources in a single session during the course.

For writing practice these students completed thre assignment essays following a sequence of steps. Initilly, they conducted research on a given topic, familiarizing themselves with existing arguments from various perspectives. Subsequently, they formulated their own position, substantiated it with evidence and reasons, addressed counterarguments, and drew conclusions. Each assgnment was submitted to the instructor for feedback, addressing both local isues such as sentence clarity and cohesion, and global concerns including organization, coherence, and overal argument development. Feedback on argument development focused on the quality of the four elements in the argument chain and the appropriate use of Engagement resources. Allstudents received individualized feedback on their writin, supplemented by whole-class eedback sessions. During these sessions, the instructor addressed common issue identifie in marking ther asignments and provided sugestions for future improvement (ee Supplementary Dat for a sample feedback summary). After completing the practice assignments, these students proceeded to work on their final essas fllowing the same procedure within two weeks before the end of each semester. These essays were then submitted to the instructor for formal evaluation (see writing prompts and assessment rubrics in Appendix).

# 4.2. Data collection

We collected our data from the Teaching Assistance System (TAS), a platorm used at our universt for sharing lecture notes, reading materials, and collecting assgnments and papers. At the end of each semester, students enrolled in ENG780 submitted ther final essas to TAS for grading. The first author downloaded all esays from TAS and saved them on her personal computer. From the pool of graded essays, we selected 21 essays that received grades ranging from 85 to 90 (corresponding to A, A-, and $^ { \mathrm { B + } }$ based on the university's credit evaluation system) to create the High-Scoring Corpus (HSC). Similarl, we chose 21 essays with grades ranging from 65 to 72 (corresponding to $^ { \mathrm { C + } }$ , C, and C-) to form the Low-Scoring Corpus (LSC).

Each essay was then labeled based on its order of collection (e.g.: HS-1 for the first high-scoring esay). Furthermore, we converted each file into  format to facilitate analysis using corus tool. Given our research aims, we retained only the body paragraphs where the argument chain was constructed, excluding the introduction and concluding paragraphs from each essay. We also disregarded minor grammar r spelling erros that did not ffect our anotation and analysi of Engagement resource e.. privat tutoring has become a obstacle ., ...private tutoring is not that signifificant). Table 1 shows the make-up of the two corpora.

# 4.3. Data analysis

We used the online version of the UAM CorpusTool (hereafter UAM) (ODonnell 2021) to conduct multi-layer annotation of our data. Specifically, we annotated Engagement resources (as depicted in Fig.1) and the four elements of the argument chain separately, following Fuoli's (2018) annotation procedure to ensure the reliability of our coding. Initially, the first and second authors independently annotated approximately $2 0 \%$ of the dataset. Discrepancies or ambiguities were resolved through discussion until a consensus was reached, and the coding principles were meticulously documented. For instance, we noticed that in certain paragraphs, essay writers introduced others' claims at the outset, aributing them to external sources. They then presented their own claims supported by reasons and evidence to refute these views. To differentiate between externall attribute claims and those made by the writers themselves (authorial claims, as shown in Example 10), we labeled similar instances as counterclaims. For example:

11) Some people might argue that private tutoring would benefit children since it consolidates their knowledge and improves their academic performance. [counterclaim] (Hs-3)

Next, both coders re-annotated the same $2 0 \%$ portion of the data based on the established principles and achieved substantial agreement (Cohen's Kappa $= 0 . 9 5 5 6 \mathrm { \AA }$ . Following this, the first author meticulously coded the remaining data. In cases of uncertainty regarding specific items, she consulted with the second author to make mutually agreed annotations.

Our data annotation revealed 1431 instances of Engagement items, suggesting an occurrence of one Engagement item every 15.1 words. The frequencies of Engagement items within each element of the argument chain were calculated and normalized to 1000 words using UAM to facilitate comparison between the two corpora. Significant differences were calculated using the Chi-square test provided within UAM. Combined use f Engagement items were identified through a manual detection proces involving reading texts marked with color-coded Engagement items generated by UAM (see also Xu & Nesi, 2019), as freely combining items cannot be quantified by UAM.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Individual engagement items used across argument chain

Both HSC and LSC writers predominantly used Heterogloss over Monogloss in argumentation (see Table 2), reflecting their consideration of multiple perspectives. HSC writers employed significantly more Heteroglos in presenting evidence compared to LSC writers (13.0/1000wds vs. 7.6/1000wds, $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 0 0 1 $ indicating a stronger inclination to incorporate sources and construct persuasive arguments by providing support for their claims and reasons. However, LSC writers significantly increased their use of Heterogloss in making authorial claims (7.9/1000wds vs. 5.2/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 1 1 6 \ + + + )$ suggesting an over-reliance on external perspectives and a lack of authorial commitment to the presented viewpoint.

Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, both HSC and LSC writers displayed a preference for employing Contract Heterogloss when making claims, presenting reasons and evidence, and drawing conclusions. However, HSC writers utilized both Contract Heterogloss (7.5/1000wds vs. 3.9/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 0 4 \ + + + )$ and Expand Heterogloss (5.5/1000wds vs. 3.7/1000wds, $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 4 7 2 \ + + )$ significantly more frequently than LSC writers when presenting evidence. These differences may stem from HSC writers' tendency to combine Entertain with Endorse while incorporating evidence (see section 5.2). The balanced use of Contract and Expand Heterogloss by these writers suggests their emphasis on establishing the credibility of their evidence while sillallowing for the inclusion of alternative viewpoints.

More notable diferences exist between the two groups of writers regarding their preferences for using subtypes of Heterogloss in the argument chain. Throughout the remainder of this section, we present examples from our data to illusrate these differences. To ensure clarity and ease f comprehension, we provide contextual excerpts where necessary and annotate only the Heteroglossc items currently under discussion. Additionall, for esier identification of the various elements of the argument chain, we present authorial claims in bold, resons in italics evidence in underined text, and conclusions in a smaller font, both in this section and in section 5.2.

As shown in Fig. 2, when presenting their own claims in the argument chain, LSC writers used Counter (1.1/1o00owds vs. 0.3/ 1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 1 6 3 + + + )$ and Pronounce (1.4/1000wds vs. 0.4/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 1 7 8 + + + )$ significantly more frequently than did HSC writers.

12) Less well understood, however, is that private tuition indirectly provides students with the more harmonious development circumstance given that the relationship between parents and children is better connected. (LS-10)

In Example 12, the writer of the low-scoring essay used Counter to position her view in opposition to the \*normal perspective held 3y the reader and other voices, thereby creating a sense of contrast and disagreement.

Fig. 3 illustrates that when presenting reasons to support their claims, HSC writers employed significantly more instances of Counter (5.4/1000wds vs. 3.6/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 4 3 9 + + )$ and Endorse (2.7/1000wds vs. 1.6/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 9 4 3 \ + )$ compared to LSC writers. However, LSC writers used significantly more instances of Pronounce than did HSC writers (4.8/100owds vs. 3.0/ 1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 2 6 5 \substack { + + } )$

13) In addition, the intensity of private tutoring may have impact on students' physical and mental condition. Students who commute between school, home and extracurrcular casses have no time for physical exercise every day, and sometimes even need to stay up late to finish thir homework. The continuous learning progress going on from morning until evening on weekdays and during weekends denies students sufficient rest and recreation (de Silva, 1994) [Endorse]. (HS-6)

In Example 13,the writer of the high-scoring essay efectively supported her claim regarding the detrimental impact of private tutoring on students by presenting a clear reason: the absence of adequate rest and recreation. Furthermore, the writer bolstered the persuasivenes of this rationale by aligning it with previous research by de Silva (1994), thus increasing the interpersonal stakes associated with challenging this viewpoint and limiting the dialogic space for alternative perspectives.

14) Every industry has its own excellent males and females, if we exclude them from certain professions because of their gender, we may cause the brain drain. We must [Pronounce] admit there is always a diffrence between people; some people indeed [Pronounce] have gift in certain things, so we should [Pronounce] give ul play to their talents rather than force them to do something they are not skilli. Throughout history, we know most scientists are males. If we exclude females from this profession, radium and mobilecontrol gene theory may not be discovered, and scientific community will lose Marie Sklodowska-Curie and

Barbara McClintock. Besides, we also know most statesmen are males, but Britain may be not able to lose Margaret Thatcher and Elizabeth I and Angela Merkel are also important to German. (LS-14)

In Example 14, the writer of the low-scoring essay employed Pronounce to emphasize the validity of the reasons she presented for opposing gender-based exclusion in professions. However, the evidence provided following this rationale is inadequate and not representative enough to support the writer's arguments effctively. In this context, the repeated use of Pronounce instances may convey a sense of assertivenessthat could lead to a disconnect with readers who hold different views, casting doubt on the validit of the rationale presented.

Fig. 4 shows that when presenting evidence, HSC writers employed significantly more instances of Deny (0.6/1000wds vs. 0.1/ 1000wds, $\mathsf { p } = 0 . 0 4 7 6 \mathrel { + } + \big )$ , Endorse (5.1/1000wds vs. 2.5/1000wds, $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 2 4 \substack { + + + } )$ , and Entertain (3.4/1000wds vs. 1.4/1000wds, ${ \bf p } = 0 . 0 0 2 1 ~ + + + )$ compared to LSC writers. This suggests that HSC writers used a broader range of Engagement strategies for incorporating external sources.

15) Firstly, being of a certain gender does not necessarily mean the individual possesses the traits or qualities usually attributed to that gender. Different from common stereotypes, males can be attentive and considerate just as females can be tough and courageous. For example, although [Counter] the nursing profession is ordinarily perceived as not [Deny] suitable for males, Torkelson (2011) has found [Endorse] that male nurses can [Entertain] be as competent as female nurses to carry out the work (evidence). (HS-12)

In Example 15, the writer of the high-scoring esay cited Torkelson (2011) as supporting evidence for her claim that gender does not limit one's abilities or characteristics. She challenged the common stereotype that nursing is only for females by using Counter and Deny, and supported her argument by incorporating Torkelson's (2011) finding through Endorse and Entertain, which recognizes individual abilies regardlessof gender expectations. This example illusrates that when presenting evidence, HSC writers did not simply rely on Endorse to incorporate external sources; instead, they utilized a variety of Heteroglossic resources to construct a balanced voice with authority and openness to potentially differing viewpoints.

Finally, as shown in Fig. 5, LSC writers consistently used significantly more instances of Pronounce (2.8/1000wds vs. 1.0/1000wds $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 4 2 \substack { + + + } )$ when drawing conclusions, mirroring their usage when presenting claims and reasons. This reliance on Pronounce across the argument chain may suggest a limited repertoire of Engagement resources and a lack f sophistication in their deployment.

16) Additionally, taking private tuition has more flexibility in choosing tutor and learning style since they may not receive ideal teaching mode in school. Sometimes the school teachers have strange accent or unsuitable teaching style leading to the sti. dents' inadaptation and low achevement. However, selecting tutors according to the students appetite for teaching and receiving knowledge can sulement ther requirement for high-qualified lessons and high concentration. It may also help realize their potential While enjoying a learning journey chosen frely by themselves. If there are still worries about whether the tutors are qualified, the references about them such as educational background, teaching experience, teacher certification, feedbacks from primary tutees etc. are accessbl both online and ofline on the tutoring center's platform. The private tuition certinly [Pronounce] does [Pronounce] a great job in serving for students depending on their personal preferences in learning. (LS-11)

In Example 16, the writer of the low-scoring essay argued for private tuition because of is flexibility in selecting tutors and learning styles. However, the argument lacked solid evidence to support this claim, relying primarily on the writers reasoning. Consequently the use of Pronounce while drawing her conclusion projected an overly assertive tone, which may lead to a challenge of the writer's position and alienate readers who hold alternative views.

# 5.2. Combinations of engagement items used across argument chain

As shown in Table 4, HSC writers, overall exhibited a greater tendency compared to LSC writers to use combinations of Engagement items when presenting their own claims or introducing counterclaims.

HSC writers employed three types of Engagement combinations when presenting their own claims: combining Contractresources (Pronounce/Deny) and the Expand resource (Entertain) with Justify, respectively, with a notable preference for the Contract $^ +$ Justify combination. This demonstrates that when HSC writers establish their claims with strong authority to limit dialogic space, they opt to balance this authority with ustfication to prempt potential hllenges and ehance persuasion, as shown by Example 17. Conversely, when LSC writers attempted to assert authoritatie claims, they often relied solely on Pronounce, which made them appear overly assertive without the strategic inclusion of Justify (see section 5.1).

17) Working at home is not [Deny] more productive because [Justify] the work-home boundary is broken down, which makes people vulnerable to interference from family members and makes it hard to concentrate. (HS-20)

At times, both HSC and LSC writers moderated the authority of their own claims by using Entertain to acknowledge alternative viewpoints. However, they promptly restricted the dialogic space for these views by providing justifications for their own perspectives, as shown in Example 18.

18) Private tuition can [Entertain] help students gain academic achievement because [Justify] it provides students with personalized classes and direct feedback. (Hs-8)

Furthermore, Table 4 indicates that when HSC writers introduced counterclaims, they used Counter $^ +$ Acknowledge and Entertain $^ +$ Acknowledge combinations to implicitly distance themselves from those alternative views. In contrast, LSC writers did not employ any combinations of Engagement for this purpose; instead, they relied solely on using Distance individually as an Engagement tratey for introducing counterclaims and explicitly projecting disalignment.

19) Some people might [Entertain] argue [Acknowledge] that private tutoring would benefit children since it consolidates their knowledge and improves their academic performance. (HS-5)   
20) Nevertheless [Counter], some argue [Acknowledge] that private tutoring does not increase academic performance. (HS] 4)

In Example 19, the Entertain $^ +$ Acknowledge strategy was employed to introduce a potentially opposing view on the discussed topic without explicitlydistancing from it, thus prempting potential criticism. In Example 20, Counter was utilized to imply that the following opinion might be perceived as "normal by some, yet it contradicts he writer's earlier stance regarding the positive impact of private tutoring on academic ability. Acknowledge was then employed to introduce the alternative viewpoint while also subtly signaling disagreement. These strategic uses of Engagement resources foster more room for critical evaluation of the topic under discussion.

When drawing conclusions, both HSC and LSC writers displayed a similar tendency to combine Justify with other Engagement resources. For instance, as shown in Example 21, the Justify $^ +$ Entertain strategy presents a rational conclusion while still allowing room for the consideration of alternative interpretations. This echoes Lancaster's (2014) explanation of the Contract $^ +$ Expand sequence as creating a cautious stance.

21) Therefore [Justify], the insufficiency of time for activities caused by private tutoring would [Entertain] lead to an unfavorable impact on students' development. (HS-5)

However, the persuasive impact of the Justify $^ +$ Pronounce strategy varied between high-scoring and low-scoring essays, primarily due to the dialogic interplay between Engagement resources and the presentation of reasons and evidence before drawing strong conclusions.

In Example 22, the writer initiallyasserted the benefits of private tutoring in improving students' weaker courses, supported by citing non-research-based evidence of large classizes in public schoos. xpanding on this, the writer presented reasoning suggesting that personalized education, lacking in public schoos, could be compensated for through private tutoring. However, the writer failed to provide solid evidence to substantiate her reasoning before concluding strongly using the Justify $^ +$ Pronounce strategy. This approach may alienate readers with alternative views and provoke doubts, thereby weakening the persuasiveness of the conclusion.

22) Apart from the efectivenesto learning extra knowledge required by their dream schools, children also benefit a lot in terms of enhancing their weak courses in private tuitions. (Smyth, 2009; para. 1). It is known that there are dozens of students in a classin most public chools. Due to the large clss volume, it i dificult for each student to adust to the unified course curriculum and course schedules. Furthermore, teachers have to take care of a great number of students in their class and they do not have abundant attention paid on every student. (Facts and detil, 2021, para. 9). Therefore, it i very likely that hildren fall behind in certain cores. wever, inthe privttrienters, child re ocatd o eon rs t supot ther coures, ndor lso provide with personlized course sllabus for each student based on his or her academic performance. Thus [Justify],from this point of view, attending private tuition is a great opportunity to increase children's weak courses; in the long run, this will [Pronounce] help them get promotion in their grades. (LS-6)

When presenting reasons to justify their claims, both HSC and LSC writers employed a range of Engagement combinations and showed a tendency to make combined use of Contract Heterogloss However, as Table 5 shows, HSC writers preferred combining a variety of Engagement resources with Counter and used these combinations more evenly, whereas LSC writers predominantly used the Justify $^ +$ Entertain and Justify $^ +$ Deny combinations.

The following two examples demonstrate the most frequently used combinations with Counter in HSC.

23) However [Counter], eve if private tutoring can consolidate knowledge for children, i is of no [Deny] great use to their developmen (HS-5)

Table 5 Combinations of Engagement items in reasons and evidence.

24) Although [Counter] WAH (working at home) can provide more breathing space, the disorder of ife would [Entertain] result in several physical and mental problems, which would [Entertain] make the decline of productivity. (HS-21)

In Example 23, the writer used the Counter $^ +$ Deny combination to reject what might be held as a "normal' belief among readers: that private tutoring helps students build knowledge. The writer then directly negates its role in children's overall growth as justification for her position against this \*normal belief This stratey enables the writer to incorporat opposing views but with the am of undermining its validity and emphasizing the writer's stance against it.

In Example 24, the writer used Counter to acknowledge readers who may believe in the benefits of WAH but then challenged this belief by presenting potential negative consequences of WAH through consecutive use of Entertain. The Counter $^ +$ Entertain combination engages readers in considering her opposing view that WAH is not productive.

The LSC writers chose alternative combinations of Engagement when presenting their reasons for supporting their claims, as illustrated in the examples below.

25) First of all due to Justify] th excessve study burden that brought by the privat utor and th lack of sleing time, students do not [Deny] perform well in class. (LS-9)   
26) Owing to [Justify] physiological diferences, females are more ikely [Entertain] to be injured when doing toilsome and energyconsuming works. (LS-12)

Example 25 demonstrates the use of the Justify $^ +$ Deny combination to provide rationale for the writer's refutation of the potential assumption that private tutoring enhances student performance, thus supporting her claim that is opposite to this belief and con. tracting dialogic space for possible doubt from readers. In Example 26, the Justify $^ +$ Entertain combination is used to validate the writer's clam that males and females are suited for diffrent professions based on their physical qualifications, invitig readers to consider alternative perspectives while still maintaining the writer's position.

Lastly, when presenting evidence to substantiate their reasons, HSC writers utilized the Endorse $^ +$ Entertain and Entertain $^ +$ Entertain combinations. In contrast, LSC writers did not employ such combinations but instead relied solely on using Endorse ind. vidually, suggesting they had simpler and fewer Engagement strategies for incorporating their evidence into their writing.

27) Having invested more time and money in study than their peer, th students with extra tutoring tend to sufer from higher presure f expectations from both their parents and themselves. A study has shown [Endorse] that $8 5 \%$ of the student participants could [Entertain] feel the stress of private tutoring, and half of them said that the stress was difficult or even unbearable (Zhang, 2017). (HS-2)   
28) Conrary to "digitl naties", the elder peopl i family are possbl to show ther nadtabilit to digital environment and socil medi. The capacity of older adults to accet new things and ideas is rlatively weak for ther non-continuing participation in learning Bekker et al. (2012) suggested [Entertain] that it may [Entertain] be difficult for older adults to stay sociallyconnected, on account of technology barriers and ageing limitations. (Hs-10)

In Example 27, the Endorse $^ +$ Entertain combination enables the writers to present the evidence as credible while also acknowledging the potential for alternative perspectives, thereby demonstrating a nuanced and evaluative engagement with the evidence. Example 28 illustrates how the writer used the Entertain $^ +$ Entertain combination to ground the evidence on Bekker et al.'s (2012) proposition while also indicating a wilingness to explore other perspectives or sources of evidence.

# 6. Discussion and conclusion

The results reported above reveal how frst-year EFL undergraduates, who are writers of both high-scoring (HSC) and low-scoring (LSC) argumentative essays, use Engagement resources individually and in combination toconstruct arguments across the argument chain at the paragraph level.

Specifically, our analysis reveals that both HSC and LSC essays demonstrate a higher level of Heteroglosscompared to Monoglos. This finding contrasts with prior research, which sugests that low-scoring argumentatie essays by ESL students tend to be monoglossic, featuring more absolute statements. This implies a neglect on the part of these writers to create a dialogic space for engaging with altenative viewpoints and readers whil presenting ther own views (e., Brooke, 2014; Wu, 2007). It sems that the LSC writers in our study have, to some extent, developed an awarenes of readers and a dialogic perspective in writing, potentilly influenced by the instruction received in their writing course.

However, while both HSC and LSC writers made efforts to include altenative views, they tended to limit the dialogic space, as is evident from ther preference for Contract Heteroglossover Expand Heterogloss when constructing arguments acros al four elements of the argument chain. For instance, HSC writers used significantly more Counter and Endorse when presenting reasons, and they employed significantly more Deny and Endorse when presenting evidence. This preference may be attributed to these students anticipating a diversty of differing views and a challenging reader ikely their instructor, against whom the writrs viewpoints are framed. Consequently, they contradict certain views and support their own justifications by blending the writer's voice with that of other researchers to emphasize the authority of their positions and limit the dialogic space for other views.

Unlike the HSC group's diverse use of Contract Heterogloss the LSC group heavily relied on Pronounce throughout the argument chain. This reliance led to an overemphasis on asserting their claims and conclusions, as wel as insisting on the validity of their supporting reasons and evidence. Consequently, their writing tends to be perceived as \*externally authoritative discourse" (Bakhtin, 1981: 345), where readers fee compelled to accept the writer's argument. This prevalent reliance on Pronounce reinforces a dia logically contractive stance, limiting space for altenative viewpoints and potentiallyalienating dissenting readers. In cases where writers fail to present sensibl reasons and credible evidence, thir ngagement strategy may provoke challenge from criticl readers (see Examples 14, 16, & 22 in sections 5.1 & 5.2).

It can be inferred that the LSC writers use Pronounce as a compensatory substitute for Monoglos. In other words, while they may superficially avoid using Monogloss they till project an overly asrtive stance when arguing for their claims, without understanding how to expressa more authoritative yet tolerant stance simultaneously. This stuation isakin to students whose argumentative essays adopt a recommended structure on the surface but lack substantive content within that structure (Sampson & Clark, 2008). The LSC writers in our study appeared to struggle with understanding how to deploy Engagement resources within each element of the argument chain and the dialogic interplay between these resources in relation to the quality of reasons and evidence provided to support their claims. Future intruction in this writing kill, guided by the problematic instances uncovered in this study, may provide additional assistance to EFL students in overcoming this writing difficulty.

In contrast, although the HSC writers also used more Contract Heterogloss when constructing arguments, their deployment of these resources within each element of the argument chain, particularly in reasons and evidence, generates a more effective impact on persuading the reader. Unlike the tendency of high-scoring essay writers in Wu and Allison's studies (2003; 2005) to make more dialogically expansive claims, in our study, the HSC writer often make dialogically contrctive claims through the use of Pronounce/ Deny $^ +$ Justify combinations. However, these claims are subsequently supported by sound reasons and credible evidence, which are integrated into their texs through frequent use of individual instances of Counter, Deny, Endorse, and Entertain, as well as comb. nations such as Counter $^ +$ Entertain/Deny/Justify and Endorse/Entertain $^ +$ Entertain. These Engagement strategies foster a balanced dialogic interaction with conflicting viewpoints and readers, either reinforcing the writer's own assertions or challenging specific claims with authority and tolerance (see Examples 13 & 15 in section 5.1). This dialogic interplay betwen Engagement resources in relation to different elements of the argument chain was not effectively realized in the low-scoring essays during argument construction.

These findings highlight that an argument's efectiveness is not solely determined by the use of a specific Engagement resource within one element of the argument chain. Instead, it depends on how these resources are employed acrossall four elements as the argument unfolds at the paragraph level. This involves an interaction among the selected Engagement resources or combinations of them, alongside the quality of the provided reasons and evidence. This substantiates the previous view that an argument's persuasiveness is more dependent on the appropriate use of Engagement resources rather than their mere frequency of use (Ho & Li, 2018; Lee, 2019). The writers skillul deployment of Engagement resources to engage with diverse perspectives and anticipate potential responses from imagined readers at different stages of the argument significantly influences the strength of their arguments.

Therefore, we advocate for implementing a "dialogic pedagogy' (Lee, 2019) in teaching argumentative writing to EFL students, particularly in simila trtiary institutions. When Chinese high school students transition to universities as freshmen, they often lack the necessary instruction in considering multiple views and readership in their writing to make appropriate evaluations of their own claims in relation to altenatives. This gap in instruction stems from negligence within the teaching curriculum and writing textbooks during their secondary education (Li & Wharton, 2012). The dialogic pedagogy can bridge this gap by equipping students with the skill to efetiely utilie ggment resources at different stags of armenttion. This undertanding mowers them to articulate their views while engaging with external perspectives and readers in a more balanced and authoritative way, thus fostering an "internally persuasive discourse" (Bakhtin, 1981: 345), as exemplified by the HSC essays in our study.

Despite receiving the same instruction from the same instructor, the LC writers did not demonstrate the same level of proficiency in effctively deploying Engagement resources whil constructing arguments as the HSC writers did. This difference in performance can be attributed to varying overallL2 writing proficiency between the two groups. Course records indicate that most LSC writers generally performed les successfull on practice assgnment esays. However, based on the instructor's asssments during both assignment and final essay grading, those LSC writers who initill received lower cores on assinments showed improvement intheir final essays. After receiving specific instruction, they appeared to have developed an awareness of using Engagement resources, as evidenced by their frequent occurrences in the LSC final essays (se section 5.1). Nevertheless,they had not yet mastered the deployment of Engagement resources, particularly in relation to different elements of the argument chain, to the extent that the HSC writers did. This finding highlights the importance of considering L2 writing proficiency in future research on the use of Engagement resources. To further investigate the impact of dialogic pedagogy in teaching argumentative writing with an emphasis on Engagement future research can track students' development of strategic engagement by comparing the patterns of using Engagement resources in their assgnment essays and final essays. In this way, the potential impact of L2 writing proficiency can be taken into account.

In summary, our study contributes to research on L2 argumentative writing by extending previous research on the use of Engagement resources in argumentative essays from the clause level to the discourse level. We demonstrate how high- and low-scoring EFL undergraduate writers deploy these resources in constructing arguments within paragraphs. Our corpus-based analysis of high. and low-scoring esays has revealed significant ifferences in the individual use of Engagement resource acrossthe four key elements f the arument chain: clams, reasons, evidence, and conclusions. dditionall, the esays differ in their combined use of Engagement resources, which results in varying effects on the construction of persuasive arguments through negotiation with altenative views and anticipated reader responses. This variability is mainly attributed to how Engagement resources interact with each other and with the elements of reasons and evidence as the argument unfolds at the paragraph level. It is pedagogically crucial to raise awareness among EFL students about these interactions so that they can construct persuasive arguments by employing appropriate Engagement strategies at various stages of argumentative writing. Therefore, the findings of this study can complement currnt academic writing textbooks with corpus-based teaching resources that help students master this essential aspect of argumentative writing.
