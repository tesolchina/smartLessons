# A Guide to In-sessional English for Academic Purposes: Paradigms and Practices, Neil Adam Tibbetts, Timothy Chapman. Routledge, New York and London (2023). 228 pp pp $\$ 23,46/4$ 22.99, ISBN: 978- 1032020037

EAP, nowadays, goes beyond mere English language instruction, encompassing an understanding of the diverse forms of literacy prevalent in academia (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002). Hyland (2002) rightly emphasizes the significance of "taking specificity seriously' in efective language teaching at universities (p. 394). In line with this, the three core principles of contextualization, embedding, and mapping, cllectively known as the CEM model, have been advocated as the foundation for the development of In-Sessional English for Academic Purposes (ISEAP) (Sloan & Porter, 2010). ISEAP refers to "academic English language provision that does not aim to prepare students for future academic study, but rather takes place during the academic year, running alongside the regular teaching and learning activities of the institution (Tibetts & Chapman, 2023, p. 1). To this end, ISEAP, as an extracurricular program, can play a complimentary role in the mainstream education of the students mainly in English Medium of Instruction contexts. Neil Adam Tibetts and Timothy Chapman's book, A Guide to In-sessonal English for Academic Purposes: Paradigms and Practice, casts new light on ISEAP through catering to the needs of EAP educators and practitioners engaged in this area of research and practice. This book fulfil the requirements of those working within the realm of EAP, providing insights and guidance fr ffective ISEAP instruction.

The content of this book is structured into two major sections. The first section, The In-sessional within the EAP Context," delves into the evolution of ISEAP practices and factors to contemplate when establishing efective support. It mainly focuses on in-sessional practices within the framework of EAP. The second section, In-sessonal EAP: Its Role within the Wider Universty, offers a more exhaustive and conjectural perspective of ISEAP. Notably, the book contains "Appendix: Standard Questions for Interviewees" for prospective researchers to conduct interviews regarding practice, functions, and roles of ISEAP.

Among the three chapters in the first section, Chapter 1 ilustrates the distinct characteristics of ISEAP, i., facilitating academic literacy development and the membership of academic discourse communities, and shaping its diverse interactions with academic disciplines. It goes beyond the notion of basic language aid, revealing complex decisions needed to address diverse needs of students in specific subjects and setigs. This specificit challenge univeral est practices. hapter 2delineates the theries (corpus lingustics and functional systemic linguisics) and methodologie (communicative language teaching, task-based learning, and situated learning) typically employed in EAP teaching and examines their relevance within the context of ISEAP. This chapter aims toaddressdiverse elements influencing ISEAP pedagogy within space limitations, avoiding bias towards any specific method. Readers are encouraged to engage with reflective questions in the book for personalized insights. The authors argued that crain effectie ISEAP methods does require consideration of a broader context. Factors like subject content, student composition, and delivery modes can influence the suitable approach for ISEAP teaching radicall. Chapter 3centres on the logistical aspects of delivering ISEAP, exploring methods for identifying needs, presenting various course design and delivery models (the CEM model and a bottom-up hub-and-spoke model), and addressing the challenges that arise when making decisions based on available resource. In particular, language instructors and practitioners can build up their expertise and specializations through the hub-and-spoke model, where practitioners do much of their work withflexibility in satellite (spokes) separated from the main hub. The authors have endeavored to present pragmatic trategies like conducting action research, case studies and interviews for effective ISEAP needs assessment, course conceptualization, and delivery across diverse contexts.

The second section (Chapters 4-6) showcases a broader perspective of ISEAP. It examines the role of in-sessional programs witin the wider framework of swifly evolving tertiary education methodologies. This section explores the dynamic alterations ISEAP undergoes within the universty sphere. To this end i inolves the widespread impact of neoliberal tactics, the consequences stemming from the pandemic, and the effcts of decolonization on the delivery f ISAP. Chapter 4 direct is attention towards the institutional environments and the consequential impact they wield over ISEAP and explores how institutions attempt to cope with the influence and how the rapidly changing higher education environment ffects the situations faced by practitioners. Despite the concerted effrts of the EAP establishment, the characteristic of ISEAP provision may be influenced by significant decision-making and the need for modifications tofit for the pecific requirements of teaching ISEAP. These influences carry sustantial weight for individuals employed in present-day universties. The instances highlight the concerns, such as neo-liberalism, uncertaint, the repercussions of the pandemic leading to online delivery and the quest or curriculum decolonization, have eft their mark on ISEAP. Chapter 5 concentrates on the \*professional academic identity' (p. 195) of ISEAP practitioners. It covers various aspects f ISEAP's significance for professionals in this field, and explores the paths practitioners take to enter this field. IsEAP isoften perceived as a distinct and restricted domain within the realm of EAP. The chapter suggests that the roles of instructors within ISEAP setings contribute to their distinct identity. For instructors engaging in diverse EAP activities, the experience gained in ISEAP may develop their academic identity, shaping thir expertise and professional development. Hence, it should come as no surprise that many find IsEAP work rewarding yet challnging. Rewarding IsEAP work enhances academic involvement and allows for more innovation in pedagogy. Chapter 6 investigates how ISEAP shapes the development of teaching and learning approaches in higher education, projecting potential future advancements based on its distinct osition. o make ISEAP more visible and to foster its transparent development, EAP practitioners connect acros boundaries to share knowledge and advice, reaching out to each other from one institution to another in what is referred to as crossintitutional collaboration" (p. 202) in ISEAP practce Establishing connections like this can be valuable, especially considering the hidden nature of ISEAP and can facilitate further expansion of ISEAP in the future. In the role of a conclusion, the chapter aims to weave together concepts from the two preceding chapters, exploring the trajectory of the ISEAP practice area and its implications within and beyond the established realm of ISEAP It provides critical insight into the evolving nature of ISEAP, its expanding scope, and its capacity to transcend boundaries both within and between institutions. In its entirety, this section adeptly presents a thorough and discerning analysis of ISEAP within the ever-progressing realm of tertiary education. It enriches our comprehension of the evolutionary trajectory of this specialized domain and its capacity to transcend conventional boundaries within the academic milieu.

Broadly speaking, ISEAP teachers and course leaders may find the book extremely helpful for reflecting on their own practice, framing pedagogies, and recognizing ISEAP's role in clasrooms. Evidently, the book can bridge the perceived gap betwen research and practice in this field. At the end of each chapter, the Concluding Thoughts and Chapter Refection sections stand out,as they encourage readers to examine their own academic contexs and identify the characterisics of ISAP. The reflction questions provided are remarkably thought-provoking, encompassng the main ideas and key terms of each chapter. This empowers readers to align these concepts with their individual situations. Another notable aspect is the emphasis on IEAP practitioners in Chapter 5. Within the realm of ESP, there tends to be a focus on curriculum design and development from the perspectives of learners and institions. However, the book direct it atention towards ISEAP educators, delving into their teacher expertise, positioning, and roles. This approach is exceptionally conducive to prompting educators to introspect about their teaching philosophy and pedagogy.

There is little to fault with the book; however, it appears that the book could benefi from the inclusion of a dedicated section focusing on the asessment and evaluation of ISEAP. The authors themselves acknowledged the rarity of assessment in ISEAP in Chapter 1 by stating that "assessment itelf is not commonplace in ISEAP" (p. 45).Asessment in ISEAP within rigid curricular frameworks might indeed pose challenges. However, in certain high-stakes settings, there i a necessity to asess every individual activity to gauge its effctivenes. A further improvement would be to include authentic ISEAP activity examples. Reading interview excerpts in every chapter makes readers feel empathetic and connected to the story. It would be helpful for readers to glimpse vivid samples of IEAP activities to become more engaged and use these in their EAP lasses. Moreover, the authors can devote chapter to the potential application of emerging technologies in the context of ISEAP.

Offering a timely and insightful contribution, A Guide to In-sessional Englishfor Academic Purposes: Paradigms and Practices delves into the intricat realm of effective ISEAP practices, roles, and functions within higher education. With the increasing prominence of ISEAP (Charles, 2022), this book may serve as a robust cornerstone for advancing the ield of EAP by advocating for the incorporation of reflexvity and pedagogical experiences as reputable scientific practices. This comprehensive resource promises immense value to those seeking to deepen their understanding of ISEAP, while also attracting scholars and practitioners engaged in ISEAP research.
