# Effects of Student Academic Ability on Cognitive Gains Using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of student academic ability on the cognitive gains achieved through a Reciprocal Peer Tutoring(RPT)instructional strategy.The Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique involves a unique combination of successful learning techniques:preparing to teach a peer, actually teaching a peer, and accountability for the process.Two hundred six students enrolled in two different undergraduate psychology courses were assigned to one of four different ability pairings (low-low, low-high, medium-medium and high-high)based on college grade point average.All pairs used the same Reciprocal Peer Tutoring study assignments. Results showed no significant differences in cognitive gains for the different ability pairs. All ability pairs achieved approximately the same cognitive gains over the course of the semester.Moreover,all students using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring exhibited significantly higher cognitive gains than did comparison students who were not using RPT strategies.These findings provide further support for the use of Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategies in college classrooms.

Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) is a classroom instructional method whereby students alternately play the role of tutor and tutee.It has been shown to be an effective strategy for enhancing college student academic achievement and psychosocial adjustment (Fantuzzo, Dimeff, & Fox, 1989FantuzzoRiggio,Connelly& Dimeff,1989;Riggio,Fantuzzo, Connelly,& Dimeff, 1991).Reciprocal Peer Tutoring is an effective classroom strategy because it offers a unique combination of elements. In Reciprocal Peer Tutoring, each student prepares to teach a peer and actually teaches the peer.Research on tutoring has shown that tutors show significant cognitive gains through the process of preparing to teach and tutoring a peer (Annis,1983;Bargh & Schul,1980;Lambiotte et al.,

1987).In addition, being paired with another student fosters social support from a peer, leading to a reduction in the psychological stress associated with college, as well as alleviating feelings of social isolation seee.g.Cohen & Wills1985;FondacaroHeller& Reilly1984Lew, Mesch,Johnson& Johnson1986).Finallythe pairing provides a peerbased normative pressure that maintains accountability for the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring process, as well as avoiding the destructive coalitions and "free-riding"effects that often occur in larger groups (Dansereau, 1987).

While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique, and its superiority over other learning strategies for college students (e.g.FantuzzoDimeff,& Fox1989)an important question remains: What role does the academic ability of the student pair play in affecting cognitive gains? For instance, do high academic ability student pairs using the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique show higher cognitive gains than low ability student pairs? Who benefits more from Reciprocal Peer Tutoring, students of high academic ability or low ability? These questions were explored in the present research.

Aside from the work of Dansereau and his colleagues (e.g. Hall Dansereau,&Skaggs,1990;Hall et al.,1988) there has been relatively little research directly examining the impact of individual differences, such as academic ability, on cognitive gains achieved through cooperative/collaborative learning strategies in college students.Larson et al.(1984) looked at the effects of verbal ability and field dependence/independence on gains achieved in cooperative learning dyads. They found that students of low verbal ability performed best when paired with a high verbal ability student. Importantly, the higher verbal ability students were not adversely affected by the pairings with lower verbal ability students.

Common sense might dictate that a pairing of two low ability students in a peer tutoring paradigm might lead to lesser cognitive gains, since neither student has demonstrated the academic abilities typically used to distinguish those students who are designated as "tutors."Yet,the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique,as implemented by Fantuzzo and his colleagues (Fantuzzo, Riggio et al., 1989;Riggio et al. 1991)emphasizes a very structured tutoring format involving students preparing and taking one another's practice tests and alternating the roles of tutor and tutee. Recent research by Wiegmann, Dansereau, and Patterson (1992) found that high ability students in cooperative learning pairs benefited most from playing the student' role, while low ability students benefited most from playing the "teacher' role.Yet, common sense might still dictate that high ability students would benefit more from peer tutoring than would low ability students. However, since Reciprocal Peer Tutoring involves alternating "teacher'and "student'roles, it might be that students of both low and high ability will benefit from this Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy.Thus, the present study was intended to examine whether students of high, medium, or low academic ability all benefited from engaging in Reciprocal Peer Tutoring learning strategies, and to examine the differences in cognitive gains for students from different ability groups.

An additional issue concerns the psychosocial benefits of the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy.As demonstrated in earlier investigations FantuzzoRiggio et al.1989Riggio et al. 1991) students using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring techniques demonstrated better psychosocial adjustment as indicated by scores on standardized tests of depression and anxiety. In the present investigation, we examined another form of psychosocial adjustment-a measure of global satisfaction with the university.This study explored whether students using the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring techniques would show any increases in their satisfaction with the college, and whether any such increases would be affected by the ability pairing.

# METHOD

# Subjects and Setting

Subjects were 206 undergraduates (135 women and $7 1 \ \mathrm { m e n }$ enrolled in two sections of Social Psychology and one section of Industrial/Organizational Psychology at California State University,Fullerton (CSUF). The social psychology sections were relatively small with 54 students in one section and 32 students in the other section.The industrial psychology course was a larger section with 120 students.Since the social psychology sections and industrial/organizational psychology section were different courses, they were treated as separate groups in the analyses.However, since both sections of social psychology were taught identically, these two sections were combined and treated as one group.

The mean age of all students was 25.4 years (range,20.0 to 52.0 years).Although the majority of students (about $50 \%$ were psychology majors, students were from a variety of academic majors, including significant percentages of students majoring in business, communication, liberal studies, and sociology. The students were informed that this research was designed to study a method of enhancing the learning experience.

# Measures

Comprehensive Examinations.The comprehensive examinations consisted of 25 multiple-choice questions designed to assess general student knowledge of the course material from each of the two courses.These exams were administered to students prior to instruction and again at post-instruction as part of the final examinations for the courses.Reliability coefficients for pre- and post-administration for both exams were high $\mathrm { \bf K R } 2 0 \mathrm { \bf s } = . 7 0 $ .74 for the pre- and post-exams for the social psychology course, respectively and .75,.83 for the pre-and post-exams for the industrial psychology course, respectively).

College Satisfaction Scale.A 15-item scale designed to assess global satisfaction with the university was adapted from the College Satisfaction Scale created by Vinsel,BrownAltman, and Foss (1980).The scale measures a student's satisfaction with college, including contentment with social and academic aspects of university life.Sample items from the scale include:"I'm adjusting pretty well to the University, and I feel pretty good about my academic program and classes."Students respond using a 4-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Internal consistency of this scales was rather low (alpha $= . 5 5$

Academic Background Questionnaire. The Academic Background Questionnaire was a group of questions assessing students'backgrounds (age, sex, undergraduate major) and academic grade point averages GPA). Students were asked to report their overall GPA (all college coursework),GPA at CSUF, and GPA only in coursework within the major.These self-reported GPAs were used to determine students' academic ability.

Student Satisfaction and Time Invested in Reciprocal Peer Tutoring. Following the administration of the final exam, students were given a questionnaire which asked about student satisfaction with the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique and about the amount of time they personally invested in the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy. In order to ensure that their answers would be as truthful as possible and also to alleviate student concern that their answers would affect their course grade, students were asked to return this questionnaire to the instructor at a later date in a sealed envelope.Specifically, the questionnaire asked students to rate their satisfaction with the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique on a 9-point scale (scale anchors: extremely helpful to not at all helpful), and to rate whether they perceived the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique to be more or less beneficial than some other assignment,"such as a term paper or group project' (9-point scale, with anchors (1 less beneficial, midpoint (5) about the same, (9) more beneficial).Students were also asked how many times they had actually met with their partner during the semester (three meetings were required),and to estimate how many total hours they spent working on the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignment over the entire semester.

# Procedure

On the first day of class, subjects were administered the Academic Background Questionnaire, College Satisfaction Scale, and the comprehensive examination (which was given to students with the explanation that the questions were samples of the style and type of question they would be seeing on the actual course examinations.") Students were encouraged to do their best, but told not to worry if they did not know the answers to any or all of the questions.

Ability Classification.Students'self-reported GPAs were used as a basis for assigning them to categories of "high,medium,or low academic ability.A few general guidelines were followed by the first author in making these assignments.First, overall GPA and CSUF GPA were given the strongest weights in making assignments, with GPA in major given lesser weight. Second, if there was an inconsistency in overall GPA and CSUF GPA, greater weight was given to CSUF GPA, particularly if major GPA was consistent with CSUF GPA.The assumption was that overall GPA included coursework either from community colleges or from much earlier coursework, and for many students, was likely to be less representative of how students would do in the present course.The general rule was that "high"'academic ability was represented by an overall and/or CSUF GPA of 3.25 on a 4-point scale).Low academic ability was a GPA of under 2.75, while students falling between 2.75 and 3.25 were of"medium' academic ability.Average overall GPAs for the three categories were: (for the social psychology courses, 2.54, 2.97, and 3.41 for low, medium and high ability students, respectively for the industrial psychology course, 2.56, 3.01, and 3.37, respectively).

Two separate checks were made on the academic ability assignments.First, the first and third authors independently made assignments on 70 of the subjects.Category agreement was $9 7 \%$ Second, one-way analyses of variance were conducted on the pre-test comprehensive exam scores by academic categorization,separately for the social and industrial courses. Both ANOVAs were significant: $\mathrm { F } \left( 2 , 8 3 \right) = 1 2 . 4 $ $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ ,for the social psychology course (raw score Means $= 1 0 . 3$ 11.5,13.6 for low, medium, high ability, respectively); $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } ( 2 , 1 1 7 ) = 4 . 2$ $\mathsf { p } < . 0 2$ for the industrial psychology course (Means $= 1 0 . 8$ 12.3,12.4,respectively.

Ability Pairing.Using the categorizations of high,mediumand low academic ability, subjects were randomly paired with other students to create 4 different ability pairings:low-low,high-low,medium-medium, high-high.For the social psychology courses, there were 9 low-low ability pairs, 9 high-low pairs, 14 medium-medium pairs, and 11 highhigh pairs.For the industrial psychology course,there were 17 low-low pairs, 14 high-low pairs,20 medium-medium pairs, and 10 high-high pairs.Students were also assigned to pairs with a goal of trying to achieve equality in the number of pairs in the low-low,high-high, and high-low groups.

A control group was not used in this research primarily for ethical reasons.A substantial amount of research has demonstrated the effectiveness of the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique over other instructional techniques (such as other groupstudy strategies, or working on the assignment alone, see FantuzzoDimeff,& Fox1989)not only in college populations (e.g.,Fantuzzo,Riggio,Connelly& Dimeff1989; Riggio et al.,1991)but in other populations as well (e.g.,FantuzzoKing, & Heller, 1992).Therefore,it seemed unethical to assign actual students to a control group that was known to be potentially detrimental to their academic performance (i.e., we would not be providing the best' instruction for control group students).However, a single, small comparison group $a = 2 2$ was available from a previous semester's Industrial/ Organizational Psychology course. These comparison students constituted a "control group' in another study of Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategies (unpublished).These students worked on the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments, but did so alone rather than in pairs. Also, these students were administered the exact same pre-test/post-test used in the present study.

Subject Attrition.Several students withdrew from the courses before the first exam and the remaining partners were, whenever possible,paired with another student who had lost a partner. In addition,3 students from the social psychology courses, and 3 students from the industrial psychology course withdrew late in the semester, typically after completing 2 or 3 of the three course units.Their partners were either paired with another remaining partner (4 subjects), or they completed the final assignment alone (2 subjects).Only the 206 subjects who completed the entire course were included in the study.In addition, some of these 206 subjects failed to complete one or more of the measures,causing some of the analyses to contain less than the total n of 206.

The Reciprocal Peer Tutoring Assignment.Prior to every class unit exam (there were three separate units in each course),each partner created a short test consisting of at least 1O multiple-choice questions based on the assigned readings and lecture material for that unit.For each question,the correct answer, along with a brief written rationale, was placed on a separate sheet of paper.For the tutoring session, the subjects were instructed to meet and administer their tests to each other under test-like conditions.Upon completion of the tests, they scored each others' exams. Next, they alternately provided each other with explanations from their answer sheets for questions answered incorrectly.In addition, subjects briefly outlined the material in each section, noting any areas where they were having difficulty understanding the material, and they also made a list of important points' they believed would be covered on the unit test. These outlines were prepared beforehand and brought to the meeting with the partner, where the partners then held a discussion using their outlines as a guide.Students turned in their corrected tests, answer sheets, and outlines on the day of each unit exam. The first author scored these materials and made comments suggesting ways to improve the assignments and they were returned to the students following each unit exam. The second and third authors independently made ratings of the "quality" of the materials, including the energy and time' put into their preparation, using a 3-point rating scale.

The students'level of participation in the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments was measured in various ways and did not differ significantly across ability pairings.First, overall compliance rate was very high $( 9 7 \% )$ with 600 of the 618 (206 students $\textbf { X 3 }$ assignments) written components of the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments turned in to the instructor.Second, as mentioned earlier,the assignments were scored as to perceptions of the apparent effort put into the assignments using a 3- point rating scale.One-way analyses of variance showed no significant differences among ability pairings on these assignment "quality" ratings. Finally, ANOVAs using students' self-reports of the number of times they met with their partners and the number of hours they invested in the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments also showed no significant differences in either meeting times or hours invested for the different ability pairings (see below).In short, compliance with the assignment and time invested in the assignment did not vary significantly across the different ability pairs.

# RESULTS

Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the pre- and post-test raw scores on the comprehensive examination, as well as the deviation scores (i.e. cognitive gains),for the four groups of ability pairs, and separately for the Social Psychology and Industrial Psychology courses.One-way ANOVAs revealed no significant differences in cognitive gains for the different ability pairings $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 8 2 ) = 0 . 7 6$ ns for the Social Psychology course; $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } ( 3 , 1 1 5 ) = 2 . 3 9$ $\mathsf { p } < . 0 8$ for the Industrial Psychology course),although the ANOVA did approach significance for the Industrial Psychology students. Common sense predictions say that there should be significant differences in cognitive gains among the ability pairing groups (e.g., high-high ability pairs should have higher cognitive gains than the other ability pairings).It is important to note, however, that,even though the ANOVA approached significance for the industrial psychology students, the pattern of mean cognitive gain scores in both groups did not follow common sense expectations. That is, while high-high pairings in the industrial psychology course demonstrated the highest cognitive gains, it was the medium-medium ability pairings,not the low-low pairs, that showed the lowest average gains. Even more surprisingly, in the Social Psychology course, the high-high ability pairs showed the lowest cognitive gains of any of the groups.Importantly,these latter findings were not due to a ceiling effect for the high-high students, since their average score on the post-test comprehensive examination was only approximately $70 \%$ in the Social Psychology course and $80 \%$ in the Industrial Psychology course.In addition, power tests of these ANOVA analyses showed that there was sufficient power to have found significant between-group differences in the Social Psychology course (observed power $= . 5 9$ and marginal power in the I/O Psychology class (observed power $= . 2 1$ ).

As an additional check on whether the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique was approximately equally effective for all students, a comparison was made between cognitive gains scores of low ability students in low-high ability pairs and low ability students in low-low pairings. Similarly, cognitive gains for high ability students in high-high pairings were compared with high ability students in high-low pairs. Average cognitive gain scores were essentially the same for all high and low ability students, regardless of whether they were paired with a high-ability or low-ability partner (all Fs were nonsignificant and less than 1.0,except the F for the high ability students in the Social Psychology course which was 2.7, $\mathsf { p } < . 1 2$ however, the differences were opposite of the expected direction with high ability students in high-high pairs showing slightly lower cognitive gains than high ability students in low-high pairs).

This finding that students of all ability pairings seemed to benefit equally from the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique is made clearer by the fact that student pairs showed only very small, nonsignificant differences in the amount of time they devoted to the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments.One-way ANOVAs of ability pairings showed that student pairs from both courses met roughly the same number of times with their partners $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 7 2 ) < 1 . 0 $ ns for the Social Psychology course; $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } ( 3 , 1 1 1 ) <$ 1.0,ns for the Industrial Psychology course) and spent about the same number of hours working on the assignments $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 7 5 ) = 2 . 5 6 , \mathrm { p } < . 0 7$ ,for the social course; $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } ( 3 , 1 1 1 ) = 1 . 2 5$ ns, for the industrial course). In addition, analyses of covariance using hours invested in the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments as a covariate, did not alter the results of the initial ANOVAs. (Incidentally, the correlation between hours spent on the RPT assignments and cognitive gain scores was positive, but nonsignificant, $\mathbf { r } = . 1 1 .$ In other words, even when controlling for time invested in the assignments, there were no significant differences among ability pairings on cognitive gains. All groups appeared to benefit equally from the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy.

In order to test whether all Reciprocal Peer Tutoring students performed better than students not using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategies, a comparison was made of post-test scores on the comprehensive exam between all students from the I/O Psychology course with comparison students from an earlier semester who completed similar assignments,but not using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategies (Note: pre-test scores on the comprehensive exam for these two groups were nearly identical: RPT students Mean $= 1 1 . 8$ Comparison/Control students $\mathbf { M e a n } = 1 1 . 9 )$ .A one-way ANOVA comparing post-test scores showed that students using Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategies exhibited higher post-test scores (Mean $= 1 8 . 5$ $\mathbf { s } = 2 . 9$ .. ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 1 1 9$ than did Comparison/Control students (Mean $= 1 6 . 0$ .. $\mathbf { s } = 3 . 5$ .. $n = 2 2$ - $( \mathrm { F } ( 2 1 , 1 1 8 ) = 2 . 1 6 , \mathrm { p } < . 0$ see Figure 1).

Since earlier research had demonstrated better psychosocial adjustment in students using the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy, we also explored the differential effects of the different ability pairings on student satisfaction with the university.As in the main analysis above, a one-way ANOVA on the deviation scores of the first and second administrations of the College Satisfaction Scale revealed no significant differences among ability pair groups in terms of changes in level of satisfaction with the university (all $\mathrm { F s } < 1 . 0$ .Contrary to expectations, however, overall student satisfaction with the university declined an average of one point for all students.This (nonsignificant) decline may be attributed to the fact that between the first and second administrations of the College Satisfaction Scale it became clear to students that the university was undergoing unprecedented budget cuts that would severely cut the next semester's course offerings, as well as support services on campus.

FIGURE 1 Pre-Test and Post-Test Scores on Comprehensive Exam for RPT Groups and Comparison/Control Subjects

Subjects were also asked whether they found the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring assignments to be helpful and more beneficial than other classroom learning interventions.As in all of the other measures,there were no significant differences among ability pairings in how the students perceived the assignments (all $\mathrm { F s } < 1 . 0 $ ).Overall, students found the assignments helpful (Mean of all subjects $= 6 . 2$ on a 9-point scale),and more beneficial than other learning strategies (Mean $= 7 . 2$ on a 9-point scale).

# DISCUSSION

The results of this study supported the notion that the cognitive gains achieved through reciprocal peer tutoring are relatively unaffected by the academic ability level of the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring pairs. All combinations of ability pairs-high-high,low-high,low-low-benefited about the same from the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring technique.It makes sense that students of different academic abilities would benefit similarly from Reciprocal Peer Tutoring,because the strength of the technique is that it requires each partner to play the tutor role.This means that each partner must prepare instructional materials for his/her partner. Research has shown that preparing to teach and actually teaching or tutoring leads to large cognitive gains in the teacher/tutor (Annis, 1983;Bargh & Schul, 1980).Moreover, this particular Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy involved very structured and proven learning assignments (i.e., making up multiple-choice tests,answer sheets, and outlining important points from the course).Since each student was required to perform all of these proven learning tasks, and since all students appeared to participate at about the same level, it seems reasonable that academic ability would not affect cognitive gains over the semester.

This research is a particularly important extension of research on Reciprocal Peer Tutoring because of the previous work with college students which has demonstrated that Reciprocal Peer Tutoring techniques are superior to individual study strategies or unstructured group meetings (FantuzzoDimeff,&Fox1989FantuzzoRiggio et al.1989Riggioetal. 1991).Moreover,the effectiveness of Reciprocal Peer Tutoring with undergraduates is bolstered by studies demonstrating that RPT techniques enhance cognitive gains for graduate students (Blakely,Fantuzzo, Gorsuch,& Moon,1987)andelementary school students (Fantuzzoetal.,1992;Fantuzzo, Polite& Grayson,1990PigottFantuzzo& Clement1986Wolfe, Fantuzzo,& Wolfe, 1986).

Contrary to expectations, however, we did not find that the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy had any positive effects on students' satisfaction with the university.In fact, satisfaction scores declined a bit over the course of the semester, which may have been due to the campus-wide decline in course offerings and student services caused by the economic recession.Another possibility is that global university satisfaction is too broad a variable (or that the College Satisfaction Scale is not sensitive enough) to be affected by a learning intervention in a single course. Consistent with expectations, however, there were no significant differences by ability pairings on either university satisfaction or satisfaction with the Reciprocal Peer Tutoring strategy.This coincides with the fact that students registered few complaints with the instructor about the strategy.None of the few complaints dealt with the academic ability ofthe Reciprocal Peer Tutoring partner.Rather, they dealt with the difficulties in arranging convenient meeting times or places for students living great distances from each other. Although these findings did not illustrate the effect that Reciprocal Peer Tutoring has in fostering a social support system in the college classroom, as has been demonstrated in previous research Fantuzzo, Riggio, Connelly& Dimeff, 1989Riggio et al., 1991), informal observations showed that some relationships were developing and that an "academic' form of social support was indeed taking place.Often, students would inform the instructor that the partner was ill and would be absent from a class. Reciprocal Peer Tutoring partners began to sit with each other and take notes in the partner's absence.For a commuter university, such as CSUF, these sorts of peer relationships, regardless of the fact that they are short-lived and rather superficial, may help provide the academic and social integration necessary for building commitment to students' academic careers (see Pascarella & Chapman, 1983;Tinto, 1975).

Reciprocal peer tutoring has been previously shown to be an easy-toimplement and cost-effective instructional strategy for use in the college classroom.Given the current and ongoing cutbacks for funding in higher education, Reciprocal Peer Tutoring is a promising strategy since it is classroom-based and requires no extra or special resources. In addition, because Reciprocal Peer Tutoring requires assigning students to dyads, potentially supportive social structures are created in the classroom environment. This can be particularly important for students on a large campus, or for "commuter' students (as were all of the students in this study) who may experience a sense of social isolation.
