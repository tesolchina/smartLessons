Motivated by the assumption that the recycling of directional determinants (DDs) (the research purposes, hypotheses, questions) across English research articles (RAs) is evidence of the writer's responsibility, this study sought to investigate any potential differences between English and Iranian researchers in the recycling of DDs throughout RA sections. To this end, 600 empirical RAs representing six soft science disciplines from 2006 to 2018 were chosen, 300 of which were authored by English L1 scholars and another 300 by Iranian researchers. The quantitative analysis revealed similarities between the two groups of scholars, with the DD recycling appearing more frequently in the Discussion section than in other sections, and in Economics than in other disciplines. In the qualitative phase, the two groups of authors' common rationales for the DD recycling, including editorial policy, RA length, English academic writing conventions, and reader guidance were determined. However, only two reasons were identified in novice Iranian researchers' responses: redundancy and English academic writing conventions. This implies that EAP writing course designers need to provide more explicit teaching materials to help novice nonEnglish L1 researchers find out how the DD recycling in each RA section directs the writing of that section and contributes to text coherence.

# 1. Introduction

Nowadays, English has become the global language of scholarship necesstating the fluency of countless academics around the world in English academic writing conventions. These norms and conventions are not easily acquired by novice and non-English L1 (non-Eng L1) academics until they are explicitly made conscious of such conventions. One of the requirements for writing English academic texts is to compose reader-friendly texts by providing various kinds of comprehension cues because as Hinds (1987) proposed, English has a writer-responsible culture. This means that in English, it is up to the writer to make the text as clear and comprehensible as possible for the intended audience. Inded, in writer-responsible languages such as English, writers predict areas Where readers may require asstance with text comprehension and mee this need by interspersing guiding signals throughout teir texts. In reader-responsiblecultures, the situation is reversed where writers are les explicit and leave much for the reader to infer (Kuhi, 2017).

Hinds' (1987) distinction between writer-responsible and reader-responsible cultures sparked a flood of cross-cultural studies (Blagojevic, 2012; Butler et al., 2013; Peterlin, 2013; Qi & Liu, 2007; Salski & Dolgikh, 2018; Wang, 2002). These scholarly works typically sought to ascertain the extent to which non-Eng 1 writers can provide various types of text comprehension signals, as well as to determine whether their texts fl into Hinds' reader- or writr-oriented dichotomy. For instance, in astudy of 3 esas written by Chinese Ph.D. students, Qi and Liu (2007) discovered that the main information in the paragraphs was not centered on a single theme, resulting in a confusing and disorganized discourse structure, which they attributed to China's reader-responsible culture.

Traces of writer-responsible culture can be found in the application of a variety of rhetorical cues such as move recycling (MR) in English research articles (RAs). A move can be defined as a discoursal or rhetorical unit that performs a communicative function in a written or spoken discourse" (Swales, 2004, p. 228-229). However, in MR, a tex transitions from one type of move to another and then returns to the firt type (Kanoksilapatham, 2007). Swales (2004) believes that the length factor in social science RAs contributes to MR.

Although the recycling of a specific move/sub-move within a RA section signifies is importance, MR across RA sections can be more striking because it links RA sections and highlights the relations between them. This results in increased cohesion throughout the RA, assis the readers in not losing their way, facilitates their journey through the tex, and allows them to move quickly across RA sections without having to check the recycled moves. Despite its importance, MR acros the Introduction, Method, Results, and Dis cussion (MR) setions of soft science RAs has received ittl attentio. Consequently, novice itructors from arious disciplines may have implict knowledge of the use of MR across RA sections, and use i pontaneously in their papers, but may not be able to explain to their students why such move/step recycling is needed. Nonetheles, both inexperienced teachers and students need to be acquainted with MR as a well-established resource for soft science RAs, to become fully capable members of their discourse communities.

Among the various moves/sub-moves that could be recycled acros RA sections, purpose statements, research hypotheses, and/or research questions, the threesub-moves of presenting the present work' (move 3) in Swales (2004) move model that gere analysts (e. 8., Feak & Swales, 2011; Kwan, 2021; Lim, 2010, 2018) collctively referred to as directional determinants DDs), were selected for the current study. This i for thre rsons. First ince their inclusion in Swales (2004) revised CARS model, they have been the focus of a large number of studies (e.g., wan, 2021; Lim, 2010, 2014, 2018; Lim et al, 2014; Lim et al, 2015; Lim & Lu0, 2020), indicating their significance. However, these studies have focused solely on DDs in the Introduction sections of RAs/theses, ignoring their presence in other sections f RAs. As a result, it is unclear how Ds are recycled across RA sections to carry out their communicative functions. Furthermore, whilescholars confirmed that inexperienced researchers have dificulty writing Ds in the Introduction sections of high-stakes research texts such as RAs, the possbility that these novice researchers may struggle to recycle DDs across other RA sections, and to understand why recycling needs to be done, are isues that stil need to be addressed. Finall, although Ds may be recycled appropriately by Iranian researchers (as with other non-Eng L1 authors), one unresolved ssue is whether they purposefully recycle them to guide their readers or merely follow in the footsteps of their natie English speaker counterparts. In light of this, the current study sought to identify whether there are diffrences in the recycling of DDs across RA sections between authors whose dominant language i English (Eng L1) and Iranian authors as non-Eng L1 researchers, and whether these scholars are aware of the reasons for recycling.

# 1.1. Directional determinants

The term "directional determinants", was introduced by Lim (2010) and has been adopted by Feak and Swales (2011, p. 112) to refer to the purpose of the study, research questions, and/or hypotheses. The three determinants have been defined by Kwan (2021) as follows. The purpose of the study is "a declarative sentence(s), which announces what astudy intends to study" (p. 195). It can be distinguished by various lexico-grammatical cues (ee Lim et al., 2015). A reearch question (RQ) is an interrogative about an inquiry object realized in a standalone question form' (p. 196). Finally, hypothesis (H), "is a declarative sentence that predicts the rela tionship between two variables' (p. 195, and can be signaled by different word ordering such as It is predicted that .., It is expected that .. ' or simply 'hypothesis' (see Lim & Luo, 2020). In recent years, many scholars, particularly Lim (2014) and his colleagues have shown a kee interes i these determinants. Lim (2014) investigated the use f RQs, while Lim et al. (2014) examined the use of hypotheses, and subsequently, Lim et al. (2015) studied purpose statements in the introductory chapters of doctoral dis sertations in Language Education and Applied Linguisics, shedding particular light on the lexico-grammatical tructures of DDs in this genre, among other valuable findings.

Meanwhile, several researchers have acknowledged the presence of DDs in various sections of RAs, including the Introduction (Swales, 2004), Method (Peacock, 2011), Results (Chen & Kuo, 2012), and Discussion (Joseph & Lim, 2018). Notwithstanding, they have used diffrent terms to refer to DDs: Peacock (2011), for instance, referred to them as 'research aims/questions/hypotheses', while Joseph and Lim (2018) referred to them as background information', and Sheldon (2019) call them focus of the study. Some genre analysts . Feak & Swales, 2011; wan, 2021; Lim, 2014, 2018 usedDas an umbrella term to reer t all thre derminants that "have bearing on the way in which a reearch report or disertation wil proceed and develop Lim, 2014, p. 67). (This definitin of DD has also been adopted in the current study.)

While thesestudies are crucial for our understanding of DDs within a specific section of RAs, they do not provide information about the recycling of DDs across IMRD sections of RAs.In addition, no previous research has examined the recycling of DDs as n indicator of writer-responsbility in English soft science RAs. Moreover, even though several move-based studies have been carried out in Iran (e. g., Behnam & Nikoukhesal, 2017; Farzannia & Farnia, 2017; Soltani et al, 2021; Tavakoli Gheinani & Tabatabaei, 2018), the recycling of DDs has not been their primary focus. The aforementioned ssues and a dearth of research in this particular aea piqued our interest in conducting this study and determining whether there are differences betwee Eng L1 and Iranian reearchers in recycling Ds across RA sections. dditionally, we sought to identify whether the two groups under investigation were aware of the rationale for recycling DDs. The study then delved deper into the data analysis by examining Iranian novice researchers justifications for recycling DDs.

More specifically, the study was shaped to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the differences between Eng L1 and Iranian researchers in recycling DDs across RA sections?   
2. What are the perspectives of Eng L1 and Iranian researchers on the recycling of DDs across RA sections?   
3. Are Iranian novice researchers aware of the rationales for recycling DDs in their RAs?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. The study design

There were two phases in this mixed-method study. As part of a quantitative phase, the study looked at the overallfrequency count of the recycling of DDs across RA sections and the possible variations between the two groups ofauthors in their aplication. The qualitative phase was divided into two stages: the first was an email survey to gather Eng L1 and Iranian scholars perspectives on the recycling of Ds; the second was focused on in-person interviews wth Iranian novice reearchers to study their rationales for recycling.

# 2.2. Qualitative phase

# 2.2.1. The study corpus

The study used 600 RAs with IMRD sections, published in prestigious journals (Appendix) between 2006 and 2018, 300 of which were written by Iranian authors and the remaining 300 by Eng L1 scholars. Following Becher's (1989) taxonomy of oft and hard sciences, six disciplines as representative of soft science (Sociology, Linguistics, Psychology, Management, Economics, and Applied Linguistics) were selected for the current study. These disciplines were preferred because (a) they had RAs with MRD structure, which was required for this study, and (b) Iranian reearchers frequently publish in the medium of English in these disciplines, thus making it possible to collect suficient English RAs authored by Iranian researchers. We subsequently conducte interviews with 24 Iranian PhD students from two famous universities in Tabriz who had produced RAs included in the Iranian corpus. It is worth noting that finding RAs that met the above criteria proved diicult because, for instance, not all Economics RAs have an IMRD structure.

# 2.2.2. Journal selection

Following Nwogu (1997), journals were selected based on their representativeness, accessbility, and reputation among their respective discourse communities. More precisely, 24 skilled Iranian professors four in each of the six disciplines) with numerous RA publications in reutable journals were asked to nominate four prestigous jourals in their respective fields. Iranian authors in certain disciplines such as Sociology, had not published a sufficient number of RAs in the journals that we had originally selected. We, therefore, had to include more journals in our corpus, based on our informants' suggestions.

# 2.2.3. Model of analysis

Although the current study was pattern-seeking not patten-imposing, Swales (2004) revised CARS model was used as a guide to facilitate the searches. Because determinants were placed in move 3 (presenting the present work) of this model (move 3.1, outlining purposes/announcing present research, and move 3.2, research questions or hypotheses), this model was used to facilitate the searches. The following extracts from the corpus of the current study exemplify these rhetorical segments.

2.2.3.4. RQs in the Tntroduction. Abdolrezapour (2012).

# 2.2.4. Quantitative data analysis procedure

When downloading the desired RAs for the current study from the Intenet, the IMRD structure, time frame (2006-2018), and RA authors' cultural backgrounds wereall taken into account. It is worth noting that RAs were downloaded in late 2018 and were chosen from a 13-year archive of recent journal publications. RAs co-authored by Iranian and Eng L1 authors, or by Eng L1 and non-Eng L1 authors, were excluded. To differentiate Eng L1 authors, from those from other countries, irst their affliations were examined to determine whether they were from one of the following four English-speaking countries: the United States of America (US), Australia New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (UK). The selected RA authors were contacted via email to find out whether they were Eng L1 authors or not.

The first author of this study analyzed all 600 RAs. Nevertheless another rater with a doctorate in Applied Linguistics and experience with move analysis was recruited to independently analyze 300 RAs, with equal numbers in each discipline and culture, to mitigate the degree of subjectivity inherent in a single individual's identification of moves.

Prior to analyzing RAs, the invited rater was informed that, firs, following some established scholars (Feak & Swales, 2011; Kwan, 2021; Lim, 2018), research purposes/questions/hypotheses should be considered DDs, and any repetition of each of these rhetorical segments should be regarded as the recycling of a DD. Second, a mere mention of the words "objective", \*research question" or hypothesis" was not considered form of recycling. For example, if we came across asentence like "these results partially confrm our hypothesis," there was no recycling of any DD because the reader was not reminded of the hypothesis.

The following example from an Economics RA (Hanafizadeh et al., 2010) may clarify the points:

# 2.2.4.1. Hs in the Introduction.

1. Privately owned vehicles are commuting lessthan the period before fuel rationing. 2. Traffic load has decreased as compared to the period before the rationing.   
3. Owners of automobile and light pickup trucks awarenesstowards optimization of vehicular fuel consumption has increased as compared to the period before the rationing.   
4. The use of fuel smartcards and the rationing of petrol have reduced petrol consumption.   
5. The use of fuel smartcards and the rationing of petrol have reduced air pollution.   
6. Petrol consumption statistics conform to the perception automobile and light pickup truck owners.   
7. Traffic load statistics conform to perception of automobile and light pickup truck owners.   
8. Air pollution statistics conform to perception of automobile and light pickup truck owners.

2.2.4.2. The recycling of Hs in the Method. In the first section, Hypotheses 15(opinion of automobile and light pickup truck owners on the positive effcts of the fuel smartcard) are investigated and in the second, Hypotheses 6-8 conformity of perception of automobile and light pickup truck owners with actual data) are examined.

2.2.4.3. The recycling of Hs in the Results. The firs occurrence f Hs in the Results section of this article was not regarded as their recycling because here the reader is not reminded of what Hs were:

- In order to verify Hypotheses1-5, single-sample t-tests were used.   
- Hypotheses6-8, statistical trend analysis, variance analysis, and the $\mathbf { x } ^ { 2 }$ guests were put to use.

Conversely, the subsequent occurrences of the hypotheses in the Results section of this article (Hanafizadeh et al., 2010) were regarded as their recycling:

.. hi rects Hypothesis 6 (the actudl figures on petrol consumption are in line with the owners of automobil and light pickup trucks perception)

.. hence proving Hypothesis 7(traffic load statistics conform to perception of automobile and light pickup truck owners) to be correct.

Another determinant that was recycled in the Results section of this paper was the purpose statement which was counted separately:

In this study, the focus was on air pollution caused by transportation, assuming pollution from other sources (industrial, resi. dential, and natural) to be constant.

Therefore, the Results secion of the sample RA (i.e., Hanafizadeh et al., 2010) witnessed twice the recycling of DDs: one was related to Hs, and the other related to the purpose statement. This scenario was repeated in the Discussion, where the simple repetition of Hs was not considered recycling.

For the identification of DDs, we used Connor and Mauranen's (1999) guidelines, which suggest that while a change in communicative purpose is the primary criterion for determining move boundaries, paying attention to linguistic cues, lexical words, and phrases can help in this proces. For example, to identify Hs, we used contextual cues such as 'the first hypothesis was ..', ' we hy. pohit., it sht.,' we exet.., it  st..   ., 2014. t  t ifit o identify RQs because, as Lim (2014) indicated, they were mostly of two types: wh-questions or polar questions (beginning with is/are do/does, and will. Likewise, for distinguishing purpose statements, we benefite from different hints such as this study explored ..', 'the focus of this study was ...', 'this study investigated', and 'the purpose of this study was ...' (see Lim et al., 2015).

Afer identifying DDs, we determined instances of their rcycling throughout the IMRD sections of the RAs. We then obtained a high value for inter-rater reliability $\left( \mathbf { r } = . 8 9 \right)$ . Moreover, to eliminate any potential mistakes, a reanalysis of 180 RAs was carried out by the researcher after a one-month interval. The calculated intra-rater reliability also was found to be high $\mathbf { \tilde { r } } = 0 . 9 5 $ . It should be noted that because RAs wer t all t sme length, r frequeny counts wre irt duste to the engthcriterion ie the were normalized as occurrences per 100,000 words) and then rounded, a rcommended by Hyland (2009). Finally, a Chi-square test was used to identify potential differences between Eng L1 and Iranian researchers in the recycling of DDs.

# 2.3. Qualitative data analysis procedure

# 2.3.1. Stage 1

In the irs tage of the qualitative phase of the study, a total of 120 authors of empirical RAs, 60 from Eng 1 and 60 from Iranian groups, with an equal number in each discipline were invited via email to provide us with their justifications for the rcycling of DDs across RA sections. There was no direct inquiry into their knowledge of recycling because it was a technical term and was likely to be unfamiliar to researchers from a variet f feds with varying degree of proficiency. As an altenative, we emailed each author a PDF fileof their paper and a Microsoft Word document which grouped, according to determinant, the sentences in their paper where DDs had been recycled. We used an open-ended question in our email to ascertain why they repeated these segments (i. DDs) throughout their RA sections. To gain their agreement to take part in the study, we promised them that their answers would be used anonymously in the project.

Only 38 authors provided us with their explanations, of which 30 (12 from Eng L1 and 18 from Iranian groups) were subjected to thematic analysis. The remaining 8 responses were deemed irrelevant and excluded from the study. When authors cited multiple reasons for the recycling of DDs, each reason was coded and counted separately (see the example below, where we have written in bold type the three reasons for the recycling of DDs provided by an Iranian author in Management).

2.3.1.1. Excert 1 (Irann, Managment). Athough itis a convention, it may be influenced by journal - imposed critria. If I was limited by word count , I should get to the point quickly without such repetition. Reason 1

Reason2

# 2.3.2. Stage 2

During the first stage of aqualitative study, we noticed that some Iranian authors responded to our email with a delay (1-2 weeks after we sent to them our inquiry), whereas Eng L1 authors typically responded quickly (usually on the same day or one day afer our emails). This prompted us to conduct a follow-up interview with novice Iranian RA writrs to acertain whether they felt compelled to align their texts with the expectations of established members of their disciplinary communities in the international arena and whether these researchers were aware of the rational for the recycling of DDs. To that end, we invited 24 Iranian post-graduate students, four from each discipline, who had recently published RAs as part of their graduation requirement, to participate in the study and provide us with their prompt responses on DD recycling.

As with the first stage (email interview), they were not directly challenged about their rcycling of DDs, rather, examples of the recycling of Ds were highlighted in the hard copies of their papers and shown to them, and they were asked to share their reasons for recycling. Each student was interviewed for approximately $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , and their responses were transcribed and analyzed later. Their responses led us to speculate that those Iranian participants in the firs stage who did not respond quickly to our email survey may hae been inexperienced researchers and unable to adequately justify the recycling of Ds in RAs. Consequently, they might have required some additional time to seek clarification from experts in the field before responding to our inquiry.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1. RQ 1: The difference between the two groups of authors

The first research question sought to find potential differences between Eng L1 and Iranian RA authors in the recycling of DDS across RA sections. Table 1 represents the normalized frequency (per 100,ooo Words) of DDs recycled by Eng L1 authors acros soft science RA sections.

As displayed in Table 1, in the Eng L1 group the recycling of DDs is most prevalent in the Economics RAs $( \mathrm { f } = 1 3 5 )$ , and least frequent in the Psychology RAs. Other disciplines ranked between these two extremes: Sociology $( \mathbf { f } = 1 1 2 )$ , Management $( \mathrm { f } = 9 0 ) \mathrm { \Omega }$ Applied Linguistics $( \mathbf { f } = 8 1 )$ , and Linguistics $( \mathrm { f } = 6 5 )$ . Additionally, Table 1 indicates that Eng L1 researchers recycle DDs more frequently in the Discussion section $( \mathrm { f } = 2 2 2 ) ,$ , followed by the Introduction section $( \mathrm { f } = 1 4 9 )$ . The third place $( \mathbf { f } = 9 1 \mathbf { \dot { \Omega } }$ ) goes to the Results section, while the Method section is ranked fourth $( \mathrm { f } = 7 6 ) $ . We also needed the frequency of DDs recycled by Iranian scholars, which is represented in Table 2.

Table 2 illustrates the frequencies with which Iranian authors recycle DDs in the different social science disciplines: Economics $( \mathbf { f } =$ 107), Sociology $( \mathrm { f } = 8 7 )$ , Management $( \mathbf { f } = 7 7 )$ , Applied Linguistics $( \mathrm { f } = 6 8 )$ , Linguistics $( \mathrm { f } = 5 3 )$ , and Psychology $\left( \mathrm { f } = 4 4 \right)$ . Moreover, the frequency with which Iranian authors recycle DDs acros RA sections may be arranged in the fllowing order: Discussion $( \mathbf { f } = 2 0 5 $ Introduction $( \mathbf { f } = 1 0 6 )$ , Results $( \mathbf { f } = 7 1 \cdot$ , and Method $( \mathrm { f } = 5 4 )$

Table 3 summarizes the total frequency of DDs recycled by Eng L1 and Iranian authors across RA sections.

Table 3 indicates that the recycling of DDs is exploited more frequently in papers written by Eng L1 authors $( \mathrm { f } = 5 3 8 )$ than in RAs authored by Iranian researchers $( \mathrm { f } = 4 3 6 )$ . The results of the Chi-square test indicated that the two groups of authors did not differ significantly in terms of the recycling of DDs across RA sections, X2 (3 $\mathord { \left. \begin{array} { r l r } { 3 , 9 7 4 } \end{array} \right) } = 0 . 3 2 4$ $\mathsf { p } > . 0 5$ , Cramer's $\mathrm { V } = 0 . 0 6$

One possible interpretation for the observed resemblance between the two groups of scholars is the prescriptive writing instruction across the two academic contexts. Current institutional policy in non-English setings is to include in textbooks a set of prescriptive rules and conventions for English academic writing (Atai & Shoja, 2011; Bennet, 2009; Hyland, 2002). Neglecting these rules stig matizes non-Eng L1 authors in English academicians' eyes (Harwood & Hadley, 2004). The recycling of Ds appears to have become one of these indiscernible norms of RAs, at least in the disciplines under this study.

The observed similarity between the two cultures corroborates earier researchers assertions about the universal application of RA rhetorical structures, most notably Widdowson (1979) and a number of scholars who have put a stamp of approval on his claim (e., Hyland, 2009; McCarthy, 2005; Parodi, 2010; Pennycook, 2008; Sheldon, 2019; Swales, 2004; Yakhontova, 2006). McCarthy (2005), for example, proposed that certain textual pattrns emerge repeatedly and gradually develop to become part of English academic writing conventions. In a similar vein, Parodi (2010) contends that some conventions can be established and may evolve to fulill the needs of different community members with different academic backgrounds.

As was mentioned, two additional findings are hidden in the reported results.First, the recycling of Ds was most common in Economics RAs and least prevalent in Psychology RAs. As Hyland (2009) emphasizes, writers need to demonstrate their awareness of the salient features of their discipline to appeal to specific readerships with specific expectations. In other words, the messages of the authors should be presented in an atractive way to satisfy their respective audiences (Hyland, 2o00). It can be asserted that by recycling DDs at a high or low level of frequency in a specific discipline, writers demonstrate their membership in the discourse communities in which they operate.

Another interesting finding was that the Discussion sections were the main plaforms for the recycling of Ds, while the Method sections accounted for the least amount of recycling. According to previous research (e.g., Feak & Swales, 2011; Kwan, 2021; Ozturk, 2007; Saz Rubio, 2011; Swales, 2004), Introductions are the primary sections for establishing DDs, in which authors attempt to adequately elaborate on DDs. As the Method section follows the Introduction, authors probably assume that re-mentioning it in the Method sections is unnecessary. However, because the Method and Results sections are located between the Introduction and Dis. cussion, by the recycling of DDs in the Discussion ections, RA writers endeavor t establish connection between the two sections and eliminate the reader's need to double-check this move. As a direct consequence, readers may enjoy a more consistent reading experience.

# 3.2.RQ2: Email interview

The second study question concerned the perceptions of Eng L1 and Iranian scholars regarding the recycling of DDs. According to the participants, four major factors may motivate RA authors to recycle DDs (see Table 4).

# 3.2.1. Journal guidelines

Two Eng L1 authors and three ranian researchers cited journal guidelines as one of their reasons for the recycling of DDs. The excerpts below contain this theme:

# 3.2.1.1. Excerpt 2 (Eng L1, Applied Linguistics)

"I think that repeating the highlighted sections is aconvention in academic writing which is something necessary for your work to be published in the world-leading journal."

# 3.2.1.2. Excerpt 3 (Iranian, Linguistics)

'It is not easy to remember clearly the exact purpose of an article and when readers read the research. This might also be important for editors and article reviewers."

It is clear that writers should adhere to discipline-specific conventions to persuade their readers, particularly journal reviewers. Therefore, by the recycling of Ds, RA authors strive to bestow credibility and qualit to their works, without which thir RAs could be seriously questioned, if not immediately rejected.

# 3.2.2. The length of RAs

Another main reason, which was embodied in $5 0 \%$ of Eng L1 and $3 8 . 8 \%$ of Iranian authors' email responses, was the length of RAs. The following extracts are provided to demonstrate this theme.

# 3.2.2.1. Excerpt 4 (Eng L1, Sociology)

\*Academic articles are long and full of details and supporting points. By repeating my main points, I hope to be clear about how smaller points are supposed to fit into the whole argument."

3.2.2.2. Excerpt 5 (Iranian, Economics). \*We repeat the aim of the study throughout the long paper to lay particular stress on the importance of our study. In this way, repetition helps the readers to remind and comprehend the purpose of the paper and whether the whole article is of their interest or not."

As previously stated in the quantitative phase, the recycling of DDs occurs les frequently in Psychology RAs than in Economics RAs because the latter are about 13000 words in length and nearly twice as long as Psychology RAs. It can be stated that when a large amount of new information is presented in long RAs with litle repetition, the text becomes dificult to comprehend. One possible interpretation is that in lengthy RAs, readers may require more comprehension cues such as D recycling to continue reading without having to go back to previous sections and check a particular move such as a DD. On the basis of this assumption and the assrtions of eminent scholars such as Swales (2004), it s plausible to infer that the length of RA has a substantial impact on the recycling of DDS.

# 3.2.3. Conformity to English academic writing conventions

Adherence to English academic writing conventions was the next most frequently cited reason for D recycling. More precisely,this theme was found in 7 out of 12 or $5 8 . 3 \%$ of Eng-L1 and 12 out of 18 or $6 6 . 6 \%$ of Iranian authors' responses. The following examples illustrate this theme.

# 3.2.3.1. Excerpt 6 (Eng L1, Sociology)

suspect most people do not have a single reason for repeating the key theme/s of their articles. tend to follow the framework described in Creswell's book and repeat them as a way of elaborating the purpose statement that introduces the study."

# 3.2.3.2. Excerpt 7 (Eng L1, Psychology)

"We introduce our hypotheses as we cover the relevant background in the introduction. We then wanted to remind the reader of the set of hypotheses at the end of the introduction, as that is typically recommended. We again remind the reader of hypotheses when we tackle analyses, so that they can pair the analyses with the specific hypothesis; this is also typical. Finally, in the Discussion, we repeat our hypotheses as we consider whether each one was supported, again a bit of a convention.'

We are all aware that some academic rules are universally accepted. The recycling of DDs appears to be a wellestablished onvention of English RAs. Non-Eng L1 writers who are required to write in English thus have to ster their texts toward the norms f this language in order to avoid violating the expectations of scholars and community members, particularly in Eng L1 academic settings.

# 3.2.4. The writers' desire to meet the readers' need for guidance

The last but most frequently cited reason for the recycling of DDs was reader guidance, which was mentioned by 25 out of 30 participants $( 9 1 . 6 \%$ of $\mathrm { E n g ~ L 1 }$ authors and $7 7 . 7 \%$ of Iranian authors), and thus was considered the fundamental reason for the DD recycling. This reason is mentioned in the above examples in conjunction with the three preceding themes (see excerpts 7, 5, 3); however, the following example is solely devoted to this factor.

# 3.2.4.1. Excerpt 8 (Linguistics, Eng L1)

The alarming frequency of identified sections, in my opinion, demonstrates their importance and compels readers to eventually recall and notice these parts."'

From both groups of researchers' viewpoints, DD recycling is used to engage readers with their guiding signals throughout their RAs. This reflects another aspect of the English academic writing convention, namely the writers' responsibility. As mentioned previously, in languages where the write isheld responsible such as English, readers expect the main idea to be presented in suficient detail by the author so that the text can be easily understod. Hence the writer should employ a variety of hints to help readers in ther comprehension of a given text (Kuhi, 2017). One piece of evidence for such guiding devices is the recycling of Ds across RA sections. Indeed, the recycling of DDs empowers the reader by giving them repeated opportunities t reflect on the text and test their understanding of the recycled DDs. Linear organization does not provide such opportunities.

# 3.3. RQ3: Interview with Iranian novice researchers

The final research question is intended to determine whether Iranian novice researchers are aware of the underlying reasoning behind the recycling of DDs across RA sections. The answer to this question was shaped by a thematic analysis f the perspectives of 24 Iranian postgraduate students on this subject. All participants $( 1 0 0 \% )$ indicated that DD recycling was a common practice in RA writing in their academic fields. However, six students added that it was redundant (see Table 5).

Based on these responses, one could argue that, whil inexperienced Iranian RA authors may recycle DDs appropriately throughout their RA sections, they may be unaware of the reasons for their recycling. This adherence to English academic writing standards and conventions by non-Eng L1 researchers in general, and Iranian researchers in particular, demonstrates their respect for such conventions. It may, however, afect their judgment if they imitate blindly and do not work criticly todecipher the logic behind these rules. Conversely, educational programs in western academic contexts seek to strengthen students analytcalattitudes and encourage them to apply these standards and conventions with greater criticality and awareness (Hyland, 2006).

# 4. Conclusion

In writer-responsible cultures, we can think of atext as a place where the writer and reader engage in interaction, in which the writer asumes much of the responsibility and is in a position to provide adequate comprehension cues. As an inseparable norm of soft science RAs, the rcycling of DDs can be considered a type of rhetorical cue, with the ultimate goal of increasing the coherence between RA sections and speeding up the reading process.

More specifically, in English the ownership of the text is the writer; they strive to make their text as reader-friendly as possible, anticipating where their ddresses may need their asstance i comprehending Ds, and recycling DDs to ensure that their readers understand DDs appropriately.

In the context of the current study, the writer's responsibilit can be documented by the fact that all factors contributing to the recycling of Ds across RA sections are intended to guide readers. A review of these factors may help to clarify how they all serve as indicators of authors responsibility in RA writing. First according to the findings, the Discussion section contains the highest amount of recycling due to its distance from the Introduction section. Here the writer's challenge is apparent: to close the gap between the Introduction and Discussion sections and ast readers in maintaining a consistent reading experience. Second, the recycling of DDs was found to occur more often in Economics RAs than in Psychology RAs. Once again, writers efforts to aid readers in text comprehension come into play: it appears that researchers in the field of Economics are required to write longer RAs to adhere to discipline-specific conventions, which necesstates more frequent recycling of Ds across RA sections, demonstrating writers careful attention to their audience and their need for support. Another inerconnected reason for DD recycling was enculturation into English academic conventions. This i ust another sign of authors desire to mee th expectations of ther readers, most notably journal editors and reviewers from whom they receive green cards for article acceptance. Based on what has been discussed, it can be concluded that all factors contributing to the recycling of DDs are inextricably linked and work together to make reading easier.

The other side of the coin is that according to the qualitative findings novice Iranian authors are not aware of the writer responsibility inherent in English academic text. This led us to conclude that, while commonly used rhetorical structures such as the recycling of DDs may be followed appropriately by authors of other languages, particularly novice members, this cannot be attributed to shared cultural assumptions about the discoursal value of such conventions. It seems likely that some more abstract conventions are overlooked by non-Eng L1 academics. Consequently, it iscrucial to develop critical pedagogy and students critical discourse competence in academic contexts such as Iran, where English i not the dominant language. Using this critical pedagogy, ESP and EAP instructors can sensitize students to the facthat any established rule for English academic writing has a rationale, so that these novice members criticlly analyze the culturally acepted discourse patterns of the target language(s rather than simply imitating them. They may also alert non-Eng L1 researchers to the writer-responsibility that pervades English academic texts, encouraging them to write with their raders in mind and to addres reviewers potential questions instead of viewing RAs as purely linguistic texts. Given that inexperienced reearchers not only need to be told that they should reiterate Ds, but also need to be shown how to avoid simple reetion, they may benefit from the examples provided in the current study. Finally, the findings of this study can be worthwhile for researchers and readers from reader-responsible languages with completely different expectations, to inform them about the way that DD recycling is used as a signal from the writer t the reader for text comprehension, and thus enable them to adjust their own texts accordingly when writing for international academic communities.

This study may pave the way for further investigations. In general, as there i a dearth of research focusing solely on the recycling of DDs, the current study can contribute to the vast ocean of genre studies by establishing a relatively new framework for analyzing different scientific texts. A parallel study could be conducted to compare English RAs written in reader-responsible culturesto those written by Eng L1 academics, to confirm that D recycling is a specific comprehension cue used in English RAs. inall, in the case of accesibility, novice researchers in Eng L1 contexs could be interviewed to verify thir familiarity with the reasons underlying the recycling of DDs.
