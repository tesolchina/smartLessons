Keywords: Academic discourse Academic oral presentation Discourse socialisation Rhetorical structure theory English for academic purposes

The integration into the tertiary curriculum of problem-based learning, and the growing awareness of the need for university graduates to enter the workforce with highly developed communication skills, has led to a greater focus in academic classrooms on oral communication. One aspect of this is the increased use of monologic student oral presentation tasks, a requirement that presents challenges for international and local students alike. There is little research beyond lexical features that centres on the rhetorical level in student presentations. This study attempts to characterise the rhetorical moves within undergraduate oral presentations. The data comprise transcribed presentations by local and international high-scoring students in core first-year undergraduate subjects in three different faculties $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 0 \right)$ . The methodology for the analysis was Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The analysis, which distributed RST relations into those contributing to the presentation's coherence and listener-oriented comprehensibility, identified the range and frequency of rhetorical moves within the dataset. Differences across disciplines appeared to be due to task requirements rather than disciplinary requirements per se. To conclude, we discuss the value of RST in the analysis of oral student data and its potential to inform the preparation of students for formal academic spoken discourse.

# 1. Introduction

Graduate employability sills, also known as 21st-century skill (e.g., Kivunja, 2014), are seen as essential for the workplace, and thus these kills reeive greater emphasis in the deign of the undergaduate curculum. s areult, thee are increasing expectations for students to develop such skills during their programs of study. Typicall, these skill consist of effctive communication, critical reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptability to change, with interpersonal and communication skill frequently including collaboration and presentation skills (Cheng et al., 2018)

One area of communication skill - the abilit toally present a sustained and coherent complex of ideas - is not only viewed as an essential graduate skill but also as a key aspect of academic readiness,as described in currculum standards in Austrlia e.g., Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), 2017). In addition, Heron (2019) argues that oracy skill should be made explicit in the curiculum, given that graduates may be required to present ideas, problems, and solutions to specialized or non-specialist audiences (see for example, Kember, 2009; Morrale & Pearson, 2008; Zivkovic, 2014). Through presentations, students acquire interdisciplinary generic kills such as clearly expressing knowledge and ideas (Sunol et al, 2016), the use of technical vocabulary and - in group presentations - the development of negotiation skill and team building (Solano Fernandez et al., 2011).

Given the increasing use f oral presentations in undergraduate learning and assesment, research is needed into the demands they place on students communication skills Practitioners would benefit from research that explores the demands presentations place on students communication skills Just a the ubiquity of academic esay writing has long benthe fous of analytcal studies designed to support students' socialisation into the demands of academia and the teaching of English for Academic Purposes (hereafter EAP) writing skill (see for example, Biber, 1991; Hyland, 2006; Swales, 1990; Swales & Feak, 2004), the increasing importance of oral presentations demands equal attention. The results of analytical studies on academic oral discourse could be significant in preparing non-native speaker students for enculturation into western, English-medium, academic life (Duff et al., 2019).

# 2. Spoken academic genres

There is a substantial body of work on spoken academic genres examining oral academic discourse by novice researchers (e.g, Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2020; Hu & Liu, 2018) as wel as by established academics delivering conference presentations, seminars, lectures. (.g., Guest, 2018; Kaur & Ali, 2018) For example, Zappa-Hollman (2007) examined the characterisics of graduate academic presentations in four disciplines in terms of their components and sequence. Unsurprisingly, given that the tasks were all research presentations, the structure reflected genre-based analyses of academic research articles, such as background, reearch aims, key studies, research method, results, expected findings, and critique of results.

A number of studies on professional training to deliver presentations for undergraduate students in technical and scientific fields contextualised the spoken academic genre (e.g., Kneale et al., 2016; Venable, 2010; Zivkovic, 2014). With regards to the first-year undergraduate student presentations analysed here, those studies iffer in that the first-year tasks in our data do not focus on making arguments about contributions t a field or discipline or passing on the rearch of others. Rather, students are being encouraged to develop public speaking skills while delivering course content to engage other students with material from the course's intended learning outcomes. The focus on the delivery of content in such presentation tasks makes oral language demands that have not been hitherto examined.

# 3. Oral academic discourse

Another strand addresses the gap between English skils acquired and those required for study at an English medium tertiay institution (e.g., Cheng e al., 2004; Morrison & Evans, 2018) by identifying the required academic skill and developing EAP programs when international students are perceived to lack strategies to address academic language challenges without additional support. These studies focus largely on the linguisic features of oral academic language use acrossa range of contexts and registers, such as those of Biber and collagues (Biber, 2006; Biber et al., 2004) and those discussed in Hyland and Bondi (2006). The corpus of oral academic language in both cases consisted of speech produced by students, tutors, and support saff, and recorded in a range of context, and the corpus studies examined the occurrence and co-occurrence of lexicogrammatical features across registers and disciplines. However, while the findings identified the linguistic characteristics that are the most important markers of each register, these reisters were defined oo brod- the oral reisters being classessions, labs and i-clas groups, office hours, std groups and service encounter - toallow a focus specificll on presentational language. Although speaking issignificant chllenge .., Berman & Cheng, 2001), ssues with academic writing rather than the challenges of oral academic discourse are addressed more frequently. There are studies explicitl intended tosupport the preparation of non-native speakers of English to enter English-medium educational institutions.

Research addressing the oral language demands in academia falls under academic discourse socialisation (e.g., Duff, 2007, 2010, Duff et l., 2019; Gutierrez, 1995; Morita, 2000, 2004). Such studies typically involve either an examination of students' understanding of the urpose of aask and its epistemc stance (e.g., Lee 2009; Morita, 200, 2004) or the identification of techniques that could be used to stimulate classrom interaction more generaly and lead to the succesful accomplishment f educational goals e., Benwell, 199; Benwell & Stokoe, 2002; Thomas et al., 2004). For example, key functional and interactional features of spoken aademic communication that have ben identified include expressing attitudes, judgments, and beliefs (Morita, 2000), giving an opinion, challenging, and generating alternative viewpoints (Berril, 1991), producing solutions and evaluations (Benwell 1999), leading discussion, gaining, and maintaining the floor (Benwell, 199; Morita, 2000). The main contention is for students to have the opportunity to engage with others whil learning, as acohort, the oral and written expectations of a particular educational context. Ho (2011) explores this with small groups of native and non-native speaker students developing academic skils such ascitical thinking by problem-solving in small group discussion.

While research to date on oral academic discourse has given us insights into the nature of the requirements for students to engage in classrom discussion, the linguistic requirementsof student oral presentations have atracted es reearch attention. Barret and Liu (2016), in areview of articles on oral presentations by non-native speakers from 2000 to 2014, identify three broad areas of research: the learning proces and atitudes towards it pedagogical affordances f learning technology; and features of the discourse itself. Article, fousing on the discourse, adressed differences between natie and non-native speakers, or expert and novice, in tems of the use of adverbs and level of formality (Zareva, 2009, 2011), vocabulary level (Ka0 & Wang, 2014), and genre awareness (Row. ley-Jolivet & Carter Thomas, 2005; Adel, 2023). While adverbials are used to overtly connect logical parts of presentations and support the flow of meaning and ideas conveyed by speakers and interpreted by listeners (Conrad, 199; Hinkel, 2003), Zareva (2011) found that the L2 speakers tended to overuse them. In addition, while studies on the mastery of academic language features recommended using non-linguisic reources to support the aquisition of academic language (e.g., Haneda, 2014), studies also focused explicitly on the linguistc features of oral academic language use acros a range of contexts and registers, such as those discussed in Hyland and

# Bondi (2006).

As conference presentations have moved increasingly to multimodal style presentations (Morell 2015) so have classroom presentations, leading t reearch int the fordance of technlogy. In their 2018reviw on oral presentations Kaur and Ali (2018)called for research into the efect of the slide-visuals in classoom presentations because students have diffculty in preparing and organizing content on the PPT slides used to structure their presentations (Mahfoodh, 2014).

The studies on rhetorical analysis identified in Kaur and Ali (2018) generall focused on a particular section of a presentation, i.e, introduction, body, conclusion, and Q/A but not an entire presentation. An example of a study that reports on functional moves across entire student academic oral presentations at firs-year evel reported on the fllowing functional moves: introduction and conclusion, definition, concept explanation (process or characteristics), examples, problem - solution and opinion justification. In that study Brown and Ducass (2019) surmised that perhaps in the firt year, while students are stil learning to delier multimodal presentations, these oral presentation tasks cannot be described as a genre in the same way one can describe academic writing. In fact, Kaur and Ali (2018) concur that the moves across the various sections of oral presentations, whether obligatory or optional, were inconclusive as a pattern because they appeared not to be fixed across Academic Oral Presentation studies.

Despite the interest and broad range of topics addressed so far, what is missing from research into oral academic discourse and presentations is a systematic analysis of the discourse features - the schematic structure, the range of rhetorical functions and the conceptul relationships betweenthem, in addtion to the inguisic forms that rrsent these unctions and relationships acros ntire presentations that are multimodal, i.e., using slides to structure the discourse.

Through an empirical examination of authentic student oral presentation data, we aim to characterise effective communication rather than unsatisfactory presentations and add to the litrature on the nature of irst year academic oral presentations of a specific type -presentation of the course content-in three isciplines. Just as disciplinary differences have been the focus of studies of written academic discourse (e.g., Silver, 2006), we also addressed the question of disciplinary differences in our study.

# 4. Analytic procedures

There are different methodologies available to present, identify and analyse rhetorical moves in discipline specific course content oral presentations including, but not limited to Textual Analysis (Hoey & Winter 1983), Genre Analysis (Swales, 1990) and Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann & Thompson, 1988), henceforth RST. As part of a larger study on this data set, RST, an analysis of the relationships between propositions, combined with Genre Theory (Martin, 1992, 1997), an analysis of generic structure and moves, (henceforth GT), provides complementary and useful information regarding the overall tructure of student presentations and the relationships at a more local level. This combination has proved rich enough to enable comparisons to be made of diffrent oral presentation types within the universty and with different speaking task types in high stakes tests (e.g., TOEFL iBT speaking).

In sum, RST describes texts in terms of the defined relationships that hold between their parts, specifically the organisation of coherent contiguous text, and GT decribes texts in terms of their holistic structure and the categories of proceses which they perform (Mann et al., 1992, pp. 39-78; Man & Matthiessen, 1991). Several writer (e.g., Heuboeck, 2009, Taboada & Lavid, 2003; Taboada & Mann, 2006) have noted the complementarity of the two approaches. Gruber and Muntigl (2005, p. 75) argue that by using a combination of the two t becomes possble o identify systematic patterns of textual features in context (using RST and GT) and culturally influenced, semantic coherence relations (using RsT)."

As applied linguis and language asssment discourse pecialists the authors selected RST specificlly for this study because there were no studies that looked systematicall at the discourse features and simultaneously at the patterns of coherence and cohesion in oral test discourse across entire discipline course context presentations while also representing large chunks of the discourse patten visually for the reader. Within the scope of this paper, only RST is applied to the data set. Three complete trees are presented as examples f formally structured English speech in academic oral presentations, selected for the acesibilit offered by a visual pre sentation of the coherence relations data in trees'. RST, originally designed to study written texts, would have been unusable if the discourse had been more spontaneous or disjointed. For this reason, only high performing student samples speaking with high coherence and cohesion were selected as 'display' trees for the paper.

# 5. Data collection

As part of the extended study comparing academic oral presentations and the TOEFL iBT, the participants were recruited with ethics approval via email within undergraduate programs acrosthee faculties in an Australian higher education context (Brown & Ducasse, 2019). Genre Analysis was applied to report on the functional moves in oral presentations and the TOEFL iBT. For that study, undergraduate students - equal numbers of native speakers and non-native speakers of English - were invited to participate from one first-year core subject in each of three faculties, where the subjects included an assessed oral presentation task.

As our aim in the study reported here was to characterise only effective presentations, we subsequently selected the ten highest scoring performances in each of the three disciplines for analysis $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 0 \right)$ . Scores were awarded by pairs of subject tutors using the criteria prescribed for the task within each subject area. The evaluation criteria used to assign a presentation to the highest scoring category were the instructor judgements made by following the discipline rating criteria for the subject. The student group, subsequently selected, included both native-and non-native speaker tudents. The presentation tass of the participating students were video recorded. These recordings were transcribed using guidelines developed by Brown et al. (2005). The average word count for the cleaned set of presentations was 644 words. Table 1 shows the average, minimum and maximum length of the presentations, by number of words, as well as the quantity of slides used as visual support.

# 6. Data context and participant tasks

The three participating courses were: Management Information Systems (MIS) in the Faculty of Business, Economics and Law, Social Determinants of Health (DH) in the Faculty of Health Science, and Organisation and Function of Cels and Organisms (BIO) in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. (See Appendix D for the topics covered in presentations.)

The BIO speaking task was one component of a group learning exercise, where a group of students were given a topic and one journal article rlating to their topic. After meeting to discuss and clarify the main points rased in the paper and discuss ways to approach the essay topic and the oral presentation, they individually researched the topic further and prepared an essay and a $1 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n }$ oral slide presentation to give to students who did not research that task. The assessment focus of the presentation was on quality of language and delivery, including body language, coherence, and support materials. The BIO task required students to prepare and deliver a short (approx. $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } $ ) oral presentation on one of three topics: Arabidopsis; Phylogenetics; and Archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes.

The MIS oral presentation was one component of a four-person group research assignment, with the group members each devel. oping and delivering one component of a $2 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n }$ slide presentation on the topic assigned to their group; the other subjects, SDH and BIO, involved individual presentations. The MIS topic areas were the major systems covered in the subject: enterprise resource planning; customer relations management; supply chain management; and information technology security. The assessment criteria focused on content (argument and effective use of evidence) and presentation skill (language, audience engagement and delivery)

The SDH task required each student to develop and present a short $( 3 { - } 4 \operatorname { m i n } )$ talk on a topic that they selected from a list provided or chose themselves based on readings or other media used in the subject, and to use this to lead into and manage a classdiscussion on the topic. Topics included the impact on individuals of folk health beliefs, the attitudes of health professionals, the media, and the influence f family and friends. The assessment focused on the content (understanding and transmission) and the delivery (language, clarity, and non-verbal communication) but no slides were used.

The rubrics for each course differed substantially in depth and focus, and variously adressed aspects of the presentation such as clarity of speech, language, use of visual aids, body language, and engagement. Some referred to pecific content features and hence provided guidance to the students about how to structure their presentations (See Appendix E for the rubrics).

# 7. Methodology

RST is a theory developed to describe the organization of texts. It was developed in the 1980s, based on the empirical analysis of authentic texts (Mann & Thompson, 1987; 1988). It breaks down and analyses text organisation through discursive or rhetorical relations between parts of a text Acording to Taboada and Mann (2006, p. 425), It explains coherence by postulating a hierarchical, connected structure of texts, in which every part of a text has a role, a function to play, with respect to other parts in the text."

RST describes the rhetorical relationships between parts of a text by building up a hierarchical structure from the lowest level units (typically clauses) to the most prominent elements of holistic structure, possbly even a whole text. The theory is based on a set of assumptions about tex structure derived from close observations of texts and are set out below paraphrased from Mann et al. (1992, pp. 43-46)

\*1) text is organised; 2) texts have unity and coherence; 3) unity and coherence arise from imputed function; 4) texts are hi. erarchical in that elementary parts are composed into larger parts; 5) the same set of relations holds across all levels of the hierarchy (homogeneity of hierarchy); 6) the principal structural pattern in multi-sentential text is relational; 7) the most common type of text structuring relation is asymmetric; 8) and text structuring relations are functional and can be described in terms of the purposes of the text producer, the text producer's assumptions about the audience, and the propositional patterns in the subject matter of the text" (Mann et al., 1992, pp. 39-78).

Within RST, the structure of a text, or section of text, is represented as tree diagram (Fig. 1). As explained by Carlson and Marcu (2001, p. 87) \*the leaves of the tre - the most basic units -] corrspond to text fragments that represent the minimal units of the discourse, called elementary dicourse units, or EDs. The treis buil hierarchcall fromthe leaes upwards, through the crationof nodes. "Each node is characterised by a rhetorical relation that holds between two or more non-overlapping, adjacent spans of text" (Carlson & Marcu, 2001, p. 87). A node typicall has a nucleus, which indicates the more essential unit of information, and "asatellite indicates a supporting or background unit of information' (Carlson & Marcu, 2001, p. 87), although some relations may be multi nuclear. The relationships holding between nucleus and satellite include, inter alia Circumstance, Motivation, Evidence, Justification, Cause, Purpose, Antithesis, Condition, and Contrast. Specific textual features may characterise relations. However, relations are inferable based on the intent of the message contained in the particular text spans, and so are not dependent on the occurrence or

position of specifically related linguistic markers.

In the example below, there are three sequential EDUs. The first two make up a node where the first EDU is in a temporal-before relation to the second EDU, the nucleus. Then this span is in a background relation to the third EDU.

While RST analyses tend to be of concise- and highly coherent - texts, the present study differs from previous aplications of RST in that it comprises relatively long texts derived from speech resulting in unwieldy tree diagrams. Consequently, we decided to break the texts down into horter units representing independent coherent pies of text - which typicallycorresponded to indvidual PowerPoint slides used to support the presentations -to make the task of building the trees more manageable. The presentations that did not use slides (SDH) were also divided into individual coherent pieces of text for comparison. This approach means our focus s esentially on local coherence, rather than the generic macrostructure of the presentations. Because of this, we have also excluded the discourse structuring introductory generic moves, i.e., gretings, self-naming, and topic-naming (see Brown & Ducase, 2019) in order to focus more closely on the informational content.

In RST, the number and type of relations are not asumed to be a closed set. While Mann and Thompson (1987) identified twenty-two relations in their early work, these have been added to over time. The broadest range of relations defined by Carlson and Marcu (2001, p. 56), consists of seventy-five relations. Other anlys have selected or added relations, a required for the type f exts under analysis see, for example, Skoufaki, 2009). We drew on Carson and Marcu (2001, p. 56) for our analysis in the current study.

# 8. Analysis

To maximise the accuracy of the analysis and avoid circularity, i.e, the circular problem of the analysis depending on the seg. mentation and the segmentation depending on the analysis (Iruskieta et al, 2014), we undertook the analysis as a two-stage process with both researchers analysing the entire data set in each stage. (See Redeker et al., 2012 who discuss the process and talk about 'confusability and sorting out disagreements). As part of the process, we journaled the challenges, the decisions taken, and points discussed during our RST coding and analysis which we completed side-by-side after establishing the reliability.

The first stage was to divide the data into EDUs. We resolved alldisagreements through discussion by completing the division in iterative cycles. In the fist iteration, the two rearchers indeendenly analysed a subset of the data before coming together to review, discus and agree on their analyses. Before this discussion, we calculated the percentage of agreement between the two analyses. Further iterations involving urther sub-set ofthe dat followed this same process with, where necessary, the two analysts retuning to and reconsidering previously agreed analyses until the whole data set had been segmented with agreement by both. The overall agreement for segmentation prior to discussion and revision was $8 8 \%$

Once the segmentation into EDUs had been completed, the same iterative approach was taken to the building of trees, that is the identification of spans (groups of EDUs) and relations. The identification of relations also implied the identification of nuclert, i.e. which unit is the nucleus and which the satelite. The overall agreement on coding rlations, prior to discussion oresolving any disagreements, was $7 8 \%$ In selecting the three tree examples to illustrate the relations, the authors chose the most 'visual trees' from each data set to exemplify the analysis for a non-RST audience to follow.

# 9. Results

Within our analysis of the total number of students' oral presentations $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 0 \right)$ ) across the three disciplines, we identified 42 relations, grouped, following Carlson and Marcu (2001, p. 56), into fourteen classes, each of which shares some type of rhetorical meaning.

Attribution: ATTRIBUTION. Background: BACKGROUND, CIRCUMSTANCE. Cause: CAUSE, RESULT, CONSEQUENCE. Comparison: COMPARISON, PREFERENCE. ConditiOn: CONDITION, HYPOTHETICAL, CONTINGENCY. Contrast: CONTRAST, CONCESSION, ANTITHESIS. ElaboratiOn: ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL, ELABORATION-GENERAL-SPECIFIC, ELABORATION-PROCESS-STEP, ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE, ELABORATION-SET-MEMBER, EXAMPLE, DEFINITION. Evaluation: EVALUATION, INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, COMMENT. Explanation: EVIDENCE, EXPLANATION, REASON. Joint: JOINT, LIST, DISJUNCTION. Manner-means: MANNER, MEANS. Purpose: PURPOSE. Summary: PREPARATION, HEADING, SUMMARY, RESTATEMENT. Temporal: TEMPORAL, SEQUENCE. Topic-Comment: PROBLEM-SOLUTION, QUESTION-ANSWER, RHETORICAL-QUESTION. The major differences between our range of categories and those of Carlson and Marcu are as follows.

(1) One relation, PREPARATION, was not found within Carlson and Marcu's (2001) original set but is similar to that referred to by Taboada and Mann as being a new relation). In our spoken data the PREPARATION relation describes where the speaker flags the topic of an upcoming segment of talk (e.g., \*So, firstly, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes")   
(2) Several of Carlson and Marcu's relations were not found in our data set, namely ENABLEMENT, OTHERwISE, STATEMENT. RESPONSE, TOPIC-COMMENT, COMMENT-TOPIC, ANALOGY, PROPORTION, AND ELABORATION-PART-WHOLE.   
(3) No topic change (shift/drift)

Three worked analyse are labelled Appendices A, B and C to ilustrate a range of relations found in our study. One analysis is taken from each subject area. Presentations are by Kate (MIS), Lana (BIO), and Ruby (SDH) (not their real names).

Table 2 shows the fifteen most frequent rhetorical relations found in our complete data set. In the remainder of this section, we se! out a description of, and example for, each of the ten most common relations.

In RST studies, elaboration is one of the most typical forms of modification of a nucleus, with clauses, sentences and even paragraphs forming elaborations (Carlson & Marcu, 2001, p. 56). Two types of elaboration, ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL and ELABORATION-GENERAL-SPECIFIC, were found frequently in our data.

# 9.1. Elaboration-additional

In this relation, the satellite gives additional information or detail about the situation presented in the nucleus. This relation is typically the most common in RST analyses to show relations across contiguous clauses and large spans of text. There are numerous examples i the appendice. Extract 1 below comes from Kate's MS presentation on theadoption phase in enterpris rsource planning (ERP). The first EDU, Unit 17, is the primary node in the span, with Units 18 and 21 forming elaborations. (The EDUs of interest here are numbered sequentially from the left as 17 to 21.) Unit 18 describes what the firm does within the adoption phase, and Unit 21 specifies the tasks within this phase. Units 19 and 20 elaborate further on Unit 18 as they provide additional information regarding what the managers in the firm must do in the adoption phase. Finall, Unit 21 elaborates further on the entire preceding span consisting of Units 17-20.

Extract 1. Elaboration-additional.

# 9.2. Elaboration-general-specific

The satellite provides specific information to elaborate a more general concept inroduced in the nucleus. This type of relation was widespread in the BIO and MIS presentations, where th focus was on presenting and describing concepts, athough it ocurre in all subjects. Extract 2 below is from Lana's BIO presentation on the classification of organisms.

This extract shows a complex pattern of multiple embedded ELABORATION-GENERAL-SPECIFIC relations. Lana starts by stating that the structure of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is ifferent. The remainder of the extract gives specific detail about how they differ - the one having simple cels and the other more complex. Further detal elaborates on what makes them simple, on the one hand, and complex, on the other.

The frequency with which this relation occurred in our data is hardly surprising, given that the movement from general to specific When presenting information is helpful o the listener. The general statement or broad observation orients the litener and provides the context to understand the more elaborated detals that support that statement. Astrong reason for this common use of ELABORATIONGENERAL-SPEcIFIC in the data could be related to the students use of slides to structure the presentation. The high-level student sees a dot point on the slide .g., structures are diffrent then fluently elaborates, for the audience to understand where the point fit nto the argument being made. By implication, the RST relations are confined to the slide structure that orders the student monologue and the relations provide evidence f the influence that multimodal presentations have on the organization of academic oral discourse n this context, that make slide-structured presentations similar to writing.

# 9.3. List and joint

LIST and JOINT were commonly used relations to link items of equal status. Rather than being mononuclear, with a nucleus and a satellite they are multinuclear. LIST, used to link thre or more items, was the second most common relation, and JOINT, used to link two items, was the fifth most common.

![](img/fa156db3a9602d14ce74f201d17eb66efebfe483841287be6f5ce0d653302dec.jpg)  
Extract 2. Elaboration-general-specific.

An and' or an or relationship may join three or more text spans. A LIST relation typicall involves a paralle syntactic or semantic structure between the units. They were prevalent in the MIS presentations where students often presented a list of advantages and disadvantages, as Extract 3 taken from Kate's preentation shows. While in this example the LIT relation extends across sentences, in several cases, it extended across spoken paragraphs or sections, which were ofen supported by separate presentation slides.

The JOINT relation is like LIST, but two text spans are joined in an and' or an or' relationship. See the example in Extract 3 above. As for LIST, JOINT EDUs may be clauses, sentences, or paragraphs.

# 9.4. Consequence

In this relation, the situation presented in one span is a consequence of the situation presented in the other span. It is like the RESULT relation, the difference being that in REsur, the outcome is achieved; that is it refers to an actual event, whereas CONSEQUENCE refers more generally to any such event. The consequence relation was particularly common in the SDH presentations at $1 3 . 8 \%$ not surprisingly given the nature of the task, but was also quite common in the other two subjects, MIS $( 5 . 6 \% )$ and BIO $( 6 . 6 \% )$ . Extract 4 below derives from Ruby's SDH presentation on the impact of health professonals' attitudes on the experience of people living with HIV/AIDs. Our application of this relation was to future hypothetical events that had not occurred.

Ruby lists three everyday experiences of women living with AIDS, which combined would result in them not feeling valued this would be the consequence f their treatment. Note that she is not talking about a particular instance; instead, she is talking hypothetically about what would happen because of this treatment. Particularly in SDH CONsEQUENCE appeared the most because of the points made by the students in reference to hypothetical impact of health profesionals attitudes to HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) positive patients or the impact of beliefs on the use of folk medicine. This could be an example of how in our data we defined consequence for spoken data.

While not present in the example above, discourse markers commonly used in consequence relations include when, whenever, and $i f .$ CONSEQUENCE was the third most common rhetorical relation found in our data and more common than both CAUsE and RESULT, which indicates that students more commonly referred to general situations rather than specific ones in their presentations. The examples of CAUsE and REsuLT in our data tended to appear in case studies that students used to llustrate the concepts presented. For example, Extract 5 is from a case study of the Hershey Company used by Kate in her MIS presentation to illstrate failure in implementing an ERP.

# 9.5. Contrast

The cONrRAsT relation was the sixth most common. In this relation, two or more spans contrast along some dimension. A CONTRAST relation typicall includes a contrastie discourse ue, i., but, owever, while o onthe other hand. n her SDH presentation, Ruby describes two opposing scenarios of treatment and outcome, diffring along the positivity dimension. In Extract 6, in nodes 11-18, she describes how a positive aproach by the health professional will have positiv outcomes for the patient, and in nodes 19-20, she goes on to contrast this with a negative approach resulting in negative outcomes. Note that the relationship between approach and outcome is CONDITION rather than CONSEQUENCE because the scenario is presented hypotheticall (with "if')

Another comparative relation, ANTIrHEsIs, was the eleventh most common. It differs from cONTRAST because one span, the satellit, can be lft out without losing any vital information. ee the example of antithesis in Extract 6. The satellit ("rather than treating them as a disease ..") can be omtted without any oss of meaning. Discourse markers such as rather than, although, despite, however, and while are typically found in ANTITHESIS relations.

# 9.6. Explanation

In the seventh most common relation, EXPLANATION, the satelite provides a factual explanation for the situation presented in the nucleus, explains the import of the nuclear statement, or justifies an evaluation in the nucleus. All present a type of interpretation by the speaker for the istener. Kate lists several reasons for failure during the ERP implementation phase in her talk. In Extract 7, Kate's MIS presentation sets out one reason for falure - a failure by senior management to guide the next level down. She then explains what she meant by this and how it played out. The coherence of the EXPLANATION was most noticeable in the way the facts listed as points on the slides were utilised. Speakers needed to have the skil to make their explanations flow, not by just reading points which resulted in disjointed incoherent language that was difficult to follow but by linking with coherence relations.

# 9.7. Background

In the eighth most common relation, BACKGRoUND, the satellite gives some background information concerning how to interpret the nucleus. Understanding the satllite helps the reader understand the nucleus, but the satellit is not the cause of or motivation for the situation presented in the nucleus.

In Extract 8, at the beginning of her presentation, Lana provides an overview of the relationship between the four organism kingdoms. It i a lead into her discsson of the characteristics of each kingdom. This overview provides a framework for the listers processing of the subsequent discussion of their similarities and differences. As such, it helps them focus and assts in ongoing

comprehension.

The presentation of background information is a common strategy in academic writing. Flowerdew (2000), focusing on in troductions in academic writig, pointed out that background information is ubiquitous, to the extent there may be an entire section entitled background information. Hopkins and Dudley-Evans (1988) identified background information as one of the most frequent moves in the discussion section of academic articles and theses.

# 9.8. Restatement

In a REsTATEMENT relation, the satellit reiterates the information presented in the nucleus, typically with slightly different wording. It does not add to or interpret the information. An example from Kate's presentation is provided in Extract 9. In Unit 38, Kate indicates that insufficient time was set aside for testing the ERP system, and in Unit 39 she rephrases this as an unrealistic deadline

The frequency of use of restatement as a rhetorical strategy in our data is unsurprising. It serves in speech to provide a degree of listener-oriented redundancy to facilitate comprehension. Like self-reetition, it may also allow the speaker additional planing time. Both outcomes can contribute to the success of the presentation.

# 9.9. Example

In an ExAMPLE relation, the satelite provides an example with respect to the information presented in the nucleus. Extract 10, from Kate's MIS presentation, gives an example of poor leadership, namely the inability of managers to foresee likely problems.

As was the case in this extract, the peakers tended to use examples to clarify their statements, give readers more information, and increase the likelihood of a fact or idea being interpreted corrctly or applied apropriately to real-life situations. Exemplification is considered a key feature of academic writing (Biber et al., 1999; Hyland, 2007). Hyland (2007) argues that examples help make an academic text aessble and persuasive and facilitate writer-reader communication, while Connor and Lauer (1988) argue that exemplification creates a connection between argumentation and the external world, thus enhancing the credibility and objectivit of findings presented in academic discourse.

# 10. Discussion

Our analys amed to identify the rhetorical relations that characterise student presentations in first-year undergraduate coures. It was also beyond the cope ofthis articlto illustrate the full ange of 42 relations found in the da. We direct reders towards arlson and Marcu [2001], p. 56 for this. As ilustrated in the preceding analysis section above, the relations occurring most frequently divided into two types: those that contribute to the coherence of the presentation and those that are esentially listener-oriented moves that aim to enhance the comprehensibility of the talk.

Extract 9. Restatement.

Extract 10. Example.

Relations that function strategically to enhance the overall comprehensibility of the presentation are EXPLANATION, BACKGROUND, RESTATEMENT and EXAMPLE. The fact that such strategies feature so commonly in our data - presentations which ach. ieved high scores from the tutors- reflects the attention paid in such assments to audience awareness and listener-oriented sil n addition to content. Ducasse and Brown (2020, p. 33), note in their analysis of tutors commentaries when asessing student pre sentations that \*Audience awareness was invoked or implied as being valued in many of the comments".

However, most noticeable in the data is the high use of the coherence relations in the top half of the ten most frequent relations, namely ELABORATION-ADDITIONAL, LIST, CONSEQUENCE, ELABORATION - GENERAL SPECIFIC, JOINT AND CONTRAST. The elaborations make up $1 8 \%$ of the relations when combined. By providing extra explanation, they focus on driving the monologue by highlighting the importance of either the previous or the following statement. The course content often required listig, soths relation also appeared high on the lit. The fact that the monologues are formal and highly structured through slides means there is asimilrity with written nglish. A les tructured type of discourse would have been difficult to code T relies on chains and sequences in speech that are joined by coherence relations which means that high performing student presentations were well suited to being represented in RST.

Regarding the originality and contribution of this large RST study of a first-year cohort across three disciplines in one Australian university, we should clarify that the work we have completed is inovative on thre overlapping counts as might be visualised in an elementary Venn diagram. ur work flls in the overlapping subst of three disciplines. t is nnovative because R has not permeated the precise overlap of these three areas comprising the Scholarship of Learning and Teaching (iner dia the study of first year cohorts. academic socialisation), EAP (for speakers of English as an Additional Language studying in English Medium Instruction or Englishspeaking countries) and Discourse Studies e.g., academic oral presentations. We acknowledge that the samples are not spread evenly across the tres but anecdotally, when presented to language teachers interested in the above three discipline areas, many of whom were from international backgrounds, this set of examples from RST stimulated much discussion and interest around argument structure in spoken academic English. Faculty teaching logographic languages that are more visual expressons of language, commented they were drawn to English, in a way they had not previously experienced, through the RST trees.

Language profesionals need to know the discourse practices of the academic communities that their students will enter so that they can prepare them accordingly. WhileRST was developed to explore and explain the coherence of written text, we undertook this study with the aim of exploring the value of RST in the analysis of spoken monologic texts and to consider whether the findings could be of value in supporting student preparation for such tass. Whil th findings are somewhat limited in this regard, given the broad range of relations that characterised our data and the task-specific nature of their distribution, RST analysis could be argued to be a useful method for EAP teachers to identify the key relations and associated specific textual features needed in specific contexts.

An encouraging finding that we can take away from our analysis is the fact that we were able to code the data and construct the tree diagrams. Taboada and Mann (2006, p. 426) suggest that \*.. inding an RST diagram for texts is stronglycorrlated with subjective judgments that texts are oherent his indicates that the sucess tudent presenttions, en atthe e f first r students, were internall highly coherent and structured, i fact displaying characteristics of structured written text. Such models could be used to demonstrate to EAP students what they should be aiming for in their own presentations. Furthermore, following Skoufaki (2009), an alternative use of RST to support the prearation of students in oral presentation skill is the analysis of breakdowns in coherence Such analyses of real-life data could be used to demonstrate the structural and semantic problems that typify students peformance in oral presentation tasks.

Such a finding indicates the importance of training students, both local and international, in such skill in EAP courses because an additional focus in the asessment of universty oral presentations compared to other oral proficiency testing is the speaker's use of academic skill, prompts and aids, non-verbal communication and engagement with the audience as noted by Ducasse and Brown (2020, p.22). The listener-oriented moves for ensuring comprehensibility by the audience (via the Explanation, Example, Restatement relations, etc.) are not the only aim of these interactional moves. They also serve to attract or hold the audience's interest or create a friendly contact as observed and discussed by the faculty rating these presentations.

A limitation of the study is that RST is poorly equipped to capture this type of relation between speaker and audience, but it was not overlooked. Within the scope of this paper, we exemplified the relations between parts of formal academic oral presentations visualy with RT trees and an analysis of the relations in the first-year context of three disciplines. By doing so we responded in part o a cal from Kaur and Ali (2018) to explore the rhetoricalstructure of academic oral presentation in totality. The remaining relevant dis cussion of the genre called for a discussion of non-verbal aspects such as body language and visuals, aspects making up $4 0 \%$ of the findings already reported in Ducass and Brown (2020), which hence fll beyond the scope of this paper. That is to say, the totals of verbal protocol data from academics rating the presentations comprised $1 6 . 6 \%$ of comments on the PowerPoint support materials, $1 2 \%$ on non-verbal communication and $1 1 . 4 \%$ on audience engagement. Those comments total a sum of $4 0 \%$ Another weakness with the RST approach is the fact that the rhetorical relations found in the data are classified separately, and in terms of their frequency. Without having a complete RST tre to refer to (which this study does provide in appendices A, B and C) frequency alone does not provide insight into the structure of the presentations, nor how one relation leads in to or i combined with others, to form a coherent argument. As a result, the authors acknowledge that the frequency analysis presented is therefore descriptive to accompany the visually illustrative complete trees for each discipline context presentation.

# 11. Discipline-specific differences

One aim of our study was to examine whether there were any discipline-specific differences in the frequency of rhetorical relations The results on possible disciplinary differences are very disappointing because we had expected to find more disciplinary differences. The question remains open for future research as to whether RST can capture disciplinary differences in the types and frequencies of rhetorical relations perhaps acros yer levels in discilines sice only studed first year core subjec cohorts were sampled. In the study no statistical analysis was carred out, so it is impossible to demonstrate whether any of the apparent ifferences in percentages were significant or not. However, while we did find some diferences (Table 3), particularly in the coherence-related relations, given the specific requirements of the tass, we conclude that the diferences seem to be task-specific rather than discipline-related. Only through analysis of a broader range of tasks within each discipline can we begin to identify whether there are indeed rhetorical relations that characterise specific disciplinary discourse.

# 12. Conclusion

In conclusion, we acknowledge that this study does not address the schematic structure of whole presentations (as the analysis is broken up into slide-sized chunks), nor the linguistic forms used, nor multimodalit, however within the limits of our data set, we identified the top ten rhetorical moves related to coherence and listener-oriented relations characteristic of undergraduate course content student presentations in three disciplines. This was achieved by systematically analysing the discourse features of oral presentation tasks at the firs-year undergraduate level acrossdisciplines within an Australian universty context. Several high achieving complete student oral presentations produced by native and non-native speakers of English were analysed.

Using RST, we visually demonstrated the hierarchical, connected structure of oral presentation texts not attempted previously, offring non-linguisic resources to support academic language acquisition (Haneda, 2014). The range of rhetorical relationships and the linguistic forms associated with the presentations analysed make this paper an initial and original attempt to examine whether RST (Mann & Thompson, 1988) can e fruitfully pplied to display rhetorical relationships, structure, and linguistic forms in academic oral presentations. However, it seems that RST is poorly equipped to capture the relationship between speaker and audience.

Our analysis of only the written transcription focuses on a highly specific form of oral discourse, which however exemplifies at a lower micro level the function of RST. Such analysis on coherence and cohesion does not serve to provide us with the vital information provided in speech by intonation, paralanguage, and the visuals shown during the presentation and thus fellbeyond the scope of possibilities. The three fully analysed presentations are discussed through extracts in the analysis section. They enable practitioners and researchers to appreciate the mpact of a visual rpresentation of effctive student performance. Besides this visual rpresentation, the RST relational terminology can provide a language for teachers and students to talk about and understand the structuring of discourse.

A strength of RST, to conclude, is that it highlights the most important segments of text through the hierarchical nature of the nucleus-satelit relationship. Key points sit at a higher level in the trees than their supporting statements. This could be especially useful in demonstrating to students how to structure their own talk in such a way as to highlight their own key points clearly and unambiguously. While intilly developed for the analysis of writte language, we believe that this study has indicated not only that RST can be applied to formall structured spoken language, which was shown to be similar to academic writing even in the first year, but that it has some value as a tol for both the analysis of performance skilled or otherwise, and the preparation of students for the demands of academia.
