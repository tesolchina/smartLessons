Usage-based approaches   
L2 writing quality   
Genre effect

Mixed-effects regression

Based on usage-based approaches to language learning, this study investigated how second language (L2) writers use verbs and argument structure constructions across different genres, while also exploring how this genre effect interacts with L2 writing proficiency. We analyzed five previously established usage-based indices using a learner corpus comprising argumentative and narrative essays elicited from 3196 college-level learners. Through a series of mixed-effects regression analyses, we identified a consistent genre effect, with argumentative essays featuring a more sophisticated use of verbs and constructions alongside a greater diversity in construction types. Additionally, a significant interaction emerged between genre and proficiency regarding construction frequency and the frequency of verb-construction combinations. These results indicate that while the previously observed genre effect extends to the L2 use of verbs and constructions, its manifestation varies depending on L2 proficiency. Overall, our study supports the usage-based learning of verbs and constructions in the context of L2 writing.

# 1. Introduction

Research examining linguistic complexity in second language (L2) writing has increasingly incorporated the concept of syntactic complexity, employing various indice to evaluate the diversity and sophistication of structures in texts produced by L2 learners e.g, Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011; Biber, Gray, & Staples, 2016; Bulte & Housen, 2012; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Lu, 2011, 2017; Wolf-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). Syntactic complexity i broadly categorized into absolute complexity, which refers to the number and variety of components within basic structural units like phrases and clauses, and relative complexty, which pertains to the learnability and difficulty of such components (Bulte & Housen, 2012; Housen et al., 2019).

A key focus in this research has been on measures of absolute complexity, such as the mean number of words per T-unit and the mean number of clauses per sentence, based on the general assumption that longer sentences correlate with higher structural complexity (see Kyle & Crossley, 2017, for review). However, despite evidence suggesting the role of asolute syntactic complexity indices as predictors of L2 writing proficiency, researchers have questioned the reliability of these measures in adequately capturing the development f syntactic knowledge in L2 leaners, arguing that they lack solid theoretical foundations (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig 1992; Biber et al., 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Rimmer, 2006).

To address this limitation, recent research has introduced fine-grained indices that measure syntactic sophistication in L2 production (Kyle, 2016; Kyle & Crossley, 2017). Couched within the framework of usage-based approaches to language acquisition (Bybee 2008; Elis, 2013; Filmore & Kay, 199; Goldberg, 1995, 2006), the indices focus on structural units that exhibit consistent growth patterns as L2 development unfolds. Three key constructs have received significant attention: verbs, argument structure constructions (rfrred to as constructions', denoting clause-level units representing form-meaning correspondences; Goldberg, 1995, 2006), and the assciation between verbs and constructions. According to usage-based approaches, language users tend to employ more advanced and sophisticated verbs, constructions, and verb-construction associations, driven by their cumulative language experience. Supporting this perspective, several studies have provided compelling evidence that these usage-based indices signifi cantly predict the qualit of L2 writing (e.g., Elis & Larsen-Freeman, 2009; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Mostafa & Crossley, 2020).

While prior research has demonstrated the role of usage-based indices in evaluating L2 writing, numerous unknown variables may potentiall inluence the development of syntactic complexit in L2 texs. This paper investigates the effect of genre as one such ariable by examining how syntactic sophistcation varies acros two distinct types of written genres - narraties and argumentative - and explores how this efect interacts with L2 written proficiency. In the domain of writing, the notion of genre has been conceptualized in various ways, associating it with different rhetorical categories, text types serving diverse communication functions and purposes, and multiple hierarchies encompassing various sub-genres (see Yoon, 2017, for a comprehensive review of the definition of genre). The current study follows Yoon and Polio (2017) by classfying text genres based on their communicative goals, with a primary focus on narrative and non-narrative genres.

Among the various communicative functions provided by each genre, we examine how the varying degrees of cognitive complexity inherent in each genre influence inguistic complexity in 2 writing (e.g, Goh & Burns, 2012; Renandya & Nguyen, 2023; Yoon, 2017, 2021; Yoon & Polio, 2017). Specificall, it i hypothesized that non-narrative genres, such as arumentative, can increase cognitive task complexity, prompting L2 leaners to employ more complex linguistic features compared to narrative genres (e.g., Lu, 2011; Pu et al., 2022; Yildiz & Yesilyurt, 2017; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Way, Joiner, & Seaman, 200; Zhang & Lu, 2022). The current study explores whether this genre effect extends to the use of verbs and constructions.

Examining the gnre effect on the syntactic ophistication of L2 texts enables us to investgate the interaction betweenthe growth of syntactic knowledge and strategie associated with cogntive complexity in L2 writing. Although previous research has identified genre differences regarding the frequencies of verbs, constructions, and their combinations (e.g., Mostafa & Crossley, 2020; Zhang & Lu, 2022), these studies relied on data from separate learner corpora for each genre. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the devel. opment of syntactic sophistication varies depending on the cognitive complexity of different genres within the same group of L2 learners. Given that usage-based learning emphasizes the importance of individuals' language learning experiences in different contexts, we expect significant interactions between genre and proficiency in L2 production of verbs and constructions. To test this hypothesis, ths study employed usage-based syntactic sophistication indices to analyze narrative and argumentative essays written by 3196 L2 writers with diverse proficiency levels. Before presenting our indings, we provide an overview of existing iterature, laying the groundwork for exploring the interplay between genre and proficiency in L2 writing.

# 2. Usage-based development in L2 writing

Over the past few decades, research has extensively relied on absolute syntactic complexity measures to assess L2 writing proficiency (e.g., Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003; WolfQuintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). While much of this work has presented evidence supporting the significance f these measures as predictors of L2 writig quality, some studies have reported inconsstent findings,casting doubts on the validity of these measures (Bardovi-Harlig, 1992; Biber et al, 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Rmmer, 206). In particular, criticisms have been directed at their use due to a lack of theoretical motivation in asociating the length of astructural unit with its complexity (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig, 1992; Biber et al., 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Rimmer, 2006). Against this background, recent research has adopted developmentall sensitive syntactic mesures as supplements to asolute syntactic complexity metrics , le, 2016; Kyl & Crossey, 2017, 2018; Mostafa & Crossley, 2020; Zhang & Lu, 2022). Key indices proposed i this context include the use of verbs, constructions, and their associations. The rationalebehind employing these indice is grounded in usage-based approaches to language learning, which posit that learners gradually enhance their usage of verbs and constructions as they accumulate language experience and develop their linguistic knowledge (Langacker, 2008; Robinson & Ellis, 2008).

The expansion of verbs and constructions during language acquisition has been extensively documented in studies focusing on monolingual delopment. In the initial stages of language acquisition, children's verb usage primarily relies on highly frequent vers such as go, get take, give, put, and want (Goldberg, Casenhiser, & Sethuraman, 2004; Ninio, 1999; Tomasello, 2003). In addition, the constructions involving these verbs are often limited tostructurally simple and frequent ones, such as atributive (e., I am sleepy), simple intransitie (eg, The train goes), and simple transitive constructions (eg, wnt it. Howeer, as children auulate language experience, they expand their inventories of verbs and constructions, demonstrating an abilit to generalize specific instances of utterances into abstract patterns and to combine various types of verbs with complex and les frequent constructions (Boyd & Goldberg, 2011; Ellis, Romer, & O'Donnell, 2016; Goldberg et al., 2004; Goldberg, Casenhiser, & White, 2007; Sethuraman, 2002.

Similar developmental patterns are observed in L2 acquisition. In the domain of L2 writing, numerous studies have shown that higher-qualit 2 writig tends to exhibit (a) a wider array of verb and construction types, (b) les frequent verbs, constructions, and their combinations, and (c) stronger associations between verbs and constructions (e.g., Ells & Larsen-Freeman, 209; Hwang & Kim, 2023; Kyle, 2016; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Mostafa & Crossey, 2020; Zhang & Lu, 2022). For example, Kyle and Crossey (2017) analyzed argumentatie essays written by L2 learners, utilizing both absolute syntactic complexity metrics, such as T-unit-based measures, and syntactic sophistication indices, including verb frequency, construction frequency, frequency of verb-construction combination, and the strength of verb-construction associations. Their findings indicated that syntactic sophistication indices were more effective than absolute measures in explaining the variance in L2 written proficiency scores. Specifically,esays with higher scores featured les frequent and more strongly asociated verb-construction combinations. Kyle and Crossley (2017) attributed these results to the learners' expanded repertoire of verbs and constructions, along with an enhanced ability to integrate them in a more native-like way.

Similarly, Zhang and Lu (2022) conducted a comparative analysis of the explanatory powers of absolute measures and fine-grained syntactic complexity measures in application letters and argumentative essays written by Chinese EFL college students. The absolute syntactic complexity measures employed in their study comprised traditional syntactic complexity indice, such as mean length of sentence, clauses per T-unit, dependent clauses per T-unit, and verb phrases per T-unit I contrast the fine-grained measures included various structural subtypes of phrases, such as adjective complements, adverbial clauses, nominal subject, nominal complement, verb frequency, construction frequency, and verb-construction association. Their results revealed that the fine-grained measures demonstrated stronger predictive power in explaining the variability of writing scores compared to the traditional measures, for both application ltters and argumentative essays. In particular, consistent with the findings of Kyle and Crossley (2017), Zhang and Lu (2022) observed a tendency towards the use of lessfrequent verbs, les frequent constructions, and stronger verb-construction as sociation as the essay's score increased.

Usage-based L2 development is also characterized by the utilization of diverse construction types in L2 writing. In their analysis of L2 argumentative essays, Hwang and Kim (2023) found that essays demonstrating higher proficiency exhibite a greater variety of construction type. Specifically, their analyes revealed that leners with lower proficiency predominantly relied on a restricted set of high-frequency constructions, such as attributive (e.g., Sheis a student), simple inransitie ., I worked hard), and simple transitive constructions (e., The man kicked the bll. In contrast, those with higher proficiency expanded their construction types, leading to an increase in construction diversity. They employed both high-frequency and low-frequency constructions, including caused-motion (e. g., She faxed a ltter to him), passive (e.g., The chair was folded), phrasal verb (e.g., The girl looked the name up), and resultative con. structions (e.g., Thegirl made th ballflat). Hwang and Kim (2023) interpreted these findings as evidence of 2 leaners development of construction inventories, which expand alongside enhanced writing skills.

In summary, previous studies have furnished evidence of the predictive role of usage-based indices in explaining L2 written proficiency, ofen surpassing absolute syntactic complexity measures in predictive validity. Fig. 1 summarizes developmental trajectories of verbs and constructions as envisaged by usage-based learning.

Despite the significance of usage-based indices, however, it remains unclear how the development of syntactic sophisticatin among L2 learners is manifested in various writing genres. Addresing this question holds particular importance, considering that usage-based learning underscores the role of language experience within distinct contexts and the cognitive status of learners (Ells et a. 2016; Goldberg, 2006, 2019 Langacker, 2008; Tomasello, 2003). Before exploring this question, we review previous literature on the effect of genre on L2 writing.

# 3. Effect of genre and its interaction with L2 writing proficiency

Genres can broadly be categorized into two main types based on their communicative functions: narratives and non-narratives (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Bruner, 1986; Yoon, 2017). Narratives describe events or actions carred out by characters, whereas non-narratives focus on conveying concets, ideas, or arguments. Examples of non-narrative genres include argumentation, where individuals express personal opinions and evaluate debatable topics (e.g., Way et al., 2000; Yoon, 2017, 2021). Researchers often examine the impact of genre in relation to cognitive task complexit (Heng, Pu, & Li, 2023). Different genres are assumed to impose varying degres of cognitive demands on 2 learners. The relationship between genre and cognitive task complexity is best captured by the Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2001, 2003). According to this hypothesis, the cognitive complexity of a task is closely linked to a task participant's atention, with increased task complexity eding to the us of complex linguistic featres in productiong., Kang & Lee, 2019; Robinson, Cadierno, & Shirai, 2009). Within this framework, genre is considered a crucial factor influencing task complexity. The divers cognitive demands posed by diffrent genres require learners to engage in strategic writing, wherein they adjust their use of specific linguistic components to suit each genre (Pu, Heng, & Cao, 2022; Ravid, 2005). Specificall, it is hy. pothesized that non-narrative genres, such as argumentative writing, are regarded as more cognitively demanding, thus prompting the use of linguistic features indicative of higher complexity, compared to narrative genres (Weigle, 2002).

Fig. 1. Usage-based development of verbs and constructions.

Several studies have provided supporting evidence of the close association between genre and linguistc features in L2 writin (e., Heng et al., 2023; Kormos, 2011; Lu, 2011; Pu et l., 22; Qin & eelli, 2016; Weigle, 202; Yildz & Yilyurt, 2017; Y0on & Polio 2017). For example, in analyses f argumentative and narrative essays written by L1-Chinese 2-English learners, Lu (2011) observed that argumentative essays exhibited more complex syntactic structures, characterized by longer clauses and a greater number of complex nominals and coordinate phrases, in comparisonto narrative essays. imilarly, Qin and Uccel (2016) reported a higher lvel of complexit i argumentativessays than in narrative essays produced by Chinese-peaking L2 learners. Their findings indicated that argumentative essays contained a greater number of long words and abstract nouns and demonstrated a wider range of organization markers.

Of particular significance in the context of the present study is the interplay between genre and writing proficiency. In addition to observing disparities in inguistic complexity between argumentative and narrtive genres, Qin and Uccell (2016) noted distint linguistic features contributing to the variance in L2 writing quality across these genres. Through regression analyses employing various linguistic features as potential predictors of essays holistic scores in each genre, they identified lexical complexit,syntactic complexit, and the diversity of discourse organizational markers as significant predictors for argumentative esays. Conversely, in narrative esays, the frequency f stance markers emerged as the significant predictor, indicating the leve of possbilit, certainty, or acknowledgment of the speaker's belief regarding specific statements or situations. These findings suggest that the efect of genre goes beyond cognitive task complexity, extending to the developmental aspects of writing, as reflected in proficiency scores.

Despite the well-documented impact of genre on inguistic complexity in L2 writing and its interplay with writing proficiency, less is known about how the genre efect interacts with usage-based learning of verbs, constructions, and their associations. Usage-based approaches to language learning assume that learners generalize individual instances of verbs and constructions into abstract schematic patterns through language experience and the cognitive efort require for the storage and retrieval of specific utterances in diverse contexts (Ellis 2013; Goldberg et al., 2004; Sethuraman, 2002). Therefore, it i predicted that the language development trajectories envisaged by usage-based approaches can be influenced by the specific language experiences and cognitive demands presented by different genres. To explore this issue, the current study analyze argumentative and narrative essays written by L2 learners, focusing on usage-based measures involving the use of verbs, constructions, and their ssociations. The study specifically aims to answer the following research questions:

1. How do argumentative and narrative genres impact the usage patterns of verbs and constructions in L2 writing?   
2. Does the genre effect interacts with writing proficiency scores for each of these usage-based indices?

# 4. Method

# 4.1. Learner data

The current study analyzed written samples obtained from the Yonsei English Learner Corpus (YELC; Rhee & Jung, $2 0 1 2 ) ^ { 1 }$ , which comprisesesays produced by Korean-speaking undergraduate students at Yonsei Universty. The corpus was compiled from the mandatory English placement test administered to incoming students at Yonsei universty in 2011 for detailed testing procedures, see Rhee & Jung, 2012). According to the corpus compliers, data collection proceeded in a similar manner as the ToEFL iBT. Each participant completed three computer-based writing tasks within a 60-minute time limit: a sentence-completion task, a narrative writing task, and an argumentative writing task. Our analysis focused on responses from narrative and argumentative tasks. During the narrative writing task, participants were rompted to provide personal opinions on familiar topics drawn from their life experiences e. g., What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high schoo?). On the other hand, the argumentative writing task required participants to write essays for academic discssions on specific topics (eg., Do you agree that physical punishment should be allowed at schools? State your opinion). The entire is of topics used for the essays can be found in the supplementary materials.

Following data collection, trained raters asessed the proficiency levels of participants responses based on the Common European Framework of Reference (Council f Europe, 2011). Given the genre distinction, each participant's argumentative and narrative essas were evaluated separately. Each essay was rated across11 proficiency levels from A1 (lowest) to C2 (highest. To ensure an adequate number of samples for each level for statistical analyses, the current study focused on six proficiency levels $( \mathsf { A } 1 + , \mathsf { A } 2$ , B1, $\mathbf { B } 1 + , \mathbf { B } 2$ $\mathbf { B } 2 + )$ , coded as ranging from Proficiency 1 (lowest) to Proficiency 6 (highest). As a result, the dataset analyzed in the study comprised a total of 6392 sample, consisting of 3196 argumentatie and 3196 narratie essays, with each participant contributing one argumentative and one narrative essay. Table 1 provides a summary of the samples in each genre.

# 4.2. Variable selection

We employed five usage-based indices that have been previously identified as significant predictors of L2 writing quality: verb frequency, construction frequency, frequency of verb-construction combinations, verb-construction assciation strength, diverst of construction type (e.g., Hwang & Kim, 2023; Kyle, 2016; Kyle & Crossley, 2017; Mostafa & Crossly, 2020; Zhang & Lu, 2022).

For the frequencies of verbs, constructions, and their combinations, we used the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAAssc) version 1.3.8 (Kyle, 2016). TAAssC provides frequency information based on five sub-corpora as references (i.e., academic, fiction, magazine, newspaper, and spoken) from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (Davies, 2010). Since our data included essays from wo distinct gnres, we relied on areference corpus that subsumes ll these sub-corpora. For statistical analyses, we used log-transformed values for each frequency measure.

Regarding the association strength between verbs and constructions, we used TAAssc to measure deltaP (Elli & Ferreira- Junior, 2009. This mesure i calulated as the difference between the probability of an outcome (e., aconstruction) co-occurring with a cue (e.g., verb) and the probability of the outcome without this cue.

To asses construction diversit, we first identified types and tokens of 11 constructions by employing classfication algorithms as outlined in Hwang and Kim (2023), which identify unique argument structure configurations for each clause, considering both lexical and structural factors. Subsequentl, we calculated the moving average type-token ratio with an 11-clause window (MArrR11).? This metric provides enhanced reliabilit comparedto simple TTR measures, efectively adresing concens regarding text length variation (e.g., Kyle & Sung, 2024; Sung & Kyle, 2024). The calculation proces was implemented using the more-itrtools version 10.2.0 package (https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools) in Python. Texts containing fewer than 11 clauses were excluded from the analysis, constituting $5 . 1 ~ \%$ of the entire data.

# 4.3. Data analysis

Before conducting data analysis, potential multicollinearity among the indices was examined via correlation coefficients (e.g, Kyle and Crossley, 2018). Setting a threshold at a correlation coefficient of $\geq . 7 ;$ it was confirmed that none of the indices exhibited strong correlation (all) $r s < . 7 \AA$ , affirming their status as uniquely identified variables.

For each index, a linear mixed-effects regression model was constructed using the Ime4 package (Bates et al., 2015) in R version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023). These models included fixed effects of Genre, Proficiency, and their interaction, alongside a random intercept for participants. The effect of Genre was deviation-coded by assigning $^ { - 0 . 5 }$ to argumentative and 0.5 to narrative essays. This coding scheme allows for assessing the variable's effect by measuring each level's deviation from the grand mean, rather than designating a ingle basline catgory, they ensuring a balanced and symmetric inrrettion of the efect The effct f Proficiy was centered around the mean as a continuous variable, ollowing the convention of treating ordinal variables with more than four levels as continuous variables (e.g., Labovitz, 1970; Robitsch, 2020). Consequently, the grand mean of proficiency served as the baseline for this variable. However, due to the non-linear relationship between proficiency and some of dependent measures, we additionally conducted post-hoc analyses treating each proficiency level as a categorical variable for each genre. These analyses were performed using the emmeans function (Lenth, 2018) with Tukey adjustments. For each comparison, Cohen's d was computed as the effect size using the ef size function in R.

# 5. Results

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for each index, including means and standard deviations. In the following sections, we provide the outcomes of the mixed-effcts regression analysis for each index individually. For pair-wise comparisons, we report outcomes that show statistical significance. The entire results, including statistical outcomes and plots, can be found in the supplementary materials.

# 5.1. Verb frequency

The model outcome for verb frequency is presented in Table 3, followed by a graph in Fig. 2.

The mixed-effects model revealed a main effect of Gere, driven by significantly lower frequency scores in argumentative compared to narrative essays. In addition, there was a main effect of Proficiency, indicating a decreas in verb frequency scores with higher proficiency levels acros essays. This proficiency effect did not significantl interact with Genre, indicating consistency in the relationship between proficiency and ver frequency cross both genres. This finding was frther confirmed by correlation analyses, which showed a negative correlation between proficiency and verb frequency scores for both argumentative $( r = - . 1 1 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ) and narrative essays $( r = - . 0 9 2$ $p < . 0 0 1 $

In the post-hoc analyses, we found several notable differences among various proficiency levels, through their effect sizes were mostly small For argumentative essays, Proficiency 2 had significantly higher frequency scores compared to Proficiency 4 $( p = . 0 0 5$ Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 1 8$ ), Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 5 6 \mathrm { ; }$ , and Proficiency 6 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 5 0 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ , indicating small to medium effect sizes. In addition, Proficiency 3 demonstrated significantly higher scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 0 3$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 5 1 { \mathrm { ; } }$ ) and Proficiency 6 $( p = . 0 1 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 4 5$ , though the effect sizes remained small.

In narrative essays, Proficiency 1 showed significantly higher frequency scores compared to Proficiency 3 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d =$ 0.379) and Proficiency 4 $( p = . 0 0 3$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 5 2 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , and Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 5 6 \mathrm { ; }$ with small effect sizes, and compared to Proficiency 6 $( p = . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 7 0 $ , which had a medium effect size. Furthermore, Proficiency 2 had significantly higher scores compared to Proficiency 3 $( p = . 0 3 6$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 1 6 9 _ { \cdot }$ and Proficiency 5 $( p = . 0 1 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 4 5$ , with small effect sizes.

# 5.2.  Construction frequency

Table 4 presents the model outcome for construction frequency, followed by a graphical illustration in Fig. 3.

The model showed a main efect of Genre, attributed to argumentative essays containing constructions with significantly lower frequency compared to narrative essays. Additionally, a main effect of Proficiency emerged, indicating decreased construction fre quency scores with higher proficiency. Cruciall, there was a significant interaction between Genre and Proficiency. Correlation an. alyses demonstrated a significant negative correlation between proficiency and construction frequency for both argumentative $( r = - . 0 7 9$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ and narrative essays $( r = - . 1 1 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ . However, the degree of lower-frequency constructions with increasing proficiency was more pronounced in narrative than argumentative essays.

Post-hoc analyses revealed distinct patens acros genres. In arumentatie esays, there were no significant dfferences observed across proficiency groups.

Proficiency 1 also exhibited significant differences with Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 4 6 )$ and Proficiency 6 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 1 2 )$ with medium effect sizes. Moreover, Proficiency 2 had significantly higher scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 1 5$ , with a small effect size.

# 5.3. Frequency of verb-construction combinations

The model outcome and graphical llustration for the frequency of verb-construction combinations are presented in Table 5 and Fig. 4, respectively.

Similar to construction frequency, a significant efect of Genre was identified, with significantly lower frequency scores of verb-construction combinations in arumentative than narratie essays. Furthermore there was  main efect of Proficiency, indicating a decrease in frequency scores with increasing proficiency. We also observed a significant interaction between Genre and Proficiency. While the correlation between proficiency and verb-construction frequency was significant for both argumentative $( r = - . 0 8 9$

In the post-hoc analyses conducted for argumentative essays, the only significant difference observed was the comparison between Proficiency 2 and Proficiency 5 $( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 1 8$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 3 8 )$ , reflecting a small effect size. In narrative essays, Proficiency 1 exhibited significantly higher scores compared to Proficiency 2 $( p = . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 7 1 \mathrm { \cdot }$ with a small effect size, and compared to Proficiency 3 $\mathrm { \ d { \cdot } } \left( p < . 0 0 1 \right.$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 6 4 )$ , Proficiency 4 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 5 0 \mathrm { ; }$ , Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $\pmb { d = } 0 . 7 3 8 \mathrm { ; }$ , and Proficiency 6 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 8 3$ , all with medium effect sizes.

# 5.4. Association strength between verbs and constructions

The model outcome and graphs for the association strength between verbs and constructions are presented in Table 6 and Fig. 5, respectively.

In this model, the onlyeffect that reached significance was Genre, induced by a significantly stronger verb-construction association in argumentative than narrative essays. There was no main efect of Proficiency or its interaction with Genre. These findings indicate that participants consistently produced verb-construction combinations with stronger associations in argumentative essays, regadess of proficiency level.

The absence of interaction between Proficiency and Genre was further confirmed by post-hoc analyses. None of the proficiency groups exhibited significant ifferences, in both argumentative and narrative essays (see Appendix B in the Supplementary materials).

# 5.5.  Construction diversity

The model outcome is summarized in Table 7, followed by a graphical illustration in Fig. 6.

The model revealed a significant ffect of Genre, indicating that argumentative essays contained a wider range of construction types compared to narrative essays. We also found a main effect of Proficiency, with diversty core increasing as the proficiency level was higher. However, there was no significant interaction between Genre and Proficiency. These results sugest that the rate of increase in construction diversity corresponding toproficiency levels was more pronounced in argumentative esays than in narrative ones. These findings indicate that participants consistently produced more diverse constructions in argumentative essays, regardes of proficiency level.

In post-hoc analyses, we found several significant differences among various proficiency groups. In argumentative essays, Proficiency 1 showed significantly lower diversity scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( p = . 0 1 5$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 3 6 0 )$ , indicating a small effect size, and compared to Proficiency 6 $( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 0 4$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 5 5 5 \AA$ , demonstrating a medium effect size. Similarly, Proficiency 2. had significantly lower scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( p < . 0 0 1$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 3 0 1$ ) and Proficiency 6 $( p = . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d =$ -0.496), with small ffect sizes. Also, Proficiency 3 showed significantly lower scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( p = . 0 1 6$ , Cohen's $d =$ 0.215) and Proficiency 6 $( p = . 0 1 9$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 4 1 0 \}$ , again reflecting small effect sizes.

In narrative essays, Proficiency 1 demonstrated significantly lower diversity scores compared to Proficiency 5 $( p = . 0 0 5$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 4 1 8 )$ , and Proficiency 6 $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 3 8 \right.$ , Cohen's $d = - 0 . 4 8 7 )$ , all indicating small effect sizes.

# 6. Discussion

The objective of the current study was two-fold: (a) to investigate the use of verbs and constructions among L2 learners across different genres of L2 writing and (b) to explore the interaction between genre effects and L2 writing proficiency. By analyzing five usage-based indices within argumentative and narrative esays, our study revealed several key findings. First, a genre effct emerged across al indices, with argumentative essays featuring les frequent verbs and constructions, es frequent verb-construction com binations, tronger associations between verbs and constructions, and a wider diversity of construction types. Furthermore, the genre effect interacted significantly with L2 writing proficiency in terms of construction frequency and the frequency of verb-construction combinations. These findings are discussed in detail in the subsequent sections in connection with our research questions.

# 6.1. Genre effects on usage-based indices

The consistent genre effect observed across the usage-based indices aligns with previous research demonstrating increased complexity in non-narrative geres compared to narrative ones e.g, Lu, 2011; Pu et al., 2022; Yildz & Yeilyurt, 2017; 0on & Polio, 2017; Way et al, 200; Zhang & Lu, 2022). As previously reviewed, non-narrative genres, such as argumentatives, demand greater cognitive complexity (Robinson, 2001, 2003; Robinson et al., 2009), encouraging writers to employ more complex and sophisticated structures. Extending these earlier indings to the use of verbs and constructions, our study provides evidence that L2 leaners exhibit advanced verb and construction usage in argumentative than narrative essays.

These findings may reflect their strategic utilization of inrequent and advanced verbs and constructions to effectively convey their opinions in an objective manner. For instance, the sample esays provided in Table 8 ilustrate excerpts from a participant (proficiency level 4), presenting an argument against the practice of physical punishment in schoos (argumentative essay) and a description of his/ her favorite high school teacher (narrative essay). In the argument esay, this learner employed advanced verbs, such as abandon, allow, and achieve, when inroducing the opinions of proponents of physical punishment Simultaneously, the esay contains complex and advanced constructions, such as pasives (e.g., The physical punishment in the school was abandoned some months ago), relative clauses (e.g., The people who gres to allowing physical punisment in school), and causative constructions e.g., But I think that kind of punishment just makes student be passve to teacher's advice. The use of adanced and sophisticated verbs and constructions may indicate the learner's attempt to render the essay more academic and professional, thereby enhancing its persuasiveness.

By contras, the narrativesay by the same learner included more common, everyday expressions, utilizing frequent verbs like be, ecome, tell think, and y. In addtion, the constructions in which these vers appear were relatively simple, including aributives e. g., My favorit teacher in high chool was math teachr), simple intransitie (g, to live on my best now), and simple transities (.g., to solve the problem).

While previous research has provided valuable insights into the impact of genre on L2 writing, this study advances further by examining this efect in relation to the usage-based lerning. The use of les frequent verbs, constructions, and their combinations, as well as the use of more strongly associated verb-construction combinations in argumentative compared to narrative essays, indicates learners' strategic adaptation of language use to meet genre-specific demands. This approach reflcts the diffrential development of sentence sophistication across contexts, consistent with usage-based theories of language acquisition (e.g., Elis et al., 2016)

Specifically, learners experience with the argumentative genre, potentially through exposure to academic texts,classoom in struction, and exam preparation, may have enabled them to employ more advanced verbs and constructions in this context. Furthermore, learners appear to have adapted their use of verbs and constructions to meet the rhetorical functions of the argumen. tative genre, which requires enhanced clarit and persuasivenes compared to the narrative genre (e.g, Lu, 2011; Yon, 2021; Yoon & Polio, 2017). Additionall, the employment of a broader range of construction type in argumentative writing reflet leaners attempt to address the increased cognitie task complexity inthis genre. Collectively, learners strategic language use across genres suggests their understanding of genre conventions, developed through repeated exposure and practice. These findings support usage-based approaches, which emphasize the role of cognitive demands and experience in language learning and use (Bybee, 2008; lis, 2013; Fillmore & Kay, 1999; Goldberg, 1995, 2006).

# 6.2. Interaction between genre effects and proficiency

Another crucial finding of this study was the significant interaction between genre efects and proficiency across two indices. Compared to rgmentative esays, narative eays dmonstrated a more pronounced increase in the use of les freuent constructions and verb-construction combinations as writing proficiency advanced. This interaction likely stems from the clearer distinction be. tween genres at lower than higher proficiency levels. Our post-hoc analyses showed that the scores of construction frequency and the frequency of verb-construction combinations in narrative compared to argumentatiesays are notably higher at proficiency levels 1 and 2, whereas these gaps diminish sigificantly at levels 5 and 6. This trend suggests that lenersat lower proficiency levels are more likely to employ simpler and more frequent constructions in narrative essays.

These findings resonate with the results of Zhang and Lu (2022), where verb frequency and construction frequency emerged as strong predictors of holistc scores in narrative genres such as application letter (with verb and construction frequency decreasing with increasing holistic scores) but not in non-narrative genres such as argumentative essays. Zhang and Lu (2022) atributed these outcomes to the tendency of lower-proficiency learners to use frequent verbs and constructions for describing past experiences and academic descriptions in application letters.Similarly, lower-proficiency learners in our study may have relied on high-frequency constructions to convey simple and everyday expressions in narrative essays. In contrast higher-proficiency learners utilized diverse construction types, including both frequent and infrequent ones to express narrative events and ideas in various ways. For example, Table illstrate excerts from narrative esas written by two participants at proficiency levels 1 and 6, respectively. Both learners describe their favorite subject, math, during high schoo, yet the types of constructions they employ diffr significantly. The learner at level 1 primarily uses atributive constructions containing be, whereas the learner at level 6 employs various construction types, including to-infinitives (e.g., I tried hard to get good scores), resultative (e.g., which made my mind clear and organized), and datives (e.g., math has provided me with self-esteem and love for studying).

The higher-proficiency learners increased ability to utilize les frequent construction types in narrative essays aligns with the basic tenets of usage-based language development. According to this perspective, L2 syntactic development involves the gradual entrenchment of structure-building routines of phrases and sentences. This proces enables learners to generalize learned instances of sentence formulations into abstract grammatica categories of constructions (Bybee, 2008; Ellis 2013; ilmore & Kay, 1999; Gold berg, 1995, 2006). While our lower-proficiency participants, who are assumed to be at erly stages of construction learning, exhibited a strong reliance on a limited number of high-frequency constructions, higher-proficiency learners likely possessed more advanced constructional knowledge. Consequently, they demonstrated an enhanced abilit to utilize both frequent and inrequent constructions in narraive essays, reflecting their expansion and refinement of language skills as a result of extensive language experiences.

A similar trend was observed in argumentative essays, where higher-proficiency learners tended to employ les frequent con. structions and verb-construction combinations. However, the extent of change across proficiency levels was les pronounced compared to narrative essays. One plausible explanation lies in the increased task complexity present in argumentative genre. As previously discussed, argumentativesays ofen prompt writers to employ more complex language (e.g, Lu, 2011; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Zhang & Lu, 2022). Therefore, it is conceivable that our participants, including those at lower proficiency levels, adopted genre-specific strategies, resulting in the use f lesfrequent verbs and constructios in arumentative esays. Consequently, the rateof decrease in verb frequency and the frequency of verb-construction combinations across proficiency levels may have ben less prominent in this genre.

Another potential factor could stem from the participants' increased familiarity with argumentative genre. Given that argumen tative essays are commonly asessed in high-stakes examinations (Qin & Ucelli, 2016), our participants, who primarily studied English for exams, may have frequently encountered infrequent and advanced verbs and constructions specific to this genre during their exam preparation. This familiarity might have facilitated their utilizatio of low-frequency verbs and constructions. However, in the absence f concrte supporting evidence, these explanations remain speculative, cling for further research exploring specific sources contributing to varying levels of verb and construction usage among learners at different proficiency levels across ifferent genres.

# 6.3. Limitations and suggestions for further research

In addition to the implications discussed, we acknowledge several limitations in the current study, highlighting the need for further enhancement in future research. First, our samplecomprises Korean-speaking collegestudents and is limited to a specific modalit and genre. Considering the potential impact f learners first language on L2 writing (e., Lu & Ai, 2015), further studies should involve L2 writers from diverse language backgrounds to enhance the generalizability of the current findings. Moreover, whil this study pri marily focused on writen production, it i plausible that the interplay of genre and the use of verbs and constructions may extend to other modalities, such as spoken language (e.g, Kormos, 2014), and acros various sub-genres beyond argumentative and narrative contexts. Therefore, future research should investigate the relationship between genre effcts and verb and construction usage across different modes of language production and within a wider range of genre contexts.

Second, the diverse topics covered in the sample essays analyzed in the current study raises the possbility of these variations influencing participant' writing. To explore this potential influence, we conducted exploratory analyses, including Topic as an interactive fixed factor alongside Proficiency in our mixed-efects regression models. The outcomes of these analyses revealed no significant effect of Topic and no interaction between Topic and Proficiency, acros both argumentative and narrative essays (all $p s > . 1 \AA$ . These results suggest that variations in topic did not significantly affect the observed outcomes. However, it remains possible that the specific topics assigned to individual participants may have affcted their writing at n individual level. To addressthis issue, future research should consider controlling for topic variability (e.g., Yoon, 2021).

Third, we recognize the possbility of our results being inluenced by grammatical erors in learner production. In line with previous research on automated analyses of syntactic complexity in L2 production (e.g., Kyle, 2016; Lu, 2017), we opted not to correct any spelling or grammatical errors in our sample essays. This decision was based on the assumption that such errors do not significantly impede the identification of high-level units, such as clauses and constructions, as they do to lower-level units, such as words. However, as pointed out by a reviewer, this approach could potentiall impact the parsing or identification accuracies of automated tools, thereby potentially ifluencing the overall outcomes. To address this concern, there is a need for the development of more advanced analysis toos that incorporate learner erors into analysis results. Moreover, further research is necessary to conduct separate analyses focusing on learner errors and explore how divers types f erors correlate with various syntactic complexity and sophistication indices.

Fourth, despite the significant efect of Proficiency across several indice, these results should be interpreted with caution. Whilethe relationship between proficiency and our syntactic sophistication measures exhibited statistical significance, the correlations were relatively weak for both argumentative and narrative esays. Indeed, our post-hoc comparisons revealed statistical significance among certain proficiency levels, rather than across the entire spectrum. These results suggest that the variation i syntactic sophistication does not cale proportionally with proficiency but fllows somewhat curvilinear patterns. One possble reason for this trend may stem from the retricted proficiency range in our corpus. To addres this limitation, further research should include learner data spanning a broader range of proficiency levels, which may provide a clearer and stronger efect of proficiency on the syntactic sophistication of L2 writing.

# 7. Conclusion

Overall, the current study demonstrates a consistent effect of genre on the L2 use of verbs and constructions, along with its interaction with L2 writing proficiency. Our results sugest the crucial role of usage-based learning of verbs and constructions and the modulation of L2 writers strategic utilization specific to genre. These findings highlight the multifaceted apects of L2 writing, which can be influenced by various factors such as ingustic complexity, genre, and L2 experiences (Norris & Ortega, 2009; Yoon, 2021). The current findings offr insights into the complex dynamics of L2 writing by elucidating the relationship between genre, writing proficiency, and the use of verbs and constructions.

Pedagogicall, these findings underscore the importance of gere-awareness, strategic language use, and linguistic flexibility in L2 writing instruction, particularly regarding verb and construction usage. The interaction between genre and proficiency levels especially evident i construction frequency and the frequency of verb-construction combinations, suggests that writing instruction should be tailored to learners' proficiency levels. For instance, instructors should help lower-proficiency learners expand their repertoir of constructions and verb-construction combinations in narrative writig, while also encouraging the use of les frequent verbs and constructions in argumentative writing acrossall proficiency levels. As learners advance toward higher proficiency, in struction can shift towards more strategic use of both frequent and infrequent verbs and constructions across genres, enhancing their ability to adapt language use to specific rhetorical demands.

Furthermore, our study points to the need for a balanced approach to genre instruction in L2 writing curricula. While argumen tative writig often receives significant attention due to its prevalence in academic contexts, narrative genres receive relatively les focus in L2 clasrooms (e.g., Yoon, 2021). Therefore, L2 writing instruction should place equal emphasis on both argumentative and narrative writing, particularly given the observed limitations in verb and construction use among lower-proficiency learners in narrative essays. By actively engaging in writing tasks and activities within narrative genres, learner can develop a deeper understanding of how verbs and constructions convey diverse meanings and rhetorical functions within various textual forms.
