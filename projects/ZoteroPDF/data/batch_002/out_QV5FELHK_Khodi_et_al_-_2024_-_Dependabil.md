# ABSTRACT

Regarding the whispered use of technology in instruction and assessment of language skills, the present study investigates the effect of e-portfolio assessment on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. To this end, 60 intermediate students were randomly selected and homogenized to participate in the study. Samples of the IELTS speaking tests were then administered as the criterion for assessing the learners’ speaking ability in the pre- and post-test over a ten-week period. In both groups (control and experimental), the students had discussions on the given topics and the instructor evaluated their performance. Only in the experimental group, however, the students tracked their progress by keeping e-portfolios. The performances of the learners in both groups were rated based on the IELTS speaking band descriptors; paired samples and independent samples t-tests were run to determine the impact of the treatment. In addition, the learners responded to an attitude questionnaire and attended an interview to express their attitudes toward using e-portfolios in their speaking classes. The findings showed that not only using e-portfolio assessment improved the learners’ overall speaking proficiency significantly but it also improved the students’ positive attitudes toward its use as a learning and assessment tool. Moreover, the potential bias of the functionality of e-portfolios and the dependability of the findings were checked through running differential item (DIF) functioning and generalizability analyses, both suggesting the utility of the findings.

# Introduction

Testing and teaching, considered two sides of a fine coin, every so often enhance each other’s utility in pedagogical circumstances (Bachman, 1990). As language-teaching methods emerge over time, various types of assessment procedures have been offered in response; however, using the proper type of assessment for each method has always been a controversy (Anthony et al. 2009). In this context, the question of whether traditional forms of assessment can provide psychometrically valid measures of performance applicable by teachers into instruction procedures in typical classrooms is still a matter of real discussion (Alavi et al. 2021; Richards & Renandya, 2002). In addition, shortcomings of traditional testing methods were the motives for proposing substitute forms of assessment known as alternative assessment (e.g. performance-based assessments, conferencing, learning logs or blogs, virtual learning environments), in which through learning-oriented assessment procedures instructors evaluate whether students can use language holistically in real-life situations (Khalilzadeh & Khodi, 2021).

A well-situated context for the implementation of alternative assessment methods is to take advantage of portfolios, especially electronic portfolios or e-portfolios (Richards & Renandya, 2002; Yastibas & Yastibas, 2015) that is the focus of the present study. A portfolio is generally defined as a ‘collection of evidence that is gathered together to show a person’s learning journey over time’ (Butler, 2006, p. 2). During the use of E-portfolios, the students are interviewed for examining their performance and they are engaged in an ongoing reflection on what they have accomplished and what should be set as their future goals. E-portfolios could also function similarly or even better than paper-based portfolios since they enjoy advantages such as the type of artifacts they can contain and the interactivity they propose (Cummins & Davesne, 2009). Although many researchers have suggested the utility and practicality of e-portfolios (e.g., Mcallister & Hauville, 2011), there is a paucity of research addressing its pedagogical contribution to the acquisition of speaking sub-skills, known as fluency and coherence, lexical resources, grammaticality, and pronunciation, as well as dependability, generalizability, and absence of bias of its findings. In response, the present study investigates the effect, role, and function of e-portfolio assessment in improving EFL learners’ speaking proficiency and explore their attitudes toward it.

# Literature review

By the advancement of theory and practice, one of the popular alternatives in language assessment introduced within a framework of communicative language teaching is portfolio assessment (Alavi et  al., 2021). Kopriva (2008) mentions that the implementation of portfolios as a part of large-scale academic testing dates back to the early-mid 1990s; Kopriva (2008) defines portfolio assessment as gathering students’ artifacts produced in the classroom during the academic year to show their level of academic knowledge and skill. Despite extensive research on speaking tests addressing its authenticity, scoring procedure, generalizability, and factorial structure (e.g. Frost et  al., 2020; Khodi, 2021; Mursyida et  al., 2020; Thomas, 2020) in recent years, a few studies examined the implementation of speaking e-portfolios (Khodi et  al., 2021). For instance, Nunes-Dore (2007) conducted action research on 12 advanced level learners using e-portfolios to improve their writing and speaking skills in Spanish.

In a similar line of investigation, Huang and Hung (2010) explored the effect of using e-portfolios in English classes on EFL learners’ oral performance. That study was conducted on 30 English-major juniors from intact conversation classes divided into experimental and control groups with ages ranging from 20 to 25 years. The learners in the e-portfolio group, while making personal speaking e-portfolios to upload their recordings on specific topics were able to regularly visit their peers’ e-portfolios. However, the control group simply recorded their speaking assignments on compact disks and submitted them to the instructor. The pretest-posttest comparison showed that the implementation of e-portfolios had a significant effect on lexical richness of the learners, while it could not improve their ability to use syntactic complexity. Huang and Hung (2010) also conducted research implementing speaking e-portfolios on 51 learners from two conversation classes in Taiwan. The learners used a website named Wretch to upload their artifacts after having a tutorial session on the operation of Wretch. The learners also received feedback from their classmates. Using an attitude questionnaire and interview, the researchers explored the perceptions of the learners toward making e-portfolios. Four themes were found toward using e-portfolios in conversation classes: e-portfolios (1) can make learners aware of their weaknesses, (2) provide opportunities for more oral pra-ctices, (3) reduce the feeling of anxiety, (4) do not create face-to-face interaction.

Ozdemir-Catagay (2012) also examined the attitude of 77 beginners in Turkey; it was found that the learners, as well as instructors, had positive attitudes toward the use of e-portfolios in English-speaking classes. Similarly, Cepik and Yastibas (2013) conducted a mixed-method study on the impact of using e-portfolios in English listening and speaking classes and they concluded learners had positive attitudes toward e-portfolios.

Despite the positive attitudes toward e-portfolios in language classes, a fundamental concern received less attention. This concern is noticeable in terms of the relative consequences that the use of electronic portfolios may bring about in instruction process. For instance, Shashaani and Khalili (2001) addressed similarities and differences among Iranian college students’ attitudes and abilities toward computer use in academic contexts. They found significant differences in attitudes and abilities of the participants from different gender; the differences manifested in terms of the ability to use computers and their attitude. In addition, research has demonstrated that female learners are more interested in gaining knowledge about computers than their male counterparts; this fact may suggest that they are more able to use digital and computerized tools such as e-portfolios (Badagliacco, 1990; Shashaani, 1994). In addition, it was suggested in the literature that female learners have less familiarity and a sense of joy about using computers (Reinen & Plomp, 1997). Gender differences in computer use and activities were reported in the literature similarly (Mitra, 1998). On this basis, the present study takes into account the relationship between the gender of the participants and the function of e-portfolios through a set of statistical analyses.

In brief, all aforementioned studies as samples of extensive research that have been conducted in this regard accentuate the fundamental concerns of the utility of e-portfolios and their practical and pedagogical benefits. Nevertheless, the overlooked elements are probably as important as the known sides of the issue. The sense of having self-assessment of and self-awareness in the learning process can be counted as reasons for all these improvements, but the results merely indicate the possibility of e-portfolio use in improving learners’ technology literacy and pedagogical as well as content knowledge, and questions such as HOW, WHY, and WHEN this improvement happens are not fully investigated. To this end, the present study investigates these issues by answering the following research questions:

# Research questions

There are six main questions in this study:

1. Does using e-portfolios improve EFL learners’ speaking proficiency?   
2. How is the students’ speaking sub-skills improvement affected by using portfolios assessment?   
3. What is the attitude of EFL learners toward the use of e-portfolios in speaking classes?   
4. What are the main advantages and limitations of using e-portfolios in speaking classes?   
5. Is there any relationship between the gender of learners and the functionality of e-portfolios?   
6. How much the findings are dependable and generalizable to other language skills and contexts?

# Method

# Participants

First, based on the rules of cluster sampling, out of 20 classes $( \mathrm { N } = 3 0 0 )$ ) of non-English students in a city in the north east of Iran, two classes were randomly chosen by the researcher. These classes were composed of students who were intermediate English EFL learners attending private language institutes. They were also randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups with 30 students (each group composed of 50 percent from each gender). The number of participants (totally $\mathit { \Theta } = \ 6 0 \mathit { \check { \Psi } }$ ) was decided with regards to power analysis conducted by the $\mathrm { G ^ { * } }$ Power software package (Version 3.1). The mean age of the control and experimental groups were 20.53 and 19.33 respectively. All research conditions including textbooks, the number of sessions, and the course instructor were the same for both groups and the only different element was the use of e-portfolios in the experimental group.

# Instruments

To collect data at the first stage, a Nelson English language proficiency test, consisting of 50 multiple-choice items, was administered. Two IELTS speaking tests were also used to check the participants’ speaking proficiency in pre- and post-test. The conditions of the test administration for both groups were the same as for the real IELTS tests, examining the following elements: fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and pronunciation (based on the IELTS Speaking band descriptors). The fluency was regarded as coherent speaking about the topic with rare repetition, self-correction, or hesitation for word choice or grammatical rules. In addition, by lexical resources, it was meant that participants use topic-related vocabularies flexibly as well as idiomatic language accurately. Moreover, the grammatical range was operationally defined as an accurate and natural production and use of structures apart from ‘slips’. Finally, pronunciation quality was taken as the precise and flexible uses of pronunciation features that are easy to understand. Two independent trained raters, different from the researchers, interviewed the learners and rated their speaking proficiency based on the IELTS speaking criteria, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to ensure the inter-rater reliability (0.79), showing a high correlation and reliability.

# Attitude questionnaire

Due to the lack of an appropriate scale for assessing students’ attitude toward e-portfolio assessment in the EFL context, a four-point Likert scale questionnaire was developed to explore the perceptions of the experimental group toward using e-portfolios as a means of evaluating their speaking proficiency. The researchers first made a question pool on the learners’ attitudes toward e-portfolios based on the findings of similar studies in the literature and had them validated by two experts in applied linguistics, settling on sixteen questions out of the question pool. After the questionnaire was piloted for 25 intermediate students, who did not participate in this study, it was checked in terms of internal consistency as well as content and construct validity; then it was used in the study.

# Oral interview

After probing the questionnaire data, to triangulate the elicited responses and to have a deeper account of the participants’ perceptions, a structured interview with eight randomly selected learners in the experimental group was conducted. The reason was to ask identical questions of all the interviewed participants in the experimental group and to compare the answers of different respondents (Mackey & Gass, 2005).

# Research design

The first and second research questions aimed at investigating the impact of e-portfolio assessment on speaking proficiency; the third research question, through a questionnaire and an interview (methodological triangulation), probed the attitudes of the experimental group toward the use of e-portfolios. Since the questionnaire was on a Likert scale, quantitative measures were used to analyze the findings. In addition, the interview consisted of both closed and open-ended questions, making it possible to use both quantitative and qualitative measures to analyze the results. The philosophy of using such method of data collection and research design is explained and addressed in Frost et  al. (2018) and Goho and Blackman (2006) which accentuated the creation of a comprehensive map of reviews relating to stakeholders to the best available evidence. E-portfolio assessment was the major independent variable, whereas the learners’ oral proficiency and attitudes were the dependent variables of the study. The fourth research question was answered through qualitative analysis of the data gathered from the participants’ responses. For the fifth research question, an item response theory analysis was run to examine differential item functioning (DIF) for male and female participants. The sixth research question also aimed at investigating the reliability and validity of the findings through running a generalizability analysis. Along with the proper data collection stages that were taken, there was a random assignment of the participants to experimental and control groups, and the groups were naturally assembled as intact classrooms.

# Procedure

Primitively, sixty students were randomly assigned to two groups $\left( \mathrm { N } = 3 0 \right)$ ): one experimental group and one control group. The participants preceding the experiment were pretested to ensure their homogeneity, in terms of fluency and accuracy. Next, prior to the treatment, the experimental group took part in a tutorial session introducing the process of constructing and evaluating e-portfolios. In the first session of instruction for the experimental group, the teacher recorded five randomly selected learners’ performances in the classroom and put the samples in their e-portfolios. The students spoke for about two minutes each. Then all of the learners were asked to record an audio file in which they verbalized their thoughts on an IELTS speaking topic, introduced by the teacher at home. They had to reflect on their own work and assess their speaking performance based on the determined framework. Moreover, in each session, they had to listen to two of their classmates’ e-portfolios and offer feedback. In the control group, the learners were given the topics in the classroom and they were supposed to talk about them for 1 to 2 minutes.

In the control group, the instructor corrected students’ mistakes, of all kinds, immediate to their occurrence. Since the learners in the experimental group, contrary to the control group, recorded their speaking assignments on the same topics, they could track the process of their learning through keeping e-portfolios as well as assessing their own and their classmates’ works. In addition, the instructor regularly assessed the learners’ e-portfolios, giving feedback and keeping records of their progress. Self-assessment records were the students’ self-ratings tools of their own works based on the sample provided by the instructor at the beginning of the treatment. The instruction in both groups consisted of two 90-minute sessions per week over a period of 10 weeks. Despite having the same classroom exercises, the main difference between the groups was that in the experimental group, the homework assignments were assessed by the learners along with the instructor’s help as a supervisor of e-portfolios; these learners had one year of experience in commenting and revising English writing samples and all of them received primitive instruction in advanced writing in their curriculum. Therefore, both the instructor and the students had the opportunity to comment on any of the records presented in the class in terms of mistakes and speaking sub-skills.

# Data analysis

Descriptive statistics were employed to determine the mean and standard deviation of both groups on the pre- and post-tests. Prior to the study, an independent samples t-test was run to ensure the homogeneity of the participants, and after the treatment, a repeated measure t-test, as well as an independent samples t-test, were run to measure the difference between the performances of the participants in the two groups from the pre- to post-test. To triangulate the data, a questionnaire and an interview were used to find out the learners’ attitudes toward the utility of e-portfolios. Open-ended items in the interview were transcribed and analyzed to find a more accurate account of the learners’ attitudes. In addition, a Rash-model analysis was run to check if there is any bias in the functionality of electronic portfolios or any particular group of participants advantage more. In addition, to check the reliability of the data a generalizability analysis was run using EduG software.

A DIF analysis was run to examine the invariance of the functionality of measurement tools across the learners. Differential item functioning (DIF) is considered one of the tools for the examination of test performance which aims at determining and preventing the occurrence of bias in the function of tests and assessment tools. There are various methods for analyzing the differential function of assessment tools in the literature but research has shown that the Rasch model mainly performs at an acceptable level (Karami Khodi, 2021). Thus, in order to see if there is any bias in the function of test items in traditional and electronic portfolios for participants of both genders and to be sure about the comparability of the proceeding findings, a Rasch-model-based DIF analysis was run.

Moreover, the interview questions were four English items; the responses to them were analyzed via cross-case analysis. The analysis was conducted through transcribing and listing the recurring answers of learners. In other words, the items were analyzed through inductive qualitative analysis, in which recurring reasons in the learners’ responses to the questions were determined, and then the responses to the questions were grouped under related themes.

# Results

The present study investigates the impact of e-portfolios and probes the learners’ attitudes toward using e-portfolios. The generalizability analysis also demonstrates the dependability and reliability of the obtained results; it also shows the probability of findings the same functionality for e-portfolio in other contexts. In addition, the DIF analysis evaluates the existence of possible biases in the functionality of e-portfolio assessment in favor of the participants from any gender.

# The effect of E-portfolio assessment on oral proficiency

To check the normality of distribution, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was run. P-values were .059 and .55 for the experimental group in the pre- and post-test, whereas they were .64 and .63 for the control group in the pre- and post-tests respectively. It was found that the data had a normal distribution (Table 1).

Table 1. P retest scores of experimental and control groups on general placement test.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Group</td><td>N</td><td>Mean Rank</td><td>Sum of Ranks</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental</td><td>30</td><td>17.37</td><td>260.50</td></tr><tr><td>Control</td><td>30</td><td>13.63</td><td>204.50</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>60</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

The results of the independent samples t-test indicate that the difference between the pre-test scores of the experimental and control groups were not statistically significant $\left( \mathrm { P } \ = \ . 2 3 \right)$ which means there was not a significant difference between the overall proficiency of the two groups and the examination of the effect size accentuates the same interpretation; based on Plonsky and Oswald (2014) the index for effect size in this study was in the neighborhood of .4 that is considered too small. In order to make sure of the homogeneity of the groups’ speaking proficiency, the means and standard deviation of both groups were compared, showing no significant difference between speaking proficiency of the experimental and control groups prior to the study (Control Group Mean $= ~ 1 6 . 3$ , Experimental Group $\mathrm { M e a n } \mathrm { = } ~ 1 6 . 8 7$ , Mean, $\mathrm { S i g = }$ .67). Once the homogeneity was confirmed, the treatment was launched, a post-test was administered, and the treatment impact was determined. The mean of the experimental group was 5.30, whereas it was 4.86 for the control group. These means could be compared to the mean scores for the experimental group and control group in the pre-test that were 3.65 and 3.70 respectively. In the follow-up section, an independent samples t-test was run and showed that the significance value was smaller than .05 $\left( \mathtt { p } \ = \ . 0 2 \right)$ ; therefore, it can be claimed that the difference between the groups in terms of speaking proficiency in the post-test was statistically significant. To compare the speaking proficiency of the experimental group in the post-test as compared to their pre-test scores, the paired samples t-test was run, showing significant improvement for the experimental group in the post-test. Therefore, it can be concluded that the experimental group outperformed the control group. The analytical representation of gain scores for the experimental group is represented in Table 2.

Thus, it could be stated that the treatment was effective and the proficiency level of the participants in the experimental group improved significantly. A within-group comparison of the speaking sub-skills for the experimental group shows that all sub-skills in that group improved significantly after receiving the treatment and being assessed through using electronic portfolios. In addition, the effect size indexes calculated here suggest that even slight changes in the mean score in speaking sub-skills can result in small to medium effect sizes (Wei et  al., 2019).

# The attitude of the learners toward the use of e-Portfolio assessment (questionnaire results)

In order to examine the participants’ attitudes toward using e-portfolios, a questionnaire was developed, validated, and administered for the learners in the experimental group immediately after the completion of the treatment, following the post-test. The participants’ responses to each item was quantified based on a four-point Likert scale. The results are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows that the highest mean score was obtained for the following items: ‘Creating the e-portfolio showed me that $I$ can practice speaking even when I am alone’ ( $\mathbf { M } = 3 . 5 3 )$ ) and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ can be aware of my mistakes by the use of e-portfolios’ $\mathbf { \langle M } = 3 . 5 3 )$ ), whereas the lowest mean score was gained for ‘Using the e-portfolio is a waste of time’ $( \mathrm { M } = 1 . 5 3 )$ ). Moreover, the highest standard deviation was for $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ feel comfortable when $I$ use the e-portfolio’ $\left( \mathrm { S D } \ = \ 1 . 1 6 \right)$ , while the lowest standard deviation was obtained for ‘The teacher’s feedback helps me improve my speaking’ $\left( \mathrm { S D } \ = \ . 5 6 \right)$ and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ could monitor my knowledge as it develops over time by using the e-portfolio’ $\left( \mathrm { S D } = . 5 9 \right)$ ).

Collectedly it is suggestible that using an e-portfolio helps learners to act independently in finding their mistakes and assessing their own performance as well as practicing on their own. In addition, the majority of the students with a high-level of assurance believe that the use of e-portfolio is beneficial. In addition, the standard deviations showed that the learners’ ideas about the effect of peers’ comments are somehow controversial and its level of contribution to the improvement of the students’ needs more investigations. In addition, the highest degree of agreement was achieved for the effectiveness of teachers’ comments on the learners’ performance and the ability that learners gain in monitoring their performance.

# Learner attitude toward the use of E-portfolio assessment (interview results)

A total of 8 students were interviewed randomly in this study. The findings indicated that most of the learners $\left( \mathtt { n } = 5 \right)$ preferred a combination of traditional and e-portfolio assessment. Besides, all 8 interviewees believed e-portfolios improve their speaking in general. The frequency of the responses -which should be supported by the direct quotations of the participants (Pham, 2021) - showed that, despite a few negative points expressed by the learners, most of the respondents had a positive attitude toward the use of e-portfolios in the speaking courses. Amongst the statements by the students, the sense of being confused at the early stage of using e-portfolios was a common concern as the first student mentioned:

Quotation 1: ‘The continuous use of e-portfolios is bewildering for me especially when I work as member of a group because sometimes I cannot come to conclusion that what I am supposed to do and what is the responsibility of others’

The most commonly reported disadvantage of using e-portfolios is the repeated presentation of the mistakes. This issue was mentioned by more than 20 percent of those who were interviewed and it ranked first among the disadvantages. This concern is mentioned in the second students’ statements as:

Quotation 2: ‘when it reminds me of the mistakes I have, I feel it’s very nice but when multiple of times I face my mistakes it bothers me and I lose my confidence’ This shows that e-portfolios are somehow repetitive.

Through the analysis of interview results, the sense of awareness that they provide is very critical and noticeable. Clearly, it was stated that after using e-portfolios learners could differentiate mistakes and errors consciously as mentioned by the third student:

Quotation 3: ‘you know the sense of awareness it gives and provides is really helpful; sometimes I unknowingly make a mistake specially in pronunciation or grammar but using this method enables me to improve my performance’

‘To be truthful, I should say that always I struggle with myself how to find my mistakes. In majority of the situations that I make a mistake I a dead sure that my statement is right but, in fact, it is not. A major dimension and capacity that using e-portfolios can propose is to enable us become aware of our mistake easily and even we have the chance to check them several times to fully understand the root of the problem.’ These were coded as an advantage showing the impact of e-portfolios on learners’ awareness.

Similar to other themes about the use and application of e-portfolios, the motivation that its use can bring about is very eye-catching in the students’ comments. This really makes sense that the use of such an attractive and structured tool can improve the learners’ motivation; one of the reasons was mentioned as:

Quotation 4: ‘any single time that I can detect my own problems before receiving an advice of correction form the teacher or my friends I get more motivated to use it in all conditions’ it was taken an advantage, which show the sense of motivation e- portfolios bring about.

One of the major advantages of using e-portfolios was raising the learners’ awareness to detect the inaccuracies in their performance. A full demonstration of the direct quotations along with the coding procedure are represented in appendix B in this paper. These extracted themes are all classified and reported in Figures 2 and 3 in proceeding In proceeding, an analysis of the coded responses is presented in Figure 2. The findings show that when students understand their improvement, they would be motivated.

Along with the announced advantages of e-portfolios, the repetitious listening to recordings, the sense of confusion, and the amount of time required for its use are among the suggested cons for its use. Figure 3 depicts the limitation of using e-portfolios as they are ranked and suggested by students.

To answer the fifth research question about the function of e-portfolio, a Differential item functioning analysis was run, and the results are demonstrated in Table 3.

Demonstrating the DIF analysis results among the learners with different genders, Table 3 shows that although the difficulty level of both electronic and non-electronic tasks was found to be higher for the male than for female learners, it was statistically significant. Although e-portfolios were generally more difficult for the learners (greater DIF measure than traditional portfolios), they both function advantageously for the female learners. It can be concluded that the male learners are less able in both tasks, whereas the female learners found the tasks more lenient and obtained higher scores. Finally, to be sure about the dependability of the findings, which means consistency and reliability of the assessment scores, a generalizability analysis was run (Rentz, 1987). The necessity of running generalizability analysis was that it takes both random and systematic errors of measurement into account. Moreover, based on the participants of the study, this analysis explains the possible scope for the generalization of findings to other contexts. The results show that the relative G-coefficient index for the e-portfolios was .91, while it was .89 for traditional portfolio assessment, suggesting that e-portfolios are more reliable in the process of assessment. In addition, the use of e-portfolios in other contexts may bring about a similar level of reliability and accuracy with the confidence interval of 91 percent.

Figure 4. G ender-based presentation of speaking sub-skills.

For obtaining a better understanding of students’ performance, an analytical gender-based examination of scores is illustrated in Table 4. Accordingly, the considered speaking subskills namely fluency and coherence, the use of lexical resources, grammaticality of statements, and pronunciation were evaluated (Figure 4).

As it was indicated in Table 4 the level of each subskill in the post-test for both male and female participants accentuated the superiority of the female participants’ ability in all subskills, except the use of lexical resources. Grammar range and accuracy, as well as the use of lexical resources, had similar patterns of change for both genders, accentuating social similarities (Fairclough, 2003) and sex-exclusive differences in language use (Talbot, 2010). The function of the assessment tools, to a certain extent, could be attributed to relatively gender-based factors such as culture, literacy, and willingness (Medel-Anonuevo, 1995). In this case, DIF means that the learners feel more comfortable to using e-portfolios; thus, despite decreases in differences between the abilities of male and female learners, the male learners’ progress rate could not exceed the females’. This is supported by the means obtained in the pre- and post-tests for participants of both genders. The mean score for female participants in the posttest improved by $1 5 \%$ while this rate was $1 3 \%$ for the male participants. This could be attributed to the attitudes and comfort the female learners had during the study. In terms of the speaking sub-skills, pronunciation was the dimension in which both the male and female learners experienced the highest improvement. This may be explained due to its integration with other speaking sub-skills (McGregor & Reed, 2018). Moreover, it was found that -in comparison with the beginning of the study- that for male students the progress rate was different. The results are depicted in Table 4.

Therefore, it should be asserted that the progress level for each speaking subskill was not at the same rate compared to its level prior to the study. The best progress belongs to the grammatical accuracy of and the slowest rate belongs to the use of the lexical resource.

# The juxtaposition of attitudes toward using e-portfolios

Initially negative, the learners appreciate its use and gain positive attitude over the years as the process evolves. The primitive negativity in learners’ attitude, which was observed in previous research rather than the present one could be attributed to the anxiety the learners have once they try to use e-portfolios (Ozdemir-Catagay, 2012). The juxtaposition of negative and positive attitudes could be explained due to other contributing factors such as learners’ motivation and autonomy: the higher these two factors are, the more positive the learners’ attitude would be. The combination of the findings may provide support for the conceptual premise in the case of applying e-portfolios during the assessment process rather than the teaching process that would result in learners’ positive attitude toward its use. The findings of this study can mirror those of the previous ones about the positive attitude in assessment procedures (e.g., Cepik & Yastibas, 2013; Rahmawati & Hakim, 2018).

# Discussion

In the present study, the most frequently reported advantages stated by the learners in the experimental group were about speaking ability (including improvement in speaking, motivation for speaking, and finding mistakes in speaking) which probably accentuate the effectiveness of e-portfolios in language assessment. These themes specifically show that learners have a positive attitude toward the use electronic portfolios in speaking assessment procedure. This can also stress the limitations and negative aspects of e-portfolios. The results of the interviews and the questionnaire survey show that learners are more worried about the time, place, and in general the practical use and implementation of e-portfolios than the nature of its existence in their education. Therefore, the discrepancy among research studies may be due to the implementation methods of e-portfolios and the results of this study can corroborate the findings of a great deal of the previous work about learners’ positive attitudes toward the use of e-portfolios (e.g., Barrot, 2016; Chen et  al., 2012; Tzeng, 2011). The findings of the present study are in accordance with the other studies such as Huang and Hung (2010), who investigated the impacts of e-portfolio assessment on speaking along with learners’ attitudes toward it in Taiwan. They found the learners’ perceptions of creating e-portfolios positive. Generally, e-portfolios raise students’ awareness of their weaknesses, decrease their anxiety, and can be a useful tool for practicing speaking in language classes.

Along with the examination of the learners’ attitude toward using e-portfolios, the major aim of this research project has been to establish the effect of using e-portfolio assessment on language learners’ speaking proficiency. It was found that e-portfolios positively contribute to the Iranian language learners’ speaking proficiency. Much of the research on the use of e-portfolios in assessment suggests the significant utility of e-portfolios in helping learners to take greater responsibility in planning, managing, and monitoring their learning (Mansvelder-Longayroux et  al., 2007). In the present study, the learners’ assessment was done based on IELTS Speaking Band Descriptors.

The significant improvement in students’ speaking ability was analytically depicted, and the results of a within-item analysis for speaking subskills made the investigation of the progress level of each subskill possible, showing that the progress did not equally occur for speaking subskills. It seems that these results are due to the effectiveness of e-portfolios and the findings could be extrapolated to other contexts. The findings of the present study were also in line with another study conducted by Cepik and Yastibas (2013), examining the effect of e-portfolios on improving the oral performance of Turkish EFL learners. The results showed that e-portfolios had positive effects on improving the learners’ speaking ability. In addition, they generally had positive attitudes toward using e-portfolios and indicated that e-portfolios could bring language improvements (e.g., in grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary) and affective achievements (through increasing self-confidence and motivation). One major concern that exists among the researchers was whether e-portfolios have an identical function for both male and female learners (Davis & Ponnamperuma, 2005; Driessen et  al., 2006) and the generalizability of much of the published research on this issue has been inconsistent since their focus was on qualitative methods rather than objective statistical investigation. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the possible bias in the functionality of e-portfolios for assessing the learners’ speaking proficiency.

It was found that the female learners in both e-portfolios and paper-based portfolios gained more advantages. Since the main purpose of the study was to assess the functionality of e-portfolios, it could be explained that such a difference could be due to either their digital literacy or their attitude as it was mentioned in the literature (Badagliacco, 1990; Shashaani, 1994); although this was not evaluated in the present study, it is suggested in various local research findings. In addition, at the international level, this hypothesis is supported that there is a significant difference in the computer literacy of male and female learners in the world (Birgin et  al., 2010; Tella & Mutula, 2008; Zin et  al., 2000). What we have found is that using e-portfolios for female participants easier than male participants based on DIF analysis results. It is assumable that this easiness of using e-portfolios for females is due to their higher literacy. Moreover, it could be a matter of preference, under the condition that ‘When individuals exhibit a social preference, others payoffs (or utilities) enter into their utility function’ (p. 7), In the Iranian culture, the trend analyses show the educational level of women is increasing each year and it is predicted to exceed the level of men in future years (Mila Elmi, 2009). Therefore, a gender-based willingness to use e-portfolios is explainable due to the rising level of enthusiasm in women. What could be concluded here is that similar to other studies in the literature (Dabaghi, 2012; Yan, 2009), the gain scores for female participants exceed that of males’, requiring further investigation to find the contributing factors.

Furthermore, the results of the generalizability analysis pointed to the higher levels of dependability for e-portfolios, in comparison with the traditional portfolios. That is, the performance assessment of learners’ speaking abilities by e-portfolios is more accurate, dependable, and generalizable than the assessment results derived from the traditional portfolios. This conclusion is justifiable due to the fact that the results of generalizability analysis (as a means for assessing whether the contribution of construct irrelevant factors to our evaluation procedures is significant) have shown using e-portfolios reduces the effect of irrelevant factors on the scores obtained. It is represented the G-coefficients presented by the preceding G-theory analysis and the analytical variance components obtained. The variance of the stems from the real performance of students is higher in the assessment procedure by e-portfolio than the variance level obtained in traditional assessment. To sum up, similar to the previous studies that pointed out the utility of e-portfolios (Delett et  al., 2001; Kohonen, 2000) and learners’ positive attitude toward its use, the present study suggests that speaking e-portfolios are effective tools in instruction and assessment procedures of oral skills. It should also be noted that based on the suggestions received from the students in the interview, instructors should provide support through giving clear guidelines and help the students believe that using an e-portfolio is not a complicated task, and it can positively change the atmosphere of the class to a dynamic one.

# Conclusion

This paper was designed to determine the effect, function, and validity of e-portfolios in the assessment of language learners’ speaking ability. Given the belief that e-portfolios improve the quality of learning and assessment, six research questions explored the impact of e-portfolio assessment on oral performance of EFL learners’ attitudes toward using e-portfolio assessment. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that the learners have a strong willingness to use e-portfolios in speaking courses. Besides, they show positive attitudes toward this kind of assessment. In addition, the application of e-portfolios paves the way for the use of learning-oriented assessment. It is useful because it brings statistically significant improvements in their achievements in terms of speaking sub-skills such as fluency, grammatical accuracy, and vocabulary use.

To achieve this aim, scholars and researchers in the area of EFL/ESL speaking can shift their discussions to how the implementation of e-portfolios can contribute to the improvement of speaking proficiency of the learners facing the challenge of non-nativeness of their instructors and limited chances of communication with native speakers. However, the majority of the studies to date have focused on how to measure and teach speaking to EFL learners through instructors’ skills, with a particular focus on the use of technological tools. Without considering a lack of practical studies and biased functionality of e-portfolios in empowering learners of different genders (Behzadnia & Mehrani, 2018; Mehrani & Khodi, 2014; Zabihi et  al., 2019), it is important to indicate that using e-portfolios would benefit both male and female EFL learners in terms of fluency, grammaticality, lexical resources, and pronunciation, especially when instructors, as well as peers, are involved in the process of assessment and instruction in speaking classes (Burns & Kurtoglu-Hooton, 2016). This bias in the performance of genders is due to the way they look at the nature of assessment (i.e. holistic vs. analytical) and the active presence and contribution of gender effect in the pedagogical contexts (Haswell & Haswell, 1996). Concerning the unbalanced development of speaking -subskill, we believe that it is attributable to the natural development of first language among children the same findings are suggested in the literature (e.g. Anthony et  al., 2009). These findings can enhance our understanding of the idea that using e-portfolios can be useful and beneficial for language learners; they can also pave the way for independent learning and make students take responsibility and control of their learning. In addition, the learners engaged in the process of self and peer assessment can further cooperate with their classmates so that the language class becomes more dynamic. To conclude, the results agree with the findings of other studies that propose EFL learners face more improvement in their speaking ability when e-portfolios are applied to the instruction and assessment procedures. Accordingly, other researchers are encouraged to carry out analytical and more comprehensive research on the causes of DIF in the function of e-portfolios among EFL learners and on the generalizability of such issues to the ESL context. Since the present study, due to the limitations, is unable to explain the differences in the functionality of e-portfolios among the learners of different genders as well as the unbalanced distribution of progress in the speaking subs-kills, future research can expand the scope of this study by collecting analytical data on not only speaking ability but also other linguistic skills, using un/semi-structured interviews and longitudinal observations on the significance of using e-portfolios in empowering EFL/ESL learners.

Participant 1: “when I use electronic portfolios in the class, a little bit I feel confused $\textcircled{1}$ but when I use it at home to see how I have progressed during the semester, it really helps me to find my strengths $\textcircled{2}$ so I prefer to use it on my own and when I feel I have mastered the point I used them in communication with my friends $\textcircled{3}$ . Thus, in comparison with my friends in the class, I am now more able and the teacher encourages me more because I have fewer mistakes and I am faster in my speaking and making sentences correctly” $\textcircled{4}$   
Participant 2: “To be faithful, I needed to find out the element and part of my speaking win which I have pronounced mistakenly and when I used this method, I was able to find them on my own just by listening to my performance once or twice①.
