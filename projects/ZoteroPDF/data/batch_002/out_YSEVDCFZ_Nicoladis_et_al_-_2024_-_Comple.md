# ABSTRACT

Bilingual children often lag behind monolinguals on standardized measures of language acquisition, such as vocabulary tests. This bilingual lag could be related bilinguals’ lesser experience with the target language relative to monolinguals. In this study, we predicted that sequential Mandarin-English bilinguals would perform worse than same-aged English monolinguals on a standardized measure of complex sentence production. As predicted, the bilingual preschoolers performed worse than age-matched English monolinguals. However, once English experience was covaried, there was no significant difference between the two groups. After controlling for age, we tested three predictors of complex sentence production: (1) English vocabulary, (2) verbal memory, and (for the bilinguals) (3) Mandarin vocabulary. For both bilinguals and monolinguals, English vocabulary and verbal memory were significant predictors. These results support the argument that experience with a particular language is highly predictive of children’s ability to produce complex sentences in that language. Verbal memory is also an important predictor of individual differences in the ability to produce complex sentences.

Studies have shown that bilingual children often lag behind monolingual children in at least one of their languages in many aspects of language learning, including vocabulary (Bedore and Peña 2008; Bialystok et al. 2010; Nicoladis and Wiebe 2020; Peets and Bialystok 2015; Thordardottir et al. 2006; Thorn and Gathercole 1999; Uccelli and Páez 2007) and morphosyntax (Austin 2009; Cahill et al. 2020; Chondrogianni and Marinis 2011; Kaipa 2020; Rezzonico et al. 2016; Thordardottir et al. 2006). Bilinguals can sometimes obtain equivalent vocabulary scores in at least one language relative to monolinguals, if they have a lot of exposure to that language, if socio-economic status (SES) is taken into account (Filippi et al. 2020), and/or if they are growing up in a supportive sociocultural context for bilingualism (Smithson, Paradis, and Nicoladis 2014). When bilinguals show lags relative to sameaged monolinguals, one common explanation is that bilingual children hear and produce that language less often than monolingual children. In support of this argument, exposure time is strongly correlated to vocabulary size in bilingual children (David and Li 2008; Paradis et al. 2020). In the present study, we compared bilingual children’s complex sentence production abilities in English on a standardized measure to those of monolingual children. Complex sentences are sentences requiring either two finite verbs (such as relative clauses) or verb movement (such as WHquestions in English) or passive constructions in English (Crain and Thornton 2012; Diessel 2004). The bilingual children in this study had all first learned Mandarin and then started learning English. Given that the bilingual children had had less exposure to English than same-aged monolinguals, we expected them to perform worse than monolingual children (as in Chondrogianni and Marinis 2011; Thordardottir et al. 2006).

In contrast to the findings of studies showing a bilingual disadvantage in complex sentence production, one recent study found that French-English bilingual preschoolers outperformed agematched English monolinguals on a standardized measure of complex sentence production in English (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022). The bilingual advantage on complex sentence production in that study was particularly surprising given that the bilinguals scored significantly lower on English vocabulary than the monolinguals. One possible reason that bilinguals sometimes outperform monolinguals on complex sentence production (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022) and sometimes underperform relative to monolinguals (Thordardottir et al. 2006) is that there are additional factors contributing to children’s performance. In the present study, we considered three variables that might modulate whether bilingual children outperform or underperform monolingual children on complex sentence production: (1) their within-language vocabulary, (2) verbal memory abilities, and (3) cross-linguistic influence. We briefly discuss evidence from previous studies as to why these variables might be important.

The ability to form complex sentences in a language is strongly related to exposure and usage of that language (Crain and Thornton 2012). Previous studies have found that English vocabulary scores (a proxy measure of exposure to English) predicted bilingual children’s production of complex sentences (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022; Paradis et al. 2017). As for monolingual children, most previous studies have focused on age, showing that older children are better at producing complex sentences than younger children (Jackson and Roberts 2001; McDaniel, McKee, and Garrett 2010; see discussion in Peña et al. 2020). However, it is important to keep in mind that age is highly correlated with vocabulary among monolingual children (Yan and Nicoladis 2009). Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest (2022) found that English vocabulary scores were a significant predictor of the ability to produce complex sentences on a standardized test in English, for both bilingual and monolingual children, even after they controlled for age. However, since they also found that the bilingual children outperformed the monolingual on complex sentence production despite lower vocabulary scores, they speculated that other variables might be involved.

Another variable that could contribute to children’s ability to produce complex sentences is verbal memory. Verbal short-term and working memory refer to the ability to store limited verbal information in a temporarily accessible state during cognitive processing (Cowan et al. 1999; Gutiérrez-Clellen, Calderón, and Weismer 2004). Verbal memory allows speakers to hold their message in memory while they access words and other linguistic constructions to convey that message. Verbal memory is an important predictor of sentence production abilities among both adults (Wiseheart and Altmann 2018) and children (Adams 1996; Kim and Yim 2016; Paradis et al. 2017; Veraksa et al. 2020), most likely because sentence production involves planning (McDaniel, McKee, and Garrett 2010). Some studies have shown that bilinguals outperform monolinguals on measures of verbal short-term and/or working memory (e.g. Bialystok 2010; Blom et al. 2014; Leikin and Tovli 2014) while others have not (e.g. Bosman and Janssen 2017; Cockcroft 2016; Engel de Abreu 2011; Gutiérrez-Clellen, Calderón, and Weismer 2004). We expected to find that verbal memory predicted children’s ability to produce complex sentences in this study.

Still another variable that could contribute to bilingual children’s ability to produce complex sentences is the extent that they can transfer knowledge from their other language, such as particular syntactic constructions (Nicoladis and Sajeev 2020; Runnqvist et al. 2013; Strik and Pérez-Leroux 2011). For example, Nicoladis and Sajeev (2020) found that French-English bilingual children attained the same level of comprehension of passive sentences as English monolingual children by the age of five to six years, despite less exposure to English than the monolingual children. Nicoladis and Sajeev (2020) argued that the bilingual children transferred knowledge of passive constructions from French to English, allowing them to attain similar levels of comprehension. Passive constructions in French and English are formed identically, a factor that could have supported children’s transfer from French to English (Nicoladis and Sajeev 2020). We know of only one study that has directly tested for possible effects of cross-linguistic influence in complex sentence production (see Paradis et al. 2017, for an indirect test). Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest (2022) found that French-English bilingual children’s performance on a French version of a complex sentence production task was not a significant predictor of their English performance. In this study, we tested for the possibility that the bilingual children’s production of complex sentences in English was influenced by their knowledge of Mandarin.

# This study

In this study, we compared preschool English monolingual and Mandarin-English bilingual children’s production of complex English sentences on a standardized test. The bilinguals in this study had averaged less than two years of exposure to English. We therefore predicted that bilingual children would perform worse than monolinguals (Thordardottir et al. 2006; cf. Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022). Moreover, if the bilinguals’ lower performance is due to less English experience, than covarying a measure of English experience should result in no significant differences between bilinguals and monolinguals.

While most previous studies have shown a bilingual disadvantage in complex sentence production (Paradis et al. 2017), one study showed a bilingual advantage (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022). We tested two predictors of all the children’s performance on a sentence production task in English: (1) English vocabulary scores (a proxy measure of English experience; see David and Li 2008; Paradis et al. 2020) and (2) verbal short-term memory. For the bilingual children, we also tested for the possibility of cross-linguistic influence, but testing whether Mandarin experience predicted their performance on English complex sentence production. Following Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest (2022), we controlled for age in these analyses.

# Method

# Participants

Forty Mandarin-English bilinguals between 4 and 6 years of age living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada participated in this study. While all of the bilingual children started learning Mandarin at home before learning English, the age at which they were exposed to English varied. Eight children started learning English before 12 months, eight between one to two years, 10 between 2–3 years, and 14 after 3. Thus, as a group, they are best characterized as sequential bilinguals, with an average of 1.8 years of English exposure. Forty age-matched English monolinguals were also included from a database of 79. Some data from the same participants in this study has previously been published (Nicoladis and Jiang 2018); some comparisons between the two language groups on background measures are repeated, but the main analyses are new. The two language groups did not differ in age in months, $t < 1$ , $p = . 4 8$ , $d = . 1 5 8$ . The background characteristics of the children are summarized in Table 1.

We did not collect measures of individual families’ socio-economic status. Our recruitment strategies likely targeted families on the higher end of socio-economic status, for both bilinguals and monolinguals. Canadian immigration policy favours highly educated immigrants (Morton and Harper 2007), particularly from mainland China (the birthplace of all the parents of the children in this study). All of the bilingual children had at least one parent who was in Canada for postsecondary studies. As for the monolingual children, we recruited them in university-area daycares that are known to cater to university students and professors.

# Materials

The standardized measure of complex sentence production was the Reynell Sentence Production Task: Complex Sentences (F) (Edwards et al. 1997; Edwards et al. 1999; Letts et al. 2014). In this subtest, children are invited to produce three kinds of complex sentences: four WH-questions, three sentences with relative clauses, and three passive sentences. For each kind of complex sentence, children are provided with a practice item first before proceeding to the test items. For the WH-questions, a stuffed monkey is placed in front of two pictures. The experimenter asks children to ask the monkey a question (e.g. You want Monkey to tell you which boy is chasing the girl. What do you ask Monkey?; Edwards, Letts, and Sinka 2011, p.37). For the sentences with relative clauses, the experimenter describes a picture and invites children to describe another picture in the same way (e.g. In this picture the boy who is pulling the lady is wearing a hat). Then, the experimenter shows children another picture and starts the sentence for them (e.g. And in this picture, the lady … ). For passive sentences, the experimenter also asks children to describe pictures following a model. All three of the target constructions on this subtest of the Reynell differ in word order between Chinese and English (Qi and Biase 2020; Yip and Matthews 2007).

The children’s English vocabulary was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) III: English receptive vocabulary (Dunn and Dunn 1997). Version A was given to all participants as a measure of English vocabulary, and a Mandarin translation of Version B was also given to the bilingual participants as a measure of Mandarin vocabulary. Vocabulary scores were used as a proxy measure of experience with a language, as previous studies have shown that vocabulary scores are highly correlated with measures of exposure in bilingual children (David and Li 2008; Paradis et al. 2020). Moreover, the parents’ report on the number of years that the bilingual children in this study had been learning English was correlated with their English vocabulary scores, r (38) $= . 4 7 9$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ .

Verbal short-term memory was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Wechsler 2003) subtest digit span – forward digit (FDS). The experimenter read out a sequence of numerical digits to the participants, and the participants were instructed to repeat the sequence in the same order. If successful, the participants were then given a longer sequence, starting from 2 numbers and going up to 9 numbers. The score was the longest sequence correctly recalled by the participant.

# Procedure

Within a testing session, the children were administered a battery of measures of cognitive and language abilities. The order of the tasks was decided upon by the experimenter’s judgment of individual children’s engagement and comfort. Within a session, the experimenter usually started with the more passive tasks (like the PPVT, in which children are invited to simply point to a picture corresponding to a word) and then proceeded to the more active tasks (like the forward digit span task, the Reynell sentence production, and the narrative task; these tasks all require children to speak). We present here only the measures relevant to the hypotheses.

The bilingual children participated in two language sessions: one in English and one in Mandarin Chinese. The two language sessions were scheduled on different days, usually about a week apart, and were run by two different experimenters, native speakers of the target language of the session. The Mandarin PPVT was administered during the Mandarin testing session. All of the other measures included here were administered during the English testing session.

The standardized tests (the PPVT and the Reynell) were administered according to the tester’s manual of the relevant test (Dunn and Dunn 1997; Edwards, Letts, and Sinka 2011).

# Coding and analysis

The standardized tests were scored according to the test instructions (Dunn and Dunn 1997; Edwards, Letts, and Sinka 2011). For the Reynell, all ten test sentences were scored as either correct (1) or incorrect (0). Correct WH-questions had to start with the correct question word, followed by a determiner on the noun, the appropriate verb with correct tense marking. A relative clause sentence had to contain the correct connector, determiner, verb, and tense marking. A passive sentence had to include determiners before nouns, an auxiliary verb, and the passive morphological markers (-ed, by). The task was completed in English for all participants, and the possible scores ranged from 0-10. Because we were interested in individual differences between children for this study, we included the raw scores of the PPVT and the Reynell in the analyses.

To test for predictors of children’s complex sentence production, we analyzed the data with linear regression models. We entered age in the first model, since both of these variables have been shown to be related to complex sentence production. In the second model, we entered forward digit span scores. For the bilingual children, we also included Mandarin PPVT scores in the second model, to test for possible cross-linguistic transfer.

# Results

Table 2 summarizes the descriptive data for all the above tasks. As predicted, the bilingual children performed significantly worse than the monolinguals on the two standardized tests in English, both the PPVT, $t \left( 7 8 \right) = 1 0 . 6 4 , p < . 0 0 1 ,$ $d = 2 . 4 0 ,$ and on the Reynell sentence production task, $t \left( 7 8 \right) = 2 . 1 9$ , $p = . 0 3$ , $d = 0 . 4 9 .$ . There was no significant difference between groups on the forward digit span task, t $( 7 8 ) = 0 . 5 0 , p = . 6 2 , d = 0 . 1 4 .$

To test whether the bilingual children’s lower sentence production scores on the Reynell could be attributed to less exposure to English, we compared the two language groups’ Reynell performance on an ANCOVA, covarying the children’s English PPVT scores. Consistent with the less-experience argument, the difference between groups no longer reached significance when the PPVT scores were covaried, $F \left( { 1 , 7 7 } \right) = 3 . 2 1 , p = . 0 8 , \boldsymbol { \mathrm { \Pi } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 3 3 .$ . To the extent that this difference approaches significance, there was a tendency for the bilingual children to perform better (estimated marginal mean $= 6 . 0$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 0 . 7 $ than the monolinguals (estimated marginal mean $= 3 . 9$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 0 . 7$ ) when PPVT scores were controlled.

Table 3 summarizes the correlations between performance on the complex sentence production task and age, PPVT, and verbal memory. All of these variables were positively was correlated with Reynell performance for both bilingual and monolingual children. Note that the Mandarin PPVT scores were highly correlated with the bilingual children’s performance on the English complex sentence production task, too.

We next turn to the forward regression, predicting the children’s performance on the Reynell sentence production task. The first model included age; the second model included group (dummy coded with $1 =$ bilingual and $0 =$ monolingual), PPVT, and verbal memory. The first model was significant, $F \left( 1 , 7 8 \right) = 2 5 . 2 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ , consistent with the prediction that age would be an important predictor of performance. The second model was also significant, $F \left( 4 , 7 8 \right) = 1 6 . 1 4 , p < . 0 0 1$ , and showed a big change in $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ from the first model (i.e. .219). Table 4 summarizes the results with the individual predictors. As can be seen in Table 4, English PPVT scores and forward digit span were significant predictors of the children’s performance on the sentence production task. Group (i.e. whether they were bilingual or monolingual) was not a significant predictor. Figure 1 shows the scatterplot of the children’s PPVT and Reynell scores.

Figure 1. Scatterplot of children’s English vocabulary (PPVT) and sentence production (Reynell) scores.

To test for the possibility of cross-linguistic influence (in addition to English experience and verbal memory), we next ran a regression on just the bilingual children, with English PPVT, forward digit span, and Mandarin PPVT in the second model. The first model was significant, $F \left( 1 , 3 9 \right) = 1 9 . 9 7 , p$ $< . 0 0 1$ , meaning that age was a significant predictor or performance. The second model was also significant, $F \left( 4 , 3 9 \right) = 1 3 . 9 9 , p < . 0 0 1$ , with a big change in $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ (i.e. .271). As can be seen in Table 4, even after age was controlled for, English PPVT scores and the forward digit span were significant predictors of performance. Mandarin PPVT scores were not a significant predictor of the bilingual children’s performance.

# Discussion

The purpose of this study was to compare bilingual and monolingual children’s performance on complex sentence production on a standardized sentence production measure. The ability to produce complex sentences is related to exposure to and practice with a particular language (McDaniel, McKee, and Garrett 2010). Since bilingual children often have less experience with at least one of their languages relative to monolinguals (Paradis et al. 2020), we predicted that the bilingual children would perform worse than same-aged monolinguals on complex sentence production.

As predicted, the Mandarin-English bilingual children in this study scored significantly lower than English monolingual children on a standardized measure of English sentence production. This result replicates previous studies on complex sentence production specifically (Thordardottir, Chapman, and Wagner 2002) and standardized language measures generally (e.g. Austin 2009; Bedore and Peña 2008; Bialystok et al. 2010; Chondrogianni and Marinis 2011; Nicoladis and Wiebe 2020; Peets and Bialystok 2015; Rezzonico et al. 2016; Thordardottir et al. 2006; Thorn and Gathercole 1999; Uccelli and Páez 2007). Surprisingly, in this study, once their vocabulary scores were controlled for, the bilingual children showed a non-significant tendency to score higher than the monolingual children. In other words, their performance tended to be higher than would be expected given their vocabulary scores. As this difference did not attain significance, a future study could include a larger sample of children to test if bilingual children reliably perform better on a standardized measure of complex sentence production than would be expected from their vocabulary scores.

This study, like most previous studies (Paradis et al. 2017; Thordardottir, Chapman, and Wagner 2002), showed a bilingual disadvantage in complex sentence production. However, one previous study showed a bilingual advantage in complex sentence production (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022). We therefore also tested three possible predictors of individual differences in children’s complex sentence production: English vocabulary, verbal short-term memory, and (for the bilinguals) Mandarin vocabulary.

As previous studies have shown (Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022; Paradis et al. 2017), we found that English vocabulary was a significant predictor of children’s production of complex sentences. Vocabulary is highly related to exposure time in a particular language (David and Li 2008; Paradis et al. 2020; this study). The finding that vocabulary predicts sentence production is consistent with the argument that experience hearing and using complex sentences in the target language is necessary for children to learn them (Diessel 2004).

We also found that verbal short-term memory was a significant predictor of children’s ability to produce complex sentences, even after controlling for age. This finding supports findings from previous studies showing that verbal memory is an important predictor of sentence production abilities among children (Adams 1996; Kim and Yim 2016; Paradis et al. 2017; Veraksa et al. 2020; cf. Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022). Researchers have speculated that verbal memory is important in sentence production because speakers have to hold verbal information in memory as they plan what they are going to say (McDaniel, McKee, and Garrett 2010). Unlike some previous studies (Bialystok 2010; Blom et al. 2014; Leikin and Tovli 2014) but like other previous studies (Bosman and Janssen 2017; Cockcroft 2016; Engel de Abreu 2011; Gutiérrez-Clellen, Calderón, and Weismer 2004), we did not observe a bilingual advantage for verbal memory. Future studies can test whether a bilingual advantage in complex sentence production is more likely to be observed when there is a bilingual advantage in verbal memory (cf. Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest 2022).

The final predictor we considered in this study was cross-linguistic influence. We hypothesized that bilingual children might transfer knowledge about complex sentence structure from their stronger first language. As in Korade, Nicoladis, and Charest (2022), we found no evidence for cross-linguistic influence in this study. It is important to keep in mind that our measure of complex sentence production included three different linguistic constructions. Given the ubiquity of cross-linguistic influence in other domains (see Serratrice 2013, for a review), future studies could more sensitively target particular constructions in both languages. For example, it is possible that children’s ability to form the passive in one language predicts their ability to form the passive in the other (Nicoladis and Sajeev 2020).

There are a number of limitations to the present study that could affect its generalizability. First, we included a relatively small sample size and a relatively large age range. While we attempted to address the latter point by statistically controlling for age, future studies can focus on a narrower age range. Another limitation of this study was that our measure of complex sentence production elicited three different complex sentence types (i.e. relative clauses, passives, and WH-questions). Future studies can target well-chosen complex sentence types to better test for cross-linguistic influence. Finally, as noted earlier, we did not have measures of the individual families’ socio-economic status, a variable that has been shown to be important in predicting children’s performance on a variety of language measures (Smithson, Paradis, and Nicoladis 2014).

In conclusion, the results of this study support the argument that bilingual children lag behind monolingual children in the acquisition of complex sentences, to the extent that their experience with the target language is less than that of same-aged monolinguals. For both bilingual and monolingual children, individuals’ verbal short-term memory is also an important predictor of their ability to produce complex sentences.
