# ABSTRACT

The aim of this study is to examine the trends and main findings of the studies concerning the flipped classroom method in the field of English language teaching (ELT). For this purpose, databases including Web of Science, Eric, Taylor $\&$ Francis and the Educational full text EBSCO were reviewed, and a total of 43 articles were analysed. Systematic review was used as the research methodology. The articles were analysed utilising a content analysis method. The findings of the study revealed that the flipped classroom method in ELT gained popularity among researchers after 2014, and the number of the studies in the field rapidly increased in the last two years (2016–2017). In addition, the most commonly used research methods in flipped classroom in ELT studies were found to be mixed and quantitative methods. In the examined studies, speaking and writing abilities were the most commonly studied language skills. Further analysis revealed challenges, as well as benefits related to the use of the flipped classroom method in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. Additionally, in studies reviewed concerning the effectiveness of the flipped classroom methods, the findings mostly pointed to the benefits of the flipped classroom method. On the basis of the review, various suggestions are made for practitioners and future research.

# 1. Introduction

English language teaching (ELT) has been of significant importance and of top priority worldwide (Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017). The advances in technology have led to changes in student profiles and instructors, and researchers have been searching for new educational methods that suit the new student profile (Chuang, Weng, & Chen, 2018; Hao, 2016; Wu, Chen Hsieh, & Yang, 2017). In English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching, in this sense, active learning approaches are now considered to be more effective when compared to teacher-centred approaches. The flipped classroom is one of the many active learning approaches that emerged as a result of a quest for a method that serves the changing needs of the new age and has been readily welcomed by instructors and researchers. The literature review reveals the use of the flipped classroom method in various fields including engineering (Karabulut-Ilgu, Jaramillo Cherrez, & Jahren, 2018), mathematics (Lo, Hew, & Chen, 2017), statistics (Strayer, 2012), teacher education (Turan & Goktas € ¸, 2018), and health education (Hew & Lo, 2018). In addition, the flipped classroom has become a hot topic in the field of foreign language teaching (Wang, An, & Wright, 2018; C¸etin Koro € -glu & C¸akır, 2017).

The flipped classroom, in the most general sense, is an educational method in which homework and instruction are swapped and learning takes place beyond the classroom (Adnan, 2017; Bergmann & Sams, 2012; Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017; Karabulut-Ilgu, Jaramillo Cherrez, & Jahren, 2018). In a flipped classroom, new information is transferred to students when they are out of school, mostly through videos. In the classroom, students engage in hands-on activities and practices under the teachers’ guidance (Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017). A flipped classroom makes room for active student participation and encourages the development of an interactive learning environment (Chuang, Weng, & Chen, 2018). Videos are given to students prior to the courses allow the students to learn at their own pace due to being able to pause, rewind, and replay the videos (Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017; Yu & Wang, 2016). A flipped classroom offers flexible instructional time, creates a dynamic and interactive learning environment, and allows for a deep investigation of concepts (Amiryousefi, 2017; Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017; Francl, 2014). To date, studies have shown that a flipped classroom contributes to academic achievement (Turan & Goktas, 2016), increases student engagement (Chen Hsieh, Wu, & Marek, 2017), and decreases learners’ cognitive load (Turan & Goktas, 2016).

It is a well-known fact that language acquisition requires time, patience, and practice. For effective results in learning in foreign language classrooms, students should be able to engage in as many activities as possible to gain a better grasp of the new target language. However, due to restricted classroom time, thus a limited opportunity for practice, teachers may be forced to skip vital aspects of effective foreign language teaching. The flipped classroom method can contribute to language learning outcomes by restricting the instruction to outside the classroom and providing room for additional practices and activities in classroom (Han, 2015). The flipped classroom model is considered to be beneficial in foreign language teaching as it promotes two key points to success:

student-centred learning and autonomy (Amiryousefi, 2017; C¸etin Koro € -glu & C¸akır, 2017; Han, 2015). Chen Hsieh, Wu, and Marek (2017) argued that the flipped classroom method prepares a suitable learning environment for ELT and provides certain benefits. According to the qualitative study by Basal (2015) based on 47 pre-service English teachers’ perceptions, the flipped classroom method in foreign language classrooms is believed to allow for learning at one’s own pace and enhance student preparation, removing time-related issues in the classroom and increasing student engagement. Boyraz and Ocak (2017), on the other hand, studied foreign language learners’ academic success, retention of knowledge and opinions regarding the flipped classroom method and reached conclusions that suggest the superiority of this method over traditional instruction. The participants of the study were also positive about the implementation of this method. Likewise, the study by Amiryousefi (2017) into the impact of the flipped classroom method on language learners’ speaking and listening skills, out-of-class participation and engagement revealed that the method positively influences the students’ learning process of EFL. In the mixed-methods study by Chen Hsieh, Wu, and Marek (2017), conducted with the participation of 48 sophomore students, the conclusions suggested an increase in idiomatic knowledge, student engagement, as well as higher motivation levels among students in flipped classrooms. In another study by Ekmekci (2017), the impact of the flipped classroom method on foreign language learners’ writing skills was investigated. This research, in line with many of the studies in the field, yielded results in favour of the flipped classroom method. Different from the other studies mentioned above, the quasi-experimental study study by Hung (2015) compared a structuredflipped classroom, semi-structured flipped classroom, and non-flipped classroom methods and concluded that semi-structured and structuredflipped classroom methods are more effective.

Despite the growing interest in the flipped classroom method, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the effectiveness of this method in the field of foreign language education. Although there are a number of review articles about the flipped classroom method, none focuses on the use of flipped classroom method in ELT (Betihavas, Bridgman, Kornhaber, & Cross, 2016; Chen, Lui, & Martinelli, 2017; Karabulut-Ilgu, Jaramillo Cherrez, & Jahren, 2018; Lo, Hew, & Chen, 2017; O’Flaherty & Philips, 2015; Presti, 2016; Seery, 2015). The present study is of importance in the field because a systematic review of the findings yielded by the previous studies in the literature can pave the way for future studies and provide an insight for researchers. In addition, of the many studies into the flipped classroom method, only a few were conducted in EFL courses, which requires more research to be undertaken in that area (Amiryousefi, 2017; C¸etin Koro€ -glu & C¸akır, 2017; Ekmekci, 2017; Mehring, 2016). Finally, overall the literature review suggested that there was a lack of research into the advantages and challenges of flipped classrooms in foreign language courses. Therefore, for the purpose of the study, responses to the following research questions were sought:

Research Question 1 (RQ1). What are the trends in flipped classrooms in ELT research?

Research Question 2 (RQ2). What were the main findings from the available literature?

# 2. Method

This study used a systematic review method, which is a literature review based on an explicit research question that determines, through systematic methods, which studies of the existing literature need to be taken into account (Uman, 2011). From systematic reviews, the findings of previous research can be checked for consistency and generalisability to other fields or samples (Mulrow, 1994). The main difference between a systematic review and literature review is the method followed. The former starts in a way that is well-organised in detail (Kowalczyk & Truluck, 2013) with the search for the articles to be reviewed following a precise path and including various available databases. In contrast, literature reviews are generally carried out in a less systematic way and the articles are retrieved from only a few databases (Robinson & Lowe, 2015).

# 2.1. Data collection

On 2 February 2018, a systematic search was conducted in the databases Web of Science, ERIC, Taylor & Francis and Education Full Text EBSCO. These databases were selected since they contain the highest number of education-related studies. The search terms used included ‘flipped classroom and English’, ‘flipped learning and English’, ‘flipped and English’, ‘flipping and English’, ‘flipping classroom and English’, ‘inverted classroom and English’, ‘flipped EFL classroom’, ‘inverted EFL classroom’, ‘flipped classroom and foreign language teaching’, and ‘flipping EFL courses’. Of the results returned, only research studies were taken into account.

# 2.2. Data analysis

All the studies examined in this paper were coded and analysed by two researchers. For the analysis, the researchers followed content analysis method, which is commonly used for textual analyses and allows for comparing, contrasting and categorising the data (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2000). Firstly, a form to record the results of the analysis were created using Microsoft Word. This contained categories related to the research questions, such as the year/place of the study and the advantages and challenges of the flipped classroom method. The form was filled with related information after a careful reading of each article. After completing the form for each study, Microsoft Excel was used for analysis by organising codes and categories. As seen in Table 1, the first research question (RQ1) and related subcategories included descriptive information which is directly stated in the reviewed articles. The second research question (RQ2) and related subcategories, on the other hand, sought detailed information about the reviewed articles. To define the advantages and challenges, the first step was to read all the studies after which the codes and categories were identified.

Our search for articles to be reviewed returned 153 articles from four different databases (Figure 1). Upon removing the duplicates, there were 103 articles to be reviewed. After an examination of the titles and abstracts, 42 of those 103 articles were removed since they were not relevant to ELT and the flipped classroom method. Another three were excluded from the study since they were not written in English. The remaining 58 articles were reviewed for eligibility, and the results showed that four of the studies were not related to ELT. In addition, other four articles included only descriptive information about the flipped classroom method and were not scientific research studies. In seven of the articles, the flipped classroom was not the focus of the research, and thus they were removed from the present study. After the above-mentioned process, there finally remained a total of 43 studies to be reviewed.

To ensure inter-rater reliability, 20 randomly chosen articles were separately coded by the two researchers. Two code sets were then analysed through SPSS to determine Cohen’s Kappa coefficient value, which was found to be 0.73. According to Viera and Garrett (2005), values between 0.61 and 0.80 indicate optimal agreement between researchers.

# 3.1. Trends in flipped classroom and ELT literature

In response to RQ1, the subcategories examined by the authors included the distribution of the studies by year, research methods used, education levels of the participants, and the distribution of the countries where the studies were conducted. The following section covers descriptions of each category.

# Distribution of the studies by years

The distribution of studies referring to the flipped classroom method in ELT by years is shown in Figure 2. The first research into area was published in 2014 $\left( \mathbf { n } = 1 \right)$ ), after which there was an increase in the number of the studies. Since the cut-off date was 2 February 2018, only 1 article was included.

# Research methods used in the reviewed articles

As shown in Figure 3, the most commonly used research method was the mixed method $( \mathtt { n } = 1 9 )$ ), closely followed by the quantitative method

$[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1 8 ]$ . The least commonly used methods were the qualitative method $( \mathtt { n } = 3 )$ ) and literature review $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 \right)$ ).

# The education levels of the samples in the articles

Figure 4 reveals that the vast majority of articles $( 8 5 \% )$ selected university students as the sample, followed by K-12 students, $( 1 0 \% )$ and the remaining groups were teachers $( 2 \% )$ and EFL and ESL learners with various backgrounds $( 3 \% )$ .

# Countries of the reviewed articles

Most of the studies investigating the flipped classroom method in ELT were conducted in Taiwan $[ \mathtt { n } = 1 2 ^ { \cdot }$ ) and China $( \mathtt { n } = 9 )$ , with a number of studies carried out in Turkey $( \mathbf { n } = 5 )$ ) and Arabia $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ (Figure 5). There was a good range of countries in which studies into flipped classroom method in the ELT field were implemented.

# 3.2. The main findings of the flipped classroom and EFL teaching literature

For the purpose of answering RQ2, the following subcategories were defined and examined by the researchers: studied basic skills, advantages, challenges, and the effectiveness of the flipped classroom method in ELT. In the following section, the subcategories are described in detail.

# Studied basic language skills

Of all the 43 articles, only 23 directly stated which language proficiency skills they investigated which were speaking $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ , writing $\left( \mathrm { n } = 6 \right)$ , grammar knowledge $( \mathrm { n } = 5 )$ ), listening $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ , reading $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 \right)$ , vocabulary knowledge $\left( \mathbf { n } = 1 \right)$ ), and idiomatic knowledge $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = \boldsymbol { \mathrm { 1 } } ]$ (Figure 6).

of learners $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = \boldsymbol { \mathrm { 1 1 } }$ ), enhancing learners’ speaking skills $( \mathtt { n } = 7 )$ ), enhancing peer interactions $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 6 )$ ), and increasing learning achievement of learners $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = \boldsymbol { 6 } )$ ).

# Challenges of implementing the flipped classroom in ELT

Although numerous advantages were attributed to the use of the flipped classroom method in the ELT field, the process might not be as smooth as expected, and Table 3 reveals the most commonly reported challenges as extra workload for learners $( \mathbf { n } = 7 )$ ) and technology/Internet related problems $( \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = \boldsymbol { 6 } )$ ).

# Flipped clasroom effectiveness in ELT

As shown in Table 4, a total of 21 articles measured the effectiveness of the flipped classroom method by comparing it with traditional teaching or through pre-test and post-test. Eighteen of 21 studies found out that the flipped classroom method is an effective teaching method in ELT. One of the studies was inconclusive since both positive and negative results were obtained, and two studies concluded that the flipped classroom method makes no difference in ELT.

# 4. Discussion

In this study, 43 articles retrieved from Web of Science, Eric, Taylor & Francis and Education Full Text EBSCO were analysed in terms of their trends and main findings. The analysis showed a rapid increase in the number of the articles on the use of the flipped classroom method in

ELT since 2014. The rising number of studies might be attributed to the growing popularity of this method and certain advantages it offers. It can be seen that there has been an intense interest in the topic particularly in the last two years, which suggests increased popularity in the coming years. In the analysed articles, the most commonly used research methods were found to be mixed and quantitative methods, which might be due to the impetus to thoroughly examine the effects of the flipped classroom method. Although the proportion of the mixed methods and quantitative studies is high, such studies are scarce in the literature. For instance, our search retrieved 43 available studies that fulfilled the criteria for review in the current research. However, 21 of the 43 reviewed studies provided empirical data pertaining to the effects of the flipped classroom method, which suggests that there is still a lack of research in the field.

In the examined studies, the most common sample group consisted of university students, with a lower number of studies undertaken with K12 students and other participants. Parallel to this finding, Lo and Hew (2017) also commented on the lack of flipped classrooms research with K-12 students not only in ELT but also in other fields. The review studies in the literature also indicate that in research into educational technologies the participants are generally chosen from university-level students (Kucuk et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012). The reason for this might be the fact that university students are easier to access and are expected to show greater abilities in self-regulation.

However, the effect of the flipped classroom method which is believed to be beneficial in the field of ELT needs to be further investigated in K12 EFL classrooms. This systematic review revealed a number of studies into the flipped classroom method in ELT in a wide range of countries, with Taiwan hosting to the highest number of studies. Conducting more studies on the use of flipped classroom method in EFL courses in countries with different cultures and educational trends can offer valuable insight into the topic.

By removing the lecturing part of teaching from the classroom, a flipped classroom naturally allows for extra time for application and interaction facilities in the classroom. Thus, this may lead to greater opportunities to enhance learning, particularly with the help of additional feedback provided to the learners (Hall & DuFrene, 2016). In the systematically reviewed articles in the current study, the most commonly investigated language skills included speaking and writing. Such studies, however, are still rather scarce in in the literature. Future research may provide valuable insight into the effective use of the flipped classroom method by reporting on the improvement of the basic language skills in flipped classrooms.

This review revealed various benefits provided by the flipped classroom method in the field of foreign language learning and teaching. The most commonly reported benefit is increased student engagement, which can be attributed to the nature of the flipped classroom method that encourages active learning (Roehl, Reddy, & Shannon, 2013; Jensen, Kummer, & Godoy, 2015).

The flexible nature of the flipped classroom method allows diverse needs in the classroom to be met by providing learners with extra time out of classroom and helping teachers understand the aspects in which their students need further reinforcement (Marks, 2015). Therefore, positive outcomes of flipped classrooms come as no surprise. The reviewed articles in this study also confirm that flipping in EFL classrooms boosts the courses from several aspects, with the main findings indicating that this method helps learners improve their speaking proficiency, peer interaction, and overall learning achievement.

However, the process of flipping EFL classrooms might incur difficulties. In the reviewed studies, the reported challenges include extra workload for students and internet/technology related problems. These findings are in line with the results of the study by Karabulut-Ilgu, Jaramillo Cherrez, and Jahren (2018). Other reported challenges and disadvantages include extra workload for teachers and increased writing anxiety among students.

The examination of the studies comparing the flipped classroom method and traditional teaching revealed the superiority of the flipped classroom method. The studies measuring the impact of the flipped classroom method on students’ learning through pre and post-test also concluded that the method enhances EFL learning process. In this study, the effect of the flipped classroom method was only qualitatively investigated. A meta-analysis could have led to more conclusive and informed findings. However, in the reviewed comparative studies different language skills were analysed, which prevented a meta-analysis. Therefore, a meta-analysis can be conducted in the future when the number of studies in the field increases.

The findings of this study can help teachers and researchers develop ideas regarding the practices of the flipped classroom in education. First, based on the findings, a flipped English classroom can enhance engagement, thus may offer benefits by increasing the engagement rate in the classroom, particularly where attendance is not compulsory. Students have a higher chance of developing autonomy when they take the responsibility to learn the content of the course before coming to the classroom. Flipping the classroom also paves the way for differentiated education since all learners can be exposed to the content prior to courses as they wish. Therefore, instructors can opt for flipping their courses, particularly if there is a wide range of diverse student needs in their classrooms (Siegle, 2014). In addition, by maximising the quality time spent in the classroom, the flipped classroom method is likely to positively influence learners’ overall achievement (DeRuisseau, 2016). However, making sudden changes in the way learners are taught may receive initial resistance (Homma, 2015). The curriculum should be redesigned to incorporate a smooth transition from conventional teaching methods. Furthermore, the teachers who introduce flipped EFL classrooms should know how the method works and what should be accomplished prior to the start of flipped courses. For the best learning outcomes among students, the recorded flipped course videos should be interesting and interactive so that learners do not get bored (Schmidt & Ralph, 2016).

# 5. Conclusion

Briefly, this study is significant in that it is the first review study on the use of the flipped classroom method in ELT. This study is also expected to guide researchers who want to conduct studies into the flipping EFL classroom. Finally, based on the findings of the study, the following suggestions are given.

# 5.1. Recommendations for future research

Further experimental studies on the effect of the flipped classroom method on EFL education should be undertaken. In addition, qualitative studies are necessary to provide insight into the use of flipped classroom method in EFL classrooms.   
There need to be more studies into implementing flipped EFL classrooms with K-12 student participants.   
In future research, the effect of the flipped EFL classroom on EFL learners’ grammar knowledge, listening skills, reading skills, and vocabulary knowledge should be examained.

# 5.2. Recommendations for practitioners

Instructors who are willing to transit from a traditional classroom to a flipped EFL classroom should gather information as to how this method works before starting their application. Flipping EFL courses might put an extra burden on instructors; therefore, cooperation with other instructors acquainted with the

flipped classroom method can reduce extra time and energy being expended.   
Instructors are advised to maximise the benefits of flipped EFL classrooms by taking learners’ needs into consideration before engaging in the detailed planning of their courses.   
The flipped classroom method requires the use of technological tools. Therefore, instructors need to ensure that both instructors and students have access to the needed technology.
