The study examined the frequency and accuracy of four discourse competence (DC) parameters (i. e., establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow, stance display, engagement with readers, and mastery of knowledge of discourse structure) in Hong Kong English-as-a-secondlanguage (ESL) secondary students' disciplinary research reports. The results showed that: (1) elements of establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow constituted, on average, less than $9 \%$ of the reports' length, with mean accuracy rates ranging from $6 4 . 3 1 ~ \%$ to $8 0 . 3 3 \% \cdot$ (2) elements of stance display constituted, on average, no more than $3 \%$ of the reports' length, with mean accuracy rates ranging from $5 8 . 3 3 \%$ to $9 8 . 1 7 \ \%$ (3) elements of engagement with readers constituted, on average, no more than $2 \%$ of the reports' length, with mean accuracy rates ranging from $3 3 . 3 3 \%$ to $8 8 . 6 4 ~ \%$ (4) the mean accuracy rates of mastery of knowledge of discourse structure ranged from $0 \%$ to $1 0 0 ~ \%$ The findings reveal the secondary students' DC in disciplinary research writing and pinpoint weak areas that instructors can work on. The proposed DC framework forms a foundation for future research on DC in discipline-specific research writing.

# 1. Introduction

Disciplinary writing performance contributes greatly to secondary students' academic suces in Hong Kong (Lo & Jeong, 2018; Tsang, 2020), where content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approaches have been adopted in many secondary schools (Kan & Adamson, 2010). In Hong Kong CLIL programmes, students must be equipped with discipline-specific academic writing skill to complete their disciplinary writing tass (Qiu et al., 2022; Tsang, 2020). However, evidence showing problems in disciplinary research papers written by Hong Kong English-as-a-second-language (ESL) tertiary students (Toraskar & Lee, 2016) indicates that many Hong Kong ESL secondary students have dificulties in ESL disciplinary research writing, and suggests a need for reearch attention to how Hong Kong secondary students perform in their ESL disciplinary research writing. Such research could help Hong Kong secondary school instructors develop more effective approaches to improving their students' ESL disciplinary writing performance.

Producing satisfactory disciplinary writing requires high levels of discourse competence (DC) (Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b). DC involves the knowledge and skills needed to manage linguisic features and semantic functions within a text (or a context) beyond forms and functions at the word and sentence levels" (Canale & Swain, 1980; Harris 1952; Hymes, 1972; Paltridge, 2012; as cited in

Wang & Xie, 2022a, p. 1), and is a major contributor to the inguistic complexity and contextual appropriateness of written text (Canale & Swain, 1980; Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b). However, a high frequency of the use of DC elements does not necessarily mear that a writer has achieved high-level DC in academic writing (Wang & Xie, 2022a). Therefore, research is needed to examine both how. often and how well DC elements are reflected in Hong Kong ESL secondary students' disciplinary research writing.

This study calculated the frequency and accuracy rates of DC parameters (establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow, stance display, engagement with readers, and mastery of knowledge of discourse structure) in Hong Kong ESL secondary students disciplinary research writing. The following research questions were addressed:

(1) How frequently and how accurately are elements f establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow displayed in Hong Kong ESL secondary students' disciplinary research writing?   
(2) How frequently and how accurately are elements of stance display reflected in Hong Kong ESL secondary students' disciplinary research writing?   
(3) How frequently and how acurately are elements of engagement with readers shown in Hong Kong ESL secondary students disciplinary research writing?   
(4) How frequently and how accurately are elements of mastery of knowledge of discourse structure displayed in Hong Kong ESL secondary students' disciplinary research writing?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Theoretical underpinnings of discourse competence

Major contributors to DC include coherence and cohesion within a discourse structure (e.g., Canale & Swain, 1980; Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b). For example, as early as the 1980s, discourse competence was defined as \*mastery of how to combine and interpret meanings and forms to achieve a unified text in different modes by using (a) cohesion device to relate forms and (b) coherence rules to organise meanings" (Canale & Swain, 1980, p. 39). More recently, global coherence, local coherence, and logical connectives have been identified as components in DC rubrics (e.g., Wang & Xie, 2022a). Global coherence refers to an overalldiscourse organisation (Wang & Xie, 2022a); local coherence relates to old-to-new information flows within texts (Wang & Xie, 2022a); logical connectives refer to how complex and precise the use of linking words and phrases can be (Wang & Xie, 2022a).

Coherence, defined as "underlying relations that hold between assertions (or propositions) and how they contribute to the overall discourse theme (or macro-structure)" (Grabe, 1984, p. 110), involves three characteristics (Grabe, 1984, pp. 110-111):

a. having a discourse theme;   
b. comprisig a set of relevant asertions relating logicall to one another by means of subordination (cause, condition, comparison, specification, etc.), coordination, and superordination; and   
c. being organised by an information structure imposed on the assrtions to guide the reader in most ffectively understanding the theme or the intent of the author (theme-rheme, given-new, focus-presupposition).

Here, cohesion refers to the "means available in the surface forms of the text to signal relations that hold between sentences or clausal units in the text (Grabe, 1984, p. 110). To build a smooth old-to-new information flow within a text (Swales & Feak, 2013), writers may adopt a range of cohesive devices, including \*reference, substitution, ellipsis conjunction, lexical cohesion, and conventions governing the ordering of old or new information in a discourse (Bachman, 1990, as cited in Wang & Xie, 2022a, p. 2).

In addition to a smooth old-to-new information flow within a discourse (Canale & Swain, 1980; Ehrlich, 1988), reader-writer interactions are regarded as major contributors to DC (Chalhoub-Devill, 2003; Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b). Reader-writer in. teractions, which involve stance and engagement (Hyland, 2005), emphasise how writers use various discourse markers to present their positions and engage with their readers (Wang & Xie, 2022a).

Therefore, DC involves a smooth old-to-new information flow, reader-writer interactions (i., stance, engagement), and knowl. edge of discourse structure (Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b). These concepts are discussed in the following subsections.

# 2.1.1. Establishment of a smooth old-to-new flow of information

Flow in a text means \*moving from one statement in a text to the next (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 30). Swales and Feak (2013) provided the following tips for building a smooth flow of ideas in a text:

(1) Placing relevant \*old' information in early position establishes acontent connection backward and provides forward content link that establishes the context' (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 31);   
(2) \*starting a text with some familiar information In the following sentence, you can repeat some information from the previous sentence (exact repetition, in the form of a synonym or variation on the part of speech)' (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 32);   
(3) "using this/these $^ +$ a noun, which refers back to some or all of the preceding sentence" (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 32);   
(4) \*repetition and linking words and phrases can help a writer maintain flow and establish clear relationships between ideas"(Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 37).

In summary, a smooth old-to-new flow of information can be established by putting old information in an earlier position, using referential and linking words and phrases, and repeating previously mentioned information (Swales & Feak, 2013).

# 2.1.2. Reader-writer interactions

The theoretical foundation of researching reader-writer interactions in written discourses is an interaction model that was put forward by Hyland (2005, 2008). Viewing successful academic writing \*as a persuasive endeavour involving interaction between writers and readers"(Hyland, 2005, p.173), the interaction model consists of stance and engagement (Hyland, 2005, 2008). Stance a writer-oriented dimension, refers to how writers convey their atitudes through stance markers (Hyland, 2005, 2008). Engagement, a reader-oriented dimension, refers to how writers interact with their readers through engagement markers (Hyland, 2005, 2008) Specificall, to display a stance, writers may use hedges, boosters, atitde markers, and self-mention Hyland, 205, 2008). To engage with readers, writers may use reader pronouns, appeals to shared knowledge, directives, reader-oriented questions, and personal asides (Hyland, 2005, 2008). Definitions of these terms are provided in Table 1.

# 2.1.3. Knowledge of discourse structure

Numerous scholars (.g., in & Evans, 2012) have studied discourse patterns in research writing of varied academic disciplines. One of the most nfluential frameworks of discourse patterns i wale's (1990) Introduction-Method-Results-Discussin (IMRD) structure. Swale's (1990) IMRD framework has provided a theoretical basis for move analysis of disciplinary research writing (e.g., Tessut, 2015) as well as the development of scientific writig rubrics (e.g., Kelly-Laubscher et al., 2017). Nevertheless, IMRD i not the most common pattrn of many empirical research papers (Lin & Evans, 2012). Lin and Evans (2012) found that the Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion-Conclusion (IMRDC) pattern appears in empirical artices more frequently than does the IMRD patern. This finding indicates that the conclusion section is an important independent section in existing empirical articles of different disciplines (Lin & Evans, 2012).

However, disciplinary differences exist in the discourse patterns of research papers (Gardner & Nesi, 2013; Lin & Evans, 2012) According to Lin and Evans (2012), the IMRDC pattern is frequently used in paper of applied science and engineering, whil the Introduction-Literature Review-Method-Results-Discussion-Conclusion (ILMRDC) format is commonly adopted by social sciences researchers.

The IMRDC pattern i consistent with the structure of students laboratory reports required by science/engineering classooms in many regions, such as the Us (Riley et al., 2021) and Malaysia (Veerappan et al., 2023). For example, as recommended by Hong Kong Education Bureau (Education Bureau, 2020, p. 17-18), an experiment report consists of Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. Therefore, Hong Kong secondary students need to show the following information in their reports of scientific experimental work (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2009): (1) research objectives; (2) research design and its rationale; (3) data collection and analysis procedures; (4) display of findings; (5) discussion of the findings; (6) conclusion.

Normally consisting of introduction, methods/methodology, results/findings, discussion, and conclusion sections (Hong Kong Examinations and Assesment Authority, 2009; Swales & Feak, 2013), a research report typically follows a general-specific (GS) structure, meaning that it \*involves movement from broader statements to more specific ones' (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 55)

Each section in a research report is divided into several moves fllowing the GS structure. An introductory section normally in cludes  short or extndd deintion, a enealization or urose statement, statement of fact, or some interesting sttitics (wales & Feak, 2013, p.55). General statements refer to facts as well as broad statements made about a topic that are usually, but not necessarily always, true" (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 61), and an extended definition "usually begins with a general, one-sentence definition and then becomes more specific as additional details are provided" (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 74). A methodology section typically entails seven moves: research overview, research settings, research objectives, participants, research instruments, data collection and analysis procedure, as wel as justificationfor the methods (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authorit, 2009, Peacock, 2011). Following the methodology section, the results section normally conss of a report of the key findings (., location statements, comparison statements), an explanation of the findings, and comments on the data (Swales & Feak, 2013). The discussion section entails two obligatory moves: "Summarizing and reporting key results (Swales & Feak, 2013 p. 368) and Commenting onthe key results (making claims, explaining the results, comparing the new work with the previous studies, ffering alternative explanations)" (Swales & Feak, 2013, p. 368). Finall, aconclusion section typically entails three moves: a summary of the key findings, a presentation of the study's limitations, and recommendations and implications for future research (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2009; Swales & Feak, 2013).

# 2.2. Empirical research into discourse competence

Numerous studies have been conducted on how frequently various discourse features are reflected in texts, such as the respective frequencies of various discourse markers of reader-writer interactions in academic discourses (e.g., Luzon, 2023; McGrath & Kuteea, 2012; Qiu & Jiang, 2021) andfferences in the use of DC components between first language (L1) and second language (L2) academic written discourses (e.g., Lee & Deakin, 2016).

Many studies on the frequency of DC components (e.g., Livytska, 2019; Takimoto, 2015) have used published research articles as major data sources. For example, Soylu et al. (2023) found that experienced L2 writers of research papers in the field of teacher education tended to use attitude markers about importance and evaluation. Such studies may enable early carer researchers to develop a clearer understanding of how to incorporate various linguistic devices into their research articles for publication. However, because L2 writer of published research artices are normally equipped with advanced levels of L2 academic language proficiency, research on ublishd reearch papers may not reflect the problems present i reearch reorts written b les experic writers who struggle with L2 academic writing. Therefore, more research attention should be paid to L2 students' unpublished research papers to identify problems and inform relevant instructional practices.

Because research into the frequency of DC components may not accurately reflect levels of discourse competence, a growing number f researchers (e.g., Wang & Xie, 2022a, 2022b) have developed assessment rubrics to (1) count the frequency of at least one DC component and (2) assess whether the use of at least one of the DC components is appropriate. For example, to asess the per. formance of reader-writer interactions in L2 argumentative writing, Zha0 (2012, 2019) developed an analytic rubric based on Hyland's (2005) model of interaction. However, Zhao's studies involve two major limitations: (1)she failed toasses the performance of other DC components (e.g., the construction of a given-new flow of ideas) and (2) her rubric was developed for asessing L2 argumentative essays rather than discipline-specific L2 academic writing. Wang and Xie (2022a) addressed these limitations by developing a more comprehensive rubric for asessing DC components in academic writing in social sciences. Wang and Xie's (2022a) analytic rubric fr DC takes al of the DC components into consideration and helps readers understand how to asess whether these components are accurately used.

As few studies have assessed DC in ESL secondary students' disciplinary research writing, this study focused on discourse competence in science research rports writen by Hong Kong secondary students, for the following reasons. irst, this genre commonly appears in high-stakes examinations, such as school-based asessment (SBA) in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDsE), which greatly influences many bilingual secondary students' educational achievements. Second, this is a prevalent type of academic writing for preparing the students' future undergraduate studies (Paltridge, 2004). Therefore, to help educational practitioners develop their students academic writing skill, it i important to conduct research into the respective frequency and accuracy rates of DC elements present in disciplinary research writing.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Participants and research setting

The study described in this paper is part of a larger research project about the influences of a genre-based approach on discipline specific research report writing performance of secondary students in Hong Kong English-medium instruction (EMI) programmes.

Twenty science reearch reports used for this study were collcted from twenty junior secondary students, whose first language (L1) is Cantonese. Aged between 13 and 14, these second-year junior secondary students were recruited from seven Hong Kong secondary schools, where Eis implemented i their science classrooms. Among the seven participatig schools, four schools are ranked Band 1 (top level), while the other thre schools are ranked Band 2 (intermediat evel). Normally students in Band 1 schools receive EMI in all subjects; students in Band 2 schoos rceive a mixture of Chinese-medium instruction (CMI) and EMI; students in Band 3 schools receive instruction mostly through Chinese. Therefore, the participants reequipped with above-average academic achievements , reaching at least medium-level Chinese writing competence and English proficiency) for writing scientific reports in English.

Science research reports, a type of disciplinary research writing, are normall used for assessments in the participants' science classes due to two main reasons. First, scientific investgations, such as laboratory experiments, are required in science classrooms of Hong Kong secondary schools. During the scientific investigation processes, students need to think about research questions, propose hypotheses, design their research, conduct data collection and analyses, write reports for presenting and discussing findings, draw conclusions, and propose suggestions for future research (The Curriculum Development Council, 2017). Second, SBA constitutes part of HKDSE. HKDsE is a high-stakes public examination for Hong Kong final-year secondary students. Different from traditional paper-based tests, SBA can asses secondary students' abilit to conduct scientific investigations (eg, laboratory experiments) and write research reports (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2023).

Considering the importance of science research reports, students at the participating schools are required to submit at least one science research report with in-text citations and a reference ist by the end of a semester. Science research report writig constitutes less than $3 0 ~ \%$ of the final assessments for the participants' science classes. Despite some differences in the science writing rubrics among the participating schoos, science reearch report writing is evaluated in terms four dimensions: subject knowledge,citations and referencing, structure, and language use.

Before the data collection of the present study, the scienc teacher atthe participating schools did not tech their students the sils of citations, referencing, and science reearch report writig. Instead, they provided their students with sample reports that included citations and reference lis. The English language teachers at the participating schools also told the principal investigator that they tended to teach narrative and argumentative writing rather than the skill of citations, referencing, and disciplinary research report writing.

During the data colection period, the participants were invited to conduct an experimental study withclassmates on the effect of music and then to write a science research report on this topic independently. Before submission of this report, the participants received 12-week instruction on science research report writing, during which the research team taught language features tis on citations and referencing, as well as macro- and micro-structure of science research reports.

After collcting and analysing data from the research into music efects the participants were given at least four weeks for writing the report. They were allowed to accessthe internet, write their report independently, and submit a soft copy of the report to the principal investigator. Finall, the submitted report ranged from 129 to 723 words in length. A report written by Participant No. 19 is provided in Appendix B.

# 3.2. Data analysis procedures

A DC coding framework (Appendix A) was developed to code the elements of the four DC parameters: (1) establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow, (2) stance display, (3) engagement with readers, and (4) mastery of knowledge of discourse structure.

This study incorporated lists of linking words and phrases proposed by Wang and Xie (2022a) into the DC coding framework to identify elements ofa smooth old-to-new information flow, such as lingustic markers of cause (e.g., because of) and concesson e., 'even if').

According to Wang and Xie (2022a), a required DC component is the notion of reader-writer interactions. Therefore, Hyland's (2005) interactional model was used as the theoretical foundation for stance display and engagement with readers. As mentioned above, stance display consists of hedges, boosters, atitude markers, and self-mention (Hyland, 2005), and engagement with readers consists of reader pronouns, directives, appeals to shared knowledge, and reader-oriented questions (Hyland, 2005). Although Hyland (2005) considered personal asides to be a component of engagement, they were excluded from this study's data analysis because the English language instructorsa the participating schools did not encourage their students to include personal asides in different types of English writing.

Based on discussions with experienced science teachers and English language instructors as wellas with reference to previous literature, the research team determined the structural elements by taking the academic writing guidelines recommended by Swale and Feak (2013) and Hong Kong education authoritie (Education Bureau, 2020; Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2009) into account. For example, as shown in Appendix A, defintions are considered to be adiscourse structure element i a typical science research report's introduction section.

After coding the elements of each DC parameter in each of the 20 research report, the authors calculated the respective frequency of each element. For the first three parameters (i., establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow, stance display, and engagement with readers), the frequency of each element was determined by the following formula:

t frequency $=$ number of element instances $\div$ number of words in a report.

For example, if there were 10 boosters in a 1000-word report, the frequency of boosters was calculated as $1 0 \div 1 0 0 0 = 1 \ \%$

For the fourth parameter (i., mastery of knowledge of discourse structure), the frequency of an element was calculated on entence-level basis using the following formula:

element frequency $=$ number of element instances $\div$ number of sentences in a report.

To calculate the accuracy rates of the elements of the four DC parameters, the following formula was u lement accuracy $=$ number of appropriate element instances $\div$ total number of element instances.

The criteria for determining whether the elements of the four DC parameters were used appropriately in the reports were: (1) linguistic accuracy, (2) formal academic language tyle, (3) accurate expression of intended meanings, (4) consistency with adjacent sentences, and (5) relevance to the writing topic and the discourse contexts, with the fourth parameter (i.e, mastery of knowledge of discourse structure) also including accurate citations of sources. The use of an element was considered to be inappropriate or inacurate if one of these criteria was not met.

There are two main reasons for considering citation use in thescience research reports: (1) HKDSE requires students to cite sources properly in the research reports for SBA (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, 2023); (2) research writing normally involves appropriate citations (Swales & Feak, 2013).

Extract 1 below gives an example of a participant's description of data collection and analysis procedures in his/her completed study. Instead of using a simple past tense for describing the procedures this participant wrote an incomplete sentence, which is considered to be inappropriat. However, the uses of third, the', and their' were appropriate because they satisfied the above criteria.

To ensure high levels of inter-coder reliability, two coders participated in the coding processes. Coder A, a doctoral degree holder with more than six years of English-medium postgraduate research experience, was responsible for coding the DC parameters in the 20 reports and calculating their frequencies. Afer finishing the coding independently, Coder A trained Coder B to do the coding and calculation. Coder B, who holds a master's degree in English Language Education, coded the DC elements in $2 0 ~ \%$ of the reports.

The intra-rater reliability of the coding results was calculated using the intraclasscorrlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC value of above 0.75 indicates a high level of agreement (Ko0 & Li, 2016). There were high levels of agreement on the coding of the DC parameters, as evinced by the following ICC values: establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow $( \mathrm { I C C } = 1 . 0 $ , stance display $( \mathrm { I C C } = 1 . 0 ) $ , engagement with readers $\mathrm { ( I C C = } 0 . 9 8 $ , and mastery of knowledge of discourse structure $( \mathrm { I C C } = 0 . 8 3 )$

After determining the frequencies of the DC parameters, the two coders decided whether the DC parameters were accurately reflected in the reports. Coder firs independently calculated the accuracy rate of each DC parameter in the report, and then Coder A randomly selected four reports for these calculations. There were high levels of agrement on the accuracy rates of the DC parameters: establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow $( \mathrm { I C C } = 0 . 8 8 )$ , stance display $( \mathrm { I C C } = 0 . 8 0 )$ , engagement with readers $\mathrm { ( I C C = }$ 0.89), and mastery of knowledge of discourse structure $( \mathrm { I C C } = 0 . 8 6 )$ . Any disagreements over the coding results were addressed and resolved through discussion.

# 4. Findings and discussion

This section presents and discusses the findings regarding the mean frequencies and average accuracy rates of the DC parameters.

4.1. Establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow

Table 2 presents how frequently and how accurately an old-to-new information flow was built through various types of cohesive devices.

4.1.1. Establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow: frequency

Table 2 shows that with the exceptions of referential ties $( M = 8 . 4 9 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 1 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and numerical/continuation/conclusion linguistic markers $( M = 1 . 1 8 ~ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 9 4 _ { . }$ , each of the cohesive devices used to establish a smooth old-to-new information flow constituted on average less than $1 \ \%$ of the reports' length.

Table 2 reveals that, on average, referential ties were the most frequently appearing element used to establish a smooth old-to-new information flow. In the reports inguisic markers of referential ties, such as the', this, they', them' and it, were used to \*point back to earlier parts of the text to establish cohesion'(Lee et al., 2021, p. 4).

Table 2 also shows that, on average, numerical/continuation/conclusion linguistic markers were the second most frequently used elements of the establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow. Moreover, the mean frequency of addition/repetition/simi larity/exemplification use $( M = 0 . 9 0 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 7 3$ ) was similar to that of contrast/concession use $( M = 0 . 5 2 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ Discourse markers of emphasis and of cause/result/purpose/condition made up, on average, less than $0 . 5 ~ \%$ of the reports' length.

1.1.2. Establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow: accuracy

Table 2 shows the average accuracy rates of the elements of establishment of a smooth old-to-new information flow. All of the elements in this parameter had mean accuracy rates of more than $6 0 ~ \%$ On average, the linguistic markers of cause/result/purpose/ condition were the most acurately used elements in this parameter, and the inguistic markers of addition/repetition/similarity/ exemplification were the least accurately used elements in this parameter.

The participants' weak skill with respect to language formality required in academic writing was also the main cause of the inappropriate use f inguistic markers of addition/repetition/similarity/exemplification. For instance, many of the participants used 'And' at the beginning of sentences to add detail of the information provided in previous sentences. However, using 'And' at the beginning of sentence, as shown in Extract 2, s considered to be informal, with Moreover or Furthermore being acceptable formal alternatives.

# Extract 2.

And (A) this interview is going to investigate people's perceptions of the effect of music on their bodies. And (A) to test the body's reaction to music at different tempos.

A possble explanation for the observed ignorance of formal language use is that English language teaching in Hong Kong secondar! schools may prioritise daily communicative purposes of English language use (Lo & Lin, 2019). Therefore, many ESL students in Hon Kong may have insufficient knowledge of language formality.

Although the mean accuracy rate of referential ties reached $7 9 . 2 9 \%$ it is worth mentioning that the redundant use of 'the' was a common problem among the 20 reports in this study. According to Ong (2011), the redundant use of the' can be regarded as \*un. necessary addition (p. 49), which occurs when a particular cohesive device is used unnecesaril or redundantly in the text (Ong, 2011, p. 49). Some of the participants may have failed to comprehend that the is used only when there is a need to refer to already mentioned information (Ong, 2011). For instance, in Extract 3, the second the' was considered to be inappropriate and redundant because it was the first time that this writer mentioned volunteers. A possible explanation for this finding is the influence of the participants' L1, as there are differences in the use of articles between English and Cantonese (Chan, 2004).

Prepare two songs, a piece of fast pop music and one piece of classical music. Before starting the $\textcircled{1}$ experiment, make sure that the $\textcircled{1}$ volunteers are calm and have been resting for at least five minutes.

# 4.2. Stance display

Table 3 displays how frequently and how accurately the participants used the elements of stance display in their writing.

# 4.2.1. Stance display: frequency

Table 3 shows how frequently the participants demonstrated their stance through hedges, boosters, atitude markers, and self mention. On average, the most frequently appearing element of stance display was self-mention $( M = 2 . 5 1 \ \% )$ $S D = 0 . 0 1 6 9 _ { . }$ . This statistical finding may be due to the participants' prior English writing training. Self-mentions are often regarded as an indicator of informal language in academic writtendiscourses (Yoon, 2021), and impersonal writing is usuall involved in experimental science papers for showing objectivity (Khedri & Kritis 2020; Parkinson, 2019). However, the participants previous English writing training may not have strengthened their awarenessof reducing the use of self-mention in ESL science research writing. Since primary chool, Hong Kong schoo students rceive training more on narrative writing and persuasive writing than on disciplinary research writing (Bai, 2021). The English language instructor at the participating schoos also mentioned that their English writing instruction tended to focus more on narrative and argumentative writing than on disciplinary research report writing. Frequent use of first-person pronouns may be shown in narrative texts (Sandiford & Macken-Horarik, 2020) and persuasive writing (MacIntyre, 2019), but this may not be advocated in research writing of experimental science disciplines (Parkinson, 2019).

Table 3 reveals that on average, hedges were the second most frequently used element of stance display $( M = 1 . 2 9 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 6 2  \it$ with each report showing at least one hedge. The most frequently used hedges were can', may', 'might', and could. They were used in the introduction, result, discussion, and conclusion sections of the reorts to indicate the participants' lack of confidence in ther assertions. owever, the participants should have used more hedges in the reults and icussion sections to comment on their data and explain their findings more objectively, as their findings were based on data collected from a small sample. If their data had been gathered from a larger sample, they may have generated different findings. Therefore, the participants could have used more hedges to decrease the certainty levels in their comments on their data and their explanations of their findings.

Extract 3.   
Table 3 Stance display: Frequencies and accuracy rates.   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Element</td><td colspan="4">Frequency</td><td rowspan="2">Accuracy rate</td></tr><tr><td>Min.</td><td>Max.</td><td>M</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Hedges</td><td>0.51 %</td><td>2.78 %</td><td>1.29 %</td><td>0.0062</td><td>98.17 %</td></tr><tr><td>Boosters</td><td>0</td><td>1.02 %</td><td>0.17 %</td><td>0.0031</td><td>58.33 %</td></tr><tr><td>Attitude markers</td><td>0</td><td>0.68 %</td><td>0.18 %</td><td>0.0020</td><td>89.58 %</td></tr><tr><td>Self-mention</td><td>0</td><td>5.44 %</td><td>2.51 %</td><td>0.0169</td><td>92.84 %</td></tr></table></body></html>

The participants' insufficient use of hedges in their results and discussion sections may have been due to two reasons: (1) Hong Kong school students have extensive experience in producing fact-based narrative writing (Bai, 2021), which may involve only a few hedges, so they may not be accustomed to employing many hedging devices in writing; (2) preferences for certainty over argumentation are normall reflected in Chinese discourses (Chen & Zhang, 2017; Hu & Cao, 2011; Lee, 2020), so the Chinese-speaking participants may tend to use few hedges in their writing.

Table 3 shows that attitude markers constituted, on average, only $0 . 1 8 \%$ of each report's length. Most of the attitude markers were used in the form of evaluative adjectives and evaluative adverbs (1) to describe the participants' atitudes towards music in their introduction sections and (2) to comment on their data and findings in their results and discussion sections. However, more atitude markers should have been used for commenting on research contrbutions and providing implications in their conclusion sections.

The low frequency of the use of attitude markers may have been due to the nature of the discipline (Hyland, 1998). As the par. ticipants were required to analyseempirical data from an experimental science study, this may have reduced the frequency of atitude markers in ther reports relative to that in witing relatd to philosophy or other ure soft disciline (e.g, litratre, history). Artices in pure soft disciplines, which involve relatively ittle empirical data, require more personal evaluations and interpretations (Hyland, 1998) than do research reports in science, which normally involve the analysis of empirical data.

As Table 3 shows, on average, the least frequently appearing element of stance display was boosters $( M = 0 . 1 7 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 3 1$ The low frequency of booster use may have been due to the participants' awareness of the nature of their data. Boosters are used to "show full commtment or ertainty and leave littl room for disagrement (Aull, 2019, p. 270). Sciece reearch reports, which ofen involve the analys of empirical data collected from a specific sample of subject, may display a low frequency of boosters because the empirical findings may not be generalisable to other research setings. Therefore, writers need to be careful in thir use of boosters when writing empirical research reports.

# 4.2.2. Stance display: accuracy

Table 3 shows the mean accuracy rates of the elements of stance display. Among the four elements, the mean accuracy rate of boosters was relatively low $( 5 8 . 3 3 \% )$ , and the remaining elements demonstrated high mean accuracy rates of above $8 0 ~ \%$

A major cause of the participants unsatisfactory performance in using boosters may have been their lack of knowledge of the polysemous nature of the word significance' and its inflected forms, as it has discipline-specific meanings in additin to its general meanings (Masrai & Milton, 2021). For instance, Extract 4 shows that a participant used 'significantly' as a synonym for by a large amount tostrengthen the degreofthe influence of music. owever, in scientific experiments, significance i normally regarded as a statistical conct used by rearcher to dtermine whether their statistical results may be dueo hance (Parkhurst, 2001). Therfre the use of significantly' in Extract 4 is misleading, because the participant did not conduct any statistical analyses to determine whether the changes in the subjects' heart rates were statistically significant.

To give a conclusion, the result shows that music can significantly (B) impact a person's heart rate.

A possible explanation for the inappropriate use f significantly' is that Hong Kong secondary students may not know the statistical meaning of this word or may be unable to distinguish its general meaning from its meaning in discipline-specific contexts. In Hong Kong secondary schoos, the instruction of English language teachers is heavily influenced by high-stakes English language examinations (Tsang & Isaacs, 202) focusing primarily on general communicative purposes of English (Lo & Lin, 2019). Although English is usually used for the teaching and learning of different subject in many secondary schools of Hong Kong, language features and rhetorical functions for discipline-specific academic purposes are much les taught by the English language specialists (Yung & Cai. 2020). However, EMI subject teachers tend to pay attention to delivering the subject knowledge only, thus neglecting the teaching of discipline-specific academic English (Lo & Lin, 2019). Academic language proficiency is diffrent from communicative language proficiency for general purposes (Cummins, 1979). Even though many secondary students may have achieved at least intermediate levels of communicative language proficiency in general contexts, they may sill lack the ability to convey disciplin-specific infor. mation accurately (Qiu et al., 2022), which is relevant to disciplinary literacy (Monte-Sano, 2010; Spires et al., 2018). Disciplinary literacy (e.g, discipline-specific vocabulary) means that \*each discipline has its own discourse" (Spires et al., 2018, p. 1403) Therefore, failure to use a subject-specific word accurately may cause misunderstanding among peers and experts in a discipline.

# 4.3. Engagement with readers

Table 4 displays how frequently and how accurately the participating writers engagement with readers was reflected in their reports.

# 4.3.1. Engagement with readers: frequency

Table 4 shows that the participants engagement with readers occurred with very low frequencies in the research reports, with a mean frequency of at least $0 . 0 1 ~ \%$ for each element of engagement with readers.

Table 4 shows that on average, reader pronouns $( M = 1 . 4 7 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 1 2 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) were the most frequently used element in the participants' engagement with readers. The most commonly used reader pronouns in the writing samples were you', us, our, and we'. Therefore, in many cases, reader pronouns overlapped with self-mention, both displaying the writers' stance and indicating interactions with readers.

However, as reader pronouns are often regarded as a linguistic marker of informal language in academic writing (Hyland & Jiang, 2017), the relatively high frequency of reader pronouns indicated that the participants may have failed to differentiate academic writing from informal converstions. Despite their awarenessof readers their previous writing training may have failed to teach them how to avoid the use of informal language in their research writing.

Extract 5 gives an example of the inappropriate use of atypical reader pronoun, you'. The sentence in Extract 5 appeared in the results section f one ofthe participants writing; this stion is intndd to guide rder in inrreting the findings. Howeer, the use of you is informal. Therefore, this participant should have avoided it use by using alternative phrases, such as As can be seen from the tables'.

As Table 4 shows, the mean frequencies of directives and appeals to shared knowledge were both $0 . 0 2 \%$ Furthermore, on average, reader-oriented questions $( M = 0 . 0 1 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 0 0 1 _ { . } ^ { \cdot }$ were the least frequently used element of reader engagement in the reports. Their low mean frequency may have been due to the participants awarenessthat \*direct questions are considerably underrepreented in academic writing' (Hyland, 2001, p. 569).

# 4.3.2. Engagement with readers: accuracy

Table 4 shows the mean accuracy raes of each element of engagement with readers. What stands out in ths table is the low average accuracy rate of directives $( 3 3 . 3 3 \% )$ . The participants performed better when using reader pronouns, with a mean accuracy rate of $8 8 . 6 4 \%$ and appeals to shared knowledge and reader-oriented questions, which had intermediate mean accuracy rates of $5 0 \%$ and 60 $\%$ , respectively.

The inappropriate use of directives in the methodology section was the major reason for the low average accuracy rates of the directives. Many of the participants wrote directives in describing thir datacollection procedures. As demonstrated in Extract 6, the participants created imperatie sentences, which are generall used to expres commands and requests (Aarts, 1989), therey failing to adequately achieve the goal of describing the procedures.

Then play the fast kpop song prepared for 2 minutes and let the volunteer listen to it (D). After that, record the volunteer's pulse again (D).

Such errors may be explained by two factors. Thefirs is the participants inadequate knowledge of academic writing conventions in science rerch reports. The second factor is 1 nerference. For instance, it i accetable o omit a subject in a Canonese sentence if readers can easil infer it from the discourse context or if the topic of the sentence is the same as that of the previous sentence (Chan, 2010). However, if there is no subject in an English sentence, it may be considered to be incomplete (Chan, 2010).

# 4.4. Mastery of knowledge of discourse structure

Table 5 presents how frequently and how accurately various discoursestructure elements appeared in the science reports.

4.4.1. Mastery of knowledge of discourse structure: frequency

Table 5 shows how frequently elements required for science research report writing appeared in the 20 reports. As shown in the table, the only element that faile to appear in the reports was justification for methods in the methodology section. In contrast, on average, the most frequently appearing element in this parameter was descriptions of instruments and research procedures in the methodology section $( M = 2 5 . 3 2 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 1 3 0 4 _ { . }$ . These statistical findings indicate that the participants had a weak awareness of justifying their research instruments and procedures after or while describing their methods.

Table 5 reports the mean frequencies of elements in the introduction sections of the reports. On average, the two most frequently appearing elements in the introduction section were a brief introduction to statistics or research evidence of a specific issue $( M = 7 . 2 7$ $\%$ $S D = 0 . 0 4 1 3 )$ and elaborations on or detailed explanations of broad statements, definitions, statistics, or research evidence of a specific issue $( M = 8 . 1 6 \%$ $\begin{array} { r } { S D = 0 . 0 7 2 1 . } \end{array}$

In addition, factual or general statements about an issue $( M = 2 . 7 7 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 3 7 5$ ) and definitions of the issue $( M = 1 . 3 2 \%$ $s D =$ 0.0279) were refected in some of the reports when research backgrounds were introduced. Unexpectedy, the identification of research gaps $( M = 0 . 9 4 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 2 0 7 _ { \cdot }$ made up, on average, the lowest proportion of the introduction section, indicating that most of the reports did not effectively communicate to readers why research attention to the effects of music was necessary.

Table 5 displays the mean frequencies of the elements in the methodology and results sections of the reports. The results indicate that the participants should have given more descriptions of the participants and research settings in their methodology sections $\left( M = \right)$ $1 . 3 3 ~ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 2 2 9$ to communicate to readers more information about the data sources. On average, an overview of the methodology and research purpose at the beginning of the methodology section constituted $3 . 0 8 \%$ of the total number of sentences in each report. In the results section, comparison statements $( M = 1 0 . 6 4 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 6 6 8$ ) constituted, on average, a much higher percentage than both location statements $( M { = } 2 . 1 8 ~ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 5 0 3$ and comments on the data or results $( M = 1 . 7 9 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 2 9 4 )$ Furthermore, the participants should have provided more location statements to help their readers locate graphs, tables, or figures more easily, and they should also have provided more explanations of or comments on their statistical results.

Table 5 also shows how frequently the elements required for writing the discussion and conclusion sections appeared in the reports. In terms of the discussion section, the participants paid more attention to summarising the key findings $( M = 7 . 9 9 \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 6$ ) than to explaining the results $( M = 1 . 4 3 \%$ $S D { = } 0 . 0 2 6 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and comparing new research evidence with previous findings $( M = 1 . 1 4 \%$ $s D =$ 0.0181). Similarly, in the conclusion section, the summary of findings $( M = 7 . 9 8 ~ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 5 3 6$ ) made up, on average, a higher percentage than the other elements in each report, such as the presentation of research limitations $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 2 . 3 8 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 3 8 3$ ) and implications $( M = 2 . 5 1 \ \%$ $S D = 0 . 0 2 9 3$

# 4.4.2. Mastery of knowledge of discourse structure: accuracy

Table 5 shows the mean accuracy rate for the elements of mastery of knowledge of discourse structure. In this parameter, only two of the elements achieved mean accuracy rates of more than $6 0 \%$ , whereas more than half of the elements had mean accuracy rates of less than $3 0 ~ \%$

One of the reasons for the low mean accuracy rates of the elements of the introduction section was the participants failure to use citations appropriatl. Extract 7 gives the example of a definition in an introductory section of a report. As the definition of pulse is not common knowledge, the writer should have cited sources to let readers know where this definition was derived.

# Extract 7.

Pulse is our heart rate, or the number of times our heart beats in one minute $\mathbf { \Pi } ^ { ( \mathrm { D } ) }$

There are three possble reasons for the lack of in-text citations in most of the reports. Firs, as compared with tertiary students, secondary students have less research report writing experience and less awareness of avoiding plagiarism. Second, since primary school, the participants may have been accustomed to producing narrative stories (Bai et al, 2020), which normally do not require citations. Thus, they may have developed an inaccurate understanding of plagiarism and might have been used to believing that only word-for-word copying of original ources requires citations in their written texts. Third, because large amounts of public information available online, to which Hong Kong secondary students are exposed, provide no references, a false belief may have been deeply rooted in their minds that mentioning definitions and previous research evidence requires no citations.

The mean accuracy rates of the elements of the methodology and results sections ranged from $6 . 9 7 \%$ to $5 0 \%$ indicating that the participants made numerous mistakes, such as lexical and grammatical errors, in writing about both their methodologies and ther findings. The problems in the participants methodology and results sections included the improper use of verb tenses. Specificall, the improper use of tenses contributed to the low average accuracy rates of the descriptions of istruments and research procedures in the methodology section of the reports $( 1 3 . 2 9 \% )$ . For instance, in Extract 8, the writer used the future tense (i.e., 'will') rather than past tenses to describe the research procedures that happened in the past.

I will ask them when they listen to music, why they listen to music, how they feel when listening to music, and whether they believe that music has an impact on them (R).

The mean accuracy rates of the elements in the discussion and conclusion sections ranged from $0 \%$ to $1 0 0 ~ \%$ Extract 9 displays elements f a discussion section wrtten by one of the participants. This section comprises the summary of findings, but only twc sentences explain the findings. Furthermore, this writr should have explained the statistical findings with reference to prior literature. because there is no comparison of the research findings and previous research evidence.

The results from the experiment show that fast and loud music increases a person's heart rate and increases their mood (U). The effects of fast and loud music may be due to its tempo (T). The higher tempo makes people excited, which leads to an increase in heart rate (T). However, the effects of slow and soft music vary from person to person (U).   
The results from the survey shows that most people have a habit of listening to music (U). They know that music has an effect on them (U).

# 5. Conclusion

# 5.1. Findings and implications

The present study found that the DC elements were used with varying levels of frequency and accuracy. The relatively high mean frequencies of self-mention and reader pronouns in the reports imply that EMI secondary students need to reduce their use of informal

language in their science research report writing. Instructors are therefore advised to provide lists of indicators of informal language to remind their students to use formal language in academic writing.

Given the insufficient use of hedges in the results and discussion sections of the reports, secondary students should be taught why, when, and how hedges should be used in their academic English writing. For example, when writers comment on empirical data or explain statistical results, hedges may be required to reduce certainty levels.

This study revealed redundant use of certain linguistic markers (e.g., the') and low average accuracy rates resulting from gram matical mistakes. To avoid such writing problems, English language teachers could consider providing corrective feedback for students' writing.

The lack of references and inappropriate use of citations in the reports indicate that Hong Kong ESL secondary students require more training on how to properly cite sources.

The finding about the participants failure to use a subject-specific word accurately indicates the need to implement a language across the curriculum approach in CLIL programmes. Subject instructors can collaborate with English language specialists to teach students disciplinary writing skills.

# 5.2. Limitations and directions for future research

This study has the following limitations that could be addressed in similar future studies. First, the reearch collected only 20 junior secondary students'science research report in Hong Kong, so the findings may not be generalised to a larger population in other contexts. Therefore, future rearch could consider collecting rerch reports of various academic disciplines from a lager population in different regions. Second, this study did not consider certain variables in the data analysis. For example, if L2 proficiency and L1 writing proficiency had been used as independent variables in the data analysis, the research may have provided more insights into how learners of varying L2 writing proficiency and L1 writing proficiency perform differently in terms of DC. Furthermore, the 20 written rports oly nolve one topic, i theffets f music, so ute stdes could explore hw different les of topi familirity may influence the frequencies of DC elements. Third, the present study did not explore how linguistic complexity (e.g., lexical complexity and syntactical complexity), whichi asignificant indicator of writing quality and 2 proficiency (eg., Panagopoulos et al. 2024), may relate to the frequencies and accuracy rates of DC elements in secondary students' disciplinary research reports. Future research could explore the relationship between linguistic complexity and DC elements.
