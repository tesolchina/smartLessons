Keywords: Medical writing Formulaic language Multiword collocations Medical written registers

Scholars in the medical field have described medical writing as particularly challenging and have called for instructional support for both novice writers and L2-English medical scholars. One of the main challenges is that there exist conventionalized terms that express a wide range of concepts, and any inappropriate use of such terms can lead to miscommunication with real consequences for practitioners, researchers, and the public. Therefore, the investigations of such conventionalized expressions could constitute a good starting point in addressing some of the challenges in medical writing. Thus, the present study investigates the use of multiword collocations (a type of register-specific word combinations) in medical research articles and the medical case reports, using two corpora of over a million words, representative of the two registers. The subsequent structural and functional analyses revealed that the majority of multiword collocations in both registers consisted of complex noun phrases mostly formed through noun premodifications (e.g., fine needle aspiration, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphisms). The identified sequences served distinct discourse functions that reflect the differences in the specific communicative functions of the two registers. Some pedagogical applications are suggested in this paper.

# 1. Introduction

The study of recurring word combinations in academic writing has provided ample evidence that such sequences are highly pervasive in different written academic registers (e.g., Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad & Finegan, 1999; Biber, Conrad & Cortes, 2004) and are, therefore, considered useful tools for the comprehension and production of academic texts (Cortes, 2004; Wray, 2005). In the field of medicine, formulaic language is of paramount importance, as medical writing entails the use of conventionalized terms and expressions for a wide range of concepts in the field. A slight deviation from the appropriate use of an expression can lead to miscommunication with real consequences for practitioners, researchers, and the public (Rezaeian, 2015). Thus, medical scholars have described medical writing as particularly challenging, and have called for instructional support for both novice writers and L2-English medical scholars (Man, Weinkauf, Tsang & Sin, 2004; Rezaeian,

2015). Therefore, investigating formulaic language use in medical texts could constitute a positive first step towards addressing some of these medical writing challenges.

A number of multiword sequences have been reported to account for the formulaicity of language, including collocations, lexical bundles, and phrase frames, to name but a few (e.g., Biber et al., 1999; Gray and Biber, 2013; Sinclair, 2004). Lexical bundles are still one of the most frequently studied sequences. These expressions are defined by Biber et al. (2004) as “the most frequent recurring lexical sequences in a register” (p. 376) and in medical discourse, they are expressions such as has been shown to, a single dose of, in the case of, and in individuals with. This continuous interest in lexical bundles stems from the fact that they have been shown to be ubiquitous in academic writing, where they function as “lexico-grammatical building blocks associated with basic functions used to bind the text together” (Cortes, 2013, p. 36).

However, there is indication that in addition to lexical bundles, specialized corpora also yield expressions that do not behave like bundles even though they are identified through corpus-driven methods and meet the conventionalized frequency and range thresholds set for identifying lexical bundles (Biber, 2009; Mbodj, 2021). Biber (2009) termed such expressions multiword collocations (mwc). Unlike lexical bundles that consist primarily of function words (e.g., in the case of, on the basis of the), mwc are predominantly composed of content words and tend to serve communicative functions specific to one particular register. For instance, in the case of medical case reports, examples of mwc are expressions such as vital signs were stable, and with no significant past medical history, among many others. It follows then that research and teaching of mwc could provide novice and L2-English writers with invaluable support in medical writing and its conventionalized expressions.

Additionally, given the stated register-specific communicative functions of mwc, disciplinary writing could be better served by studies of the use of these types of sequences in different registers within any given discipline, though the registerspecific nature of mwc remains yet to be evidenced. The present study takes a step forward in this direction and sets out to investigate the use of mwc in Medical Case Reports (MCR) and Medical Research Articles (MRA), two important registers in the medical field, as we will see in the following sections.

While several studies of formulaic language have explored discourse variations between different academic disciplines (e.g., Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008), little is known about potential variations that may exist between registers of the same discipline. By investigating the use of mwc in both medical case reports and medical research articles, this study seeks also to provide evidence of such within-discipline variations, and hence, the register-specific nature of multiword collocations.

# 2. Literature review

Studies of formulaic language in discourse have mostly focused on the use of recurrent word combinations in academic writing with the rationale that academic discourses constitute a “variety of subject-specific literacies” (Hyland and Tse, 2007, p.247). Hyland (2000) rightly posits that beyond what members of academic communities write, it is how they write that makes the “crucial difference” between disciplines, and therefore, “understanding disciplines involves understanding their discourses” (p. 2). It follows that for novice writers, learning to be efficient in the registers of their disciplines entails learning the preferred linguistic choices within their academic communities (Cortes, 2004; 2006; Hyland, 2008). Studies of lexical bundles and other formulaic sequences in academic writing have undeniably contributed to our understanding of how discourse is constructed in various fields and registers. However, little is known about mwc and their use in specialized academic texts.

# 2.1. Multiword collocations in specialized texts

Multiword collocations (Biber, 2009) are sequences of three or more words that have the peculiarity of being primarily composed of content words with strong collocational strength. Multiword collocations are of relevance to the study of formulaic language in specialized texts in that they “tend to be technical referring expressions” (Biber, 2009, p. 289). In the field of medicine, the importance of such technical referring expressions has been highlighted by Rezaeian (2015), who contends that one of the main challenges in medical writing lies in that it entails the use of conventionalized terms and expressions for a range of concepts in the field, and a slight deviation from the appropriate use of an expression can lead to miscommunication with real consequences for practitioners, researchers, and the public.

Multiword collocations are identified empirically based on both frequency and statistical measures of collocational strength. The most frequently used statistical measure of cohesiveness in studies of formulaic language has been Mutual Information (MI). Such frequent use of MI may be partly explained by convenience, given that there already exist corpus tools like Antconc (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b) or Collocate (Barlow, 2004) that automatically compute MI scores of sequences of various lengths. However, it should be mentioned that there is no agreement as to how well MI can measure the strength of association for sequences of three or more words as (1) it was initially meant to measure collocational strength between two words, and (2) it is biased towards low-frequency words (Biber, 2009; Gablasova, Brezina & McEnery, 2017). Another call for caution came from Gries (2013) who contends that MI and many other measures of collocational strength are symmetric measures that provide scores that do not reflect directional attraction of collocates. As an alternative measure, Gries proposed delta $P ( \Delta P ) ,$ , a directional measure that uses conditional probability to indicate both directional and bidirectional associations of elements of a collocation. In other words, $\Delta P$ can provide information that others cannot; that is, “it can tease apart which collocates in a collocation exhibit the strongest or weakest amounts of attraction or repulsion to the other collocate(s)” (p. 152). While Gries (2013) focused only on two-word collocations, the author suggested that $\Delta P$ could also be used for sequences longer than two words. The present study has explored that possibility.

While the identification of mwc is based on both strength of association and frequency, it should be mentioned that the frequency thresholds need not be very high to allow for the identification of the potentially useful low frequency sequences. In his brief comparison of mwc and lexical bundles, Biber (2009) used a lower frequency cutoff of 10 times per million words for the identification of 4-word collocations in lieu of the more conservative cutoff of 20 times per million words for 4-word lexical bundles.

To our knowledge, there is no published study that has focused on mwc – as defined in the present study – and their functions in specific disciplines and/or registers. Biber’s (2009) comparison of mwc and lexical bundles was for the purpose of addressing a methodological issue and to provide evidence that the frequency approach and the MI approach to the identification of multiword expressions yield two distinct categories of formulaic sequences (i.e., lexical bundles and multiword collocations). However, there is indication of the potentially important role of mwc in the construction of discourse in specialized texts.

# 2.2. Research on the formulaic language of medical writing

Researchers in the medical field have expressed the need for courses that would help familiarize both novice and L2- English writers with medical writing and conventionalized expressions in the field (e.g., Rezaeian, 2015; Yanoff and Burg, 1988). This call highlights the potential importance of research in and instruction of formulaic sequences in medical writing. Yet, there is a dearth of research in formulaic language in written medical texts. Research in medical writing has mostly focused on the study of: (1) selected linguistic features and their rhetorical functions, such as modals in expressing epistemic modality (e.g., Yang, Zheng & Ge, 2015), the use of reporting verbs in medical research articles (e.g., Jirapanakorn, 2012), or conditionals in medical research articles (Ferguson, 2001), (2) medical vocabulary in research articles (e.g.,Chen and Ge, 2007; Wang, Liang & Ge, 2008), and (3) the textual organization of the medical research article (e.g., Fryer, 2012; Nwogu, 1997).

A few studies, however, have looked at formulaic language in medical writing (e.g., Gledhill, 2000; Marco, 2000; Abdollahpour and Gholami, 2018; Jalali and Moini, 2014; Mbodj-Diop, 2016). Gledhill (2000) looked at the phraseology of introduction sections of Cancer articles and investigated the discourse functions of collocations comprising the verb forms has, have, been, and is; and the prepositions of and to. Luzón Marco (2000) explored the collocational frameworks (pairs of function words that form discontinuous sequences with one variable slot) in medical research articles focusing on intermediate words that fill in the following three frameworks: the . of, a . of, and be . to. Abdollahpour and Gholami (2018) investigated the use of lexical bundles in the abstracts of MRAs. Jalali and Moini (2014) looked at the use of lexical bundles in the introductions of MRAs, and Mbodj-Diop (2016) looked at the structures and functions of lexical bundles in MRAs.

These studies have primarily focused on the medical research article. Such focus can partly be explained by the importance of this register in the medical field. According to Man et al. (2004), the medical research article is not only the most commonly used vehicle to convey new knowledge but also the “principal currency for academic recognition and promotion” (p. 811). However, next to MRAs, case reports now “account for a growing number of articles in medical journals” (Gagnier et al., 2013; p. 1). A number of articles in the medical field have been published to expressly encourage the publication of MCRs, given the contribution of such reports to the field (e.g., Florek and Dellavalle, 2016; Gagnier et al., 2013; Rison, Shepphird & Kidd, 2017). Key contributions of MCRs listed by Florek and Dellavalle (2016) include, but are not limited to, providing the first line of evidence that often leads to new randomized clinical trials, serving as major sources of detecting rare adverse events of treatments and side effects due to drug interactions in clinical practice and preparing authors and medical students for a scientific career by adding publications to their resumes. The websites of a number of journals which publish case reports also highlight the importance of MCRs (e.g., Journal of Medical Case Reports, BMJ Case Reports).

Yet, despite this consensus on the importance of MCRs in the medical field, empirical studies that describe case reports linguistically are rare. To our knowledge, only two studies, Goodier (2008) and Helán (2012), looked at MCRs, and both studies used a genre approach, describing the rhetorical moves in case reports. Therefore, with the description of the use of mwc – an under-researched formulaic sequence in both MRAs and MCRs, two of the most important registers in the medical field – the present study makes a valuable contribution to medical writing instruction by providing a rich description of the uses of many of what Rezaeian (2015) labeled as conventionalized expressions that tend to make medical writing particularly challenging. To that end, this study sets out to investigate the following research questions:

Research Question 1: What are the structures and functions of multiword collocations used in Medical Research Articles?   
Research Question 2: What are the structures and functions of multiword collocations in Medical Case Reports?   
Research question 3: How do the identified multiword collocations compare in the two registers? Are they registerspecific or rather shared within the same discipline?

# 3. Corpora and methods

# 3.1. Situational analysis of MCRs and MRAs

In order to collect representative corpora and later support the interpretation of our findings, we conducted an analysis of the situational characteristics of MCRs and MRAs. As rightly suggested by Biber and Conrad (2009) such analysis is a key step in the study of any text variety as the linguistic features of registers under scrutiny adapt to the communication purposes and the situational context of those registers. To conduct the situational analysis of MRAs and MCRs, we developed a framework based on existing literature (e.g., Biber and Conrad, 2009; Gray, 2015), insights from expert informants, journal websites and instructions to authors, a sample of 100 MCRs and 100 MRAs, and Gagnier et al.’s (2013) CAse REport (CARE) Guidelines. Table 1 summarizes the most salient situational characteristics that portray the medical research article and the medical case report as two distinct registers within the medical field. Both registers share the overarching communicative purpose of advancing medical research and practice and have medical pathologies and treatments as general topics.

However, these similarities were found to exist only at the surface level. The two registers differ fundamentally in their foci and specific communicative purposes. The focus of MRAs is on advancing medical research. This is what makes this register a “highly technical report of experiments” (Nwogu, 1997, p.119). Most of the content of MRAs is devoted to extensive descriptions of research methods and experiments and advanced statistical measures to establish the generalizability of results and ensure replicability of the research.

The primary focus of MCRs, however, is on informing medical practice and education. To that end, authors of MCRs provide detailed descriptions of patients (usually only one), medical pathologies, new treatments, adverse events, and outcomes of clinical interventions with an aim to provide “enough details [.] for clinicians to relate in their own practice” (Rison et al., 2017, p. 1) and “offer a structure for case-based learning in healthcare education” (Gagnier et al., 2013, p. 46). This difference in foci in the specific communicative purposes of MCRs and MRAs translates into distinct channels of production and production circumstances. Indeed, MRAs and MCRs fundamentally differ in their methodologies.

Table 1 also shows that MRAs are primarily experimental with extensive use of advanced statistical techniques, while MCRs are typically observational with occasional use of some descriptive statistics. This difference in research design is reflected in how information is presented in the two registers. Experimental MRAs are written in the IMRD format with very detailed Methods and Results sections. On the other hand, MCRs are typically written in three different formats (see Table 1). However, regardless of format, MCRs present similar information, including diagnoses, clinical findings, interventions, outcomes, adverse events, and follow-up. Consistent with the specific communication purposes of the register, MCR authors provide detailed descriptions of these steps and observations.

# 3.2. Corpora

The MRA corpus (MRAC) is an updated version of a corpus previously collected for the investigation of the use of lexical bundles in MRAs (Mbodj-Diop, 2016). That corpus was built based on previous research on corpus collection, previous studies of MRAs (e.g., Nwogu, 1997; Wang et al., 2008), journal websites, sample MRAs, and insight from expert informants. The MRAC is an over 1-million-word corpus of quantitative MRAs written in the conventional IMRD format, published in five renowned journals in the medical field, namely, Science Translational Medicine (a subsection of the well-known journal Science), The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), and The Journal of Clinical Investigations (JCI). The initial MRAC was updated by $2 0 \%$ . That is, we added 50 newly published articles and removed the 50 oldest articles of the initial corpus. The thus updated corpus includes 250 texts for a total of over one million words. Table 2 provides a summary of the MRAC.

As previously mentioned, very little is known about MCRs. Therefore, the collection of the Medical Case Report Corpus (MCRC) was informed by the findings of the situational characteristics analysis, literature from the medical field, journal websites, sample MCRs, and insight from field-expert informants. In light of the information gathered, the working definition of MCRs for corpus collection was as follows: any MCR published in a journal indexed in PubMed, recognized in the medical field as a repository of the most reputable journals according to Rison et al. (2017), and reflecting the information listed in Gagnier et al.’s (2013) CARE guidelines: presenting concerns, clinical findings, diagnoses, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. A total of 704 texts were collected from five top journals, all indexed in PubMed: The Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), The British Medical Journal - Case Report (BMJCR) the Journal of Medical Case Reports (JMCR), Oxford Medical Case Report (OMCR), and International Medical Case Report Journal (IMCRJ). Table 3 provides a summary of the information about the MCRC.

# 3.3. Methods

Multiword collocations in this study were identified following a corpus-driven approach.

Corpus-driven approaches to the identification of formulaic language have become very popular in the past two decades, particularly because they allow researchers to avoid preconceptions or intuitions about the collocational preference of words. Biber (2012) explains that “corpus-driven research is more inductive, so that the linguistic construct themselves emerge from analysis of a corpus” (p. 159). We set out to identify all frequently occurring sequences primarily composed of lexical words and whose elements showed strong mutual expectancy. Prior to identifying mwc in the two corpora, we determined a working definition based on two main observations. First, mwc consist primarily of lexical words and second, these sequences have strong mutual expectancy (Biber, 2009). To ensure that all sequences considered for analysis were predominantly composed of lexical words, we set the following criteria:

3-word, 4-word and 5-word sequences must contain no more than one non-lexical word,   
6-word to 8-word sequences must contain no more than two non-lexical words, and   
9-word and more sequences must contain no more than three non-lexical words.

To determine the collocational strength of multiword collocations, we tested Gries’s (2013) suggestion of using $\Delta P$ for sequences longer than two words. That suggestion worked for 3-word multiword collocations but proved to be problematic for longer sequences. Therefore, we decided to use $\Delta P$ for 3-word expressions – partly as evidence of the feasibility of Gries’s suggestion – and MI scores for all longer sequences.

Based on the two observations mentioned above, we operationalized mwc as frequently co-occurring sequences of three or more words consisting primarily of lexical words and with strong mutual attraction as determined by $\Delta P$ for 3-word sequences and MI for longer sequences.

# 3.3.1. Identification of multiword collocations

Multiword collocations in both corpora were identified following Cortes’s (2013) exploratory approach that consists of progressively searching for longer expressions until the search yields no more results. We set the frequency thresholds at ten times per million words (pmw) for 3-word and 4-word sequences, eight times pmw for 5-word sequences, six times pmw for 6-word and 7-word sequences, and five times pmw for longer multiword collocations. These relatively low-frequency thresholds are necessary to identify sequences involving technical words as the latter often occur at a much lower frequency than other non-technical words (Gablasova et al., 2017). The range was set at five texts in each corpus.

Sequences of three words in both corpora were identified in Antgram (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b).

Then $\Delta P$ values were computed in Excel, following Gries’s suggestion (personal communication, August 5, 2021) to use the simple approach of calculating the probability of word3 when ( $\mathbf { w o r d } _ { 1 } \mathbf { + w o r d } _ { 2 }$ ) is present. In that way, only two $\Delta P$ values are computed in Excel: $\Delta P \left( A + \mathbf { B } \right)$ , and $\Delta P$ (C) with A, B, and C representing word1, word2, and word3, respectively. The log 10 scores of these two values were also computed to facilitate the selection of candidates for analysis. Only sequences with a log10 score between $- 0 . 5 0$ and $+ 0 . 5 0$ were considered for the list of candidates. Additionally, where the log10 score was between $- 0 . 5 0$ and $+ 0 . 0 0$ , the $\Delta P$ value of $( \mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B } )$ had to be equal to or greater than .30; and where the log10 score is between $+ 0 . 0 1$ and $+ 0 . 5 0$ , the $\Delta P$ value of C had to be equal to or greater than .30. In sum, 3-word collocations in the list of candidates had to meet the following criteria:

- $- 0 . 5 0 \leq \log 1 0 \leq + 0 . 0 0$ and $\Delta P _ { \mathsf { C } | ( \mathsf { A } + \mathsf { B } ) } \geq . 3$ 0 - $+ 0 . 0 1 \leq \log 1 0 \leq + 0 . 5 0$ and $\Delta P _ { \mathrm { ( A \mathrm { ~ + ~ } B ) | C } } \geq . 3 0$

All other mwc were identified in Collocate 2.1 (Barlow, 2004). Initial lists of candidates ranked by MI were generated by Collocate and saved to be cleaned later. The cleaning process for all lists, including the 3-word lists, was done in two steps. First, all sequences that did not meet the criteria for the number of non-lexical words described above were deleted. The next step was to check for overlaps using the Concordance tool in Antconc (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b) . Shorter sequences were deleted if they did not meet the frequency thresholds outside of the longer expressions.

After this final cleaning step, all lists were ready for analysis.

# 3.3.2. Structural analysis of multiword collocations

For the structural analysis of mwc in both corpora, we developed a classification framework in the absence, to our knowledge, of any previous framework for that purpose. With the mwc as observations, we identified the following three major structural categories (see Table 4 for examples of sequences in each category):

Table 4 Structural classification framework for multiword collocations.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Structural Categories</td><td>Subcategories</td><td>Examples from MRAC &amp; MCRC</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Phrasal Sequences</td><td>Complex Noun Phrases</td><td>acid phase reactants common terminology criteria for adverse events</td></tr><tr><td>Prepositional Phrases</td><td>in nonhuman primates</td></tr><tr><td>Other Phrases</td><td>with no significant past medical history. available on request</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Clausal Sequences</td><td>Declarative Clauses/Fragments</td><td>vital signs were stable</td></tr><tr><td>Dependent Clauses/Fragments</td><td>showed a blood cell count of what we believe</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>to better understand</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Coordinated Binominals</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>chest pain and shortness of breath. palms and soles</td></tr></table></body></html>

Phrasal Sequences, with three subcategories: Complex noun phrases (i.e., noun phrases with pre-modification, postmodification, or both), Prepositional phrases in the form of prep $^ +$ (complex) noun phrases (NP); and Other Phrases; Clausal Sequences, with two categories: Declarative clauses/fragments and Dependent clauses/Fragments; and Coordinated Binominals, defined by Biber et al. (1999, p. 1030) as “two words from the same grammatical category, coordinated by and or or”.

# 3.3.3. Functional analysis of multiword collocations

All identified sequences were functionally analyzed in context in Antconc (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b), using the Concordance tool and the File View in cases where more context was needed.

For the functional analysis of MRAC multiword collocations, we drew from existing frameworks for the analysis of the functions of formulaic sequences, mostly lexical bundles. We adapted Hyland’s (2008) framework, which was specifically designed for the academic research article. Based on our observations of the mwc, we deleted other subcategories of functions that were not served by the MRAC multiword collocations, and we further divided the Topic subsection into two subgroups: Institutions and Research Objects and Related Elements to avoid compounding visibly distinct sequences, like The World Health Organization and posterior circulation territory infarctlike lesions in the same category. The functional classification framework is shown in Table 5. The bolded entries in italics indicate additions made based on the observed functions of MRAC multiword collocations.

In the absence of any study of formulaic language in MCRs, the functional classification framework for MCR multiword collocations was based primarily on observations from the analyses in context in Antconc (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b) and the required information that MCRs must include based on Gagnier et al.’s (2013) CARE guidelines. We also drew from Biber et al.’s (2004) and Hyland’s (2008) frameworks for the labeling of some functions in the subcategories. We identified three major functional categories:

 Case-related sequences used to specify case subjects (patients), describe the medical pathology, and refer to other individuals related to the case;   
 Diagnosis/Intervention-related sequences used to refer to biomedical elements and/or processes, decisions made during diagnosis, and intervention procedures; and   
Stance features used mostly to indicate authors’ evaluation of the importance of the case being presented and/or therapeutic approaches they took.

These major categories, as well as their respective subcategories and examples of collocations from the MCRC, are shown in Table 6.

# 4. Findings and discussions

With the exploratory approach used in the identification of mwc, sequences of up to seven words were identified in each corpus. Table 7 shows the numbers of mwc identified in each corpus (see Appendices for full lists of mwc). Overall, the number of types of mwc was relatively similar in the two corpora with 149 in the MRAC and 155 in the MCRC. The identified mwc were analyzed both in terms of structures and functions.

# 4.1. Multiword collocations in MRAs

The following subsections will present the results of the structural and functional classification of multiword collocations in MRAs.

# 4.1.1. Structures of multiword collocations in the MRAC

The structural analysis revealed that mwc in the MRAC were primarily phrasal, with complex noun phrases accounting for $6 7 . 7 \%$ of 3-word collocations, $9 0 . 0 \%$ of 4-words, $8 8 . 0 \%$ of 5-words, and $100 \%$ of both 6-words and 7-words. As shown in Table 8, the longer the mwc, the less varied their structures are, with a steady increase in the proportion of complex noun phrases.

These findings are consistent with the claim of Biber and Gray (2016) that modern science research writing has dramatically shifted from the use of dependent clauses in favor of “a strong increase in the use of phrasal modifiers” (p. 27). The high frequency of phrasal sequences in the MRAC could indicate how grammatical complexity is achieved in MRAs. It may be the case that medical writers resort to this grammatical process to achieve concise writing, given the limited word counts allowed by medical journals.

Given their very high frequency, the complex noun phrases were further analyzed to better understand the noun modification processes used by authors of MRAs. The findings indicated noun pre-modification as the process most frequently utilized by MRA writers, accounting for $7 4 \%$ of identified complex noun phrases. The remaining expressions involved either noun post-modification $( 1 8 \% )$ or both pre- and post-modifications $(8 \% )$ . This grammatical process is achieved in the MRAC through multiple devices ranging from nouns, to adjectives, to -ed and -ing participial modifiers (e.g., ambient particulate matter pollution, cell signaling technology, seafood omega-3 fatty acids, forced expiratory volume).

Table 8 Distribution of categories of multiword collocations in the MRAC.   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td colspan="5">MRAC Multiword Collocations</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Structures</td><td>3-words</td><td>4-words</td><td>5-words</td><td>6-words</td><td>7-words</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Phrasal Sequences</td><td>Complex NP</td><td>67.7 %</td><td>90 %</td><td>9 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td></tr><tr><td>PP</td><td>9 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>other</td><td>2 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>subtotals1</td><td></td><td>78.8 %</td><td>90 %</td><td>89 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Clausal sequences</td><td>Declarative Clauses/fragments</td><td>7.1 %</td><td>10.%</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>Dependent Clauses/Fragments</td><td>4 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>subtotals 2</td><td></td><td>11%</td><td>10 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>Coordinated Binominals</td><td></td><td>10 %</td><td>0 %</td><td>11%</td><td>0 %</td><td>0 %</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td></td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>100 %</td></tr></table></body></html>

Noun pre-modification may thus be of pedagogical value in medical writing instruction. As rightly noted by Biber, Gray, Staples and Egbert (2020), learners need support to be able to parse “the dense packaging associated with phrasal complexity” (p. 13). This point is further discussed later, in the conclusion.

4.1.2. Functions of multiword collocations in the MRAC As indicated in Section 3.3.3, all identified sequences were analyzed in context using concordance lines in Antconc (Anthony, 2020a, 2020b). Table 9 shows the distribution of mwc of various lengths in the major functional categories.

Figure 1. Distribution of research-oriented subfunctions served by MRAC multiword collocations.

Most mwc in the MRAC, regardless of length, were research oriented, with all 4-word, 5- word, and 7-word sequences belonging to this category. Figure 1 shows the distribution of research-oriented subfunctions served by mwc in the MRAC. As shown in this figure, the subfunctions Location (in time/place) and Quantification accounted for only $6 \%$ and $5 \%$ of researchoriented multiword collocations, respectively, suggesting that authors of medical research articles resort to some other devices (like lexical bundles, for example) to express these functions. Therefore, Location and Quantification are not further discussed in this section.

The most frequent subfunction of Topic (Research Object and Related Elements) was almost exclusively served by complex noun phrases, regardless of length, with only two instances of 3-word coordinated binominals. Examples (1) and (2) below illustrate the use of complex noun phrases to refer to the object of the research (example 1) and elements related to the object of the research (example 2).

The second most frequent research-oriented function, Procedure, was also frequently expressed through complex noun phrases (example 3), but also through prepositional phrases (example 4).

(3) Between March 31, 2009, and June 2, 2014, we assessed 8820 women [.], of which 651 and 629 women, respectively, completed an oral glucose tolerance test. (15LANCET1)   
(4) Total lysates of $C D 8 ^ { + }$ T cells after CD3/28 stimulation and treatment with 15 mM LA for the indicated time points were analyzed by Western blotting. (20Science5)

Sequences used for Description, on the other hand, showed a different pattern. They were primarily 3-word coordinated binominals (example 5) and 3-word and 4-word clausal sequences in the form of declarative clauses/fragments (examples $6 \&$ 7). As shown in examples (5)–(7), these sequences appear much less technical than those used to refer to research objects and procedures.

(5) All follow-up is through September 30, 2009. Events are the composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events that occurred in [.]. (14JAMA3)   
(6) Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced across the 2 groups. (20JAMA8)   
(7) Secondary end points included the duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. (20NEJM9)

Finally, sequences used to refer to institutions were predominantly complex noun phrases. The institutions they refer to appear to be internationally well-known as in the case of the World Health Organization. Authors of MRAs appear to refer to those institutions primarily to validate the ethics of their procedures and research approaches, as can be seen in examples (8) and (9).

(8) The results of this trial prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 2006 to release a joint statement recommending [.]. (16JAMA3)   
(9) The protocol was completed when the infant’s [.]. Safety data were reviewed by the data and safety monitoring board at the midpoint of the study. (15NEJM1)

In sum, the structural analysis revealed that MRAC multiword collocations, in their vast majority, consisted of complex noun phrases. Further analysis of those complex noun phrases revealed pre-modification as the most frequent process used by authors of medical research articles to create this type of phrase. The functional analysis showed that mwc in the MRAC were predominantly research-oriented sequences. While the functions of Topic (Research Object and Related Elements), Procedure, and Topic (Institutions) were primarily realized through complex noun phrases, the third most frequent researchoriented function, Description, was served primarily by coordinated binominals and phrasal sequences.

# 4.2. Multiword collocations in MCRs

The next subsections will present the results of the structural and functional classification of mwc in MCRs.

4.2.1. Structures of multiword collocations in the MCRC

The results of the structural analysis of MCRC multiword collocations are shown in Table 10. As was the case in the MRAC, phrasal sequences were also found predominant in the MCRC, accounting for $8 8 . 1 \ \% , 7 9 . 2 \ \% , 8 3 . 3 \ \% ,$ , and $6 3 . 6 \%$ of 3-word, 4- word, 5-word, and 6-word collocations, respectively. However, these proportions of phrasal multiword collocations in the MCRC are noticeably lower than in the MRAC. This is explained by a higher proportion of clausal sequences in the MCRC. Indeed, clausal sequences accounted for $2 7 . 3 \%$ of 6-word sequences, $2 0 . 8 \%$ of 4-word sequences, and $1 6 . 7 \%$ of 5-words. They also represent $1 0 0 \%$ of the 7-word list, but there was only one item in that list. Still, it is worth noting that the only item in that list was a clausal sequence.

As shown in Table 10, clausal sequences in the MCRC were predominantly declarative clauses/fragments. The phrasa sequences, on the other hand, were largely dominated by complex noun phrases, as was the case in the MRAC. Given the latter are still highly frequent in the MCRC, despite the increased use of clausal sequences, we further investigated the modification processes involved in MCRC complex noun phrases to see whether authors resort to the same noun modification processes in the two registers.

The analysis revealed that complex noun phrases on the list of MCRC multiword collocations are almost exclusively formed through pre-modification $( 9 0 \% )$ as was previously observed in the MRAC (e.g., left ventricular ejection fraction, complete blood cell count). The remaining $1 0 \%$ of identified mwc involved either post-modification $( 7 \% )$ or both pre- and post-modifications $( 3 \% )$ In light of these findings and based on Biber and Gray’s (2016) claim regarding the shift of modern scientific writing toward phrasal modifiers, it can be inferred that medical writing, in general, is fundamentally phrasal and that noun premodification plays an important role in phrasal complexity in this discipline. As mentioned above, this is precious information for both medical writing instructors and learners.

One salient difference between the structures of mwc in the MCRC and the MRAC was the relatively high frequency of clausal sequences in medical case reports, primarily in the form of declarative clauses/fragments. These were mostly short and simple complete clauses or fragments (e.g., function tests were normal, physical examination revealed $a$ ) that appeared to serve important functions in case reports, as will be seen in the next section.

# 4.2.2. Functions of multiword collocations in the MCRC

The findings of the functional analysis are shown in Table 11. Multiword collocations in the MCRC were almost exclusively Diagnosis/Intervention-related and Case-related. Figures 2 and 3 show the distributions of the subfunctions served by the MCRC multiword collocations in each of these two categories. Description was the most frequently served function in the Case-related category, accounting for $6 0 \%$ of all sequences in this category. Procedure and Biological processes/elements, on the other hand, were predominant in the Diagnosis/Intervention-related category.

Figure 3. Diagnosis-related subfunctions of MCRC multiword collocations.

Multiword collocations occurring in the Description subcategory were mostly used to refer to the medical condition at hand (example 10) and provide details in the initial presentation of the case (examples 11 & 12). Sequences serving these functions were primarily complex noun phrases (example 10) but also included coordinated binominals (example 11) and declarative clauses/fragments (example 12).

(10) A 67-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia was evaluated for unintentional weight loss of [.]. (19JAMA169) (11) He was alert and oriented, able to answer questions and follow commands appropriately. (20BMJ4) (12) Her medical history included diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (21BMJ78)

Multiword sequences in the Procedures subcategory were used to refer to diagnosis and intervention procedures. They consisted exclusively of complex noun phrases and often were highly technical expressions as shown in examples (13) and (14) below.

(13) Various therapies have been used for the patient, including [.], biliary drainage by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, [.]. (20IMCRJ94)   
(14) We could not identify EBV DNA in the DLBCL-containing portion of the specimen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and breaks in the[.] by fluorescence in situ hybridization. (20JMCR27)

In addition to the functions discussed above, there is one Diagnosis/Intervention subcategory, Findings, that displayed a particularity that may be of interest in medical case report writing instruction. Despite the predominance of complex noun phrases in all other functional categories, this category did not involve any complex noun phrases. It was served exclusively by declarative clauses/fragments that appeared as ready-made sequences for reporting the results of examination and diagnosis procedures, as shown in examples (15) and (16). This probably explains the noticeably higher proportion of phrasal sequences in the MCRC, compared to the MRAC.

(15) Physical examination revealed a tall gentleman with blood pressure of 104/75, heart rate of 90 bpm and [.] (20BMJCR13). (16) Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bitemporal edematous lesions, [.]. (20IMCRJ50)

Note in these examples how each clause/fragment starts with the source of the information being provided as its subject. This, according to Helán (2012), is typical of MCR writing where authors tend to use medical technology and procedures as Agents. From a pedagogical perspective, this finding is particularly important as the declarative clauses/fragments in the Findings category are vehicles of required information in any medical case report, according to Gagnier et al. (2013). It appears then, that novice L1 writers and L2- English medical professionals seeking to publish MCRs, will greatly benefit from instruction of these ready-made clauses/fragments.

In sum, we have seen in this section that mwc in MCRs are predominantly complex noun phrases created in their vast majority through pre-modification. As case-related sequences, these noun phrases were primarily used in the description of the medical cases being presented. As Diagnosis/Intervention-related, they were used to refer to procedures and biological processes/elements. Next to complex noun phrases, phrasal sequences were also frequent and appeared to specifically serve the function of reporting findings in the Diagnosis/Intervention-related category.

The findings presented so far already indicate some variations in the use of mwc in MRAs and MCRs, despite some structural similarities. To supplement the comparison and answer RQ3, which aimed to determine whether the identified sequences were register-specific or rather shared across the medical field, we now turn to the findings of the analysis of mwc shared between the two registers.

# 4.3. Shared multiword collocations

We have seen that mwc in both registers are predominantly phrasal with a high prevalence of complex noun phrases. However, the similarities seem to be limited to the structures of the identified sequences. Multiword collocations in the two registers served very distinct functions that reflect the differences in the situational characteristics of the two registers, mainly their specific communicative purposes. Additionally, the two corpora shared only 13 mwc (shown in Table 12), representing only $8 . 7 8 \ \%$ and $8 . 3 8 \%$ of the MRAC and MCRC lists, respectively.

Table 12 Shared multiword collocations across the two corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>3-words</td><td>4-words</td><td>6-words</td></tr><tr><td>calcium channel blockers sensitivity and specificity polymerase chain reaction stem cell transplantation intensive care unit written informed consent the United States acid fast bacilli. hematoxylin and eosin in situ hybridization.</td><td>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease thee World Health Organization</td><td>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</td></tr></table></body></html>

Analysis of the shared sequences in context did not reveal noticeable variations between their use in MRAs and MCRs. This may be because many of the shared sequences are technical terms referring to specific medical processes (e.g., stem cell transplantation, calcium channel blockers, in situ hybridization). Examples (17)–(20) show the use of some of these technical sequences in both MRAs and MCRs.

(17) Microscopically, using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained sections, the tumor was [.]. (MCRC_20IMCRJ44) (18) Lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, and $1 0 \mathrm { - } \mu m$ sections were prepared and stained using hematoxylin and eosin and [.]. (MRAC_20Science7) (19) Immunohistochemical analysis by in situ hybridization showed strong positive [.]. (MCRC_19OMCR140) (20) Importantly, in situ hybridization revealed an indistinguishable cellular distribution of [.]. (MRAC_10JCI1)

To answer our third research question, most mwc identified in the MRAC and MCRC are specific to each register with a few common technical expressions used in the medical field.

These findings lend evidence to previous calls in the field to consider each register, even within the same discipline, in its own right (e.g., Gray, 2015; Mbodj, 2021). Indeed, it appears that disciplinary writing instruction can be more effective if within-discipline variations are taken into account. Some pedagogical implications and applications are discussed in the final section below.

# 5. Conclusion

The aim of the present study was to investigate the use of mwc in two of the most importantdif not the most importantdwritten registers in the medical field. Authors of both MRAs and MCRs resort primarily to noun pre-modification to compress information. As a result, mwc in both registers were found to be primarily complex noun phrases. This linguistic feature appears to be frequently used by MCR and MRA writers for the purpose of concise writing given the amount of information they must provide, and the limited word count allowed by journals. The resulting mwc, however, serve different functions in the two registers, highlighting the differences in the situational characteristics of MRAs and MCRs. In addition to complex noun phrases, MCR multiword collocations included a noticeable proportion of declarative clauses/fragments that functioned exclusively as ready-made sequences for reporting the results of examination and diagnosis procedures, a function that is specific to MCRs.

# 5.1. Pedagogical implications and applications

The findings discussed above underscore the importance of noun pre-modification processes in medical writing in general, and clausal sequences in writing MCRs in particular, and provide evidence that could account for the pedagogical potential of these expressions. Wesuggest a task-based approach that would encourage medical students to integrate these types of sequences in their writing. For example, students might be assigned to write a case report as a semester final evaluation. This could work particularly well if students are starting or have already started their internships. The task is explained at the beginning of the semester and different deadlines are set for completing the different sections of the MCR.

Given that there have been calls in the literature for explicit teaching of formulaic sequences (e.g., Cortes, 2004; Jones and Haywood, 2004; Li and Schmitt, 2009), we suggest task-based instruction in its weak form (Skehan, 2003), with writing tasks assigned to complement instructor-led lectures and/or classroom activities. Such activities/lectures can include relevant formulaic sequences like clausal mwc used for reporting diagnoses or results of clinical tests and/or examinations, or complex noun phrases used in Case Presentation that can complement the teaching of other aspects of these registers, such as communicative purposes and discourse organization, to mention just a few. Classroom tasks may consist of scaffolding activities going from awareness raising, to guided production, to free production (actual sections of the MCR).

When the time comes to focus on particular linguistic features frequently used in these registers, the instructor can start teaching noun pre-modifications, as this was found to be the most frequently used noun modification process in both MRAs and MCRs. Complex noun phrases may be difficult for students and L2-English users to even unpack, let alone produce (Biber and Gray, 2016). Therefore, a good starting point could be activities that help learners unpack the information in these expressions. Such activities can vary from simple reading strategies to short reformulation activities.

One such strategy is “backward reading”. The strategy consists of reading the complex noun phrase starting from the head noun and moving backwards. For example, for the phrase oral glucose tolerance test, the aim would be to make a meaningful sentence starting with the head noun test and incorporating the preceding words one at a time. Thus, an example of a coherent sentence that captures the meaning could be a test of the tolerance to glucose which is administered orally. As another example, data and safety monitoring board could be a board that monitors safety and data. Once students get the gist, the instructor can provide them with a list of complex noun phrases that they can try to untangle in groups. The rationale behind this activity is to help students be aware of the amount of information that can be packed in complex noun phrases.

Once students get practice with these procedures, the instructor can introduce reformulation activities by providing strings of information that students will have to “correctly pack” in complex noun phrases. During these activities, it may be important to draw students’ attention to the wordiness of the provided strings of information.

The next step (not necessarily during the same class session) would be guided production activities. One possible activity could be to provide students with an excerpt of an MCR where complex noun phrases have been reformulated into strings of less compressed information. First, students would identify the sentences or phrases that appear too wordy (an alternative would be to directly underline the wordy sentences or phrases, depending on students’ levels, as in Figure 4).

# Sample excerpt to reformulate

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with $8 0 \%$ of death related to CVD occurring in countries that have low income and middle income.2 Although CVDs usually clinically manifest in adulthood, changes that are atherosclerotic and early are already present in childhood and adolescence.The density and severity of the lesions seem to be modulated by the presence of factors of risk of CVD that are concomitant.3,4 Furthermore, the presence of such factors of risk of CVD that are potentially modifiable during adolescence is a precursor of profiles of cardiovascular risk that are poor in adulthood.5 Therefore, understanding the distribution of burden of factor of risk of CVD that is behavioural in adolescents in countries that have low income and middle incomes is of utmost importance for formulation of policy for the control and prevention of disease

# Original version (not to be provided to students)

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with $80 \%$ of CVD-related deaths occurring in low income and middle income countries. Although CVDs usually clinically manifest in adulthood, early atherosclerotic changes are already present in childhood and adolescence.The density and severity of the lesions seem to be modulated by the presence of concomitant CVD risk factors.3,4Furthermore, the presence of such potentially modifiable CVD risk factors during adolescence is a precursor of poor cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Therefore,understanding the distribution of behavioural CVD risk factor burden in adolescents in low income and middle income countries is of utmost importance for policy formulation for disease prevention and control.

After these writing techniques, the subsequent class activities and lectures can focus directly on the types of formulaic sequences students will mostly need to complete the different sections of the MCR. For example, for the Case Presentation section, instructors could choose to introduce the clausal mwc. As awareness raising activities, instructors can start with sets of concordance lines like those shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Concordance lines of clausal multiword sequences.

Then, in groups or pairs, students discuss and identify the discourse functions of clausal mwc. We suggest giving students the opportunity to investigate the functions of the sequences on their own. As rightly suggested by Hunston (2002), students are more likely to remember “what they have worked to find out” (p. 170). Then, the activity is reviewed as a class to (1) ensure that all functions/purposes are correctly identified, and (2) bring students to notice the possibility of using medical procedures as agents in active sentences to report results.

It is important to note that the tasks and activities presented in this subsection are just some examples of materials and activities that could be used in a medical writing class for novice L1 English and L2 English writers. There may be innumerable opportunities for material and activity creation from the findings reported in the present study.

# 5.2. Limitations and further direction

Like most research, the present study has some limitations. We did not analyze the textual semantic associations (or prosody) and the grammatical and textual colligations (Hoey, 2005) of identified mwc, as this was considered beyond the scope of our study. However, from a pedagogical perspective, a description of where different sequences tend to occur in MRAs and MCRs, and in what grammatical and semantic environments, could be of high interest to medical writing instructors. Further, to better inform writing instruction, studies are needed that examine the relationships between mwc (and possibly other formulaic sequences) and rhetorical moves. Very few studies have done so, and most that have focused on sections of the IMRD research article (e.g., Cortes, 2013; Le and Harrington, 2015). Investigating the connection between formulaic sequences and the moves of an entire text variety could help writing instructors identify which formulaic sequences to teach to help realize each move or communication function.
