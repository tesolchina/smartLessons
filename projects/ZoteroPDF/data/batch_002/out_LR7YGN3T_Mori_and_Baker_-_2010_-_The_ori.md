Abstract Prodigious growth in out-of-school, private educational activities meant to supplement formal schooling is observed worldwide. Why has shadow education expanded, and what does it mean for the future of education in postmodern society? Illustrated by the historical development and recent changes in the Japanese shadow education industry, it is suggested that shadow education follows the institutional logic of formal education. And as this logic has become more homogenized and expansive globally, so have the forms and goals of shadow education. Because of its focus on learning and achievement, which are central to formal education, it is predicted that shadow education will be increasingly incorporated into the broader culture of education.

# Introduction

Over the past several decades, observers of international trends in education have noted the prodigious growth in out-of-school educational activities meant to supplement formal schooling (Baker et al. 2001; Bray 1999). From one-on-one tutoring to sophisticated cram-school industries to large-scale distance learning, numerous organizational forms of ways for students and their families to buy additional out-of-school learning have grown in popularity worldwide. As early in this trend as the mid-1990s, a crossnational study found that across 41 nations, on average, four out of every 10 eighth graders participated weekly in some form of supplemental education, as a means to meet educational requirements and take full advantage of educational opportunities (Baker et al. 2001). In South Korea, a significant majority of primary and secondary students purchase some supplemental education during their school careers, and estimates show that Korean families invested another $56 \%$ of the total national education budget in these learning enhancement activities in 2003 (Lee 2005). Why, then, has this expanding global trend come about, even in the face of international expert and national governmental concerns about the practice as socially problematic and possibly corrosive to the legitimacy of public education? And, what does it tell us about where the institution of education is headed in the future?

The entire practice of supplemental education, usually aimed at academic achievement enhancement and often referred to as ‘‘shadow education,’’ represents significant private capital investment on the part of families and is now routinely the subject of policy concern over educational quality and equality (Bray 1999; Bray 2003; Lee 2005; Silova et al. 2006).1 When the issue of shadow education emerged onto the international stage in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to the then novel large-scale cross-national comparisons of achievement tests by some national educational establishments (e.g. U.S., German, U.K.), it was portrayed as a somewhat exotic cultural practice limited to East Asian nations (Cummings 1997). It was also thought to be the ‘‘secret ingredient’’ in some Asian nations’ relative high performance on these tests (U.S. Department of Education 1987). Neither of these original ideas proved correct, however, as since then shadow education has been observed as a part of the culture of education in other nations, and now it has gone worldwide. And interestingly too, while these learning enhancement services can help individual students with the rigors of schooling, there is no evidence that extensive use of these learning influences overall national levels of achievement (Baker et al. 2001).

After a review of the extent to which shadow education has spread and an assessment of its impact on various educational issues and policies, it is argued that the cause of this trend has been a result of growing institutional forces driving the world’s culture of education in general. Specifically, the argument is developed that the origin of the recent trend lies in the shift of logic behind the institution of education, from an older modern logic germane to nation-building projects of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, to a relatively new universal, intensified, and robust educational logic of postmodern society. In other words, shadow education is transformed by a ‘‘global culture of education,’’ even in the nations where the practice has long existed, and therefore is found worldwide with similar intent and increasingly common forms (Baker and LeTendre 2005). And the wide success it currently enjoys in many nations reflects directly back on the institutional essence of formal education.

This argument is developed by employing neo-institutional ideas and research about the relationship between education and society and is contrasted with more traditional ways of thinking about this relationship (e.g. Baker and LeTendre 2005; Meyer 1977). The argument is then illustrated by an analysis of the long historical development and recent transformation of shadow education in Japan, a nation whose modern use of shadow education was prominently at the center of other nations’ debates about educational quality in the aftermath of international achievement studies. The analysis shows that the primary purpose of shadow education in Japan shifted from national elite formation to exam preparation, and then to the provision of customized learning services to the masses, similar to the purpose behind the phenomenon in many other nations. This has all occurred with a steady increase in the use of shadow education in Japan, as well as an increase in the institutional saturation of education in Japanese society, both symbiotic trends now occurring in most other nations.

# Worldwide spread of shadow education and research on its effects

Earlier focus on Japan and Korea

Over time, shadow education activities have developed in various parts of the world under various contexts. Until the early 1990s, shadow education was exclusively studied by scholars on East Asian societies, often with a focus on the societies’ exam-oriented education systems. However, owing to some groundbreaking studies that examined shadow education from a global perspective, studies for other countries with shorter history of shadow education are increasing in recent years.

In Japan, rapid growth and monitoring of shadow education began after the World War II. The government’s national survey on private tutoring started in 1976, and various academic and journalistic publications on this topic came out. Rohlen (1980), one of the earliest scholarly studies on shadow education in Japan, examined Japanese private tutoring institution called juku from an anthropological view and described the relationship between schools and juku as similar to ‘‘ideal’’ and ‘‘reality.’’ Rohlen insightfully discussed Japanese shadow education in a broader social and educational context, by referring to the pursuit of educational advantage by middle class families and the egalitarian ideology of formal schooling. However, he interpreted the juku mainly within the cultural framework of Japan, and while recognizing similar forms of shadow education that existed in Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, the Japanese-centric premise of his analysis suggested that it would not take root in other countries.

Stevenson and Baker (1992) undertook an early sociological study on Japanese shadow education that employed an allocation theory to understand the link between students’ participation in shadow education and their formal school career. They statistically estimated the effects of family backgrounds and student characteristics on participation in various types of shadow education activities, and found that higher family SES and higher school grades were associated with the use of shadow education.

In the 1990s, some more studies focused on Japanese shadow education. These include those of Harnish (1994) that studied curriculum aspects of juku, Russell (1997) that studied the culture of teaching and learning in Japanese juku, and Cummings (1997) that examined juku in the context of East Asian private education. In addition, LeTendre (1994) focused on the abolishment of distribution tables (high school ranking with predicted cut-off scores) in Japan, an unsuccessful reform which continued the school’s reliance on private testing companies for predicting such probability of entrance. A recent national survey showed that $2 5 . 9 \%$ of elementary and $5 3 . 5 \%$ of middle school students received private tutoring2 (Monbukagakusho 2008).

South Korea is another country where shadow education had a long historical development. The country’s participation in shadow education is among the highest in the world. A survey in 2003 indicated that $8 3 . 1 \%$ of elementary, $7 5 . 3 \%$ of middle school, and $5 6 . 3 \%$ of high school students received private tutoring3 (Choi et al. 2003). Korea is also known for its drastic reforms of shadow education, where the government banned the use of tutoring in 1980, with a strong drive for equalization. By addressing the issue of private tutoring, a major concern of that time, the government attempted to gain domestic popularity. However, the ban was not effective and the policy was gradually relaxed, until shadow education was finally legalized in 2000. Although the government’s intent on equalization had some positive effects, such as increasing the secondary school enrollment, shadow education remained prevalent and the expenditures on tutoring kept rising (Lee 2005; Mori 2008).

Worldwide shadow education

While earlier studies on shadow education emphasized cultural and historical backgrounds that were specific to each country, recent studies focus on global similarities and the spread of the practice worldwide. By integrating studies from a wide range of countries and regions, Bray (1999) documented the growth of shadow education across the world. The range of countries included Egypt, Tanzania, Greece, Malta, Brazil, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Taiwan. In addition to the large scale of shadow education, he explained backgrounds and impacts of the phenomenon and examined some policy responses. He found that shadow education was banned in some countries on the grounds that it distorted formal education and maintained and/or exacerbated inequality, but also found that it was encouraged in some countries in order to help students with additional and tailored instructions.

Soon after Bray’s study, subsequent researchers provided further empirical evidence on this topic. While Bray used data and reports from individual countries, Baker et al. (2001) used a large international survey of schooling and achievement to show the worldwide existence of shadow education. Analyzing the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data, Baker and his colleagues showed that substantial amount of shadow education in mathematics existed all over the world, even in countries where the existence of shadow education had not been previously reported. They found high rates of participation in Columbia, Slovakia, and Philippines, but also appreciable rates of $10 \%$ in some European countries without much of a tradition in shadow education, such as Norway, Germany, Sweden, France and Netherlands.

Recent studies across the world

These cross-national studies stimulated further studies, and policy formation about shadow education in many countries. In the United States, shadow education has seen a rapid expansion under the No Child Left Behind Act promulgated in 2002, under which school districts are mandated to provide supplemental education services to schools that failed to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) for three consecutive years. In 2006–2007, 3.3 million students were eligible for Title I supplemental educational services, a six-fold increase since 2002–2003 (U.S. Department of Education 2009). In addition, a longitudinal study has revealed positive effects of tutoring on student achievement (U.S. Department of Education 2007).

In Canada, a study found that about $24 \%$ of Ontario parents with school-aged children have hired tutors in 2002, and the tutoring business has grown between 200 and $500 \%$ in major Canadian cities over the past 30 years (Aurini and Davies 2004). Foreshadowing the institutional argument developed below, Aurini and Davies described the transformation of shadow education in Canada as becoming more ‘‘school-like,’’ referring to the increase of learning-center franchises which differ from the existing small-scale operators. Aurini (2006) also examined private tutoring in Canada as a case of legitimation, suggesting that tutoring develops in an isomorphic form to regular schools.

Besides these developments in North America, tutoring has also developed in European countries. A study of educational opportunities in Greece suggested the mediating effect of shadow education between family background and academic achievement (Katsillis and Rubinson 1990). Following Bray’s study in 1999, monitoring of private tutoring in post-socialist Eurasian countries started in 2003. Silova et al. (2006) showed that in Azerbaijan, $93 \%$ of the respondents reported that they had received private tutoring in the form of lessons or courses during their final year of secondary school; $80 \%$ reported receiving such tutoring in Georgia; $79 \%$ in Ukraine; $71 \%$ in Mongolia; $66 \%$ in Poland; and $56 \%$ in Slovakia. In Turkey, private tutoring called dersane was examined in relation with national examinations for advancing to upper levels of schooling (Tansel and Bircan 2008). In England, U.K., estimates suggest that $27 \%$ of primary and secondary school students had a private tutor for exams and help with daily learning (Ireson and Rushforth 2004). These studies show that the recent development of private tutoring is indeed occurring at the worldwide level.

# Why has shadow education expanded in the schooled society?

At the core of the supplemental education activity is the ancient educational form of tutoring, which often was used to educate children in all kinds of society in lieu of formal schooling. From this limited educational practice, a number of forms of shadow education emerged as a way to enhance students’ educational opportunities in expanding mass public education. It then evolved along with rising national education systems in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to sizable proportions in some places for specific social strata. An organizational form of shadow education has also expanded to include an array of more complex and intensive practices beyond simple one-on-one tutoring practice. Now, as described earlier, shadow education is a worldwide phenomenon used by a wide spectrum of students even in nations that had little such activity only a few decades ago. There is so much evidence of its spread that shadow education practices appear to be on the verge of becoming a standard feature of education in most nations. What arguments can be made about why this has happened over a relatively short time period?

We suggest that the best way to hypothesize about this trend is to see it as a consequence of a robust education culture that not only homogenizes formal education worldwide but also profoundly influences other social institutions. Starting with the slowly accruing influence of the western university over the course of its development and culminating in the spread of mass schooling over the past 60 years, education has become one of a few foundational social revolutions that have shaped modern, and post modern, society. Worldwide shadow education is most accurately understood when it is put within this context.

The larger context of education’s influence as a social institution is employed to explain recent world trends in shadow education. Building off an earlier similar analysis by Baker and LeTendre (2005), we start with a brief description of the traditional way the connections among shadow education, education overall, and society are thought of, and then we develop a perspective on shadow education from an institutional constructivist model of education and society.

The two main ways that shadow education as a large educational phenomenon continues to be analyzed by social scientists and education policy-makers stem from the same model of the relationship between education and society—what can be called the traditional model of education and society. This common model considers the primary role of schooling to be chiefly one of a ‘‘helping role’’ in creating the overall social and economic complexity of society through socializing students through teaching of the formal curriculum. Hence, at the heart of the traditional model is the notion of education as mostly training individuals and allocating them to jobs and social status in each successive generation of children. Also, the traditional model assumes that the social and economic positions to which it allocates adults are more or less fixed by processes operating beyond formal education, or in other words, education as an institution is not a major force in the expansion and transformation of society in any significant direction beyond socializing individuals (Baker 2009).

From this traditional model, shadow education is frequently analyzed in one of two opposing ways: one as a ‘‘preparer for society’’ and the other as a ‘‘reproducer of society.’’ The former stems from a general human capital argument and referred to sociologically as a technical functional process. This perspective reasons that as the labor market of society becomes more complex (technically or otherwise), formal education in its preparation role expands to meet this need. From this perspective, shadow education provides more opportunities for learning in a world where more learning is demanded by an ever more complex job market. It is an easy step from here to assume that shadow education serves a valuable collective purpose and even helps to meet unmet demand for more education, as public education seems to lag behind. For example, this was in part the initial understanding of shadow education in Japan and other East Asian nations by American policymakers, in the wake of the Nation at Risk era when a crisis of confidence in public schooling occurred as a provider of an effective future workforce (U.S. Department of Education 1987).

The latter way shadow education has been thought of stems from a general Marxist argument and sociologically referred to as a conflict process. This perspective reasons that an expanding capitalist economic system needs compliant workers with some essential skills, and a politically valid replenishment of competent elites. From this perspective, nations with extensive shadow education use by elite families for advanced educational opportunity confirm the reproductive nature of education (e.g. Stevenson and Baker 1992). It is an easy step from here to understand why some policy-makers (and whole governments) can consider shadow education as a producer of problematic social inequality, and even as a form of corruption of the education system (Bray 2003; Heyneman 2009).

In contrast to these more traditional ways to understand worldwide shadow education, we consider an institutional model hypothesizing that the evolving practices of supplemental education, how they are organized and who uses them for what reasons, are an outgrowth of the maturing education revolution. We think this more accurately fits the empirical evidence from around the world. Shadow education not only assists in allocation of individuals to social roles (as per either human capital or reproduction perspectives); it has come to possess its own institutional power, enhanced by the institutional logic of education in general in the postmodern society.

Over the past 50 or 60 years, the world has experienced an education revolution (e.g. Baker and LeTendre 2005; Meyer and Rowan 1977; Ramirez and Boli 1987). Demographically, going to school and attending for a considerable number of years is a new and massive change in behavior of children and youth, and supporting this endeavor is a new role for their families and communities. There were relatively small numbers of children attending primary schooling throughout the nineteenth century across the world, but over the first few decades of the twentieth century, growth in primary enrollment took off and by 1940 burst into a logarithmic climb. As primary schooling reached large numbers of children 20 years later, enrollment in secondary schooling turned sharply up in the 1960s. And then in the early 1970s, enrollment in higher education began to grow, now to the point where tertiary education is undergoing unprecedented expansion (Schofer and Meyer 2005). Growing education is supported both by national governments and international agencies (UNESCO 2009).

This is not just a function of population growth, instead, what education demographers call ‘‘gross enrollment rates’’—or the percent of school aged children and youth attending schooling—have grown steadily, with only the most extreme social and political events retarding growth at certain times in some nations (e.g. Baker et al. 2007). This stepwise revolution in school enrollments, increasingly justified as preparing all children for the adult world, was first undertaken in wealthier nations, but since the middle of the twentieth century has spread globally (Benavot and Riddle 1988; Fuller and Rubinson 1992). Mass schooling today is more or less a taken-for-granted world institution, but it is a distinctively Western cultural product. It has become widespread because of its powerful transforming properties and, for better or worse, has pulled the rest of the world toward a Western model of society. There is common, widespread belief that mass education is integral to achieving the ‘‘good society’’ (Baker and LeTendre 2005; Meyer 2000).

Consequently, the average length of individuals’ school attainment continues to rise worldwide. In what is often referred to as the ‘‘developed world,’’—rich or at least upper middle-income nations—average educational attainment across the entire population is now slightly over

12 years of schooling. Importantly, a large group of lower middle- and low-income nations now have expected attainment of over 9 years (UNESCO 2009). The multilateral campaign to bring basic schooling to all children worldwide continues on with some major challenges to full implementation, but with wide political support nevertheless.

Over the past several decades some social scientists examining the dimension and impact of the education revolution have claimed that this major trend in society has transformed the relationship between education and society. Using ideas from a theoretic perspective known as neoinstitutionalism, these accounts show that the social institution of formal education (from early childhood schooling through upper reaches of university training) is now so robust that it has a large independent influence on society.

This perspective suggests that formal education as a social institution constructs significant portions of modern society (Meyer 1977). Occupations and adult social status are created anew, along with emerging privileged qualities of knowledge, expanded concept of human development and capacities, new approaches to work, more types of experts and elaborated educated social statuses, and even a new concept of society itself. Not only are people trained and credentialed through schooling, they also are thought to have enhanced cognitive skills that are essential to their overall functioning. These people are placed into a society that is itself changed by the ideas of what enhanced cognitive skills and widespread education can do for all aspects of society. From this perspective, the educational revolution has brought about a schooled society, where concepts about central parts of society are influenced by a robust culture of education (Baker 2009).

From this perspective, shadow education is produced by the education culture of a schooled society, and is itself part of the constructing force of education. The practice of shadow education spreads worldwide because the schooled society spreads worldwide; the use of shadow education is motivated by the dominant logic of educational expansion in all its forms. This argument also subsumes both the essential functions of shadow education from the human capital and conflict perspectives; supplemental activities follow the logic of more instruction and learning of the former, and can also be motivated by the fact that educational credentials are increasingly the main routes to adult social status, as in the latter. But the neo-institutional perspective expands on both of these and sees shadow education not as just a narrow supplement to learning or as only a form of family-financed educational opportunity (Baker and LeTendre 2005, especially Chapter 4). Instead, there is a symbiotic relationship between the schooled society and shadow education; as the former intensifies, the logic of the latter expands and heads toward a universal practice. Shadow education goes along with the expansion of formal education to younger children and longer into adulthood in many nations.

Further, shadow education is developed into a robust social institution along with the institutional development of education in general. Most shadow education is private business, so market forces assist in its spread, but the businesses do this along the same institutional logic of mass education. These services are now publically recognized and discussed, and the companies continue to expand services for larger arrays of clients’ educational needs. All the while shadow education becomes more normative to the point of being a partner institution to formal education itself. For example, as part of their menu of services, Canadian supplemental education franchises routinely prepare and teach for official school credit courses for students who otherwise do not have access to a course in their official schools (Aurini and Davies 2004). These developments take shadow education well beyond specific processes of national elite formation, as the evolution of Japanese shadow education clearly illustrates in the following paragraph.

# Transformation of shadow education in Japan4

In Japan, shadow education is historically rooted in traditional practices that have been described by international analysts of education as a unique national cultural formation. However, like in many other nations, Japanese shadow education has gradually been transformed by the institutional logic of formal schooling and has come to share increasingly similar characteristics with the newly developed shadow education systems in other countries. While some journalists tend to depict Japanese tutoring as a special case, with titles such as ‘‘crazy for cramming’’ (Business Week 2005), recent transformations in the industry and societal perceptions about Japanese shadow education suggest that it is not a unique case. These changes illustrate how all such practices in all nations might develop in the future. As an institutional perspective predicts, worldwide trends are converging toward a similar model of shadow education across the world.5

Educational institutions in the feudal period

The historical origin of Japanese shadow education dates back at least to the seventeenth century, and some scholars see the root of the current shadow education in the earlier educational institutions that existed during this time. Since there was no mass education in this period, it is debatable whether these practices were truly ‘‘shadow’’ ones, yet there was then a distinction between public and private education and the latter provided more flexible and diverse type of education.

These old but organized forms of education existed before the establishment of modern national education in 1872 in the early Meiji period. During the feudal Edo period (1603–1867), also known as the Tokugawa period, education for various groups of people developed. One of these systems, hanko (fief schools), for children of samurai and ruling class families, taught the cultural, moral and martial subjects thought necessary to rule the country. Only a limited number of children received such education, and school fees were paid as formal personal gifts or sometimes as food to individual teachers. Education was primarily class-based in the feudal period, as the elites were educated separately and differently from other classes.

While hanko were public institutions organized by the local government, there were also private institutions organized by educated individuals and local Buddhist priests. One of these institutions includes shijuku, small independent private schools which taught various advanced academic subjects including Chinese studies, calligraphy, National Learning (kokugaku), and Western learning. In contrast to hanko, shijuku had no official curriculum and were open to people of all classes. Regardless of social origins, anyone from merchant, peasant, and samurai classes could attend the shijuku; and similarly to hanko, payments were made as money or formal gifts.

Terakoya was another type of major private educational practice during the Edo period. As tera means temple, the learning originally took place in temples. Teachers were often Buddhist monks, doctors, samurais and other educated individuals, and the students were children of commoners. They gathered in temples or teachers’ homes and received the basic education in reading, writing and arithmetic that were necessary for real life. Terakoya required some compensation based on family circumstances, on appropriate festive gift-giving occasions. Dore (1965: 254) estimated that as many as $40 \%$ of all Japanese boys and $10 \%$ of Japanese girls received such education during the period. Behind the prevalence of these institutions was the rise of a merchant class and the need for a practical education that would help children to succeed in their hereditary occupation.

Both in shijuku and terakoya, teachers were often respected elders of the community, who formed intimate mentoring relationship with their disciples. They taught not only academic subjects but also non-academic subjects, disciplines, and life lessons. On the eve of the founding of the modern national educational system in 1872, these frequently used, traditional public and private practices were educational institutions in their own right, but their goals would soon begin to shift.

Establishment of modern national education and the prewar period

A while after the beginning of the modern education, as enrollment in primary schools grew and a small population became eligible for secondary and tertiary education, shadow education for elite students preparing for entrance examination started to grow. Following the end of feudal Tokugawa legacy and the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan sought to establish a strong, centralized nation state by abolishing its old class-based system. During this period, Japan opened the country to the West, recovering from its 200 years of national isolationist policy. At first, these new modern schools charged tuition for all except for poorer families, but by 1900 tuition had been abolished.

Although it took time for Japanese society to accept the idea of universal primary education, the old hanko, shijuku, and teyakoya were gradually merged into, or replaced by, the new formal schools. In 1873, the enrollment for primary school was $3 9 . 9 \%$ for boys and $1 5 . 1 \%$ for girls. The respective figures rose to 69.3 and $3 5 . 3 \%$ by 1884, and by 1905 enrollment reached nearly universal proportions $( 9 8 \%$ for boys and $93 \%$ for girls) (Monbusho 1981). As a further sign of the increasing institutionalization of modern schooling in the nation, the government extended the length of compulsory education from its original 4–6 years in 1907.

In contrast to the prevalence of primary education, secondary and tertiary education were slow to expand. Because of the limited resources and positions, competition was already severe in the 1890s. Adding to the competition, educational backgrounds became important for bureaucrats as well as for medical doctors and secondary school teachers. For example, in 1887 when the Japanese government established a system for hiring civil servants, greater weight was given to schools from which candidates graduated, in addition to results of the civil service examinations (Amano 1989).

During this period, the first shadow education companies were established, such as the major firms called Sundai, Zkai, and Kawai-juku, founded in 1918, 1931, and 1933, respectively. The purpose of these companies was to help students prepare for competitive examination of high schools and universities of the students’ choice. Although universal primary education had been achieved, by 1937, only $10 \%$ of boys continued onto academic lower secondary school, a first step to proceed to prestigious universities (Schoppa 1991: 25). While the modern form of Japanese shadow education began to operate, educational competition was still limited to elite families so the growth in the industry was moderate. So too, starting in the 1930s, Japan was governed by an extreme militaristic regime and all regular education was interrupted. Consequently, operation of shadow education also ceased during the Second World War, but the stage had been set for the tremendous growth in shadow education as an industry in the postwar period.

Postwar period and the growth of shadow education institutions

Along with substantial postwar educational expansion, the number of shadow education institutions also increased. During this period, an emerging robust institutional logic of formal schooling started to transform the characteristics of shadow education. Starting in 1945 in an occupied Japan, the education system was reformed into an egalitarian single-track primary and secondary system with intentional similarity to the American system. Enrollment rate for universities and junior colleges also began to increase in this period. For instance, the number of universities reached 226 in 1953 compared to 12 in 1948 (Monbusho 1981). By the end of the 1970s, as educational opportunities expanded, the government introduced standardized entrance examination (Kyotsu-ichiji) for national universities in place of each institution’s own examinations. At this point, the Japanese educational system had become much closer to the sociologist of social stratification Ralph Turner’s image of a contest model versus an elite-sponsored one (1960). Now with the reform of comprehensive secondary schools, large cohorts of undifferentiated students were eligible for the same open competition for limited admission to the university. Under such a system, modern shadow education had a significant niche to grow in Japanese society, plus two additional features greatly intensified its growth. The first was the institution of a widely known hierarchy of universities with tight links to status levels in the white-collar labor market (Rohlen 1980; Stevenson and Baker 1992).

As secondary schooling in Japan expanded toward mass education, shadow education experienced massive growth and became embedded within the Japanese education culture. For example, in addition to the shadow education companies that existed before the war, additional major tutoring companies (juku and yobiko6 ) were established during the postwar educational expansion.7 Figure 1 shows the participation rates in shadow education in Japan over the decades. Although there are no official statistics of shadow education prior to 1976 when the government survey on juku started, shadow education in the 1950s and early ${ } ^ { \circ } 6 0 \mathrm { s }$ was still mostly used by elite students, as the overall enrollment in secondary and tertiary education was limited. For example, the high school enrollment was about $50 \%$ in 1955, and the tertiary enrollment was only about $10 \%$ . However, similar to what was occurring throughout developed nations worldwide, the next two decades saw a rapid expansion in enrollment rates, so that by 1975, high school enrollment reached over $90 \%$ , and tertiary enrollment reached around $40 \%$ . While the majority of youth in the 1970s became eligible for tertiary education through mass comprehensive secondary education, it took another three decades for tertiary education to fully expand and provide opportunities for the masses. This lagged development of tertiary education created extreme pressure for high school seniors to compete for limited access, and this pressure fueled demand for shadow education.

Fig. 1 Elementary and Middle school students’ shadow education participation and tertiary enrollment in Japan (1976–2008). Note that these figures only include participation in juku, excluding home tutors, correspondence courses, and non-academic lessons. Although names of the reports differ by years, all surveys were conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Education to grade 1–9 students in elementary and middle schools, for the purpose of understanding children’s out-of-school learning activities. However, while the 1976, 1985, and 1993 studies included students in both public and private schools as they were household surveys, the 2008 study only included students in public school as it was a school-based survey. Regarding the comparability of these surveys, see Monbukagakusho (2008: 6–7). Tertiary enrollment includes universities, junior colleges, and special training schools (Source: Monbusho 1976, 1985, 1993; Monbukagakusho 2008)

Participation in shadow education expanded through the 1970s and 80s. This was at the same time when somewhat negative slogans such as ‘‘exam hell’’ (juken jigoku) and ‘‘a period flooded with tutoring’’ (ran-juku jidai) were used by the national media to depict shadow education and its conditions. Originally, a term for wondering masterless samurai, ronin (students who failed to gain entrance and spent a year in limbo preparing for the next round of university entrance exams) as a university entrance strategy also gained popularity in the 1960s. Throughout these periods, buying shadow education became a normal, even institutionalized, activity with expanded services for preparing secondary students for the university entrance exam.8 And during this time, the industry expanded its cliental to include not only high school students and high school graduates retaking exams but also middle school students and a small number of elementary school students received shadow education.

Contrary to the widely held image, participation in shadow education in high school is lower than that of middle schools. This is true for several reasons. While college preparatory juku and yobiko are prevalent in metropolitan areas, some high schools also provide extra lessons during summer or after school, especially for final year students. In addition, while the enrollment for universities and junior colleges is currently just around $50 \%$ , enrollment for high schools is close to $100 \%$ , where the majority faces some kind of examination or evaluation in order to proceed to high schools. Therefore, more middle school students are likely to receive shadow education than those in high schools.

Not only did shadow education experience quantitative growth but also it faced qualitative changes. In the postwar period, all of the shadow education companies had begun as small-scale businesses headed by individual entrepreneurs, but as formal education expanded, the shadow education industry also developed and transformed itself. For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, Kawai-juku scaled up its business, opened branches, sold national franchises, and augmented its academic tutoring with detailed career counseling and lifestyle guidances (Kawai-juku 1985). Another prominent company, Z-kai, expanded in a similar fashion (Zoshinkai 1991). During the same period, the company diversified its course offerings, introduced a computer management system, and changed itself from a limited-ownership company to a publically traded corporation for further capital growth. Similarly, many shadow education companies grew into large corporate organizations during this period. In 1988, the industry became governed by the then Ministry of International Trade and Industry, as well as being monitored by the Ministry of Education, and it established an industry-wide organization called the Japan Juku Association. While shadow education had become deeply embedded in Japanese society by this point, it was posed to undergo yet another transformation.

Global transformation of shadow education

With more expansion and organizational diversification of tertiary education plus the greater globalization of education structures across nations, Japanese education went through a similar series of changes in the late 1990–2000s. The tertiary sector not only increased in size but also offered a variety of courses and majors for students. It also offered various ways of admitting students such as by essays and special talents, in addition to traditional written examinations. During this period, the number of ronin also decreased.9 These institutional changes in the tertiary sector, which were also occurring at a worldwide level (Schofer and Meyer 2005), transformed Japanese shadow education in the following ways.

For example, general expansion of services offered by these companies reflects the growing value of education at all levels. The older formula of providing intense but narrow services for university (and before, secondary school) entrance exams has continued since competition for top universities and top white-collar jobs continues, but there is now a much wider menu of services for all kinds of students. Some large companies now educate pre-school children and adult learners, in addition to the teaching of academic subjects to school-age students, including subjects from English, arts and designs, study abroad, hotel management, to sports medicine. Indeed, these institutions aim to become comprehensive educational institutions. Roesgaard (2006) calls such trend toward the comprehensiveness of the industry as ‘‘Benessification,’’ borrowing a name from the major company Benesse, which originally started as a correspondence (distance) education company. Companies advertize their materials through brochures and websites and attempt to solicit consumer demands. As the market is huge, a wide range of services and prices exist, from more basic and reasonable ones to more challenging and expensive ones. Instructions are becoming more individualized and flexible, due to the introduction of one-toone learning options and the use of technologies such as DVDs. The above examples illustrate how a distinctly national practice of shadow education in Japan is transforming to the logic of the global model of education culture, leaving behind the national and traditional forms.10

Furthermore, some Japanese shadow education companies are now operating at a global level. The Kumon method, developed by educator Toru Kumon, is one of the largest mathematics and language educational systems in the world. Established in Japan in 1958 and started overseas franchising in the mid 1970s, the company serves over 4 million children at more than 26,000 Kumon Centers in 46 countries as of 2009. This shows an example where a Japanese model of shadow education developed into a global model, along with its recent transformations.

Institutional response of the Japanese government

This trend of increasing institutionalization can also be observed from the shifting attitudes of the Japanese government toward shadow education. Following the early national expansion of shadow education for university entrance exam preparation, the media started to report the downsides of excessive shadow education in the 1970s. These reports expressed concerns for students’ stress due to cramming and casted doubt on the nature of learning in shadow education. In response to such climate, in 1976, the Ministry of Education conducted the first official national survey on shadow education. Although the government did not exercise any direct regulations on the industry, they instead started to monitor the growth of the phenomenon.

In a rapidly changing environment of the 1980s, the Ministry’s concern toward shadow education intensified. This was the time when the Prime Minister’s Ad hoc Council on Education (Rinkyoshin) (1984–1987) was held to discuss the long-term educational reform. The basic principles included emphasis on strong individuality (kosei), shift toward lifelong learning, and response to internationalization. During these discussions, in 1987, the Council mentioned the possibility of shadow education to contribute to public education. Although the Council’s report showed concerns for the detrimental effect of shadow education on child’s health and their excessive commercialism, it also mentioned the possibility that shadow education could respond to the increased diverse and individual learning needs outside of formal education. Some council members even insisted that existing juku to be seen as legitimate private schools, but their suggestion was never realized (Monbusho 1988).

During the 1990s, the government’s attitude toward shadow education has turned cautiously positive, yielding the current stable relationship between schools and shadow education. For example, in 1999, Council on Lifelong Learning in the Ministry of Education officially recognized a positive role of shadow education as community-based afterschool learning institutions, but report still expressed concerns about excessive participation in the competitive type of shadow education and its detrimental effect on children’s health.

Since 2000, some local governments have been seeking to increase partnerships between school and juku in order to support students’ after-school learning. These juku that are allowed to enter schools sometimes even provide academic counseling for students’ future paths. With these recent changes, shadow education in Japan is slowly legitimating its role in public education and is now becoming a regular dimension of public policy about education. This is no doubt in part because of growing practice of postmodern shadow education in many other nations. Although still controversial, the societal perception has been shifting to increasing recognition and acceptance.

# Toward universal supplemental education

The Japanese case illustrates a number of features of our institutional argument about what is causing the worldwide expansion of supplemental education and what role these practices will play in education into the future. Our argument applied to the Japanese case is summarized in Table 1 across three stages of the evolution of shadow education.

The driving changes in shadow education are themselves bound up in the education system overall, all of which are connected to this nation’s historically varying link to world society over its development. As the nation’s official education system moved toward the world model of education over time, the structure and logic of the educational system shaped the practices of shadow education, as to who purchased them for what goals. So as education as an institution changes, so does shadow education.

This is particularly evident in what happened to Japanese shadow education in the late 1980s. There is more than irony in the fact that just as Japanese shadow education was internationally ‘‘discovered’’ as a uniquely national practice in the wake of international achievement studies of the mid-1980s, it was on the verge of adopting an emerging global model based on broader educational goals. And along with the rest of the world, Japanese shadow education has gone onto be based on this global model. This happened because of the greater homogenization of the institutional qualities of educational organizations and their goals across nations (Baker and LeTendre 2005).

Postwar Japan’s unique combination of traditional shadow education, high-stakes examinations, and close connections between a hierarchy of universities and labor market position in a sense supercharged the market demand for exam preparation services. But as Japan joined in on the worldwide expansion of tertiary education, and made reforms toward the emerging global model of schooling for lifelong human development instead of personnel allocation and elite production, its shadow education industry significantly changed in this direction too.

Nations such as Japan, South Korea, and others with extensive shadow education which developed out of a nationally unique model (or perhaps an older world model) of education are now shifting toward the world norm of supplemental services for a wide range of learning objectives. Tellingly too, nations without an earlier tradition of shadow education, like the U.S. and Canada, are changing to meet the Japans and Koreas at a point where shadow education is transformed into supplemental education for learning by all students.

# Coming out of the shadows

In 2005, Baker and LeTendre asked if Korea’s shadow education industry, the most used and capital-intensive system in the world, is in all of our futures? Then as now, we think that answer is no, at least not in this form. Rather, the Japanese case quite clearly illustrates what will likely happen in the future. While prolific shadow education as an ‘‘outside-of-education’’ process has increasingly becoming practiced and bought throughout the world, the history of schooling and its pedagogical techniques have shown that resources and practices thought to alter all-important academic achievement are themselves rapidly institutionalized into education in postmodern society (Baker and LeTendre 2005). Therefore, what will most likely happen in the near future is that shadow education will be absorbed into the education culture in general; its institutional status will go (and partially already has gone) from ‘‘outsider to insider.’’

The robust institution of formal education in the postmodern world constructs a world where one’s cognitive achievement, and academic credentials verifying this, is considered paramount to personal success. And on a higher social level, it constructs a world where the educational process is granted great transformational power to enhance not only individuals but to achieve the good society as well (Meyer 2000). Things then connected to these constructions, like shadow education with its focus on extra learning, are swept up into this powerful institutional logic and are made legitimate along with it.

Without a doubt, social inequality exists and will persist regarding the participation in shadow education, and links between participation and parental education or income will continue to be governmental and academic topics. However, in recent years, governments consider such use of shadow education as more normative and positive, seeking to ensure more equal out-of-school learning opportunities for all children: or in other words, mass shadow education for societal progress. Rather than trying to eliminate shadow education to protect educational equality, local and national governments frequently try to create equivalent opportunities for learning, either by offering their own public after-school programs or by collaborating with private shadow education companies. The Japanese government, as perhaps many other nations’ governments now too, accepts the logic behind shadow education as part of the rising value of mass education for all. Thus, an influential policy idea becomes: ‘‘many students may not do well without receiving some kind of shadow (i.e. extra) education.’’

This basic acceptance and the incorporation of shadow education into the public policy in Japan are similar to policy responses in other countries. For example, it resembles the Korean model of after-school reform aimed at reducing the cost of shadow education.11 It also somewhat resembles the U.S. model of supplemental educational services under the No Child Left Behind act, where participation in tutoring is publicly subsidized for students in failing schools.

Certainly cases remain where shadow education can be shown to corrupt the quality and goals of public schooling, but these cases will likely become rarer in the less corrupt nations (although they may be increasing in politically corrupt nations). But ultimately their examples do not represent the best way to think about the worldwide supplementary education phenomenon. What we see, and the Japanese case so clearly illustrates, is shadow education increasingly coming out of the shadows as the institution of education makes these practices part of itself. Simply put, in the near future in most places mass shadow education will be a legitimate part of education itself.
