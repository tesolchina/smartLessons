A growing strand of work in ERPP (English for research publication purposes) explores how English is nested within research evaluation regimes in non-Anglophone contexts across the world. This paper focuses on the under-researched context of Russia, where language of research publication is at the heart of tensions in institutional, national and international research evaluation regimes: between Russian, which until the 1970s was the second-most used language in the world's total scientific output, and English, the dominant language of global evaluation indexes.

The paper uses documentary sources to outline recent structural transformations in Russian academia, including the relatively recent insertion of English into evaluation systems. It draws on an interview-based study to explore how 16 scholars in one research-intensive university are navigating such changes in their publication practices, in three disciplines: economics, sociology and philosophy. Key findings highlight: 1) scholars' languages of publication; 2) the challenging material conditions shaping scholars' opportunities for research writing; 3) the pressures to publish in English alongside Russian; 4) the ways in which language choice is refracted through geohistorical disciplinary conversations' traditions; 5) the challenges of navigating different discourse communities. The value of such studies for ERPP within EAP as a field is underlined.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past 20 years, a growing body of research has centred on academic writing for publication, documenting the growing dominance f Englis as the medium of academic/scientific publications gloall for overviews see Curry & Lillis 2019; Kuteeva & Mauranen, 2014). A key strand of such research has sought to track the impact of the privileging of English in powerful indexes, notably the We of Science (Wos), exploring how such indexes are buil into aluation regimes (Lills, 2018, afer lommaert 2005); that is stms at national, inttional and dartmental levels used to evaluate cholars writen rerchoututs. Sch reimes have been shown to have profound consequence for institutions, in securing funds for research activit, and individual scholars in securing jobs, promotion, grants (Bnett, 2014; Cagill et al, 019 Lills & Curry, 010. Whilst some stdie confirm the insertion (explicitly or implicily f Eish into aluiim ( for xmple, Bige e l., 2018 rr  Lills, 2015; illis  Crr, 2015), thre is much till to learn about the nature of evaluation regimes operating in many national contexts and their impact on cholars' languages of publication.

In this paper, we focus on the Russian Federation (RF), an under-researched geopolity in the growing literature on how nonAnglophone scholars across the world navigate shifting evaluation regimes. In contrast to many previously researched contexts, Russia was until recently asignificant player in the global knowledge economy and in the 1970s, Russian was the second-most used language in the world'stotal cientific output (Hamel, 2007; Kirchik t al., 2012; Zakharov, 2013). After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, the RFs position in global rankings dropped signficanly, leading to stragic initiaties seeking to incrse its status. In such initiatives, English has become central, not only because of its use as a global lingua franca of science (Ferguson, 2007; Henshal, 2018; Kuteeva & Mauranen, 2014) but also because English is key to an influential global arbiter f research quality: that is, the Wos indexes, originall produced by Thomson Reuters, now owned by Clarivate Analytics. These indexes (Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index and Arts and Humanities Index), which use the notion of journal ranking and impact factor to quantify and rank the quality of research publications, overwhelmingly include journals that are in the medium of English and are used to inform evaluation regimes around the world (Li, 2014; Lillis & Curry, 2015; Tian et al., 2016).

Whilst English is central to Wos, the ways in which Wos is codified into universty level policies and impacts on scholars practices vary. Lee and ee (2013), for example, ilustrate a strong aligment acos scalar levels state, universty, department, individual) in their study of a Korean university: criteria for hiring, promotion grant funding and salaries are directly related to scholars securing publications in English-medium journals in WoS indexes, thus leading to strong pressure to publish in English and institutional discrimination against non-English scholarship' (p.227). In other national/regional contexts, however, the high value of WoS at the level of the state contrasts with other value systems at other scales. In weden, for example, a parall language policy prevail at the supra-national (Nordic) level (McGrath, 2014) and in other contexts a range of aditional indexes and universty-based criteria are being brought to bear, for example, the criterion of foreign' publication, rather than Wos/English, in Turkey and Mexico (Englander & Uzuner-Smith, 2013) and Hungary (Nagano & Spiczene, 2018). In some contexts, in addition to 'core WoS indexes, nationally-driven additional' WoS indexes, are used, notably the Chinese Science and Social Sciences Citation Index (CsCI, csscI) which evidences state level support for scholarly publications in Chineseas well as English and impacts on universty and individual scholars' practices in complex ways (e.g. Feng et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2016).

Whether initiatives and policies align across different scalar lels, and regardlessof how rigidy core Wos indexes are used, the situation faced by many scholars outside of the Anglophone centre is increasingly not whether or not to publish in English but how to include English medium publishing with their complex publishing agendas' (Curry & Lillis 2019). This paper focuses on the ways in which English has become inserted into national and institutional policy and evaluation regimes and is impacting on the writing for publication of Russian scholars in three different disciplines: economics, sociology and philosophy.

The paper begins by documenting the transformations in academia in the RF,followed by an overview of the study on which this paper is based. The main part of the paper discusses key findings 1) cholars' languages of publication; 2) the challenging material conditions shaping scholars opportunitie for research writing; 3 the pressures to publish in English alongside Russian; 4) the extent and ways in which language choice is refracted through geopolitically located disciplinary traditions; 5) the challenges of engaging with different linguistic and discourse communities. The paper concludes by underlining the value of the study for EAP.

# 2. Transformations in Russian academia and the linguistic media of science

The Academy of Sciences, established under the strong intellectual influence of continental Europe in the 18th century, was until recently the principal research-generating body. Under the UssR, this state-governed institution, with its wide network f research centers (Altbach, 2013) was highly successul ingenerating research output, particularly in the natural sciences (Zakharov, 2013). The dominant language of publication was Russian. The structure and organization of the Academy of Sciences in the UssR was inherited by the RF.

Afer the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the research context shifted significantly and resulted in a downturn in research output and ranking. Firstly, in the period immediately afer 1991, there was a notable decrease in output by Russian scholars, from 40,000 papers, in 1990, to 25,00, in 1993 (Kirchik et al., 2012). Secondly, and relatedly, the position of the RF in global rankings, based on output indexed in WoS, moved from third worldwide (afer the USA and the UK), to 15th position in 2009 (afer India, Australia South Korea, Brazil, the Netherlands). As a consequence of its lower research outut and position in intenational research rankings, research activity was fundamentall retructured from 2006 onwards: research (which had previously been the key function of Academy of Science although informal links with universitie often existed) became an aditional function of universities the number of academic staff was significantly reduced acrossall institutions, acompanied by areduction in aerage salary (Zakharov, 2013; Prakhov, 2019, as well as job insecurity (Altbach, 2013).

In this significantly transformed national context for research, two major state-led initiatives were launched to try and revitalise research outut acivity and improve the RFs position in global rankings. The first i the National Proect Science", launched in 2013, and involving significant investment, aimed at securing the F's presence among the worlds fie leading countries in the priority areas of science and technology. Efforts over the years seem to have had some success. In 2017, the RF produced $5 6 \%$ more publications primarily in English-medium journals indexed in the WoS 'core collection' than in 2012 (with a $6 8 \%$ growth of research articles).' At the same time, the number of Russin journals inthe WoS core collction' increased from 196 in 2015 to 238 journals in 2017, with journals in the top quartiles in the natural sciences being predominantly in English, whilst journals in the social sciences and humanities were in Russin (for quartiles, se https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php).? This lattr point suggests that Russian. medium outlets were available for scholars working in the social sciences and humanities. However, the number of Russian. medium journals in WoS was tiny compared with the number of Rusian-medium journals available historicall (e.g. in 2017 there were only 3 Russian-medium Russian journals in the social sciences citation index), the indirec effct of which was the need for scholarsto direct their artice to English medium journals in order to be included in Wos. Given that there are few top quartil journals inthe linguistic medium of Russian acrossall dsciplinary ares, improving the global rankings of Russian research necesarily implies publishing in English.

At the same time, however, a second initiative, driven by the Academy of Sciences was launched which oriented more explicitly to the use of Russian: the establishment ofa new WoS database in 2014, the Russian Science Citation Index (RScI). The establishment of this index aimed to raise the level of Russian-medium journals by aligning them with Wos evaluation critria and replacing an existing key list and database used historically in Russia: the VAK list, comprising 643 Russian medium journals introduced in 2001 by the Ministry of Education\* and used to evaluate research output rquirements for awarding research degrees; and the Rusian Index of Science Citation $( \mathrm { R I S C } ) ^ { 6 }$ introduced in 2005 and comprising some 4000 journals which included those journals listed in VAK. The establishment of the Wos Rscl index involved a fundamental review of the existing RIsC index, leading to asignificant reduction in the number of Rusian-medium journals. During the period 2014-2016 the number of Russian-medium journals decreased from 4000 in the RISC) to 200 (in the RSCI), with the current RSCI figure standing at 792 (Moskaleva et al., 2018).

This brief account of the RF's recent attempts to secure a higher position in global rankings indicates that national intiatives acknowledge the centralit of English whilst at the same time legitimize the continued use of Russin. There is partial alignment between these state-led initiatives and evaluation practices at the institutional level. Our study evidences the influence of Wos in the universt's annual asessment of scholars research outputs which is irectl tied to individual salary schemes: nnual assesment includes a range of citeria such as overal number of publications (see 4.1), with higher points and a significant financial bonus awarded for publications in the top two quartiles of WoS indexes. Similarl, WoS is used in the employment criteria and assessment of research grant reports: at the time of the study, Elsevier's Scopus data base was also used. However, Russian-medium lists and databases are not mentioned in university level documents: there i no referenceto the VAK it, RISC, and/or RSCI. However, as scholars indicate in 4, the VAK list continues to have academic legitimacy, because f it use at national level .g. research funding bodies (see Lillis & Curry, 2010 for uncodified/informal practices).

Russian scholars are therefore currently working in a complex and dynamic context. It isin this contemporary context of significant institutional restructuring and range of intersecting evaluation regimes, that this paper explores Russian academics research writing practices, in particular their decisions around languages of publication.

# 3. The study

# 3.1. The larger study on which this paper is based

The paper draws on a three year study exploring the writing for publication practices of 16 scholars working in three disciplines - economics, sociology, philosophy-in one rearch-intensive insttion in the RF. In line with ethngraphic rientations (Lills 2008), the study uses multiple method of data collection to build context-rich understandings about scholars publication practices, including observation, interview, texts and documentary data. The lead researcher is an academic from a similar institutional context, wellplaced to encourage participation through informal networks whilst making a commitment to confidentiality and anonymity (ethical approval was given by the Open University Human Research Ethics Committee).

The criteria for participants selection were that they: were publishing/had published in Russian and English; held full ime aademic positions; were from one of the three selected disciplines-economics, sociology and philosophy. Whils participation from the specific disciplines was facilitated by the lead researcher's existing networks, theoretical considerations were also crucial. There is a well-established link between language and disciplinary knowledge making (e.g. Hyland, 2004; Larson, 2017; Prior, 1998) and a key interest was to explore publication practices across the spectrum of 'soft sciences (e.g. Becher, 1989): economics and sociology are often considered 'soft applied' disciplines, while philosophy is often considered to be soft pure' (Becher & Trowler, 2001) Furthermore, the study hypothesized that disciplinary practices may have specific geolinguistic histories (e.g. Bennet, 2007; 2014) which may influence scholars' decisions around language of publication.

As a single-site study within which each individual scholar is further conceptualised as an individual case (Yin, 2009), indings are specific to those scholars, specific disciplines and institution. At the same time, the study is in line with ethnographic research traditions which ee epistemological value in single cases to capture and illuminate key aspects of a particular phenomenon which might otherwise go unnoticed (Casanave, 2003; Mitchell, 1984).

# 3.2. The present study: research questions and methodology

This paper explores the following questions:

1. Which languages are scholars using in their research publications and why?   
2. How is the contemporary institutional context (e.g. the evaluation regime, the working conditions) shaping scholars' decisions about the language/s they publish in?   
3. To what extent are scholars' decisions about linguistic medium influenced by their research disciplines and paradigms?

The following specific datasets were used:

. Detailed curriculum vitae including scholars' employment histories, education trajectories, and research publication profile.   
: 16 interviews of approximately $\mathbf { 1 . 5 h }$ , transcribed. Interviews were carried out in English or Russian (or a mixture) according to participants' wishes. In this paper, Russian extracts have been translated by the lead researcher into English, staying as closely as possible to scholars expressions in Russian. We indicate whether English used in exracts are as in the original interview (original) or translated from Russian (translated).   
Pre and post interview email discussions (160 emails). Pre-interview emails focused on explaining the aims of the study and practical arrangements. Post-interview emails varied according to issues raised in the interviews, clarifying specific comments made in the interview or following up on comments made.

Particular value was placed on understanding participants acounts of their lived experiences (e.g. Ivanic, 1998), relating to three areas: education and academic career, writing for publication experience, and publishing in dfferent languages (see Appendix A). The use of interviews was part of longer conversations' (after Maybin, 1994), which in this study, were continued via email communi. cation to pursue issues and concerns rased by participants. Discussing the challenge faced in academic publication can be potentily face-threatening (e.g. Flowerdew, 200), therefore trust between the interviewer and interviewees based on existing relationships was crucial.

The lead researcher carried out extensive 'memoing' (Barton & Hamilton, 1998, p.69) to identify significant themes, paying attention to content and discourse (Lills, 2008). Attention to content involved treating at face value' what participants reported; attention to discourse involved treating the pecific wordings used by participants as signaling specific ways of understanding, being and doing in the world (Gee, 1996). The identification of key themes involved an iterative proces of moving back and forth between vertical analysis (focusing on individual scholars) and horizontal analysis (focusing on themes emerging across scholars accounts) (Barton & Hamilton, 1998). Ongoing iscussion of themes tok place between the lead researcher and co-authors, focusing on sample data analysis to agree emerging categories (for exemplification of the analytical process see Appendix B).

The lead researcher's own positioning and language choices impacted the data collection and analysis in many ways, some of which she was sharply aware of and worked hard to mitigate. Being an insider (a scholar in a Russian institution and a Russian speaker) facilitated aces and perhaps an initialassumption that participants would fee comfortabl in expressing their views. However, at times the lead researcher felt there was some reluctance to be frank. For example, some participants only briefly answered the question To what extent do you feelthat your writing practices are supported by the institution?, preferring to switch to a new question rather than expressa negative judgement about the instittion. Moving between Russian and English, the researcher became aware that some phrases were problematic: for example, the meaning of types of knowledge (interview question 7) was too vague for participants, in both English and Russian leading the researcher to provide examples t facilitate discussion. The researcher felt dissatisfied with the framing of the question although the comments generated suggest that some level of shared meaning between the researcher and participant had been reached (for example, the question followed by exemplification led to Evgenii talking about two currently competing epistemological camps in philosophy, see 4.4).

# 4. Findings

# 4.1. Scholars' languages of publication

All scholars have published to date in Russian and in English with Russian medium publications dominating, and only two other anguages of publicatio identified (Table 1, Fig. 1). Whilst there are individual differences in publication profiles allthee principal genres (books, book chapters and articles are reflected across the three disciplinary areas with the journal article dominating. In Table 1, monographs' (m) are distinguished from 'textbooks' (t) both of which are considered legitimate academic outputs in the university assessment criteria. Artices in this institution include only peer-reviewed academic journal articles and published conference procedings. English-medium publications are primarily journal articles and smallr in number compared with journal article output in Russian (Fig. 2).

Whilst focusing on a small number of aademics (11 of them are 'docents' which is the equivalent to associate professor), the publication profiles suggest variation in genres at the level of seniority and discipline. Table 1 indicates that more junior scholars in two disciplines may be more likely to publish in one pecific gere, the reearch article: in economics, Galina, the most senior academic has published a large number of books, as well a artices; i contrast Nadezhda, the more junior scholar, has only published articles. A similar pattern seems evident in sociology, where the most senior academic, Danil, has published 4 books and junior scholar, Vera articles and book chapters. Whilst this pattern may be due to differentia expertise in their fields (more senior cholars publishing books), the pattern in philosophy is more diverse, with the book genre continuing to hold sway with both junior and senior scholars.

With regard to linguistic medium, Russian continues to dominate among these scholars. However, data from interviews and email discussions suggest that this situation is changingas reult of recent policy initiatives as outlined in 2. The fllowing section aims to throw light on scholars' experiences and practices by focusing on key themes to emerge from interviews and ongoing discussions, beginning by documenting the challenging material conditions shaping scholars' opportunities for research writing.

4.2. No time to be a scientist': the challenging material conditions shaping scholars opportunities for research writing

All scholars explicitly signaled the unfavorable economic conditions impacting on their research. Four material factors were emphasized: 1) the necessty to hold multiple appointments 2) governmental funding cuts; 3) lack of time; and 4) lack of institutional resources to support English-medium writing. Each of these is discussed below.

First, since salaries are historically low in Russa, 13scholars reported holding additional jobs t secure a stable income. Most of these were academic-related, working as researchers or administrators in other research centers but also in non-academic jobs. For example, Nikita states:

I now perform in three roles: as an academic writer, as an analyst--and as a publicist who can explain some ssues to wider audience. I have to work in three regimes. (translated)

Margarita similarly has an additional non-academic job, writing report for busineses and Maria, runs a small farming business Second, scholars emphasize the recent restructuring and funding cuts by the state. Nikolai says state research grants have become scarce.

We used to have more funds and more projects. (original)

Older cholars are afected more negatively than younger scholars applications for state research grants are currently restricted to scholars ged 35 or younger.Younger scholars, Nadezhda and Margarita, say they manage to secure some funds for their research, while Galina, who has been working the longest in academia, says it would also be important for me' but that she is excluded from applying.

Third, all scholars talk about the limited time they have for their research and publishing in Rusian and English (see 4.3), a key eason being the increase in teaching and adminstration. Galina, like Vera, says she has time to write only during summer vacations.

The first month is totally writing. Nothing other than writing. (original)

Danil says regular meetings and administrative work requiretoo much time and as a result he does not currentl have any time for vriting papers:

I have a wonderful project --but I cannot find time to write it. No time to be a scientist. (translated)

Finally, scholars talk about limited resources essential for preparing English-medium publications, including proficiency in English. Natalia says producing an English-medium paper i difficult because of the limited acces to online databases due to reductions in university funding. Daria talks about her university libraries being poor and not having the English-medium monographs produced by Anglo-America center scholars essential for publishing in English lisaveta ays the reason she trie to travel abroad isto access these much-needed monographs:

There are several books that I cannot reach. I scanned them in [UK] university library. I cannot do without internships. (translated)

Ten of the scholars talk about not having the level of English proficiency necessary to produce articles for high impact' English medium journals. Natalia, Olga and Margaritatalk about the need to find people who can help translate their texts into English. Even Dmitri, who hassubstantial experiencefusing Englishfrom extended stays in the UK and Us, talks of the nee for greater support with English:

Now my greatest weakness is academic writing in English. Well I feel there is some progres ut too far from perfection. You cannot learn it [English research writing], you cannot be taught, it only comes with experience. (translated) The current specific material conditions create significant challenges for scholars in their research writing activities.

While the majority of scholars have published predominantly in Russian to date (Table 1), al scholars point to a significant shift. formal universt policies and state level initiatives currently (albeit sometimes idirectly) prioritize the publication of research in English.

Danil, who is the head of a research center, says increasing the number of English-medium publications is crucial for securing university funding for reearch activity. For this reason, he and his team publish primaril in English-medium Anglo-American journals listed in Wos.

We target top [North American] journals because we get paid for this [by the university]. We publish in firs quartile--Russian journals are indexed in Scopus yet obviously have zero impact-factor. (translated)

ialina similarly says the pressure to publish in high ranking international' journals has increased.

You may be a good teacher or businesses professional but only one thing which is interesting for university is how many papers you have published and where. (original) In addition to research funding, most scholars point to personal financial reward as a strong incentive for writing articles in English.

medium journals, an important motivator given low salaries (see 4.2). As outlined in 2, if cholars publish papers in high impact journals, they are awarded a financial bonus12 and, as reported by scholars, a $2 5 \%$ reduction in teaching hours. Diane states

Minus $2 5 \%$ of teaching workload13 frees you in a way. When there is none, everything is bad. (translated) Nina and Vera say that having fewer teaching hours is the only way to survive'. Daria says that the reduced teaching workload saves her valuable time for academic writing.

Elisaveta says that until recently she had not felt the pressure to publish in high impact English-medium journals and felt able to pursue her specific interest in organzing reearch events. However, she says she now ned to ublish in English because the financial reward is the only way to have a decent income to cover the needs of her family:

The problem is I have no money. It hastarted to worry me, because now, to have a normal salary, you need to publish in very good journals. (translated)

Vera says that she did not rceive a financial reward last year therefore losing half her overall salary because she produced fewer publications than the university required.

Publishing in high impact (English-medium) journals is becoming an increasing priority, but scholars are also committed- and from their accounts are informally incentivized-to publish in Russian. Whilst the universt documentation includes no reference to Russian medium publications (2), scholars refer to the existence of university lists prescribing high-quality Russian-medium outlets. Most scholars question the criteria used to select journals for this ist and are concened about the reduced number. Galina, for example, sas she now has fewer opportunities for publishing in Russian-medium journals.

In Russia, I publish in journals of top-level specified by [university lists]. The journals are good but there are very few of them. have objections but I play this game. (original)

Evgeni too says the universty and the VAK list of journals (see 2) significantl limit his opportunities for Russian-medium acaIemic publishing and that he risks osing financial reward for failing to produce the required number of articles in institutionally pproved journals. Yet, he says he chooses not to follow these lists.

There is only one [approved] leading journal in Russia with a specific disciplinary focusThere is also one old journal in the wider scope category but I would think twice before submitting my text because of its quality. VAK used to be a criterion for me and others. Now, I'd submit my text to a journal with good working editorial board rather than follow the VAK list of journals.

Even with lower status. (translated)

Whilst Evgeni signals a willingnessto sidestep institutional criteria, other cholars, faced with the contested status of different Russian-medium outlet (not least because university lists are not part of codified criteria), see English-medium publications as the preferred option. lisaveta for example says she prefers to aim her work at Wos English-medium jounals as i is a safer way for her to meet institutional assessment requirements.

However, one key factor influencing cholars decision to publish in Russian, as compared with English-medium journals indexed in Wos, is the length of publication cycle. Allscholars commented on the shorter publication cycle of Russian-medium journals which enables them to meet the annual assessment criteria for salary bonuses'. Maria for example explains that despite the pressure to publish in English, she had to reject an invitation from an English-medium journal because the length of the publication cycle meant she risked not meeting annual research output requirements.

They said 'we have a two-year queue'. I said 'within two years everything will change 10 times in my life. (translated) Dmitri says he has to plan his research output to met anual research assessment criteria and publishing in Russian-medium journals is faster:

[A paper] in Russian [is] ready in two months. In foreign journals the publication cycle is longer It is a long game, and you need at least two years. (translated)

In sum, the formal university evaluation regime is having the efect of prioritizing publishing in high ranking (English-medium) journals. At the same time, scholars indicate the existence of an informal occluded' (Swales, 1996) dimension to the universty evaluation regime which values specific Rusian-medium outlets. The decisions scholars make about medium of publication are based on a cluster of intersecting factors including financial, disciplinary and personal motivations, and the availability of relevant outlets. One practical factor is the shorter publication cycle in Russian-medium journals which ensures a closer chronological alignment between publication trajectories and the university's annual evaluation cycle.

4.4. 'It is not that I do not do this but ... ': linguistic medium and disciplinary traditions

Perhaps a more fundamentally occluded' dimension to current evaluation regimes is the disruption caused to historically-situated disciplinary traditions, an issue foregrounded by all scholars.

Danil emphasizes that the state ideology of Marxism-Leninism was core to knowledge making in Russa, significantly shaping tussian-medium research writing in the social sciences and humanities:

It is a truly fundamental thing: it lays at the surface, yet, it i very deep-We have Marxism-Leninism heritage because there was no normal science then.--Using Russian was central to such knowledge making. (translated)

Danil, talking about sociology, explains:

In Stalin's era, sociology was forbidden and it disappeared as a discipline. In late 1950s, in Khrushchev era14 sociology was allowed. Sociological labs and institutions were opened. Sociology and other social sciences were isolated from global science and it was surrounded by ideology. (translated)

genii explains that a key rhetorical-ideological dimension to writing philosophy in the past was the obligation to criticize urs from the west. Disciplinary conversations' (Bazerman, 1988) were expected to take place in Russian and only between 1-based scholars:

In all scientific texts, the Soviet scholar had to cite classic works of Marxism-Leninism with a necessary remark that they [capitalist countries] do not understand Russian science --At the end of the text i was necessary to mention they lost, meaning that our science is better. (translated)

Daria, also from philosophy, emphasizes the negative impact of ideology throughout the history of the UsR on philosophy because it destroyed its [philosophy's] fundamental knowledge making grounds not least through the political repression of prominent scholars. In sharp contrast currently, she says she and her peers are expected to read and cite English-medium journals and books which she finds equally problematic and upsetting:

Every 20 years there is a total academic clean up. Now if we want to side with some source of ideas, it will not be a colleague from a neighboring department: it will be an overseas colleague. It is a big frustration. (translated)

In the move away from Russian-medium disciplinary conversations, scholars point to several epistemological shfts. Margarita an economist, talks about  shif from qualitative to quantittive reearch, saying he now currently has to make difficult decisions about whether to continue doing qualitative research, which she enjoys, or to follow the dominant quantitative research paradigm:

Scopus, as well as our leading journals, want statistical models, big data. It is not that I do not do this [quantitatie research], can do this at some level, but my research is mostly qualitative. (translated)

A further epistemological shift signaled by scholars when publishing in English-medium journals is the imperative to build a geo comparative dimension to any research reported. Galina states that

Some topics are interesting mostly in Russa, because it is about Russa and very deely involved in Russian specific situation, it is too local. (original)

When publishing in English-medium intenational journals, she argues that i is necessary not only to provide rich contextual detail about the Russan economy but to contrast it with other economic systems which have been previously studied and reported in leading Anglo-American English-medium journals. Similarly, Danil says that the majorit of high impact English medium papers published by his research centre are in a comparative framework:

If you make a case about a Russian village, you need to come up with the idea why it can be interesting to global community. -Even if you write about local issues you need to think why it wil be interesting to people, how you fit [Anglophone center] journal interests. (translated)

Perhaps the most fundamental epistemological shift in the move towards publishing in English was signaled by the philosophy scholars. They talk about the increasing international dominance of analytic philosophy (see Glock, 2008), an Anglo-American philosophic tradition which emerged in 19th century, and which significantly differs from the continental tradition of philosophy in Russa. Evgeni, Daria, and Elisaveta say that in their English-medium publications they are currently switching from continental to analytic philosophy. This paradigm shift demands new rhetorical practices, where the key focus is on building a particular kind of argumentation. Evgenii states:

In the past, the aim of an article [in the continental philosophic tradition] was to explain something complicated or interpret something. Now there is a demand for arguments. Interpretations play a secondary role. (translated)

This fundamental paradigm shift however also brings with it a rupture in publishing opportunities in Russan. Scholars say they cannot publish their artices inthe analytic philosophy tradition in Russian-medium journals since the majority of local journal editors and reviewers (and Russian philosophers) work in the continental tradition. Egeni says thisis not only an issue for Russian scholars.

In Italy, France and Germany and Scandinavia, even professors have to adapt and are even $@$ fired sometimes. -Recently one French academic made a joke that analytic philosophy is $@$ like NATO. It is pressure, aggressive acquisition, but is attractive at the same time. $@$ (translated).

Scholars' accounts indicate that knowledge-making in different languages is deeply rooted in the sociopolitical histories of dis. iplines. Shifts in language of publication may also carry fundamental epistemological shifts (ennet, 2007) as well asignificantly haping, and sometimes limiting, choices around linguistic medium.

4.5. 'Learning everything anew': navigating different linguistic and discourse communities

All the scholars talk about the rhetorical and epistemological similarites and differences in research writing in Russian and in English and highlight the importance of developing new ways of writing knowledge in order to publish in English. Nikita, who spent a year in Germany, explains that he can easily write in German but writing English-medium papersi difficult because of the intricate relationship between lanaguge and knowledge making:

A philosopher works in a particular local tradition, for instance French or German, and your publications willbe in the same language because only this language can allow the scholar to produce meaning. (translated)

Danil, who completed his Ph.D. in sociology in a leading anglophone-cenre university, believes therei a strong need for Russiar sociologists to change their rhetorical practices and writ papers in what he refers to as positivistic tradition' to become competitive internationally.

People who live here [RF], whether they like it or not, write as itis common here. But you need to do things differently now-To make an empirical study you need skills that were not taught to students in Soviet times and now scholars cannot teach their students these skills since they do not do it. (translated)

Evgeni and Nikitafrom philophy state that the long-standing Soviet tradition of creative retelig and pondering i changing. Evgenii says learning new rhetorical practices is not easy.

We have not learned how to argue in such a way as to offer new solutions yet. What we learned at universt is not the same as what we do now. We need to learn everything anew. (translated) Similarly, Margarita, who has not yet published articles included in Wos or Scopus, says that while we all till want t somehow try copus', the processes are not clear and therefore the experience is stressful

Several scholars believe that the epistemological-rhetorical diffrences are so great that it is necessary to undertake additional doctoral studie in English. Evgeni, for example, is currently doing an additional doctor of ciences degree because he believes he needs to learn the more globally dominant analytical philosophy tradition and associated rhetorical practices. Maria and Nikolai, who hold candidate of sciences degrees,1 are currently undertaking English-medium doctoral programmes in economics in Western and Eastern Europe. Maria comments that studying is for real there', explaining that by doing an English-medium PhD program in Western Europe, she will learn the research writing practices necessary for publishing in high impact English medium journals. Nina is considering joining an additional Ph.D. with an Anglo-American university because she fes the need to learn necessary rhetorical practices to publish in Anglo-American jounals. Daria, similarly is undertaking an additional doctoral programme at an AngloAmerican university.

Learning to write knowledge differently is not reported as a necessarily negative experience. Egeni talks about the challenge to write diffrently but also his desireto do so. He considers that writig Russian-medium articles is negatively shaped by Soviet times rhetoric', when every Russian scholar had to \*condescendingly disprove" of others work. He is currently following two rhetorical traditions and believes that rhetoric is a 'matter of taste':

Foreign scholars say now I will ffer you original things and you should se my brilliant move'. Offering something original was not new for us but it was done in a specific way.-Very many people, including editorial boards, maintain this style [Soviet time rhetoric]. -And this is very different from western journals. (translated)

Scholars' accounts suggest that traditions in knowledge making are currentl changing involving a strong imperative to develop aew rhetorical practices in order to sustain their research practices under current evaluation regimes.

# 5. Discussion

This article has focused on a single-site study in a geopolitical context which to date has remained under-researched in the field of ERPP, RF. Findings from the study both confirm and extend previous findings on the ways in which evaluation regimes are being enacted at institutional, national and international levels in non-Anglophone contexts and how scholars are navigating such regimes. In this section, we revisit the three research questions and discuss them in relation to previous research.

With regard to the first question centering on language of publication, Russian continues to be by far the most dominant language for publication for this goup of scholars, afinding contributing to the complex picture to have emerged about the use of local/national Ianguages in academic publishing: some studies have indicated that national languages continue to be widely used in the social and human scie . rr is, 2019; Gni, 208) alt vring aross prfesina traetie (.); her stdes indicate a dominant us of English, albeit often alongide ome publication activity in the local languages (Kulzycki e l., 2020; Lilli & Curr, 2010; Liu, 2017). Specific reasons for the current widespread use of Russian may in part be explained by the legacy of Russian as a high status language of publication, evident in both current codified (at national level through the RSCI and VAK) and informal (e.g. in university lists) evaluation practices. At the same time, there are indications both in research evaluation documents and interviews with scholars that Englishi on the rise in this Russin instition. Even if the use of English is not explicitly mandated, the fact that evaluation regimes are underpinned by WoS criteria means that English becomes the de facto language for high status research publications. This finding echoes previous research carried out in non-Anglophone European countries (Curry & Lillis 2014 Lillis & Curry, 2010; Perez-Llantada et al., 2011).

With regard to the second question on the impact of institutional context, it i clear from this study that the recent changes in the research evaluation regime are influencing Russian scholars' decisions about the language/s they publish, with the multiple-level (formal and informal) evaluation regimes adding to an already complex and pressurized environment. The study shows that the enactment of evaluation regimes is not a purely intellectual practice but closely bound up with the specific material conditions in which scholars are working. Scholars attempt to produce both Russian and English medium outputs as a way of meeting evaluation criteria that are functioning at diffrent levels: in order to secure universty and state-level grant funding, scholars indicate the importance of publishing in English medium outlets indexed in Wos, a finding that echoes previous studies (Hanauer & Englander, 2011; Perez-Llantada, 2014); in order to meet annual research asessment requirements, scholars are aiming to publish in Russian, as wellas English, not least because of the direct link between salary and publication, link underlined in findings from other European resource-poor contexts (Lilis & Curry, 2010). Of particular significance with regard to thelatter is scholars' decision to use Russian because of the shorter publication cycle of Russan-medium journals and it coser chronological alignment with the annual intitutional assessment regime, success in which is crucial to secure the bonuses' essential for securing a living wage.

With regard to the third question, our study confirms existing EAP research and theory which conceptualize language as insep. arable from disciplinary knowledge making. Whilstrsearchers diffr in their conceptualizations and labelling- see Airey's (2011) disciplinary literacy, Lea and Stret's (1998) 'academic literacies, Hyland's (2004) disciplinary discourses'- and there are ongoing debates about the eistmological consequences of language shifts- through notions such as domain os (e.g. (illi & Curry, 2010)) and epistemicide' (e.g. Bennet, 2007) - there is strong agreement of the need to theorise this entanglement between language and discipline. Scholars' comments in this study echo those in previous studies that language choice is deeply roted in sub-disciplinary-epistemological histories of knowledge making (eg. Lilli & Curry, 2010; McGrath, 2014) with intricate rhetorical consequence (e.. in philoophy, Hobbs, 2014). However, this study highlights the significance of the locally-sitated political histoy of disciplinary paradigms and the ways in which language choice, is refracted through institutional and national level evaluation regimes, both current and historical. The importance of acknowledging this geopolitical dimension to the relationship between (specific) languages and epistemology is underlined in the surprig finding from the study, that experienced Russian academics, who already hold doctoral and higher doctoral research degrees are pursuing further English-medium doctoral degrees in order to lean things anew At some level, scholars seem to be inhabiting a paradoxical inellectual space the privileged position of English through WoS is pushing scholars towards not only the use of a diffrent language but towards paradigms valued in Anglophone-centre tra ditions; at the same time, the establishment of Rusian as a legitimized Wos index, signals a state-level commitment to the Russian language, as well as tothe rhetorical anddiscilinry trdtions historicll valued in Rssian acadmia. A similar parado isident in China: Feng et al. (2013) exploring scholars practices in the context of an explicit sate policy shift towards valuing Chinese-medium publications, indicate that both natural and social sciences tend to 'orbit Anglo-American practice' (p. 267), not only in terms of linguistic medium but in orienting their research writing to Anglo-American expectations and traditions (Feng et al., 2013). The tensions that individual cholars are experiencing therefore may in part reflect what might be described as the push and pull ffect f state level policies of global powers.

# 6. Conclusion

This paper contributes to a growing area within EAP, ERPP (English for Research Publication Purposes), which sees to understand the imperatives driving institutional and individual English-medium reearch writing in different parts of the world (se JEAP sI, 2014 vol 13). Such work is important for making visible the specific ways in which English is inserted into evaluation regimes in different national and institutional contexts and the subsequent challenges (contextual, linguistic, epistemological) cholars face in anchoring English to their research interests. For EAP/ERPP practitioners, this paper provides further evidence that many scholars globall are working with multiple languages in their research writing which are bound up with questions of disciplinary epistemologies and geopolitical historie. The pedagogical implications for those working with English for academic purposes alongside other languages will necessrily vary depending on the pecific nature of programme (e. amed at supporting individuals or cohorts of scholars) and the specific expertise of the practitioner (an EAP practitioner monolingual in English with expert knowledge of a particular discipline, will contribute diferent kinds of linguistic/rhetorical support from a bi/multilingual EAP practitioner familiar with linguistic/ rhetorical practices in the relevant languages). Making the linguistic-rhetorical aspects of disciplinary traditions an explicit focus of pedagogical attention is an important way of considering specifically what English' alongside other languages has to offr (Bardi, 2021), and echoes calls for pedagogic engagement with multiple linguistic resources (e.g. Gentil & Seror, 2014).

Content and discourse analysis

Example Responding to the question Do you write diffrently in Russan and in English? Danil says "ye" and continues by saying We have Marxism-Leninism heritage because there was no normal science then. This comment is analyzed in terms of content: a) Danil does write ifferently in the two languages b) Danil views the writing of sociology in Russian as being influenced historically by the ideology of Marxisim-Leninism. in the Soviet period. This comment is analyzed in terms of discourse: the phrase normal science signals a binary evaluative discourse positioning some science as 'normal' and some as 'not normal'. In a follow up discussion via email Danils comments were pursued i attention to both content and discourse by asking him to describe the differences in how he writes in the two languages (content), asking him what to talk about what he means by 'normal science' (discourse).
