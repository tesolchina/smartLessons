Teacher-student rapport

Language education as a dynamic field of study requires constant innovations to meet the L2 needs in the classroom milieu. Additionally, the surge of technological advancements warns us about the significance of studying the possible beneficial roles of artificial intelligence in language teaching and learning about which the field is in its infancy stage. In this vein, the present study examined the effectiveness of a four-staged ChatGPT-based rapport-building protocol (CGRBP) on teacher-student rapport and L2 grit to not only profile a non-correlational evidence to L2 emotion studies, but also to link the realm of artificial intelligence with positive psychology in order to find practical ways for cultivating an emotionally supportive learning context. To do so, 30 intermediate-level Iranian EFL learners participated in experimental $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 )$ and control $( \mathtt { n } =$ 15) groups in a 16-week instruction program. Data gathered from a pre-test post-test experimental design was analyzed by One-Way ANcoVA and the analyses showed that students who were taught English through CGRBP outperformed the students in control group on L2 grit. The results verified the mediating role of CGRBP in the L2 context by suggesting that the application of a well-structured and staged ChatGPT-based instruction would possibly lead to enhanced L2 grit. Since grit is an integral part of one's positive psycho-emotional network, several theoretical and pedagogical implications were discussed and directions for future explorations were suggested.

# 1. Introduction

Second language (L2) classrooms cradle an array of factors that influence learners and teachers along with long-term educational goals (Wang, Derakhshan, & Zhang, 2021). Rendering psycho-emotional factors involved in second language acquisition (SLA) through the lens of positive psychology (PP), researchers have revealed that L2 learners and teachers might suffer from shame. boredom, axiet, and distress while factors such as motivation, reilience, and grit help them achieve a stabilized state of emotions and mind and the maintenance in accomplishing goals, hence, embracing life satisfaction and well-being (Mercer, MacIntyre, & Gregersen, 2016). As a branch of humanism, P sees to identify, study, categorize, and improve positive emotions, positive character traits, and positive institutions that reside within human psyche (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) on the pursuit of promoting happiness and a life lived well (i.e., well-being) (Dewaele, Chen, Padilla, & Lake, 2019; Mercer, 2021).

Teacher-student relationship is among the afore-mentioned determinant wellbeing factors that contribute to positive outcomes of the L2 learning, since it reduces in-class stress by changing the cassroom atmosphere into an emotionally supportive and favorable situation (Farel, 2014; Xie & Derakhshan, 2021) PP scholars have tried to study and frame the manifestations of teacher-student relationship in different educational contexts. Operationalizing the teacher-student relationship, the scholars have argued that the term encompasses teachers' care and teacher-student raort. The former (i.e, teacher care) refers to teachers' positive responses to the learners' emotional nds (Dickinson & Kreitmair, 2019; Noddings, 2012), while the later (i.., teacher-student rapport) denotes the understanding, compassion, trust, and intimacy shared by the teacher and students (Frisby, 2019; Frisby & Gaffney, 2015). While both variables are believed to be effective predictors of L2 achievement, more robust evidence exists regarding the higher predictive power of teacher-student rapport. In other words, the rapport between language teachers and learners would entertain and motivate the learners by infusing more emotionall supportive lerning contexts which paves the way for emergence of more positive outcomes (Frisby, 2019; Pekrun, Ellot, & Maier, 2009). Notably, the outcome of teacher-student rapport trggers the sense of connectedness and belonging f the L2 learners, which in turn fosters the students motivation and willingness to learn (Cao, 2022; Henry & Thorsen, 2018).

Theory and preliminary studies support the interconnectedness of teacher-student rapport with other well-being related factors such as engagement, enjoyment, motivation, and resilience (Derakhshan, Dolinski, Zhaleh, Enayat, & Fathi, 2022; Zhang, 2021). However, the majorit of argumentations regarding the role of teacher-student rapport and its connection to other variables inL2 class have relied on corrlational analyses the generalizability of which are questionable (Shao, Elahi Shirvan, & Alamer, 202). Thus, we are yett fully pictre the signficance and imprtance f techer-stdnt raort, espciy wth rard  es ussed tions such as grit which entails the presence of interest and effrt in the journey of achieving long-term goals (Duckworth, 2016). Accordingly, grit resembles one's hardiness and is postulated to be an integral aspect of one's psycho-emotional capital (Mercer et al., 2016). Studying grit in L2 domain provides a better understanding of how the learners persist in the journey of language learning despite numerous stressors and hardships. Thus, investing on learners' grit would potentially help them to overcome learning obstacles which reside in vocabulary development, grammar acquisition, and willingnessto communicat (Zheng, Heydarnejad, & Aberash, 2022). Due to recent studies, we know that grit would possibly lead to more engagement, buoyancy, resilience, and L2 achievement (Crede. Tynan, & Harms, 2017; Ghafouri & Tahriri, 2023). In other words, the notion is among motivating factors the possesson of which helps the individuals remain focused and perseverant towards their goals while dealing with hardships.

The existing knowledge in L2 psycho-emotional trend confirm the relatedness of grit and L2 achievement. Moreover, the relationship between grit and similar notions such as emotion regulation, higher academic performance, and self-assurance has ben evidenced (Sadoughi & Hejazi, 2023; Zheng et a., 2022); however, the generalizability of the findings has remained questionable and the number of experimental studies regarding the malleabilit effect of grit have been rare. Precisely, it has been argued that grit is promotable and is correlated with teacher-student rapport and similar positive factors, but the empirical evidence to support such claims has remained scarce or limited to correlational bases leading to a gap between theory and practice where the theoretical links between teacher-student rapport and grit have been established, but non-correlation, practical, and actionable solutions to strengthen the links and verify such relatedness are lacking Qia0, 2022; Yuan, 2022). The problem with correlational analyses is that they ignore causation. In other words, one cannot induce the effect of one variable on another via relying on correlation. By ignoring ths drawback, scholars have mainly overgeneralized thir findings and treated the results of their studies s experimental and causational. Such misinterpretation of the results would possbly lead to a limited and underrepresented interpretation of the phenomena, especially with regard to psycho-emotional factors (Derakhshan, Wang, Wang, & Ortega-Martin, 2023; Shao et al., 2022).

Thus, the fieldis in urgent need of innovative designs to further justify the already exising literature on psycho-emotional notions in L2 teaching and learning (Derakhshan et al., 2023). The innovation which might be traceable inthe field of artificial intelligence (AI). The implementation of Al in the L2 leaning process i justifiable relative to the idea that enhancing well-being-related notions such as rapport and grit requires actionable, tangible, and practical endeavors and mere reliance on theory would not sufice for cultivating an engaging, entertaining, and emotionall-upportive L2 context (Wong, Cowden, Mayer, & Bowers, 2022). Recent studies show that AI-powered mechanisms can benefit stakeholders in educational ciphers (Ray, 2023); however, the number of studies which directly test such clams within L2 domain has been scarce (Kohnke, Moorhouse, & Zou, 2023). Bridging these gaps, the researcher would reconsider the interplay of teacher-student rapport and L2 grit by envisioning the potential constructive role that technological advancements and artificial intelligence might play in language education context. In other words, the study seeks to envision the effectiveness of a more tangible practical, and actionable olution (i.e., Al usage) in L2 context tosee how it can benefit the teachers and students in cultivating rapport and grit which are among lessdiscussed well-being-related notions. In doing so, the utility of a ChatGPT-based rapport building protocol wil be tested to se whether the newly emerged Al-wired mechanism (i.e, ChatGPT) has any potential influence on amplifying the teacher-student rapport and L2 learners' grit.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Teacher-student rapport

Rapport denotes a shared understanding, caring, compassion, trust, and joy among individuals (Frisby, 2019; Frisby & Gaffney, 2015) and emerges when there is a close affinity and friendship among people who get along wel with each other (Allen et al., 2013) The term is rooted in attachment theory, originally proposed by Bowlby (1969) who aserted that individuals' emotional links affect their performance (Zheng, 2021). Arguably, the students who bond with thir pees and teachers are ess concerned about falures and are further motivated to engage and explore the unknowns since the attachment triggers a positive environment embellished with politeness cultural onsideration, and trust (Ahmad, 2018; Bergin & Bergin, 2009; Budzi'nska & Majchrzak, 2021). In reality, rapport predicts cognitie learning perception and ultimate grade (Wilson, Ryan, & Pugh, 2010). Further, it has en argued that the notion is strongly associated with the effects of the education perception towards the teachers and learning (Frisby & Gaffney, 2015).

Establishing rapport can enhance L2 learners' engagement which results in achieving academic succes (Culpeper & Kan, 2019; Frisby, 2019, since studies indicate that rapport inL2 contexts leads to higher instuctional quality along with a stres-fre context, a friendly environment and a highly motivational seting when faced with unknown concepts (Bergin & Bergin, 2009; Derakhshan et al., 2022; Li, 2022; Xie & Derakhshan, 2021; Zheng, 2021). In fact, L2 learners high interactional behavior has been demonstrated to affct their academic behaviors like engagement (Mercer & Gkonou, 2020). Further, rapport is necesary for promoting a positive attitude toward learning and improving performance (Delos Reyes & Torio, 2020), especially when achieving long-term goals is concerned. In other words, the presence of an emotionallysupportive learning context would hone the emotive bonds between the teacher and students, which helps them remain focused and interested in obtaining the goals (Yuan, 2022). Rapport can be promoted by engaging students in both verbal and nonverbal communication and creating a friendship learning environment (Burke-Smalley, 2018). To achiee this, teachers are suggeste to provide asetting in which the leaners can feel cared for and respected as wel as they are free to express their ideas and receive feedback (Burke-Smalley, 2018; Derakhshan et al., 2022).

To date, several studies have considered rapport in L2 contexts. Yuan (2022) analyzed the data obtained from 316 Chinese EFL learners from 30 diffrent cities and showed that teacher-student rapport positively predicts learners grit. Hejazi and Sadoughi's (2023) study on 339 EFL learners showed that teacher support and positive relationships between teachers and leaners would predict the learners' grit, interest, enthusiasm, persistence, and effort. Their results supported the findings of Zhao and Yang (2022) who reported medium to large correlations between perceived teacher support, academic engagement, and enjoyment.

# 2.2. L2 grit

Pioneered in the works of Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, and Kell (2007), grit refers to the integration of persistence i effrts and continuous enthusiasm for successi achieving long-term goals and is among the determinant factors in one's accomplishment (Duckworth, 2016; Shechtman, DeBarger, Dornsife, Rosier, & Yarnall, 2013; Teimouri, Plonsky, & Taandeh, 2022). Unlike age which can develop grit i older indvidals for accomplishing their gols (Duckworth et a., 2007) factors such as hlthiness and intelligence (Eskreis-Winkler, hulman, Beal, & Duckworth, 2014), as wel as, race, gender, and academic level, do not have asgnificant impact on grit (Crede t al., 2017). Among the influentia factors, motivation and the positive teachers atitude are those which can enhance L2 learners' grit (Gyamfi & Lai, 2020; Shen & Guo, 2022). As noted earlier, grit is highly corrlated with positive teacher-student re. lationships. Since language learning call for patience, consistency, and dilience in long-tem time spans, a positive cassroom context caused by teacher-student rapport would inluence the extent to which the learners show tenacity and interest in achieving goals. According to Zhao and Yang (2022), perceived teacher support not only bolsters L2 grit and enjoyment of the students, but is also effective to reduce the boredom level of the language learning process.

Also, studies verify the positive relationship between grit and L2 learners achievement and higher academic performance (Crede et al., 2017), educational desire (Duckworth et al., 2007), and grades (Strayhorn, 2014). Findings reveal that students' grit can be predicated by teacher-learner rapport (Mohammed et al., 2022 Song, 2021; Yuan, 2022). Similarl, the positive effct of emotion regulation and self-asurance on students L2 grit were also investigated (Zheng et al., 2022). Moreover, the mediating rol of grit was manifested in Sadoughi and Hejazi's (2023) study, which emphasized the efectivenessof git in the perception of teachers support and enthusiasm for academic engagement. Recently, Ghafouri and Hassaskhah (2022) evidenced the interconnectednessof grit, shame, and guilt. Specifically, the researchers found that git and guilt are strongly and positively correlated with each other, while shame, as the negative counterpart of guilt, is negatively associated with grit. The results implied that grit might be beneficial in triggering students' guilt which isthe pre-requisite of compensation and trying to make things beter. Further, Ghafouri and Tahriri (2023) studied the interplay of grit and buoyancy among 263 EFL learners and their results showed that grit is a strong predictor of learners' buoyancy which denotes one'scapabilit to overcome daily academic challenges. Therefore, investment on grit not only leads to higher achievements, but also helps the individuals to cope with their tensions and remains perseverant despite hardships (Crede & Tynan, 2021; Ghafouri & Tahriri, 2023). However, most of the findings in this trend have been corrlational in nature and more in-depth enquires are required to verify the generalizability of the studies.

# 2.3. ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an artifically intelligent chatbot powered by OpenAI (https://openai.com/chatgpt) capable of natural language processing, answering questions,offering sugestions, assting in writing, and idea generation (Opara, Mfon-Ette Theresa, & Aduke, 2023; Ray, 2023; Sallam, 2023). The introduction of ChatGPT as an interactive, versatile, and responsive chatbot in 2022triggered many scholars to question the role that AI willplay in future. For some scholars, ChatGP and similar AIls pinpoint the start of an era where technology precedes pedagogy (Al-Kadi, 2018). In other words, the ever-updating nature of ChatGPT and AI-wired mechanisms challenges the exising educational discourse by posing the idea that AI would be a replacement for teachers (Ausat, Massang, Efed, Nofirman, & Riady, 2023); however, some believe that the use of ChatGPT should be contolle and structured (Gottlieb, Kline, Schneider, & Coates, 2023; Perry, 2021).

To date, four major roles have been discussed relative to the implementation of AI within educational contexts, namel,assessor, material upplier, interlocutor, and asstant (Jeon & Lee, 2023). Recent findings indicate that ChatGPT can be beneficial i healthcare education, critical thinking promotion, and personalized learning (Sallam, 2023). However, the utility of ChatGPT in language learning and teaching contexts is yet to be discussed and explored. Reflecting on ChatGPT and L2 learning, Kohnke et al. (2023) posed that the chatbot can enrich the L2 input, motivate the learners, and provide feedacks. Likewise, the motivational aspects of ChatGPT in L2 learning context were also verified by Ali Shamsan, Hezam, and Mohammed (2023) who profiled the effectiveness of this technology on leaners readng and writing skils. Similarly, Gayed, Caron, Oriola, and Cross(2022) utilized an AI clled A KAKU in an EFL context and reported that the AI was capable of reducing the cognitive loadsof learners resulting in the improved speaking skil. The relevance of ChatGPT to psycho-emotional factors involved in language learning such as grit lies in the idea that the chatbot is always available to the leaners. This means that they can rely onit feedback providing features anywhere anytime. The availabilit of the chatbot would pave the way for long-term personalized learning and self-regulating proces which would possibly help the learners remain interestd and tenacious without worrying about the presence of some immediat stressors such as teacher feedback or peer pressure. However, the validity of such claims is yet to be discused and the present study would be among the frst atempts that considers the appication of ChatGPT in L2 contexts to evidence it effectiveness on cultivating positive teacher-student relationshp and L2 grit development.

# 3. Present study

Several standpoints justify the significance of the present study. As noted earlier, the majority of interpretations regarding the interplay between emotions and psychological variables involved in the procesof L2 teaching and learning have been theoretical or correlational, and very few action-based, experimental, and tangible endeavors have been made to promote the learners' inner strengths (Derakhshan et al., 2023). Further, overreliance on correlational analyses would possbly challenge the reality of the overly subjective and context-dependent nature of psycho-emotional factors, which are subject tofluctuations over time. Moreover, language learners would experience an array of positive and negative feelings and thoughts throughout their language learning journey, thus, remaining immune from negativity and properly handling disturbing thoughts and feelings for long- and stretched-time spans callfor an emotional supportie classoom context and constructive teacher-student relationships. In this vein, cultivating and promoting teacher-student rapport would possily provide the basi for leaners continous interet and effort (i., grit over time and help them remain focused and enthusiastic about language learning despite failures and hardships. However, aplied linguists have overlooked the importance of suggesting actionable strategies and options to teachers and learners. Therefore, the present study tries to compensate for these drawbacks by testing the effectiveness of ChatGPT, a newly emerged, flexible, dynamic, and verstile artificial intelligence, on the L2 grit development of the learners. Both variables (i.e, rapport and grit ontribut to one's well-being and are essential for achieving long-term educational goals (Wang et al., 2021). Preliminary evidence verifies their interconnectednes, but the field lacks enough experimental trils to justif their relationship further. Thus, investing in their connection through astructured and actionable AI-based program seems reasonable.

The present trial would be among the preliminary attempts in L2 studies that frame the inclusion of chatbots in the L2 learning context. Fthr, i will idence thefftivenessof uch echlogical adancemets in a tctured and conrolled manner. The trial would possibly provide more robust support to the argumentations of scholars who believe that language learners would benefit from ChatGPT and similar AIs (See, e.g., Ali et al., 2023; Gayed et al., 2022; Kohnke et al., 2023).

# 4. Material and methods

# 4.1. Design

A pre-test post-test experimental design with a control group was utilized to test the impact of a ChatGPT-based rapport-building protocol on L2 learners grit. The design is in line with Derakhshan et al. (2023) who aserted that the field requires more inovative, non-correlational, and intervention-based studies regarding the psycho-emotional factors of L2 learners.

# 4.2. Participants and context

Thirty Iranian English language learners $[ \mathrm { m a l e } = 1 9 $ , female ${ \bf \tau } = { \bf 1 1 }$ ) and six EFL teachers $( { \bf m a l e } = 4$ female $= 2$ ) were involved in the present study. The learners' age ranged between 15 and 18 while the teachers were 29-34 years old with 5-10 years of experience. Each of the teachers had approximatel 20 learners during the week. For the purposeofthe study, they were asked to inform and group five of their intermediate-level students together and plan to teach them during  16-week instruction program. Further, teachers were divided into two groups of experimental ${ ( \mathtt { n } = 3 ) }$ ) and control ${ \mathfrak { m } } = 3 { \mathfrak { r } }$ . The students of each teacher were also assigned to the experimental $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 $ ) and control $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 )$ groups. One week prior to the initiation of the program, all the students were tested on Oxford Placement Test (Alln, 2004) to ensure the homogeneity. Results of the Independent Samplest-test confirmed that the majority of the students $( \mathtt { n } = 2 4 )$ were in intermediate level based on CEFR criteria (B1).

# 4.3. Instruments

# 1. L2 grit scale:

To investigate the learners' L2 grit, Teimouri et al.'s (2022) scale was employed in the current study. This scale includes two interrelated sub-constructs: Perseverance of Effort (POE) and Consistency of Interest (Co1). The scale encompasses nine items aligned on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not like me at all to 5 (very much like me). The scale has been conceptualized in line with theoretical and epistemological foundations of grit posed by Duckworth et al. (2007) and Duckworth (2016).

# 2 ChatGPT-based intervention:

The ChatGPT-based rapport-building protocol (CGRBP) (Fig. 1) of the present study is in line with Seligman et al.'s (2009) guideline of positive educational interventions which acknowledges the infusion of happiness and joy into education context Further, the protocol represents Burke-Smalley's (2018) suggestions where teachers can amplify the rapport through using non-verbal signals implying a sense of closeness and friendliness allowing sef-expression, being approachable and available, and giving proper feed backs. Accordingly, ChatGPT helped teachers in the experimental group to enhance the rapport in four stages, namely, elf-expression promotion, empathy, group learning, and asessment. The operationalization of rapport by reliance on ChatGPT in four stages is justified rlative to Farrll (2014) and Derakhshan et al. (2022) who asserted that rpport is the byproduct of emotionall supportive and favorable situations. Moreover, the CGRBP functions as a catalyst by which understanding, compassion, intimacy, and trust are shaped and shared among the teachers and students (Frisby, 2019; Frisby & Gaffney, 2015).

Prior to the experimental phase, teachers were asked to participate in an online sesson which helped them become familiar with ChatGPT. They were handed out premium accounts of the Al, so that they could log in their profile on http://chat.openai.com/and acces the ChatGPT. Teachers were asked to test a list of prompts and see the results of their interaction with the chatbot. Simple user interface of the chatbot provides a writing space for the individuals to write down their needs. The idea-generation feature of the chatbot proceses the request ad offers a number f relevant options. Teachers in the experimental group were askedto focus on each stage throughout four consecutive sessions. The schematic (Fig 1) functioned as aguiding map for each four consecutive sessions. In the frst stage, teachers sought to acknowledge, value, and improve the students self-expresion skills In doing so, the teachers were instructed to use ChatGPT in order to generate a list of speaking and writing prompts that were based on the results of students ideas about the lesson topics. Thus, teachers were asked to collect their students' ideas about the lesson topic and make comprehensible prompts out of them as the input for the chatbot. After procesing the prompts, the chatbot would provide the output based on the learners' needs. For ease of application, teachers were free to use ChatGPT prior or within each session. Further, the teachers used ChatGPT to design personalized learning asignments. I other words, the ssignments of each student were formed by ChatGPT based on the data which described the performance of each student. The third objective of the self-expression promotion stage was to cultivate a non-judgmental atmosphere. For accomplishing this goal, teachers used ChatGPT to establish clearly defined expectations of each session, to nurture respect and tolerance among the students, and to promote growth mindsets by providing motivation and ChatGPT-generated strategies for long-term success As demonstrated in Fig. 2, teachers wrote down some prompts regarding the session objectives and adhered to the ChatGPT-generated ideas in that session.

The second stage of CGRBP focuses on teachers' empathetic behaviors which ignite a sense of helping towards others (Batson, Ahmad, Lishner, & Tsang, 2002). For accomplishing this goal, teachers were instructed to interact with the chatbot and obtain some practical and actionable solutions for helping their students. In ths tge teachers were asked to show eageness while listening to the students and share their own feelings and thoughts with their students. Using non-verbal behaviors such as smile, eye contact, and head nods were also emphasized in this stage. These were some of the strategies that ChatGPT suggested to the teachers. Moreover, teachers used ChatGPT to obtain a list of challenges that students would face during language learning along with a lis of practical coping strategiesto control their tensions and regulate their lening. This helped the teachers generate ideas regarding ther students emotional struggles throughout the language learning jouney and help them by discussing the challenges and strategies which could help the students ovecome the arriers Fially, ChatGPT helped teachers to decentralize themselves in the cassroom to evoke a sense of security and confidence among the students. As shown in Fig. 3, teachers were asked to obtain ideas regarding decentraliation in 2 class As it is depicted, the chatbot reonds to a teacher's question who asked that How can I dealize myself in the cass and shift the focus on to the learners? The objective of this trial was to promote students' engagement, citicl thinking, and shifting the focus from teacher to the learners.

Consequently, the third stage of CGRBP signaled the teachers trial for using ChatGPT to promote team spirit and group learning. In this phase, teachers used ChatGPT to generate collaborative writing prompts and creative discussion and gamified tass. In the final stage of CGRBP, teachers used ChatGPT to asses the students' performance and provide detailed and student-specific fedbacks to each student. Moreover, the ChatGPT helped teacher to simulate the IELTS exam so that students find opportunity to asess themselves by receiving feedbacks from ChatGPT.

# 4.4. Procedure

All the respondents (teachers $= 6$ , students $= 3 0$ ) were informed about the study based on the guidelines outlined by BERA (2011) prior to data collection. Teachers were randomly assigned into experimental $( \mathtt { n } = 3 )$ and control $\mathbf { \rho } ( \mathbf { n } = 3 \mathbf { \dot { \rho } } _ { c }$ groups. The students of teachers in the experiment group were also treated as the experimental group $( \mathbf { n } = 1 5 \mathbf { \cdot }$ , while the remaining students $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 )$ were assigned to the control group. Each week comprised two $9 0 \mathrm { - } \mathrm { { m i n } }$ sessions. The students of each group were tested on grit using L2 grit scale (Teimouri et al., 2022). According to the initial homogeneity test (OPT) teachers were asked to adopt the second volume of

Complete IELTS series (Brook-Hart and Jakeman, 2012) as the primary coursebook. The book provides the learners with the content which helps them prepare for IES band score 1 to 5. Also, the book covers a range of topics aimed at general English proficiency. The teachers of both groups followed the instructions outlined in the teachers guidebook; however, the teachers in experimental group were asked to focus on the ChatGPT-based Rapport-Building Protocol (CGRBP) as explained earlier and summarized in Table 1. Teachers in the experimental group were also provided an account required to initiate ChatGPT (https:/openai.com/chatgpt)

In the final session, the post-test data was also collected through a link designed by Google Forms the ExCEL output of which was analyzed by SPss26. The obtained data was checked for assumptions of One-Way Analysis of Covariance (AncovA), including, normality, reliability, linearit, hmogeneit of regresion slopes, and homogeneity of variances. Utilization of Ac leas to more statistical power through reducing the dependent variables via the covariates. Further, it improves the precision of the analyses by reducing the eror variance of the dependent variables. The analysis is also beneficial for isolating the impacts of the independent variables on the dependent ones (Rutherford, 2011).

# 5. Results

One-Way AncovA was run to compare the experimental and control groups means on posttest of grit fter controlling for the effect of preest in order to probe the only null-hypothesis raised in this study. fore discussing the results, the assumptions relatd to One-Way ANcOVA willbe discussed below. One-Way ANcOVA assumes normality, reliabilit, linearity, homogeneity of regression slopes, and homogeneity of variances. I is worth mentioning that One-Way ANcoVA also asumes that the covariate (pretest) should be administered before the posttest and there should not be too high correlations among covariat. The pretest of grit was administed before th ostest, and this study includd a single covariate, ie., pres of grit. he reults of kurois and sknes verified the normality of the data since the estimates were between $\pm 1 . 9 6$ (Field, 2018). Further, the Cronbach's alpha method showed that the L2 grit scale enjoyed adequate reliability estimates in pre-test $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 8 6 7 )$ and post-test $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 9 0 7 )$ . The significant results of the linearity test $( \mathrm { F } ( 1 , 2 9 ) = 2 4 . 1 2$ $\mathsf { p } < . 0 5$ , eta squared $= 0 . 6 8 3 \mathrm { \cdot }$ (Table 2), representing large effect size (Field, 2018, p 737) rejected the statistical null-hypothesis that the relationship between postest of git and pretest was not linear. In other words; there was a linear relationship between the two variables.

Table 3 shows the experimental and control groups means on posttest of grit fter controlling for the efect of pretest. The results showed that the experimental group $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 6 8$ $\mathbf { S } \mathbf { E } = 0 . 1 2 3$ had a higher mean than the control group $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 6 3$ $\mathbf { S E } = 0 . 1 2 3 )$ on posttest of grit after controlling for the effect of pretest.

And finally; Table 4 and Fig. 4 show the main results of One-Way ANcovA. The results $( \mathrm { F } \left( 1 , 2 7 \right) = 3 0 . 2 3 , \mathrm { p } < . 0 5 ,$ partial $\boldsymbol \eta 2 =$ 0.528), representing a large effect size (Field, 2018) indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group on posttest f grit after controlling for the effect of pretest. Thus; the null-hypothesis as "ChatGPT-based rapport-building protocol did not have any significant effect of EFL learners' grit' was rejected.

# 6. Discussion

Minimizing the distance between theory and practice the researcher tried to consider the interplay of teacher-student rapport and grit i L2 clases y investigating the mediating roleof ChatGPT-based Rapport-Building Protocol (GRBP). In this vein, four-staged ChatGPT-directed protocol was implemented in the lesson plan of 15 EFL learners in the experimental group for 16 sessions. Results indicated that the students in experimental group $( \mathbf { m } = 3 . 6 8 ) $ ) outperformed those in the control group (2.63) regarding L2 grit. As the results indicated, enhancing teacher student rapport through CGRBP leads to increased L2 grit. As explained earlier, the CGRBP attempted to hone teacher-student rpport by amplifying the sense of understanding, compassion, and trust within L classroom. Thus, it can be argued that CGRBP promotes the sense of afinit and caring which are core pillar of teacher-student rapport (Frisby, 2019, Frisby & Gaffney, 2015). Precisely, the aplication of CGRBP enabled teachers to obtain a list of practical and actionable endeavors in line with the objectives of each session. In doing so, the interaction between the teachers and the chatbot led to the emergence of suggestions, which helped the teachers tend to their leaners' needs by promoting the students' slf-expression skill, teaching them the coping strategies requred for the long-term language lrning process ehancing collaborating, and providing a basis for assesing the learners progress As induced by the result, the presence of ChatGPT in the instructional and assesment stages of the L2 teaching and learning would possibly help the teachers be more straightforward about what to do in each session since the AI is capable of generating numerous is of activities and tasks which align with different educational needs. Perhaps the idea-generation feature of the chatbot i its most influential property, which can help EFL teachers and learners. The increased grit of the leaners might be due to the personalized fedback provided by ChatGPT. Teachers constantly used the chatbot to monitor their learners' progress for 16 consecutive weeks. Such mentorship and supervision for stretched periods of time would possbly exclude the sense of loneliness in the learners, because they feel that their teacher cares about their progress and development and that they are not alone in the journey. Thus, in light of the increased raport and trust between the teachers and learners, the journey becomes more amusing for the learers. ChatGPT can be a reliable source of inspiration that provides immediate, action-based, explicit, and personalized feedback and so. lutions to learning chllenges. In thi vein, the learners interest and tenacity would be honed in the long run, and they become grittier in achieving their goals.

Accordingly, the results further justify the previous studies that profiled the connectednes of teacher-student rapport with well being-related factors (Derakhshan et al., 2022; Yuan, 2022; Zhang, 2021; Zha0 & Yang, 2022). Precisely, the existing literature de notes that grit is positiely and strongly associat wth egagment, enjoyment, motivation, and reilience (Cred e al., 017, Gyam & Lai, 2020; Shen & Guo, 2022). Arguably, the increased grit through CGRBP would indirectly tap into the network of positive factors Similarl, the results indicate that the application of ChatGPT in L2 class makes the learners perseverant and interested in achieving long-term goals. The idea which is also supported by previous studies where the researchers evidenced the efectivenessof grit on academic accomplishment, engagement, emotion regulation, and buoyancy (Duckworth, 2016; Ghafouri & Tahriri, 2023; Hejazi & Sadoughi, 2023; Sadoughi & Hejazi, 2023; Teimouri et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022).

Fig. 4. Means on posttest of grit by groups with pretest.

The increased L2 grit, as shown by the results, provides further justification for the idea that promoting rapport leads to more engagement and L2 achievement (Culpeper & Kan, 2019; Frisby, 2019). In other words, based on the results, it is argued that the application of CGRBP enhances the rapport through increasing the qualit of instruction. In light of an emotionally-supportive context caused by promoted rapport, students become more wlling to explore the unknown and the proces of language learning becomes a challenge for them to overcome rather than a threat to escape. The argumentation which is in line withattachment theory (Bowlby, 1969; Zheng, 2021) that justifies the individuals' emotional links and asserts that rapport amplifies a sense of shared politenes, cultural consideration, and trust among the individuals and in turn bolsters their performance (Ahmad, 2018; Bergin & Bergin, 2009; Budzi'nska & Majchrzak, 2021; Frisby & Gaffney, 2015). In fact results indicate that teacher-student rapport uilt up through CGRBP leads to improved performance by triggering the learners grit the presence of which leads to one's reconsideration of behaviors and inactions. In other words, the interplay of teacher-student rapport and L2 grit from the preent study is justifiable relative to Ghafouri and Hassaskhah (2022) who found that therei a positive and strong relatedness between students' grit and their sense of guilt which helps the individuals to reflect on their behaviors and try to bring about positive outcomes and compensate their failures and drawbacks. Thus, i can be argued that establishing rapport through CGRBP increases learners' grit and motivates them to remain perseverant and interested in accomplishing long-term goals.

Moreover, it can be argued that the present results contribute to the realm of artificial intelligence by suggesting that the inclusion of ChatGPT into L2 education would lead to positive psycho-emotional outcomes. Firstly, the results indicated that ChatGPT is capable of increasing the L2 grit through modfying the teacher-student rapport in a positive manner. Based on previous studie, and th isues discussed earlie, rapport i eneficial for reducing the tensions and conflicts thus, it is argued that ChatGPT-rendered instruction would allay the negative feelings and increase the learners' engagement. I turn, other positive factors such as grit reilience, and motivation would be afected as well (Bergin & Bergin, 2009; Xie & Derakhshan, 2021; Zheng, 202). The argument is supported by Gayed et al. (2022) who profiled the efectivenes of ChatGPT on learners' motivation and speaking skill. As referenced earlier, grit increases the students' percetion of their teachers' support and enthusiasm (Mohammed et al., 2022; Song, 2021; Yuan, 2022). In other words, teachers' trial for increasing the learners' grit would increase students' appreciation, implying that gritty students become aware about their teachers' care and support. Since student apreciation is an integral aspect of teaching enjoyment (Derakhshan et a., 2022 Li & Wei, 2023; Wang et al., 2021), it can be argued that CGRBP is beneficial for teacers well-being as well implying that the application of ChatGPT would make the teachers enjoy the process more. However, the validity of such claims concerning teachers' enjoyment and well-being requires more analyses.

By and large, the study poses several implications that researchers, teachers, teacher educators, and syllabus designers are sug. gested to consider. Firstly, the findings contribute to positive psychology and L2 education by highlighting possble constructive roles of AI within 2 milieu. Specifially, the results indicate that ChatGPT is beneficial for creating ateacher-leaner friendly environment and increasing the leaners git In this vein, ChatGT can function as a catalyst to render the local clsroom nees and offr a list of actionable and tangible solutions for diverse educational needs in instructional and assesment levels. In doing so, teachers can rely on the chatbot to adapt their sllabus in a more flexible and responsive manner wherein the students' educational and psycho-emotional needs are fulfiled simultaneously. As a result, L2 classrooms would possbly become more interesting and engaging situations wherein the shared rapport between teachers and students pave the way for collective growth and enjoyment Secondly, the study bridged a gap between the realm of artificial intelligence and L2 emotions by proposing and testing a ChatGPT-powered rapport-building protocol. The idea-generation propert of ChatGPT can function as a means by which students can be empowered to self-regulate their learning process. Providing immediate and detailed feedbacks, long-term assessment, user-friendlines, and idea generation features of the chatbot are among the reasons that can help the learners maintain their interes and efort in long periods of time and bolster their gritty mindset. Thirdly, ChatGPT can also be considered as a stres-coping asstant. In other words, the chatbot is capable of offering insights about different challenges of L2 learning along with practical solutions for overcoming those hardships. Aditionally, the results supported Wong et al.'s (2022) claims that well-being promotion requires an enhancement in well-being related factors tus, development of L2 grit hrough ChatGPT instruction would support his idea and denotes that the field of AI can be a proper source for offering practical and actionable solutions to learners' psycho-emotional needs.

Future researcher can tackle the claims of the present study to adressits limitations and expand its generalizability by considering more robust methodological designs which consider the interplay of rapport, grit, and similar positive or negative factors with reference to the mediating role of ChatGPT. In doing so, reearchers are suggested to modify or reconstruct the CGRBP to further justify its inclusion in educational ciphers. Moreover, divers samples can enrich the current and similar research results. The present study hypothesized that teacher-student rapport is promotable by ChatGPT; however, the discussions were based solely on the fluctuations of learners' grit. Future studies are suggested to reconsider this interplay by treating both variables equally. The field of L2 emotions requires more innovative studies to fully picture ins and outs f psycho-emotional factors. Moreover, there has een a call for pursuing antidots for negative efects of language teaching and leaning stressors; therefore it is suggested that researchers introduce more reliable stes-coping statgie. In dongso, inrdscilinay stdes which consider ther diclies such s atific inelligence can be an interesting starting point for portraying an emotionally supportive pedagogy.

# 7. Conclusion

Overall this study shed light on the efectivenessof ChatGPT on cultivating a motivational and emotionally-supportive L2 learning environment. Results also showed that the inclusion of AI-wired mechanisms like ChatGPT through a structured and controlled manner would potentiall lead to positive outcomes. The increased L2 grit of the learners through teacher-student rapport amplified by ChatGPT provided further evidence for the idea that grit is promotable. The promotion which helps the students thrive in language learning hardships and remain interested in achieving their long-term goals, and move towards a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, and well-being.
