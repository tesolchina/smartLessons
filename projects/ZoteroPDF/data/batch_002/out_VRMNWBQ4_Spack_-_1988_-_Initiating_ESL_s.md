TESOL QUARTERLY

# Editor's Note

Readers of the TESOL Quarterly may notice that this and the next two issues are somewhat smaller than previous issues. Whereas the Quarterly has averaged slightly over 200 pages per issue for the last 3 years, the first three issues of Volume 22 will be some 20 pages shorter. This restriction in length is the result of budgetary action taken by the TESOL Executive Board last September. I fully expect that, this restriction in length notwithstanding, Volume 22 will offer readers the full variety of insights and perspectives that the Quarterly aims to present.

For some time, we have wished to expand our coverage of recent publications of ESOL text and reference materials. Accordingly, we plan to publish in each issue, in addition to the comprehensive reviews that have been a mainstay of the Quarterly, a number of book notices. I am pleased to announce that book notices—short reviews of approximately 350 words—will become a regular part of the Quarterly, beginning with the December 1988 issue. Complete specifications for the preparation of book notices will appear in the June 1988 issue and in all subsequent issues. Readers interested in contributing book notices may wish to contact Polly Ulichny, Review Editor, for further information.

# In This Issue

This issue of the TESOL Quarterly features contributions on a variety of topics—including the Quarterly itself—in teaching English to speakers of other languages and in ESOL teacher development. The teaching of writing for academic purposes, of pronunciation, of grammar, and of spelling and reading are all dealt with by one or more contributions, while other discussions focus on the predictive value of English language proficiency testing for undergraduate-level international students, the role of the practicum in ESOL teacher preparation programs, perspectives on teacher supervision and observation in general, and selected aspects of the growth and development of the Quarterly.

• Jack Richards and Graham Crookes report the findings of their questionnaire survey of the nature and role of the teaching practicum in graduate TESOL programs in the United States. Almost 60 respondents described the objectives of the practicum course in their programs; the setting in which student teaching experiences take place; the logistics of the practicum (whether the practicum is compulsory for all students, regardless of previous teaching experience, and at what point in their degree program students typically take the practicum); the practicum curriculum; and the nature of supervised classroom teaching experience. Richards and Crookes found that although “the practicum has come to be acknowledged as an important part of the ESL teacher’s professional preparation in many TESOL programs,” there is “a wide variety of options for designing and implementing the practicum.” The article concludes with a number of recommendations, central among which is a call for research on the effectiveness of current practicum practices.

• Ruth Spack discusses problems in initiating students into the academic discourse community, a task that in her view is confounded by our imprecise knowledge of what academic writing is and by the gap “between what students bring to the academic community and what the academic community expects of them.” Spack examines a recent trend, which has been influenced by the Writing Across the Curriculum approach and by the English for specific purposes movement, to have English teachers teach students to write for disciplines other than English. Such expectations, the author argues, place unreasonable demands on composition teachers. According to Spack, “the English composition course is and should be a humanities course,” in which “the best we can accomplish is to create programs in which students can learn general inquiry strategies, rhetorical principles, and tasks that can transfer to other course work. This has been our traditional role. and it is a worthy one.” The article includes a discussion of how academic writing can be incorporated into a composition course without linking the course to any particular subject-area program.

• Susan Bland examines the increasing frequency of so-called stative verbs in the progressive aspect—as illustrated by a sentence like He is resembling his brother more and more every day—in order to elucidate the progressive from a discourse perspective. Bland argues that the occurrence of progressive forms—progressive statives included—arises from the speaker’s wish to focus “on a change (or changes) of state.” Recent linguistic and applied linguistic accounts of the progressive emphasize that this form is used to focus on the internal structure of events and that virtually any verb can be used for this purpose. Progressive statives reflect a speaker’s desire to emphasize the dynamic features of what is normally perceived as an unchanging state or situation. In addition to adding expressive strength to a predication, progressive forms of stative verbs fulfill a variety of other communicative functions. The author claims that a discourse perspective on the progressive can help explain the nature of ESL speakers’ errors and can complement conventional treatments of the progressive in ESL textbooks.

• Terry Santos reports the results of a study that investigated the reactions of university professors to compositions written by a Chinese and a Korean student. A total of 178 professors representing different academic disciplines participated in the study, which elicited judgments about the content and language of the compositions. In general, the results suggested that the “professors are willing to look beyond the deficiencies of language to the content in the writing of these [ESL] students.” According to Santos, her data indicate that “although they regarded errors as linguistically unacceptable, the professors still judged content and language independently, to the extent that this was possible.” The author points out, however, that it is not at all clear whether this apparent effort to separate judgments of content and language is a measure of tolerance or reflects the view that it is futile to demand linguistic correctness of nonnative writers.

• Garry Molholt describes how visual displays of ESL learners’ speech patterns can be used to help students overcome pronunciation problems. Molholt shows how a computer-generated visual display of pronunciation provides students with “objective information about the location, extent, type and significance of [an] error, as well as the progress made in correcting the error.” The technique described in the article has distinct advantages over both traditional classroom work in pronunciation, in which teachers make subjective evaluations of and then discuss students’ pronunciation errors, and language-laboratory work, in which learners must compare their performance with the pronunciation of the speaker on a master tape. Although the article focuses on the features of American English pronunciation that present special challenges for speakers of Mandarin Chinese, the use of visual displays of speech to improve pronunciation at the phonemic, word, and sentence levels would appear to be valuable for speakers of other languages as well. The article concludes with recommendations for integrating the procedures described with class work in spoken English.

• John Fanselow argues for a different perspective on the use of observation and supervision of teaching. Fanselow argues that despite their differences, the various models of supervision in use all aim to provide “help”; the alternative goal he proposes is “self-explorationseeing one’s own teaching differently.” He points out that “observing others or ourselves to see teaching differently is not the same as being told what to do by others. Observing to explore is a process; observing to help or to evaluate is providing a product.” Pre- and inservice programs that choose to encourage efforts by teachers to investigate their own teaching might include activities involving the collection and grouping of data, the development of multiple interpretations of a classroom event, and self-observation practices. The goal of such activities is to foster a sense of the “value of process . . . the construction of our own knowledge, not the acceptance of the knowledge of others in some type of package, as a product.”

Also in this issue:

• Reviews: Melanie Schneider reviews Ann Raimes’s Exploring Through Writing: A Process Approach to ESL Composition; Ann Cessaris reviews Sounds and Rhythm: Focus on Vowels and Speak Up!, two pronunciation texts.   
• Brief Reports and Summaries: Jeanne Polak and Stephen Krashen report the findings of three studies of the relationship between spelling competence and voluntary reading for ESL students at the community college level, and Yolanda Padron and Hersholt Waxman report on a study that examined whether third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade Hispanic ESL students’ perceptions of the cognitive strategies that they used in reading were related to their reading achievement.   
• The Forum: John Swales describes the growth and development of the TESOL Quarterly, as reflected by a citational analysis of 192 main articles published during the Quarterly’s first 20 years; Patricia Johnson reports the findings of a study that examined the English language proficiency and academic performance of undergraduate international students at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

# The Practicum in TESOL

JACK C. RICHARDS and GRAHAM CROOKES University of Hawaii at Manoa

This article reports the results of a questionnaire survey of how the teaching practicum is conducted in U.S. graduate TESOL programs. Information was sought on the objectives of the practicum, the kinds of training experiences and activities employed, and how the practicum is implemented. The results are discussed with reference to key issues in the field of practice teaching in TESOL.

The Directory of Professional Preparation Programs in TESOL in the United States (Frank-McNeil, 1986) lists 120 institutions that have programs leading to a master’s degree. These programs typically offer a wide range of courses serving a diverse student population. Some lead to certification so that graduates may teach in public schools; other programs have a particular specialization, such as bilingual education, adult education, or teaching English overseas. Most attempt to achieve their goals through offering a balanced curriculum emphasizing both theory and practice. However, theory sometimes wins out over practice.

In a survey of American MA TESOL graduates working in Japan (Richards & Hino, 1983), the most frequently studied courses in MA TESOL programs were phonology, transformational grammar, structural linguistics, second language acquisition, first language acquisition, and contrastive analysis. In the same survey respondents reported that the courses they found to be most useful in view of the professional demands made on them as practicing language teachers were practice teaching, classroom management, second language acquisition, materials writing and adaptation, method analysis, and phonology.

In most MA TESOL programs, the practice teaching course, or practicum, is the major opportunity for the student teacher to acquire the practical skills and knowledge needed to function as an effective language teacher. Yet there is little research or literature in the field of ESOL concerning the nature of the teaching practicum.l Our goal was to identify the objectives of the teaching practicum, the different possibilities for designing and implementing a practicum course, and the kinds of training experiences and activities employed in American MA TESOL programs and their effectiveness. This article addresses these questions by reporting on a survey of practicum courses in MA TESOL programs and by examining key issues in the field of practice teaching.

The data reported here were obtained from a questionnaire that was mailed to the 120 programs in the United States listed in FrankMcNeil (1986) as having courses leading to a master’s degree. It should be noted that not all of these programs lead to a degree in ESL or TESOL; 60 of these institutions provide a degree that is not in ESL or any of its equivalent acronyms, not in applied linguistics, and not even an education degree specifically in some form of ESL. They claim only concentrations, specializations, or endorsements in ESL, as subordinate to, for example, elementary education or linguistics.

The questionnaire was addressed to the supervisor or instructor in charge of the teaching practicum course in such programs and contained questions concerning the goals, organization, and content of the practicum. A total of 78 responses were received, a response rate of $6 5 \%$ Of these, 19 were null responses, from programs without a practicum. For each major section of the survey— objectives of the practicum course, the context or setting for the practicum, logistics of the practicum, the curriculum, and supervised classroom teaching—this article first presents the results of the survey, followed by a discussion of the issues raised. Recommendations for the objectives, setting, logistics, curriculum, and supervision of the practicum are then presented.

# OBJECTIVES OF THE PRACTICUM COURSE The Survey

Respondents were asked to rank 8 objectives for a practicum

1 The situation is little better in mainstream education. Zeichner (1980) states that course in order of importance. The results were as follows:

1 To provide practical experience in classroom teaching   
2 To apply instruction from theory courses   
3 To provide opportunities to observe master teachers   
4.5 To give feedback on teaching techniques   
4.5 To develop increased awareness of personal teaching style   
6 To develop lesson-planning skills   
7 To develop ability to select/adapt materials   
8 To become familiar with specific methods (e.g., the Silent W

Respondents were also asked to identify the most important skills that students were expected to learn from the practicum. No consistent pattern of answers emerged from this open-ended question. A wide variety of skills were mentioned, such as classroom management, ability to individualize lessons, time management skills, lesson planning, awareness of teaching style, and ability to interact with students. In studies of practicums in the field of general teacher education, a similar diversity and vagueness of purposes have been reported (Beyer, 1984; Erdman, 1983; Ginsburg & Newman, 1985; Goodman, 1983, 1985; Tabachnick & Zeichner, 1984; Zeichner & Teitelbaum, 1982).

# Discussion

The objectives stated for a practicum course reflect how the nature of teaching is viewed as well as how teacher development is thought to occur. Thus, they reflect the approach or philosophy implicit in the program. Teaching may be viewed as an art, as a craft, as a technology, or as a science, and each of these viewpoints makes different assumptions about the role of the teacher educator and the student teacher as well as about how teacher development occurs. A program directed toward the acquisition of specific skills or competencies, for example, may have different objectives from one that seeks to develop certain qualities in teachers (Richards, 1987).

These differences in program philosophy are reflected in differences in terminology: A program may be described in terms of teacher training, or teacher preparation, on the one hand, or in terms of teacher development, or teacher education, on the other. Despite its current prominence, this dichotomy is not recent but dates back at least to Dewey’s influence on education at the turn of the century (Haberman, 1983). Larsen-Freeman (1983) suggests that teacher training involves a situation-oriented approach, characterized by finite objectives, in which trainees master a particular model of teaching. Teacher education, on the other hand, involves an individual-oriented approach with a focus on developing decision-making and hypothesis-generating skills. The emphasis is on the process rather than on a specific method or model of teaching. The absence of a uniform set of objectives for the practicum course may reflect philosophical differences of this kind.

# THE CONTEXT OR SETTING FOR THE PRACTICUM The Survey

Respondents were asked to identify where the student teaching experiences occur. The most frequent settings were (a) in an ESL program on campus $( 4 6 \% )$ , (b) in a high school or elementary school $( 3 6 \% )$ , (c) in a community college or adult program $( 2 9 \% )$ , and (d) in a private ESL program off campus $( 2 1 \% )$ . (Since more than one answer was possible, these percentages do not total 100. )

# Discussion

Teaching experiences can be characterized as either campus based or “field based.” Campus-based experiences, such as working in a university English language institute program for foreign students, offer a very different kind of experience from the situation a teacher might encounter in a public school or teaching English abroad. Campus-based experiences may consequently differ so radically from ESL or bilingual programs in elementary and high schools or from private language schools abroad that they do not offer realistic teaching experiences. On the other hand, campusbased programs may be endowed with good facilities, well-trained staff, and superior support systems, providing the student teacher with experiences superior to those available off campus.

# LOGISTICS OF THE PRACTICUM The Survey

For most programs $( 8 5 \% )$ represented in the survey, the practicum course was compulsory, and in about half of these $( 4 8 \% )$ , there were no grounds for exemption. In the remainder, students were usually exempted only on the grounds of previous teaching experience, but the length and required conditions varied considerably among programs. Conditions mentioned included whether or not previous teaching was supervised, whether or not ESL instruction was involved, and what sort of documentation was required.

Most respondents referred to the length of their practicum in credit hours. For these, the average number of credits carried by the practicum was 3.3. The mode was 3 credits. In terms of the academic year this suggests that most practicums take place over the course of a single semester.

In most of the sample $( 8 9 \% )$ , students took the practicum near or at the end of their degree program. The majority of respondents $( 7 9 \% )$ indicated that the practicum had prerequisites. If the practicum was intended to be taken at the beginning of the program, prerequisites usually consisted of one to three introductory courses (usually including one methods course). If the practicum was to be taken at the end, formal or informal prerequisites could consist of up to nine courses.

# Discussion

The stringent requirements for exemption from the practicum perhaps reflect the increasing professionalization of the field of TESOL. Merely having taught before is no longer accepted as a guarantee that adequate teaching skills have been developed. Practice does not necessarily make perfect: What is needed is good practice.

With regard to the length of the practicum, given the overall time constraints of an MA program, it is perhaps not surprising to find a great deal of agreement about practicum duration. The only notable exceptions to the one-semester generalization were programs in which it was possible to have a 6-credit, two-semester practicum, one semester at the beginning of the program and one at the end.

As the results indicate, practicum placement was split, though a rationale for placement did not emerge. It seems likely that if students generally have little teaching experience, the practicum would be placed early in the program, and if students are mainly experienced, the practicum would be placed at the end (though a case for the converse can also be made).

# THE CURRICULUM The Survey

Two questions sought information on the kinds of experiences and activities provided during the practicum. These questions specified a number of alternatives, but provision was made for respondents to write in any activities not mentioned. In response to a question on the content of the practicum, the following activities were cited (ranked by frequency of mention across all programs):

1.5 Observation of experienced teachers   
1.5 Regular classroom teaching (supervised)   
3 Individual conferences with supervisor/master teacher   
4 Regular classroom teaching (unsupervised)   
5.5 Observation of peers   
5.5 Seminars   
7.5 Viewing of videotapes of participant trainees’ teaching   
7.5 Microteaching of peers   
9.5 Microteaching of ESL students   
9.5 Workshops   
11 Viewing of sample lessons

Respondents were also asked to indicate which of the activities they listed they had spent the most time on. The following ranking was obtained:

1 Regular classroom teaching (supervised)   
2 Regular classroom teaching (unsupervised)   
3 Observation of experienced teachers   
4.5 Individual conferences with supervisor/master teacher   
4.5 Seminars   
6.5 Viewing of videotapes of participants’ teaching   
6.5 Microteaching of ESL students   
8.5 Viewing of videotapes of example teaching   
8.5 Observation of peers   
10.5 Workshops   
10.5 Viewing of sample lessons

In addition, respondents reported on facilities utilized in practicums. In terms of availability the following facilities were cited: video-recording facilities, audio-recording facilities, trained audiovisual staff, and observation rooms. The majority of respondents, however, reported that available facilities were rarely used. (These were absolute majorities, except in the case of videotape use, for which respondents were split: rarely used was selected by $4 6 \%$ , sometimes used by $2 7 \%$ , and often used by $2 7 \% .$ )

# Discussion

The experiences provided for the novice teacher during a practicum can be classified according to whether they are direct, or first-hand, or whether they are indirect, or second-/third-hand (Cruickshank & Armaline, 1986). Direct experiences involve the student teacher either in real teaching experiences in a real classroom or in teaching in a contrived situation, such as teaching peers or teaching a class specially constituted to serve as a vehicle for practice teaching. Indirect experiences involve watching someone else teach. The observation may be either of a real class or of a specially constituted class. Activities cited in the survey indicate the practicum typically includes a mix of both direct and indirect teaching experiences.

Direct teaching experiences cited in the survey included supervised and unsupervised classroom teaching as well as microteaching. Indirect experiences included observation of experienced teachers and peers. Unsupervised teaching, microteaching, and observation are discussed in this section. Since a separate question in the survey addressed the issue of supervision, this topic is discussed in the next section.

Direct experiences. Although the practicum in many programs involved only supervised teaching experiences, in some programs students completed a portion of their degree program on campus and then completed their practicum requirement in the field. For example, a student might work as a full-time ESL teacher in an ESL program abroad, enabling him or her to complete part of the degree requirement while in full-time employment. The student would then be immersed in the full-time job of being a teacher with only occasional (if any) contact with the program in the form of a site visit by a faculty member.

The use of unsupervised regular classroom teaching as a component of teacher preparation reflects a long-held view that many skills of teaching can only be acquired through actual classroom teaching (Conant, 1963; Merril, 1967). Skills that might be developed in this way include handling the routines of the classroom, developing student-teacher rapport, and learning classroom management strategies. In addition, the student is expected to put theory into practice through confronting the practical realities of the classroom and the school. It may be assumed that the learning processes involved are largely selfdirected. At its best, such an experience is coupled with or follows training in self-awareness of teaching. Support is also provided to assist the student teacher in this process, through the use of assessment schedules or reports (see Dewey, 1904).

Some question an overdependence on unsupervised classroom teaching, pointing out that such experiences provide few opportunities for diagnosis or evaluation of teacher performance and that the behavior of student teachers cannot be described except in terms of their own recollections. As Smith (1972) observed, an experience of this kind

rests on the gratuitous assumption that first hand experience and student teaching are [italics added] training. At best, student teaching is a reality from which the trainee learns by trial and error and a minimum of feedback. The situations that arise in his teaching are fleeting in tenure and can be discussed only in retrospect. He cannot ‘work through’ the situations again to correct his behavior because classroom work moves rapidly from situation to situation and no situation can be reinstated for the practice of technique. (p. 232)

Hence, there is a need for data on how such practical experience can best be organized. As Haberman (1983) notes,

there has been and remains no greater need than to systematically gather data to support or refute this contention that certain kinds of practice teaching lead to technicians and other forms of student teaching lead to students of teaching. (p. 104)

Alternatives to unsupervised field experiences include supervised field experiences and more focused training experiences, such as microteaching—a procedure that captures the essence of the training approach. From the perspective of training, teaching is approached in terms of specific skills and strategies that can be acquired through direct training. According to Joyce (1980), the major components of training are as follows:

1. presentation of theory   
2. modelling or demonstration of skills or models   
3. practice in simulated and classroom settings   
4. structured feedback   
5. open-ended feedback   
6. coaching for application. (p. 34)

Similar to the training approach is the clinical approach (Nutter, 1986), in which student teachers

systematically observe, simulate, and actually perform the activities of teachers in a controlled environment, under close supervision, and with feedback on their performance and opportunity to relearn, in conjunction with their studies of theory and research in pedagogy and foundation disciplines. (p. 59)

Examples of clinical activities cited by Nutter are simulations, controlled practice activities such as microteaching and peer teaching, and case studies such as video presentations. Microteaching is one such activity reported in the present survey. (Although the ranking of microteaching appears to be relatively low, this is partly attributable to the fact that the responses are divided across two categories—microteaching of ESL students and microteaching of peers.)

Microteaching was originally based on the idea that teaching is a complex set of behaviors that can be broken down into different skills that can be isolated and practiced individually. Usually, the teacher trainee teaches a short minilesson, either to real students or peers, which is video-recorded and later discussed in individual or group tutorials (Cripwell & Geddes, 1979; Cruickshank, 1985). Microteaching is used as a complement to other training activities in a teacher preparation program. A number of different schools of microteaching have evolved, varying according to the use of peers or real students as pupils and the kind of feedback provided (Brown, 1975; Garvey, 1978). Microteaching is said to provide for more focused practice than real teaching. However, critics argue that it is often an artificial activity, removed from the reality of the regular classroom.

Politzer (1969) was the first to apply microteaching to the preparation of foreign language teachers. At the time of its first applications in language teacher education, audiolingualism was the favored language teaching method. It was hence relatively easy to identify skills that were appropriate for practice through microteaching, for example, drilling, correcting errors, presenting a new grammatical structure, or teaching an aspect of pronunciation. Model teacher behaviors could thus be identified and practiced. Although audiolingualism has since been replaced as the dominant methodology in ESOL and the need for this kind of skill training is no longer widely acknowledged, there are still aspects of classroom methodology that can be practiced in a microteaching format, such as setting up group activities, conducting a role play, or using different kinds of classroom tasks, for example, information gap activities, pair work, and so forth. (For positive reports of the relevance of microteaching in British programs, see Cripwell & Geddes, 1979; Phillips, 1975; Stoddard, 1981; see also E1-Naggar & Heasley, 1987, for a study of the use of microteaching in an EFL teacher training program.)

Indirect experiences. In the practicum, indirect experiences can involve observation of the master teacher, observation of sample lessons, and observation of peers. The following activities were cited in the survey, ranked by frequency of use:

1 Observation of experienced teachers   
2 Viewing of videotapes of sample lessons   
3.5 Observation of peers   
3.5 Viewing of videotapes of peers

It is not surprising that observation should absorb such a large section of time in practicums, since it constitutes the most basic component of any form of training that can be used to learn a complex skill. It is a basic element of the oldest model of teacher training—learning through apprenticeship. What needs to be explored is how effective it is and whether its effectiveness justifies its large share of the practicum. In the present context, a distinction can be made between long-term observation of a cooperating teacher and the observation of individual examples of teaching. The latter may be live sample lessons taught by either the cooperating teacher or supervisor or, alternatively, videotaped lessons, possibly professionally developed.

Although the survey did not probe exactly how observation takes place, it has been noted elsewhere that

although student teachers have always observed prior to taking over a class, they typically observe as they grade papers, help pupils with seatwork, and perform other clerical tasks for supervising teachers, or, they sit quietly and “look” without training in the skills of observation. (Mills, 1980, p. 5)

The need for a more focused approach to observation has therefore been stressed. This position is taken by Mills, who advocates training student teachers in clinical observation (as opposed to Nutter’s clinical approach).

Mills (1980) defines clinical observation as the “structured, intense, systematic viewing and recording of significant information about classroom environments and events” (p. 5). She points out that the student teacher needs to acquire information concerning a classroom’s schedule of activities, character of instruction, organization, management, norms, and rituals. Not all the information that could be provided to the student teacher is provided, and there may be mismatches between the expectations engendered by other parts of the training program and the reality of the ESL classroom. Developing an observation system that provides for a detailed breakdown of classroom experience at successively finer levels of analysis under these headings allows supervisors of student teachers to

(a) identify and question discrepancies between things learned on campus and events in the classroom; (b) use observational data as a basis for improving communication; (c) clarify any misconceptions student teachers might have about what they observed; and (d) supply information that is conspicuously absent from student teachers’ observational data. (Mills, 1980, p. 6)

The allocation of more time to the observation of live examples of teaching than to the viewing of videotaped examples of teaching noted in the survey is supported in a recent investigation into the effectiveness of demonstration lessons (in a mainstream, K-12 education program). Putnam (1985) compared a variety of demonstration formats, including both live and videotaped lessons, and found that live demonstrations of connected lessons were perceived to be most beneficial.

# SUPERVISED CLASSROOM TEACHING

Of all practicum experiences, supervised classroom teaching ranked highest for time allocation in TESOL practicum programs. This experience normally involves practice teaching in a regular classroom under the direction of a cooperating teacher and under the overall supervision of the supervisor of the practicum course. Since the survey suggests that the practicum is largely dependent on supervised practice teaching, the choice of cooperating teacher and the kind of supervision provided are clearly key factors in determining the success of the practicum course. Several questions in the survey addressed the choice of the master teacher and the kind of supervision provided.

# The Survey

The results indicated that the selection of cooperating teachers was done on a case-by-case basis. Although no clear pattern emerged, factors cited included the proximity of the participating school to the campus, the familiarity of the cooperating teacher to the course supervisor, the fact that the cooperating teacher graduated from the same university program, nomination of the cooperating teacher by students in the program, person-al contact with the cooperating teacher, and reputation of the cooperating teacher. At best, cooperating teachers were selected because of their known skills as teachers; at worst, by availability.

The survey indicated that in about half the programs surveyed, responsibility for the practice teaching experience was shared by the master teacher and the supervisor, whereas in other programs the supervisor assumed the main responsibility for the practice teaching.

Feedback on student performance during practice teaching originated most often from the supervisor. Students rarely gave each other feedback on their practice teaching. The forms of feedback in order of frequency of use were as follows:

1 Conferences with supervisor/cooperating teacher   
2 Observation of videotapes of a lesson   
3 Peer feedback   
4.5 Written reports   
4.5 Use of audiotapes of a lesson

Most respondents $( 8 7 \% )$ reported the use of a checklist or observation form as a standardized procedure for giving written feedback.

# Discussion

The concept of teaching practice reflects an apprenticeship view of the process of teacher education. The novice teacher is “apprenticed” to a “master teacher” and is expected to learn some of the master teacher’s skills through observing, working with, and, in many cases, getting feedback from the master teacher. The standard pattern of organization is one in which the ESL department or program enlists the cooperation of schools or teachers who agree to offer classrooms for teaching practice. The practice teaching typically begins with observation of the cooperating teacher, with the student gradually taking over responsibility for teaching part of a lesson, under the supervision of the cooperating teacher. Supervision by the coordinator of the practicum course may take the form of occasional or regular visits by the supervisor, reports to the supervisor from the cooperating teacher or the student, peer feedback, or conferences with the supervisor.

The kinds of experiences students encounter in their practice teaching are to some extent dependent on chance, since master teachers may make different kinds of demands on student teachers. As a consequence, a substantial portion of the content of the practicum is probably beyond the control of the practicum supervisor, since there is often little or no control over the interaction between the master teacher and the trainee. As Cruickshank and Armaline (1986) put it:

One field-based teacher educator might . . . ask the [student] to spend considerable time observing, then practicing according to a local standard. Another . . . might demand the student define his or her role as a teacher, act on it, and consider its consequences and outcomes. (p. 37)

The success of the practice teaching experience depends therefore on the kinds of liaison and communication established between supervisor and master teacher. The responsibilities of the cooperating teacher and the purpose of visits from the supervisor need to be clearly established. At the same time, student teachers need to be made aware of what is expected of them. Zimpher, deVoss, and Nott (1980), in one of the few studies of the relationship between supervision and teacher trainees, attest to the crucial role of the supervisor:

First, at least four of the findings suggest that if the university supervisor were not directly involved in the student teaching experience, there would have been no direction set for requirements, evaluation, or assessment of the student teacher’s experience in the school site. Second, informational communication between participants appeared to be enhanced because of the presence of the university supervisor. Students and teachers (and the principal) appeared unable to deal with each other very directly and needed an interlocutor’s assistance—in this case the university supervisor. Third, even though the university supervisor in our study appeared to be frustrated by a lack of direct influence on the teaching style of the student teachers, the supervisor seemed to be the only one making any critical contributions to the student teachers’ progress. (p. 14)

# RECOMMENDATIONS

In the last 20 years, the practicum has come to be acknowledged as an important part of the ESL teacher’s professional preparation in many TESOL programs. However, this survey of practicum courses revealed a wide variety of options for designing and implementing the practicum. Central issues that emerged concern objectives for the practicum course, settings used, logistics, the curriculum, and supervision. Comments and recommendations for each of these areas are offered for consideration by practicum supervisors and ESL faculty.

# Objectives

The objectives for the practicum currently reflect the uncertain status of classroom teaching and practical experience in TESOL programs. Programs differ in the extent to which they emphasize the practical aspects of classroom teaching and classroom-based research.

The purpose and value of classroom teaching experiences should be reexamined by faculty involved in ESOL teacher preparation, and the importance of these experiences relative to other components of professional training should be evaluated. Objectives for such experiences should be established and agreed upon by all those involved in each particular program—supervisors, students, and cooperating teachers—and procedures for validating objectives should be developed.

# The Setting

Research on field experiences in teacher education reports that they involve “a complicated set of both positive and negative consequences that are often subtle in nature” (Zeichner, 1980, p. 46). On the one hand, field experiences are often claimed to be “the only indisputably essential element in professional education” (Conant, 1963, p. 142). On the other hand, off-campus experiences are reported to induct the trainee into the old conservative patterns and norms of school practices (Hooper & Johnston, 1973).

In ESOL teacher preparation we know of no studies that have examined exactly what takes place during field experiences and the interaction between such experiences and the campus program. Such information is essential in determining the contribution of field experiences to the student teacher’s professional development. As we noted earlier, exclusive reliance on campus-based experiences provides a limited exposure to the real world of TESOL.

We recommend that a balance of both campus-based and fieldbased experiences should be provided but that careful considera\~ tion should be given as to precisely what students are expected to learn (and how) from both kinds of experiences.

# Logistics

The central issues here center on whether the practicum can be exempted, the length of the practicum, and its positioning within the program. This is one area in which practicum supervisors can exercise little control, but one in which decisions taken have a major impact on the kind of professional training a student gets in a TESOL program.

A student’s previous teaching experience should not be accepted as grounds for exemption from a practicum unless there is evidence that this teaching was carried out under the supervision and direction of a qualified and experienced teacher. The relative weighting of the practicum course and its positioning within a TESOL program should be subjected to critical scrutiny to ensure that an optimum integration of theoretical and practical components has been achieved, according to the goals of the program.

# The Curriculum

In view of the lack of agreement on objectives for a practicum in TESOL, it is not surprising that there is also a wide range of options in use concerning the kinds of experiences students will encounter during their practicum. In the absence of any substantial data on the value of particular kinds of experiences, a mix of both direct and indirect activities would seem to be the safest strategy.

Thus, we recommend that the practicum curriculum reflect both direct and indirect teaching experiences, with careful consideration given to what students are expected to learn from each kind of experience and the relationship of each kind of experience to the total curriculum. In addition, a research base concerning the effect of the various components of the practicum on the trainee’s performance as a teacher should be developed.

# Supervision

We question the value of unsupervised field experiences in teacher preparation and support the emphasis on supervised teaching experiences as constituting the core of the practicum. However, the nature of the supervision provided is crucial in determining the quality and value of such experiences. A consistent finding of research on supervision is that the role of the cooperating teacher has been poorly defined and that classroom teachers are usually not well prepared for the task of supervising a student teacher (Grimmett & Ratzlaff, 1986). There may consequently be conflicting expectations on the part of the student teacher, the cooperating teacher, and the program supervisor.

Programs should examine the procedures by which cooperating teachers are chosen and clarify the expectations they have for such teachers. Provision should be made to ensure that the relationship between the cooperating teacher, the student teacher, and the supervisor is a cooperative one and that master teachers are adequately prepared and rewarded for the demands made on them.

# CONCLUSION

Our goal in this article has been to determine current practices and to identify key issues and problems in the practicum in order to establish priorities for needed research. This survey has confirmed that a variety of different approaches are currently in use in implementing the practicum requirement in ESOL teacher preparation programs and that the importance of the experience provided in a practicum is increasingly recognized. However, we still possess little information on the effectiveness of current practicum practices. As Stern (1983) remarked,

there is little research, systematic experimentation, or attested knowledge which would demonstrate that these different procedures [in teacher preparation] actually contribute to the learning experiences of prospective language teachers. (pp. 353-354)

The field of TESOL is not alone in having neglected this aspect of teacher preparation, since the same observations have been made in mainstream education. In the latter case, however, the reasons for neglect have been identified (Haberman, 1983), and an agenda for research and evaluation has been initiated (Katz & Raths, 1985; Ornstein, 1985). It is now time for professionals in ESOL teacher education to apply the same concerns for knowledge and effectiveness that we have with regard to second language teaching to the training and education of second language teachers.

# Initiating ESL Students Into the Academic Discourse Community: How Far Should We Go?

RUTH SPACK Tufts University and Boston University

In the interest of finding ways to help their students succeed in university studies, college-level L2 writing researchers and teachers have endeavored for years to define the nature of academic writing tasks. The effort to determine what academic writing is and what ESL students need to know in order to produce it has led to the development of a number of different approaches to the teaching of writing. Most recently, this effort has led to a problematic trend toward having teachers of English, including teachers of freshman composition, teach students to write in other disciplines. This trend has emerged in response to criticism of previous writing programs, analyses of surveys of academic writing tasks, and movements such as Writing Across the Curriculum and English for specific purposes. This article reviews studies of L1 writing programs in which students learn to write in various disciplines, discusses the implications of the researchers’ findings, and argues that (a) the teaching of writing in the disciplines should be left to the teachers of those disciplines and (b) L2 English composition teachers should focus on general principles of inquiry and rhetoric, with emphasis on writing from sources.

Within the last decade, numerous approaches to the teaching of writing in programs for ESL college students have been tried, and much discussion has focused on the most appropriate approach to adopt (see the TESOL Quarterly Forum contributions of Horowitz, 1986c/Liebman-Kleine, 1986/Horowitz, 1986b/Hamp-Lyons, 1986/ Horowitz, 1986a; Reid, 1984b/Spack, 1985a/Reid, 1985; Reid, 1984a/Zamel, 1984). Though a misleading process/product, or process-centered/content-based, dichotomy has characterized the debate, ESL writing researchers and teachers have generally agreed that the goal of college-level L2 writing programs is to prepare students to become better academic writers.

However, the achievement of this goal is complicated by at least two major factors. One is that we have not yet satisfactorily determined, despite numerous surveys, what academic writing is, an issue that this article examines. The other is that there is most often a large gap between what students bring to the academic community and what the academic community expects of them.

In the case of native English-speaking basic writers—academically disadvantaged students who have achieved only very modest standards of high school literacy —Bizzell (1982) points out that the students’ social situation and previous training may hamper their ability to succeed in the academy. In other words, their problems with academic writing may not lie in a lack of innate ability but rather in the social and cultural factors that influence composing. The gap is even wider for ESL students who can be classified as basic writers, for it includes L2 linguistic and cultural deficiencies. Even for ESL students who are highly literate in their native language, a similar gap exists: The students’ lack of L2 linguistic and cultural knowledge can stand in the way of academic success.

It is clearly the obligation of the ESL college-level writing teacher, whether teaching basic writers or highly literate students, to find a way to narrow the gap. As Bizzell (1982) suggests, we must help students master the language and culture of the university; the role of the university writing teacher is to initiate students into the academic discourse community. The issue of concern in this article is the means through which we should fulfill our role.

My concern stems from what I perceive to be a disturbing trend in L2 writing instruction, a trend that has been influenced both by the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) movement in L1 writing instruction and the English for specific purposes (ESP) movement in L2 instruction. This trend toward having teachers of English, including teachers of freshman composition, teach students to write in disciplines other than English may lead many in the composition field to assign papers that they are ill-equipped to handle. The purpose of this article is to remind teachers of English that we are justified in teaching general academic writing and to argue that we should leave the teaching of writing in the disciplines to the teachers of those disciplines.

# DEFINING ACADEMIC WRITING

Determining what academic writing is and what ESL students need to know in order to produce it has not been an easy task for researchers and teachers. In fact, a number of L2 writing instructors, including this author, have tried several different approaches, faithfully following textbook guidelines. Early ESL writing textbooks were largely workbooks that fostered controlled composition and that did not satisfy students’ need to learn how to produce their own body of work for their other university courses. Later efforts to have students create their own academic texts often resulted in absurd assignments that students could not logically fulfill. For example, one textbook (Bander, 1978) suggested that science students begin with a topic sentence such as “The importance of oxygen to mankind cannot be overstated” and that humanities students show how “the revolutions that took place in France, the United States, and Russia resulted in major changes in those countries” (p. 30). (This, according to the book, could be done in one paragraph!)

ESL writing textbooks began at this time to be modeled after textbooks for native speakers (NSs) of English, which emphasized the rhetorical patterns researchers claimed were commonly found in American academic prose. These books ask students to write whole pieces of discourse by imitating models (which are, paradoxically, often excerpts rather than whole pieces of discourse) and to describe, compare, classify, define, and determine the cause and effect of everything from religion to Chinese food.

Though still popular with many teachers, this approach has been called into question in both L2 and L1 fields because “starting from given patterns and asking students to find topics and produce essays to fit them is a reversal of the normal writing process” (Shih, 1986, p. 622) and turns attention away from the meaningful act of communication in a social context (Connors, 1981). Furthermore, a recent (though admittedly limited) survey of actual writing assignment handouts given to university students by teachers in courses other than writing (Horowitz, 1986d) reveals that these assignments do not ask students to start from patterns and produce essays to fit them. If further research bears this out, it will be safe to say that this pattern-centered approach is not suitable for a program that emphasizes academic writing.

In response to some of this criticism, and again following the model of NS writing textbooks, the ESL field has begun to publish textbooks that emphasize the cognitive process of writing. This approach is based on the research of composition specialists who have drawn on the theories of cognitive psychologists and psycholinguists to explore the mental procedures writers use to communicate ideas (see, for example, the L1 research of Flower & Hayes, 1977, 1981; the L2 research of Lay, 1982; Raimes, 1985; Zamel, 1982, 1983). The thrust of these ESL textbooks (see, for example, Hartfiel, Hughey, Warmuth, & Jacobs, 1985) is to teach students systematic thinking and writing skills so that they can use their own composing strategies effectively to explore ideas. Emphasis is on self-generated topics, with thematically organized readings usually, but not always, acting as springboards for ideas.

Yet the writing produced in such courses has not been universally accepted as academic, even though it takes place in the academy. Much of the writing is based solely on students’ personal experiences or interests. Although this provides students with a drive to learn to write by focusing on what really matters to them, it has its drawbacks. As Bazerman (1980) points out, in emphasizing the writer’s independent self, teachers ignore the fact that writing is “not contained entirely in the envelope of experience, native thought, and personal motivation to communicate” (p. 657).

I would argue that since the personal essay as a genre informs the discipline known as English literature, this kind of writing can be considered academic. It also serves as a vehicle for reflection and self-expression for specialists in many other fields, including science (e.g., Cole, 1985), medicine (e.g., Thomas, 1983), and engineering (e.g., Petroski, 1986). And the personal essay plays a role in students’ future academic success: When they apply for transfer, for scholarships, or to graduate school, they are asked to write on personal topics in order to sell themselves and presumably to display their writing skills. Still, there is no evidence that the skills learned in this kind of writing adequately provide students with the tools they need to produce the academic writing required in other courses.

Although the cognitive process approach is admired because of its emphasis on writing as a learning process and its development of useful, teachable skills, MacDonald (1987) reveals its limitations: Its L1 research (e.g., Flower& Hayes, 1977, 1981) is based on only one kind of writing, which MacDonald describes as “composing with an undefined problem, with the writer forced to create a problem for him- or herself . . . a kind of composing traditionally associated with English departments—whether interpretations of literature or personal essays” (p. 328). Other kinds of writing, such as scientific or social science writing, which have different demands and constraints, are ignored. Raimes’s (1985) L2 research, based on students’ personal experience essays, has been challenged on similar grounds (Horowitz, 1986c).

A further criticism of a process approach that promotes studentgenerated meaning and form is that it does not acknowledge that “most writing for academic classes is in response to a specific assignment or prompt” (Johns, 1986, p. 253). Shaughnessy (1977), Bizzell (1982), and Rose (1985) therefore claim that it does not prepare students to grapple with the challenges of academic life but rather postpones their confrontation with the “complex linguistic and rhetorical expectations of the academy” (Rose, 1985, p. 357).

Bizzell (1982) argues that to succeed in their university studies, students need critical training and recommends a “social-contextual approach” that “demystifies the institutional structure of knowledge” (p. 196). Researchers and textbook writers, Bizzell contends, need to focus on the conventions of academic discourse, emphasizing the relationship between discourse, community, and knowledge. In finding ways to “demystify” academic discourse, ESP researchers have been at the forefront of genre analysis, identifying and analyzing “key genres, such as Case Studies in Business, Legislative documents in Law, lab reports in Science, disease-descriptions in Medicine and Agriculture” (Swales, 1986, p. 18).

L1 and L2 researchers have conducted a number of surveys to determine what writing tasks are actually assigned across academic disciplines. Horowitz (1986d) has found fault with some of the studies (Bridgeman & Carlson, 1984; Johns, 1981, 1985; Kroll, 1979; Ostler, 1980), which, he points out, “beg the question” of what the tasks are: “Instead of trying to discover and classify university writing tasks—a logical prior endeavor—they began with a set of preconceived classifications, forcing on the respondents the particular scheme used in each survey” (p. 448). The surveys of Behrens (1980), Rose (1983), and Horowitz (1986d) take a more ethnographic view, creating classifications after examining the data. Nevertheless, the Horowitz survey has been criticized on the grounds that it is a limited study (only 38 of the 750 faculty members who were contacted responded; only 54 writing assignments were collected) (Raimes, 1987) and that it ignores the context in which the tasks were assigned (Zamel, 1987).

Until we collect more assignments, interview the teachers to learn the purposes of the assigned tasks, observe the courses in which the tasks are assigned, examine the resulting student essays, and analyze the teacher responses to and evaluations of these papers, we cannot truly understand the nature of the academic writing students are asked to produce. Furthermore, we should not forget that it is important to take a critical look at these assignments. Having seen numerous examples of writing assignments for other courses, I suspect that one reason so few faculty members responded to Horowitz is that they may have been reluctant to show English teachers their own poorly written or poorly designed texts. The fact that papers assigned by teachers in other disciplines are different from those assigned in freshman composition classes—the finding of several surveys—does not necessarily mean that the former are superior.

Still, it is impossible and perhaps foolish to ignore the implications of the surveys: The writing students do in courses other than English composition is rarely dependent solely on their own general knowledge base. Rather, “students will be confronted with either academic or professional writing tasks that surface in relation to texts of various kinds (literary, historical, psychological, legal, managerial) or data (computer, laboratory-testing, statistical, chemical)” (Scheiber, 1987, p. 15). These assignments are viewed as a means of promoting understanding of the content presented in subject-matter courses (Shih, 1986). Furthermore, writing academic papers involves the recursive processes of drafting, revising, and editing (Shih, 1986). Therefore, writing teachers can comfortably design process-centered courses around text-based or data-based tasks in which written language acts as a medium for learning something else. What that something else should be is the focus of this article.

# TEACHING WRITING IN THE DISCIPLINES

Until fairly recently, students wrote the various kinds of papers listed above only in classes other than English, with the obvious exception of essays related to literary texts. But there has been a growing tendency in both L1 and L2 composition instruction to add the responsibility of teaching writing in other disciplines to the other responsibilities of English department writing programs. It is beyond the scope of this article to examine all the reasons for this trend; only two of the influences are touched on in this section: Writing Across the Curriculum, an L1 movement, and English for specific or academic purposes, an L2 movement.

# Writing Across the Curriculum

For a number of years, faculty have complained about weaknesses in students’ ability to produce papers of high quality in subject-area courses—weaknesses attributed in part to a loosening of standards in the academy and in part to the change in the student population in the 1960s and 1970s from a somewhat elitist, homogeneous group to an academically underprepared group representing diverse cultures and educational backgrounds. Partly in response to this concern, a movement known as Writing Across the Curriculum, modeled on a British program, took hold in colleges and universities in the 1970s, its purpose to restore writing to its central place in the curricula of institutions of learning (Maimon, 1984). Though there have been several WAC models, they have shared the goal of encouraging instructors in all disciplines to make writing an inevitable part of the teaching and learning process in their courses. In faculty development seminars teachers of English have collaborated with subject-area instructors so that the latter can learn more about writing.

But WAC programs have not always met with success (Russell, 1987). Obstacles such as “increased teaching loads, large classes, administrative responsibilities, lack of collegial support, pressures to research, publish, write grants and the like” (Fulwiler, 1984, p. 119) on teachers in other disciplines have caused some to refuse the extra burden of introducing the writing process into their courses. Furthermore, the lack of understanding on the part of English department faculty of the processes involved in writing essays that are neither personal nor interpretive has led to counterproductive faculty workshops (Applebee, 1986; Fulwiler, 1984). Collaborative faculty workshops have only recently begun to focus on the processes and strategies involved in scientific, technical, and social science writing, perhaps because researchers have only recently begun studying the writing processes of scientists (see Gilbert & Mulkay, 1984; Myers, 1985; and, for a discussion of these and other studies, Swales, 1987), engineers (Selzer, 1983), and social scientists (Becker, 1986).

Faculty development seminars now bring teachers of English together with subject-area instructors not only so that the latter can learn more about writing, but also so that the former can learn more about the subject area (Dick & Esch, 1985). In writing and planning linked courses with colleagues, the English composition teacher’s general goal of strengthening students’ writing skills is becoming the more specific goal of training students to handle the tasks of the other disciplines. This goal has led today to the creation of programs such as that at Beaver College (described in Maimon, Belcher, Hearn, Nodine, & O’Connor, 1981), which are built on the foundation of a cross-disciplinary, required freshman composition course. L1 textbooks designed for use in such English composition courses include instructions for writing in other disciplines—case studies in the social sciences, laboratory reports in the natural sciences, and so on (e.g., Bazerman, 1985; Maimon et al., 1981).

# English for Specific Purposes/English for Academic Purposes

At approximately the same time the WAC movement was gaining prominence in L1 writing instruction, the ESP movement had taken hold in the field of L2 acquisition. ESP programs arose as a “practical alternative to the ‘general’ orientation of language teaching: cultural and literary emphases, education for life” (Maher, 1986, p. 113). Taking as its focus science and technology—the fields with the heaviest concentrations of international students—ESP creates courses, taught by English language teachers, whose aim is generally to fulfill the practical needs of L2 learners and specifically to produce technicians and technocrats who are proficient in English (Coffey, 1984). Collaboration, or team teaching, between the language instructor and the instructor in the other discipline is the preferred method of instruction but is possible “only where there is a high level of goodwill and mutual interest and understanding” (Coffey, 1984, p. 9).

When the students’ needs consist of “the quick and economical use of the English language to pursue a course of academic study” (Coffey, 1984, p. 3), English for academic purposes (EAP) is offered. The incorporation of writing into the EAP curriculum, however, necessitates collaboration with the instructor in the other discipline, following what Shih (1986) calls the “adjunct model” of many university composition programs for native students. But the development of such programs for ESL students has been slow, and Shih recommends that we learn from existing programs:

The potential contributions and possible limitations of the adjunctcourse approach for ESL programs in general, and for preparing ESL students to handle university writing tasks in particular, remain to be evaluated. What is needed, minimally, is cooperation from subject-area instructors and ESL faculty willingness to step into subject-area classrooms and keep up with class events. For ESL instructors seeking to set up adjunct courses, the experiences of composition adjunct programs already in place for native students are a rich source of information. (p. 640)

The next section of this article examines studies of these NS programs and discusses the implications of the researchers’ findings.

# STUDIES OF WRITING PROGRAMS IN THE DISCIPLINES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS

Several L1 programs have been instituted to introduce students to the methods of inquiry in various disciplines. In typical programs, English teachers have collaborated with teachers in other disciplines, such as biology (Wilkinson, 1985), psychology (Faigley & Hansen, 1985), and sociology (Faigley & Hansen, 1985), linking the compositions to subject matter in the other course. Investigations of these programs reveal some obvious advantages: Students learn new forms of writing which as professionals they might need; they have more time to write, since there is less reading due to the fact that one subject matter is employed for two courses; and their discussions of student papers are more informative, since knowledge is shared among class members.

However, the disadvantages of such a program are equally, if not more, significant, as Wilkinson (1985) and others show, and should be of great concern to the English teacher. First of all, it is difficult for a writing course to have a carefully planned pedagogical or rhetorical rationale when it is dependent on another content course; furthermore, the timing of assignments is not always optimal. Second, the program can raise false expectations among the faculty as well as among the students. English faculty, even when they collaborate with content teachers, find they have little basis for dealing with the content. They therefore find themselves in the uncomfortable position of being less knowledgeable than their students. Students likewise can resent finding themselves in a situation in which their instructor cannot fully explain or answer questions about the subject matter. Faigley and Hansen (1985) observed collaborative courses in which completely different criteria for evaluation were applied to students’ papers by the two teachers because the English teacher did not recognize when a student failed to demonstrate adequate knowledge of a discipline or showed a good grasp of new knowledge.

The same phenomenon can hold true in L2 writing instruction. Pearson (1983) finds that “the instructor cannot always conveniently divorce the teaching of form from the understanding of content” (PP. 390-397). This drawback is often mentioned only in passing in articles recommending that English teachers use technical and scientific materials they are not familiar with (see Hill, Soppelsa, & West, 1982). But the lack of control over content on the part of English teachers who teach in the other disciplines is a serious problem. This concern is reflected in a state-of-the-art article on English for medical purposes (EMP):

A sense of insecurity and uncertainty can sometimes be observed amongst EMP teachers regarding their effective roles as lay persons teaching ‘medical English’ among medical professionals. . .

Occasionally, the specialist informant, who is co-opted on to a teaching programme, harbours suspicions about the language teacher’s motives. Consider the view of the DUODECIM [Finnish Medical Society] team of doctors: ‘We believe that it is essential to have teachers entirely at home in medicine and English and who have some experience in writing and lecturing’ (Collan, 1974:629), and ‘Too few teachers combine enough experience in the use of the English language in general and knowledge of the speciality in particular’ (Lock et al., 1975: cover). ‘Is the teacher trying to teach my subject?’ ‘What if s/he gets the medical bits wrong and misleads the learners?’ (Maher, 1986, p. 138)

In spite of these drawbacks, some investigators claim that it is possible for an English teacher to conduct a course that focuses on writing in a particular discipline if the teacher learns how a discipline creates and transmits knowledge. This is accomplished by examining the kinds of issues a discipline considers important, why certain methods of inquiry and not others are sanctioned, how the conventions of a discipline shape text in that discipline, how individual writers represent themselves in a text, how texts are read and disseminated within the discipline, and how one text influences subsequent texts (Faigley & Hansen, 1985; Herrington, 1985).

This exploration, of course, would involve a great deal of commitment, as anyone who has studied a particular field or discipline knows. Specialists in second language instruction, for example, have spent years acquiring the knowledge and understanding that enable them to recognize the issues that dominate discussion in the field (e.g., communicative competence), the methods of inquiry employed (e. g., ethnography), the structure of manuscripts focusing on those issues (e.g., the TESOL Quarterly format), the names associated with various issues (e.g., Krashen/ Input Hypothesis; Carrell/schema theory; Zamel/writing process), and the impact a given article might have on thinking and research in the field.

It seems that only the rare individual teacher can learn another discipline, for each discipline offers a different system for examining experience, a different angle for looking at subject matter, a different kind of thinking (Maimon et al., 1981). Furthermore, whereas the transmission of a discipline within content courses primarily requires that students comprehend, recall, and display information in examinations, writing in the disciplines requires a complete, active, struggling engagement with the facts and principles of a discipline, an encounter with the discipline’s texts and the incorporation of them into one’s own work, the framing of one’s knowledge within the myriad conventions that help define a discipline, the persuading of other investigators that one’s knowledge is legitimate. (Rose, 1985, p. 359)

The teaching of writing in a discipline, then, involves even more specialized knowledge and skills than does the teaching of the subject matter itself.

The difficulty of teaching writing in another discipline is compounded when we realize that within each discipline, such as the social sciences, there are subdiscipline, each with its own set of conventions. Reflection on personal events, for example, is considered legitimate evidence in sociology and anthropology, but not in behavioral psychology (Rose, 1983). Even within subdiscipline, such as anthropology, there are other subdiscipline with their own sets of conventions. The articles of physical anthropologists, for example, resemble those of natural scientists, whereas those of cultural anthropologists sometimes resemble those of literary scholars (Faigley & Hansen, 1985).

To further complicate matters, no discipline is static. In virtually all academic disciplines there is controversy concerning the validity of approaches, controversy that nonspecialists are usually unaware of until it is covered in the popular media (see, for example, Silk, 1987, for a discussion of the recent debate between political and anthropological historians). In addition, the principles of reasoning in a discipline may change over time, even in science, which is affected by the emergence of new mathematical techniques, new items of apparatus, and even new philosophical precepts (Yearley, 1981). Formal scientific papers, then, though often considered final statements of facts, are primarily contributions to scientific debate (Yearley, 1981).

And although we may be able to read and study texts from other disciplines, analyze genres, and thereby learn writing styles and conventions to teach our students, we should also be aware of any critical stance in relation to the texts. For example, Woodford (1967), editor of a scholarly scientific research journal, has mocked the state of scientific writing:

The articles in our journals—even the journals with the highest standards—are, by and large, poorly written. Some of the worst are produced by the kind of author who consciously pretends to a “scientific scholarly” style. He takes what should be lively, inspiring, and beautiful and, in an attempt to make it seem dignified, chokes it to death with stately abstract nouns; next, in the name of scientific impartiality, he fits it with a complete set of passive constructions to drain away any remaining life’s blood or excitement; then he embalms the remains in molasses of polysyllable, wraps the corpse in an impenetrable veil of vogue words, and buries the stiff old mummy with much pomp and circumstance in the most distinguished journal that will take it. (p. 743)

Woodford argues that this kind of writing is damaging to the students who read it. In his experience as a teacher of graduate students of science, he has found that it adversely affects students’ ability to read, write, and think well. (English teachers, who traditionally have seen themselves as purveyors of effective prose, might do well to wonder why they should present such poorly written texts to their students.)

Even studying a finished product—whether well written or not— cannot prepare English teachers to teach students how writers in other disciplines write. A written product such as a scientific report is merely a representation of a research process, which is finally summarized for peers; it is not a representation of a writing process. To teach writing, writing teachers should teach the writing process; and to teach the writing process, they should know how to write. But English teachers are not necessarily equipped to write in other disciplines. Testimony to this truth appears in the ESP literature:

In the author’s experience, every attempt to write a passage, however satisfactory it seemed on pedagogic grounds, was promptly vetoed by the Project’s scientific adviser because a technical solecism of some kind had been committed. The ESP writer, however experienced, simply does not know when a mistake of this kind is being committed. (Coffey, 1984, p. 8)

To learn to write in any discipline, students must become immersed in the subject matter; this is accomplished through reading, lectures, seminars, and so on. They learn by participating in the field, by doing, by sharing, and by talking about it with those who know more. They can also learn by observing the process through which professional academic writers produce texts or, if that is not possible, by studying that process in the type of program recommended by Swales (1987) for teaching the research paper to nonnative-speaking graduate students. They will learn most efficiently from teachers who have a solid grounding in the subject matter and who have been through the process themselves.

I do not deny that programs that instruct students to write in other disciplines can work. But a review of the L1 literature (e.g., Herrington, 1985) and the L2 literature (e.g., Swales, 1987) on successful programs reveals that the teachers are themselves immersed in the discipline. For example, Herrington’s (1985) study is an observation of senior-level engineering courses taught by engineering faculty. And Swales’s list of publications reveals a background in scientific discourse dating back at least to 1970.

# ACADEMIC WRITING TASKS FOR ESL COLLEGE STUDENTS

English teachers cannot and should not be held responsible for teaching writing in the disciplines. The best we can accomplish is to create programs in which students can learn general inquiry strategies, rhetorical principles, and tasks that can transfer to other course work. This has been our traditional role, and it is a worthy one. The materials we use should be those we can fully understand. The writing projects we assign and evaluate should be those we are capable of doing ourselves. The remainder of this article is devoted to practical suggestions for incorporating academic writing into an English composition course designed for ESL undergraduates, without the need for linking the course with another subject-area program.

# Working With Data

According to a number of surveys discussed earlier, students are often asked to work with data, either as observers or as participants. These experiences can become a part of the writing class instruction. In the L1 literature, Hillocks (1984, 1986) recommends that we engage students in a process of examining various kinds of data—either objects such as shells or photographs, or sets of information such as arguments. Students can be led to formulate and test explanatory generalizations, observe and report significant details, and generate criteria for contrasting similar phenomena.

Such programs have been shown to work in L2 writing classes. Zamel (1984) has reported on a class project in which students read published interviews with workers, then conducted and wrote up their own interviews, and later compared the data. Likewise, students have become amateur ethnographers, observing and evaluating the language in their communities (Zamel, 1986). Such tasks can produce writing that is “rich and original” (Zamel, 1984, p. 202).

But since composing in a second language is an enormously complex undertaking and because “it seems that this complexity has more to do with the constraints imposed by the writing task itself than with linguistic difficulties” (Zamel, 1984, p. 198), students need consistent teacher input in the observation and interviewing processes. They also need regular in-class collaborative workshops so that they can comment on and raise questions about each other’s writing.

# Writing From Other Texts

Though training in observation and interviewing can undoubtedly be useful in students’ academic career, perhaps the most important skill English teachers can engage students in is the complex ability to write from other texts, a major part of their academic writing experience. Students’ “intellectual socialization may be accomplished not only by interacting with people, but also by encountering the writing of others” (Bizzell, 1986, p. 65). As Bazerman (1980) says, “we must cultivate various techniques of absorbing, reformulating, commenting on, and using reading” if we want to prepare our students to “enter the written exchanges of their chosen disciplines and the various discussions of personal and public interest” (p. 658).

L1 and L2 research shows the interdependent relationship between reading and writing processes (see Krashen, 1984; Petrosky, 1982; Salvatori, 1983; Spack, 1985b): Both processes focus on the making of meaning; they share the “act of constructing meaning from words, text, prior knowledge, and feelings” (Petrosky, 1982, p. 22). To become better writers, then, students need to become better readers.

Intelligent response to reading, Bazerman (1980) reminds us, begins with an accurate understanding of a text—not just the facts and ideas, but also what the author is trying to achieve. But this is not easy for second language readers. Even advanced, highly literate students struggle in a way that their NS counterparts do not. First, there are linguistic difficulties. Overcoming them is not simply a matter of learning specialists’ language because often the more general use of language causes the greatest problem, as one of my freshman students pointed out in a working journal (mechanical errors corrected):

During the last few days I had to read several (about 150) pages for my psychology exam. I had great difficulties in understanding the material. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of words I’m unfamiliar with. It’s not the actual scientific terms (such as “repression,” “schizophrenia” “psychosis,” or “neurosis”) that make the reading so hard, but it's descriptive and elaborating terms (e.g., “to coax,” “gnawing discomfort,” “remnants,” “fervent appeal”), instead. To understand the text fully, it often takes more than an hour to read just ten pages. And even then I still didn’t look up all the words I didn’t understand. It is a very frustrating thing to read these kinds of texts, because one feels incredibly ignorant and stupid.

And there are cultural barriers, best expressed by another student (mechanical errors corrected):

My last essay was about bowing in the Japanese culture. After discussing my first draft with my classmates, Ramy and Luis, I felt I could get about half of the message across. But I found it interesting that both of them were stuck at the part where I mentioned Buddhism. I was interested because I saw a similarity with my own experience; i.e., I am always stuck when any essay mentions Christianity. I am not Buddhist or

Shintoist, but Japanese culture is so much influenced by those religions that it is almost impossible to talk about Japan without them. The problem is that many concepts associated with these religions are nonexistent in Christian-influenced society (Western society). I do not know how to explain something which does not exist in the Englishspeaking world in the English language. And I do not know how to understand something that never existed in my frame of reference. To me it is almost as hard as solving complicated math problems.

Given the complexity of reading in a second language, it is necessary for L2 writing teachers to become familiar with theories and techniques of L2 reading instruction (see, for example, Dubin, Eskey, & Grabe, 1986) if they are to guide their students to become better academic writers.

Some of those techniques are already part of L1 and L2 composition instruction. Marginal notes, note taking, working journals (see Spack & Sadow, 1983), and response statements (Petrosky, 1982) can train students to discover and record their own reactions to a text. Exercises that focus on the processes of summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting can encourage precise understanding of an author’s style and purpose. But these techniques should not be ends unto themselves. Rather, paraphrase, summary, and quotation become part of students’ texts as they incorporate key ideas and relevant facts from their reading into their own writing. In this way, students can develop informed views on the issues they pursue, building on what has already been written.

Readings can be content based, grouped by themes, and can be expressive or literary as well as informative. They can be drawn from a specific field, if the area of study is one that the instructor is well versed in, or from several fields, if the articles are written by professionals for a general audience. Although these articles may not be considered academic since they were not written for academic/professional audiences, they can give students an understanding of how writers from different disciplines approach the same subject. Most important, they allow instructors to avoid placing themselves in the awkward position of presenting materials they do not fully understand. But whatever readings are chosen, teachers of ESL students should always consider the background knowledge that readers are expected to bring to written texts (e.g., knowledge of American history, recognition of the publications in which the texts originally appeared, discernment of organizational formats, etc. ) and help their students establish a frame of reference that will facilitate comprehension (Dubin et al., 1986).

Writing tasks should build upon knowledge students already possess but should also be designed to allow new learning to occur. Students can initially write about their own experiences or views, then read, discuss, and respond informally in writing to the assigned readings. They can next be assigned the task of evaluating, testing the truth of, or otherwise illuminating the texts. Students can be directed to compare the ideas discussed in one or more of the readings with their own experiences, or they can be asked to agree or disagree or take a mixed position toward one of the readings. Making specific references to the readings, they can develop ideas by giving examples, citing experiences, and/or providing evidence from other texts on the subject.

By sequencing assignments, the teacher can move the students away from a primarily personal approach to a more critical approach to the readings. The goal should not be regurgitation of others’ ideas, but the development of an independent viewpoint. Students can develop the ability to acknowledge the points of view of others but still “question and critique established authorities in a field of knowledge” (Coles & Wall, 1987, p. 299). This is a particularly important skill for foreign students, many of whom are “products of educational systems where unquestioning acceptance of books and teachers as the ultimate authority is the norm” (Horowitz & McKee, 1984, p. 5).

Yet other assignments, such as research projects utilizing the library and perhaps data from interviews and/or observations, can ask students to evaluate and synthesize material from a number of sources in order to establish a perspective on a given subject or area of controversy. Like the assignments discussed above, this type of assignment allows for demonstration of knowledge and prompts the “independent thinking, researching, and learning” (Shih, 1986, p. 621) often required when students write for their other university courses. Such an assignment also builds on skills students have already practiced: reading, note taking, summarizing, paraphrasing, quoting, evaluating, comparing, agreeing/disagreeing, and so on.

These skills are transferable to many writing tasks that students will be required to perform in other courses when they write for academic audiences. The content will vary from course to course, and the format will vary from discipline to discipline and within disciplines, depending on the particular constraints of individual assignments and the particular concerns of individual teachers. But students should have a fairly good sense of how to focus on a subject, provide evidence to support a point or discovery, and examine the implications of the material discussed.

# The Process of Academic Writing

Although it might appear at first glance that asking students to write from other texts—a common writing assignment before research on the composing process gained prominence—is a throwback to traditional teaching methods, that is far from the case. The kinds of writing assignments described above take place within the context of a process-centered approach, with students employing appropriate inquiry strategies, planning, drafting, consulting, revising, and editing.

The students’ papers become teaching tools of the course. An assigned paper is not a test of their ability to follow prescribed rules of writing, but a chance to examine and organize, and then reexamine and reorganize, their thinking. Because more than one draft is read, it is not a matter of “better luck next time,” but “try again until you have communicated your ideas clearly.” Students can be trained to respond productively to each other’s work-inprogress; thus, they can learn how collaboration among scholars evolves. These experiences in collaborative learning help students become “socialized into the academic community” (Maimon, 1983, p. 122).

Student-teacher interaction is almost always necessary, at least initially, for learning to take place. Over time, students internalize various routines and procedures and “take greater responsibility for controlling the progress of an assigned task” (Applebee, 1986, p. 110). But first, teacher feedback on drafts guides students toward producing a more tightly organized, well-focused paper that fulfills the assignment. The final product of this effort shows them what effective writing should look like. Their own good work becomes a model for future academic papers, including essay examinations. The writing classroom is the place where students are given the time to learn how to write.

With each assignment, learning can be structured so that students are provided with useful strategies for fulfilling the task at hand. Assignments can be given in such a way that students understand from the beginning what the task requires and what its evaluative criteria will be (Herrington, 1981). Students can be helped to “ ‘deconstruct’ the assignment prompt” (Johns, 1986, p. 247). After they have done some informal writing, including invention techniques (Spack, 1984), they can be given a variety of suggestions on how to organize an academic paper that makes reference to another author’s work. For example, they can be told what might go in the beginning (a summary of the author’s article and an identification of the particular issue the student will respond to), middle (ideas and examples presented in logical order, never wandering from the central issue and frequently referring back to the reading), and ending (discussion of the implications of what has just been written).

The constraints of the form are meant to benefit, not hamper, the students’ writing. Knowledge of what usually comes at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of such discourse can give students another writing strategy or cognitive framework. However, rigid adherence to specific formulas is counterproductive. Students, especially those who were trained in a different culture and who are now enriched by a second culture, can create texts that may not follow explicit guidelines but that are still effective.

Indeed, Lu’s (1987) discussion of her experience in writing is an example of this phenomenon. Caught between the rigid, imitative forms required at school in China and the inner-directed approach of the at-home English instruction given by her Westernized parents, she wrote a book report that was not acceptable to either her school instructors (because she sentimentally focused on the internal conflict of a character) or her at-home instructors (because she praised a “Revolutionary” book). Yet the essay was a highly original text.

As Coe (1987) points out, an understanding of the purpose of form—to enable writers to communicate accurately and effectively to readers—can “empower students to understand, use, and even invent new forms for new purposes” (p. 26). So, respect for form is encouraged—and necessary if students are to succeed in certain other courses—but flexibility is built into the course to encourage students to respect the composing process as well.

# CONCLUSION

It is ironic that the pressure on ESL/English teachers to teach the writing of other disciplines is manifesting itself at precisely the time when influential technological institutes such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are funding programs to increase student exposure to the humanities in an effort to produce more wellrounded, open-minded students. The English composition course is and should be a humanities course: a place where students are provided the enrichment of reading and writing that provoke thought and foster their intellectual and ethical development.

This approach includes exploratory writing tasks that deal with making sense of thoughts and experiences. As Rose (1983) reminds us, “making meaning for the self, ordering experience, establishing one’s own relation to it is what informs any serious writing” (p. 118). It also includes expository writing tasks that direct students to take an evaluative and analytical stance toward what they read. Each of these processes “makes a crucial contribution to the whole of intellectual activity” (Zeiger, 1985, p. 457).

Students will mature as writers as they receive invaluable input from numerous classroom experiences and from teachers who are conversant in other disciplines. To initiate students into the academic discourse community, we do not have to change our orientation completely, assign tasks we ourselves cannot master, or limit our assignments to prescribed, rule-governed tasks. We can instead draw on our own knowledge and abilities as we strengthen and expand the knowledge and abilities of our students.

# The Present Progressive in Discourse: Grammar Versus Usage Revisited

SUSAN KESNER BLAND Cornell University

Certain uses of the present progressive in informal spoken English discourse remain difficult for even the most advanced ESL learners. This article focuses on the increasing frequency of the socalled stative verbs found in the progressive aspect. It is proposed that the use of stative verbs in the progressive is not necessarily exceptional or contrary to standard accounts of the English present progressive; rather, it is a predictable consequence of the meaning of the present progressive and the particular discourse contexts in which progressive statives are found. A consideration of the progressive from a discourse perspective provides a principled account of the discrepancy between grammar book and usage and offers a number of implications for ESL pedagogy.

The English present progressive offers an interesting challenge to ESL teachers and students. Although preliminary knowledge of the progressive is acquired early (see Krashen, 1981, and the studies cited therein), the progressive often remains a problem for even the most advanced ESL learner. This article presents a simple generalization about the meaning of the English progressive, which is intended to provide a principled explanation of its usage in discourse. It is argued that the progressive must be considered from a discourse perspective to be better understood.

The generalization about the progressive is stated as follows: The progressive focuses on a change (or changes) of state. The two key notions, which will be developed in detail, are focus and change. This generalization accounts not only for standard uses of the progressive, but also for occurrences of progressive statives like that in Example 1.1

1. Dan is resembling his father more and more every day.

The goal of this article is to explain how such sentences exemplify the contribution of progressive meaning in English. This research strategy is based on the premise, described in Smith (1983), that by looking at some of the more innovative uses of the progressive, we can gain insight into how the progressive is perceived and used in discourse.

A natural question at this point concerns the place of such sentences in an ESL curriculum. Let us defer this issue for the moment, for once we look at all of the data, it will become apparent that at least some of the progressive statives are quite common. But regardless of whether these sentences should be taught to students, the important point is that such sentences are a tool for teachers to gain insight into the progressive.

The first part of this article provides a brief overview of treatments of the progressive in ESL texts and in the recent literature in linguistics and applied linguistics. This is followed by an analysis of the progressive that attempts to synthesize relevant features of the literature in linguistics and applied linguistics. In support of this analysis, certain innovative progressive sentences, namely, progressive statives, are discussed. ESL data that reflect some of the proposals made here are then briefly examined.

# PREVIOUS TREATMENTS OF THE PROGRESSIVE

An examination of ESL texts and the recent literature in linguistics (both theoretical and applied) reveals fundamental differences in the approaches taken.

# ESL Texts

ESL texts tend to concentrate on the straightforward “action in progress” meaning of the progressive, contrasting it to the simple present. For example, intermediate and advanced ESL texts such as Azar (1981, 1985), Dart (1978), Praninskas (1975), Frank (1972), and Davis (1977) typically provide sentences such as those in Examples 2 and 3, which portray the action in progress at the moment of speaking or at a particular time, not necessarily the present moment.

2. I’m speaking now.   
3. He’s writing a book this year.

The contrast between the notion of progressive events and nonprogressive states is usually only briefly mentioned. Typically, a list of statives (often called nonaction verbs) is given. Table 1 is similar to the list of statives found in Azar (1981) and other ESL texts. Generally, ESL texts state that these verbs and others like them (the list, of course, is far from complete) resist the progressive. However, the inadequacy of such an approach becomes apparent when one considers the varying tendencies among stative verbs to occur in the progressive and the fact that some verbs are clearly more stative than others. (See Sag, 1973, for further details on this point about statives, and Bland, 1988, for a discussion of a hierarchy of the “progressivizability” of various stative verbs according to their contexts.)

TABLE 1 Nonaction Verbs   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Senses</td><td>smell, see, hear, taste.</td></tr><tr><td>Mental perception</td><td>know, believe, think, understand, remember, forget, recognize, mean.</td></tr><tr><td>Possession</td><td>possess, have, own, belong.</td></tr><tr><td>Attitudes and emotions</td><td>like, love, hate, dislike, want, desire, need, prefer, appreciate, appear, seem, look</td></tr><tr><td>Relation</td><td>equal, resemble, weigh, cost.</td></tr></table></body></html>

A few ESL texts do list progressive statives as exceptions to a progressive rule. Dart (1978) provides the following examples:

4a. You’re being foolish. b. This operation is costing a lot. c. I am loving these moments with you. (p. 77)

For the most part, however, such sentences are not included in ESL texts.

Finally, ESL texts typically do not pay explicit attention to the different effect that the progressive has on different types of verbs, a point that is taken up shortly.

# Linguistic and Applied Linguistic Accounts of the Progressive

Linguistic accounts of the progressive provide interesting discussions of the notion of events versus states (see Comrie, 1976; Leech, 1971; Sag, 1973; Smith, 1983) and of aspect as a discourse notion (see especially Smith, 1983). The literature in linguistics also tends to focus on the different effects of the progressive on different types of event verbs (see Leech, 1971; Vlach, 1981). Goldsmith and Woisetschlager (1982) present a revealing analysis of the simple present versus the present progressive.

In the recent literature in applied linguistics, Richards (1981) and Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1983) also provide interesting discussions of the event/state contrast and the effect of the progressive on different types of verbs. These accounts tend to focus on the notion of “incompleteness” and its manifestations as the semantic contribution of the progressive. The analysis presented here, though compatible with those by Richards and by Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman in several respects, especially with regard to the semantics of aspect from a discourse perspective, emphasizes instead the notion of change.

# AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRESSIVE

The following analysis, which synthesizes discussions in the recent literature in linguistics and applied linguistics, presents a more complete picture of the progressive than that usually given in ESL texts. (A more detailed review of both recent and traditional treatments of the progressive can be found in Bland, 1985.) The analysis includes a discussion of events and states.

# Events

The notion of event is important because virtually all verbs referring to events can be put into the progressive. Basically, an event is an occurrence of some kind, a situation in which something happens, that is, some sort of change takes place. Although event has been chosen here as a technical term that contrasts with state, the terms occurrence or dynamic situation might be considered more descriptive. This is because certain preconceived notions about the word event in English sometimes make it difficult for us to conceive of certain situations as events. For example, the following situations are not typically thought of as events, though theoretically they are:

5a. She’s blinking her eyes.   
b. He’s coughing his head off.

The importance of events in this discussion of the progressive is that they involve change and that therefore they have what Comrie (1976) calls “internal temporal structure” (p. 24). They have beginnings and endings and something, no matter how brief, going on in between.

Figure la below is meant to depict an event. The vertical lines represent the temporal boundaries, and the wavy lines represent the changes going on during the event. Following Comrie (1976), we can say that the progressive makes explicit reference to the internal structure of dynamic situations. That is, the reason for using the progressive is typically to refer to the changes in between the boundaries in Figure la.

![](img/ac7a725d06915af7794331ba1425cf5355155582b014ed8a7098e0484b892b32.jpg)  
FIGURE 1 Representations of Events and States

Dynamic situations can be analyzed into distinct phases due to the fact that they involve change. Thus, the generalization proposed earlier is really a simplification of the following characterization of the progressive based on Comrie (1976): The progressive focuses on the unfolding of the event, which is made up of distinct individual phases.

Depending on the type of verb put into the progressive, different types of change or distinct phases are focused upon. In Example 6 below, the focus is on the iterative motion of these progressive activities. Figure lb depicts the iterative motion of the events running on the beach and nodding his head.

6a. Jan is running on the beach.   
b. Joe is nodding his head.

With the verbs in Example 7, the progressive focuses on progress toward an end. Figure lC illustrates the distinct progressive stages involved in these events.

7a. Tom is painting a picture.   
b. The ship is arriving.

Comrie (1976) proposes that this dynamic view of the progressive may account for the meaning of “temporariness” also conveyed by the progressive. For example, a dynamic view of Example 8a below is that it focuses on the situation as a phase or a stage, suggesting change from the more permanent circumstance in Example 8b.

8a. I’m living in New York.   
b. I live in New York.

Similarly, Example 9 presents the situation as a phase, not as a permanent situation or as a characteristic of the speaker.

9. I’m wearing a jacket.

Notice, however, that internal change does not appropriately characterize the situations in Examples 8a and 9. That is, neither Figures la, lb, nor lC would appropriately depict them. Nevertheless, the notions of boundaries and change are implicit. According to Smith (1983), the progressive sets up the expectation for change, and in this sense it conveys the notion of temporariness.

The last important point about the internal structure of events is that it gives us insight into why certain event verbs either resist the progressive or occur infrequently in the progressive. These are basically event verbs that entail instantaneous change, such as the verb phrases in Example 10.

10. recognize the woman realize his mistake discover the truth

The difficulty in putting these verb phrases into the progressive appears to be due to the difficulty in “stretching out” or “looking inside of” what is really an instantaneous occurrence. If they are put into the progressive, as in Example 11 below, they tend to mean “inception of the event,” for example, Joe is beginning to recognize the woman. By signaling inception, they show change.

recognizing the woman. 11. Joe is realizing his mistake. discovering the truth.

Certain other verbs that entail instantaneous change can be put into the progressive with the following results. In Example 12, the progressive focuses on a process which, if continued in the same characteristic way, will lead to the respective end points die and win. (Vlach, 1981, presents an in-depth analysis of these verbs in the progressive.)

12a. Tom is dying. b. Mark is winning.

The progressive in Example 13 focuses on the preparatory procedures leading to the end point, that is, the moments just preceding the end point. Example 13a, therefore, might focus on the entry of the ship into the harbor, and Example 13b might focus on the reduction in altitude and the lowering of the landing gear.

13a. The ship is arriving. b. The plane is landing.

# States

In contrast to the picture of events that has been described, states can be depicted as a straight line, which represents the fact that all parts of a state are the same, that is, the first moment of a state is the same as any other. According to Smith (1983), “states are homogeneous, stable situations that lack internal structure” (p. 490). States lack shift or variation; they are without activity and successive stages. In other words, states consist of “undifferentiated moments” (p. 490). Neither beginnings nor endings are integral to states, even though we may speak of such boundaries (e.g., I knew the answer; I don’t know it any more). Once a change takes place, a new state is said to come into existence. In contrast, a number of changes typically make up the same event (see Figures la, lb, and lc).

This discussion of states suggests why stative verbs typically resist the progressive. Since there is no relevant internal structure to states (i.e., no stages progressing toward an end that can be focused upon), there would seem to be no need for progressive statives. Why, then, do they occur in discourse? The remainder of this article deals with this question.

# PROGRESSIVE STATIVES

The main reason that statives can combine with the progressive is due to the aspectual nature of the progressive. The progressive presents a situation from a certain perspective. This is where the notion of focus comes in. Let us consider aspect as a spotlight on a stage, which focuses on different parts of the temporal contour of a situation (R. Hendricks, personal communication, November 4, 1980). As we have seen in Example 8, the same situation (i.e., the same objective reality) can be viewed from two different perspectives.

What really happens in the case of progressive statives is that speakers endow certain states with features of event verbs. By choosing the progressive as opposed to the more usual simple present form, the speaker can convey slight differences in the meaning and function of stative verbs. The progressive makes the stative verbs act as if they were nonstates by imposing some sort of dynamics (i.e., change) on the stative situations. This notion of change is conveyed by progressive statives in several different ways. For ease of discussion, therefore, I have divided the progressive statives into several groups. (Although there may be some overlap in these divisions, this should not detract from the main objectives of this discussion. )

Let us consider the first group:

14a. I’m hating this weather. (attested) b. I’m actually liking this play. (Smith, 1983, p. 497) c. I’m loving these moments with you. (Dart, 1978, p. 77) d. The whole family is wanting to go to the Bahamas for Easter. (King, 1983, p. 131) really e. I'm loving it. (attested) just f. I'm enjoying my freedom. (attested) g. I am missing you dreadfully. (Smith, 1983, p. 498)

The sentences above represent the most common type of progressive statives. They are frequent in conversation, and they do appear in some ESL texts as exceptions to the progressive (e. g., Example 14c). These examples are mainly verbs of emotion, desire, and attitude. The states to which they refer are presented as events in the sense that their progressive forms convey the dynamism of actions or processes. Most important, they convey change by suggesting that something is going on.

Why are they used? First of all, the immediate quality of the progressive gives more strength to the predication. These sentences are therefore more intense, emotional, and vivid than their simple present counterparts. (Most standard grammar book accounts of the progressive make some reference to the emotional or vivid overtones of the progressive; see, for example, Curme, 1931; Jespersen, 1931; Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985; Zandvoort, 1962.) Thus, with emotions like love, hate, and so on, the progressive expresses the strength and force of these states. Such progressive statives are often found with various kinds of modifiers to further emphasize the immediacy and intensity of the situation (see Examples 14e and $1 4 \mathrm { g } )$ , and many of these sentences are also likely to have emphatic intonation. Finally, it should be added that as expressions of emotion, desire, and attitude, it is probably no coincidence that almost all of the sentences in Example 14 are in the first person. The first person is, after all, most conducive to expressing feelings.

The effect of vividness, however, is not necessarily limited to this class of verbs, as Example 15 demonstrates.

15. A photograph of Grandma and Grandpa is sitting on the mantelpiece, as it has been for 30 years. (Goldsmith & Woisetschlager, 1982, p. 85)

We could say that in this sentence the progressive has the effect of “putting us in the room with the picture.” This use of the progressive with all types of verbs is often found as a literary device that “sets the stage” at the beginning of a story.

The sentences in Example 16 represent additional instances of emphasis or intensity with other types of verbs.

16a. This operation is costing a lot. (Dart, 1978, p. 77) b. This operation is reaIly costing us a lot. c. Herbert is always hearing noises. (Celce-Murcia & LarsenFreeman, 1983, p. 72) d. Jane is constantly working on her book. (attested) e. [Speaker pricks herself with a needle while sewing.] Damn it! I’m always doing this. (attested)

The progressive stative in Example 16a conveys a more immediate quality in the sense that it is more personal than the simple present alternative This operation costs a lot. In fact, the feeling in Example 16a is probably more naturally expressed in the sentence in Example 16b, since the progressive appears to attach a more personal or emotional value or perspective to the sentence. Examples 16c, 16d, and 16e also demonstrate this attachment of an emotional value to progressive sentences. Notice that Example 16c is a stative verb but that Examples 16d and 16e are event verbs.

Examples 16c, 16d, and 16e show a common use of the progressive to convey a somewhat negative “emotional comment” (CelceMurcia & Larsen-Freeman, 1983) about an action that is often habitual. Such sentences, which express varying degrees of negativism, have also been called examples of colloquial hyperbole, irritation, and mild or amused disparagement or reproof (see, for example, Goldsmith & Woisetschlager, 1982; Leech, 1971). They are likely to be accompanied by certain marked intonation patterns. To sum up, let us say that the focus on behavior by the progressive may convey some sort of comment or opinion by the speaker about that behavior.

The sentences in Example 17 below illustrate more progressive statives. These sentences convey “temporariness” or “limited duration,” two meanings of the progressive discussed above.

I rude. (attested) 17a. You're being polite. (attested) ( foolish. (Dart, 1978, p. 77) b. Today my uncle is being Napoleon. (Leech, 1971, p. 25) c. The car is being difficult. (Leech, 1971, p. 25) d. Peter is believing in ghosts these days. (Smith, 1983, p. 493) e. The river is smelling particularly bad today. (Smith, 1983, p. 493) f. . . . it’s looking like rain. (King, 1983, p. 142) g. In general, she’s looking fine. (Cathcart-Strong, 1986, p. 2 of handout) h. They seem to be knowing it and then—poof—they don’t. (King, 1983, p. 142)

The sentences in Example 17 may be divided into two types, the first of which (Examples 17a-c) exhibits the following structural pattern: NP be $^ +$ ing ADJ. In the second type (Examples 17d-h), the expression of temporariness depends more strongly on an explicit or implicit time adverbial that limits the time duration. Let us turn first to Examples 17a-c.

The sentences in Example 17a are very common in conversation. The progressive conveys temporary behavior by focusing on the behavior as a change from the status quo. (Once again, note the importance of the notion of change.) This is similar to the explanation for Examples 8a and 9 discussed above. The sentences in Example 17a express an observation about the present, about present behavior. They do not characterize the behavior the way the simple present does. Compare, for example, the sentences You’re rude and You’re being rude. Only certain adjectives, however, are appropriate in this sentence pattern—adjectives that typically describe a situation that the subject can control (i.e., change) or at least pretend to control. Thus, the sentence in Example 18 is ungrammatical (indicated by an asterisk).

# 18. \*You’re being white as a ghost.

The verbs in Examples 17b and 17c can be paraphrased as “pretend” or “act”: He’s acting/pretending to be like Napoleon. Example 17c is particularly interesting because it also conveys personification of the car. The novelty of this sentence lies in its implicit reference to agency via the progressive: A verb in the progressive typically refers to an event, and an event typically has an animate subject that controls or causes the change.

The second type of progressive statives expressing temporariness are those in Examples 17d-h. The importance of the explicit or implied time adverbial is due to the fact that states do not include change. Therefore, an explicit time adverbial in Examples 17d and 17e satisfies a condition for the use of the progressive by introducing the limited duration that implies change. Notice that in some cases, such as Example 17d, the lack of a time adverbial would make the sentence less grammatical. Thus, the sentence Peter is believing in ghosts is less acceptable without the adverb. In other cases, such as Examples 17f and $\mathbf { \widetilde { 1 7 g } }$ , the use of the progressive itself conveys a focus on the present moment. Example 17h may be said to express limited time duration by virtue of its meaning, with seem and the progressive supporting this conveyed notion of temporariness.

The third group of progressive statives is probably the most interesting because it provides more examples of stative verbs like know and resemble, which are generally much more resistant to the progressive than the other stative verbs discussed. Because of these differences among stative verbs, it is an overgeneralization to tell ESL students that stative verbs do not occur in the progressive. Ideally, a listing of stative verbs should be expressed in terms of more and less stative.

Let us now consider the data:

19a. John is knowing the answer more and more often this semester. (Smith, 1983, p. 498) b. Young kids are knowing more and more about sex and violence these days. (attested) c. The baby’s resembling his father more and more every day. (Sag, 1973, p. 88) d. These examples are gradually seeming less and less unacceptable to me. (Smith, 1983, p. 498) e. I’m understanding more and more about quantum mechanics as each day goes by. (Comrie, 1976, p. 36) f. . . . it’s looking worse and worse. (King, 1983, p. 142) g. John is resembling his great-uncle these days. (Smith, 1983, p. 483)

Smith (1983) describes the so-called states in these examples as being viewed dynamically on a continuum of intensity or frequency. They involve change over time and act somewhat like events in these sentences. The progressive introduces change in these states by focusing on the differences in degree among classes of related states. This is illustrated in Example 20 and schematically in Figure ld.

20. [The baby resembles his father]1, [The baby resembles his father (more)] 2, [The baby resembles his father (even more)]3 . . .

Figure ld suggests that the progressive acts as a quantifier over the state, in the sense that it creates a number of related states ([ ] 1 , [ ]2, etc.) showing degrees of change (S. McConnell-Ginet, personal communication, April 12, 1985). Note that this does not imply that we think of states as dynamic events with a lot going on inside them, as seen in Figure la.2 Rather, it suggests that we think of groups of related states. The differences between the groups of related states shown in Example 20 and in Figure ld, for example, imply change over time; in this sense, they can be viewed as a succession of stages. The adverbial phrases more and more, less and less, and worse and worse are obviously quite important in imposing the progressive meaning just described. Example $1 9 \mathrm { g }$ , however, differs from the others, since it does not have one of these adverbial phrases. Instead, it has the time adverbial these days, which suggests change from before. The change is conveyed by a possible inceptive interpretation: John is beginning to resemble his great uncle.

Let us now turn to the final group of examples:

21a. Are you liking it here? (attested) b. Is she liking her new car? (King, 1983, p. 142) c. I’m hoping you’ll give us some advice. (Leech, 1971, p. 24) d. We’re wondering if you have any suggestions. (Leech, 1971, p. 24) e. I’m guessing that you’re French. (King, 1983, p. 142) f. She is thinking that she wants to go home. (Smith, 1983, p. 493) g. No, I’m thinking that I’d like a bit of a higher heel anyway. (attested) h. I am remembering now. (Smith, 1983, p. 498) i. I’m not doubting your word, but . . . (Smith, 1983, p. 493)

of the progressive question allowed for more hedging or a more descriptive and anecdotal answer. In other words, it “took the respondent off the hook” by requiring less of a value judgment on her part.

The use of the progressive for politeness is probably more typical in British English and more frequent in some idiolects and dialects than others. Why does the progressive convey politeness? Let us say that the progressive is the “weaker,” more indirect form in certain situations because it does not assert (or question) general truths; it merely comments about more immediate behavior or situations. It is therefore less formal or binding and more temporary or contingent in its description. In this sense it is weak and noncharacterizing as compared with the simple present (see Goldsmith & Woisetschlager, 1982).

This discussion of the progressive for politeness appears to present a contradiction: In Example 14 the progressive was said to have a strengthening effect, whereas in Examples 21a-e it has a weakening effect on many of the same verbs. Notice, however, that the sentences in Example 14 and Examples 21a-e serve different functions in discourse: The former represent statements, whereas the latter represent questions or sentences that function as questions. The conclusion that we can draw here is that not only does the progressive have different effects on different types of verbs, but it also has different effects on different speech acts.

Examples 21 f-i also show evidence of the weakening effect of the progressive. Unlike the sentences in Examples 21a-e, however, these sentences do not function as questions. They represent statements in which verbs of mental activity and attitude take on an inceptive quality, for example, I’m starting to think . . ., I’m starting to remember . . . The progressive appears to weaken what could otherwise be a more definitive expression of opinion or attitude. The sentence in Example 21g, for instance, served as a polite response to a somewhat aggressive shoe salesman. Here the use of the progressive allowed the speaker to hedge, since she had not really made up her mind yet about buying the shoes.

# ESL ERRORS

Let us now turn to some conversational errors that are related to the progressive analysis presented in this article. Examples 22 and 23 are from a German speaker, Example 24 is from a French speaker, and Example 25 is from a Hebrew speaker.

22. A: Do you know Sapsucker Woods? B: \*Yes, my wife is often going there with the children. (attested) 23. $^ { * } \mathrm { H e }$ is a character who is scaring everyone. (attested)

24. \*Look! She doesn’t wear a sweater $[ =$ she’s not wearing a sweater]. (attested)

25. \*He’s a man who is known for being innovative and imaginative in the terrorism they are doing $[ =$ acts of terrorism they commit]. (attested)

Examples 22, 23, and 25 are instances of overuse of the progressive. This appears to be the main problem with advanced speakers. The reasons for such overuse of the progressive need to be investigated further. It appears, however, that such errors may indeed derive from inadequate knowledge of the meaning and functional range of both the progressive and the simple present. Example 22 represents a problem with adverbs. It is quite possible that this sentence was produced by analogy to a sentence like She’s always going there, which is a grammatical sentence with a possible negative connotation like Examples 16c-e. Thus, in addition to the incorrect combination of adverb and present progressive, the possible negative connotation or emotional comment conveyed by this type of sentence is not supported by the context.

The grammatical use of always with the progressive brings up a related point concerning the use of adverbs with progressive sentences, namely, that adverbs are not always optional. Consider the following:

26. Why doesn’t Ed have any money? a. He’s buying designer clothes (these days). b. He’s (always) buying designer clothes.

Examples 26a and 26b are much less acceptable without the adverbs in parentheses. The fine line between acceptability and unacceptability may confuse students unless they understand the role of adverbs in progressive sentences and unless they are required to use them. As another illustration of this point, consider the fact that Example 23 would have been considerably better with always: He is a character who is always scaring everyone.

It is also interesting that Example 23 becomes more acceptable when it is not an introductory sentence with the indefinite article a, but rather a sentence whose subject has already been referred to in discourse, as the definite article the suggests in He is the character who is scaring everyone. This provides more evidence for the use of the simple present for characterizing in general versus the use of the present progressive for describing something more immediate or specific. Examples 24 and 25 represent similar problems with the notion of characterizing something, in contrast to merely commenting on a particular situation or a particular behavior.

# CONCLUSION

The innovative uses of the progressive discussed in this article are important to ESL teachers, curriculum developers, and materials writers for several reasons: (a) They tell us a great deal about speakers’ perceptions of the meaning, range, and scope of the progressive; (b) they complement a communicative approach to ESL by focusing on the function of the progressive in discourse, for example, its use in complaining, requesting, questioning, hedging, and so on—uses that are not currently stressed in ESL texts; and (c) they force us to reassess constantly the relationship between the grammar book and the language students are apt to encounter.

This discussion of the innovative uses of the progressive also suggests a number of directions for further research. For example, it would be useful for ESL teachers, materials writers, and curriculum developers to have access to empirical data on the actual frequency of these innovative uses of the progressive in natural spoken discourse as compared with uses of the simple present and the more standard uses of the progressive. Furthermore, as suggested earlier, studies of the acquisition of the English progressive by nonnative speakers of various L1 backgrounds could empirically test various aspects of the analysis presented here, as well as provide insight into the apparent overuse of the progressive by ESL learners.

In conclusion, the points raised in this study clearly illustrate a comment made by Leech (1971) about the progressive in colloquial English: “This is an area of usage which is unstable at the present time, and is probably undergoing continuing change” (p. 26).

# Professors’ Reactions to the Academic Writing of Nonnative-Speaking Students

TERRY SANTOS California State University, Los Angeles

The study reported in this article investigated the reactions of 178 professors to two 400-word compositions, one written by a Chinese student and the other by a Korean student. The professors, 96 of whom were in the humanities/social sciences and 82 of whom were in the physical sciences, were each asked to rate one of the two compositions on six 10-point scales, three of which focused on content (holistic impression, development, and sophistication) and three of which focused on language (comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation). The results were as follows: (a) Content received lower ratings than language; (b) professors found the errors highly comprehensible, generally unirritating, but academically unacceptable, with lexical errors rated as the most serious;(c) professors in the humanities/social sciences were more lenient in their judgments than professors in the physical sciences; (d) older professors were less irritated by errors than younger professors, and nonnative-speaking professors were more severe in their judgments than native speakers. The results suggest the need for greater emphasis on vocabulary improvement and lexical selection.

Within the past several years, a previously unexamined aspect of error evaluation has begun to generate interest—that of professors’ judgments of, and subjective reactions to, errors in the writing of nonnative-speaking (NNS) students. As this segment of the student population in the United States has grown, the demands on ESL writing programs and instructors have also increased. Consequently, there is a need to establish firmer instructional priorities in the teaching of composition. One way to do this is to investigate the reactions of the audience to whom the writing of NNS students is directed: their professors (Santos, 1984; Secord, 1978; Sheorey & Ward, 1984; Vann & Meyer, 1984; Vann, Meyer, & Lorenz, 1984).

The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate professors’ reactions to the academic writing of NNS students. The following questions were posed: (a) What is the difference between professors’ ratings of the content of an essay written by a NNS student and their ratings of the language? (b) What is the rank ordering of comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation for errors in the writing of those students, as judged by professors in the physical sciences and the humanities/social sciences? (c) Do professors in the physical sciences and the humanities/social sciences exhibit similar patterns in their judgments? (d) What factors are significant in professors’ ratings? For example, are the judgments of professors who are themselves NNSs similar to those who are native speakers (NSS)?

Error evaluation has been broadly defined as NSs’ reactions to NNSs’ errors. Various types of reactions are encompassed under this umbrella notion. Comprehensibility is the degree to which the interlocutor understands what is said or written. Comprehensibility has been tested both through objective and subjective measures, for example, repetition, restatement, and Likert-scale rankings (Bansal, 1969; Dimitrijevic & Djordjevic, 1971; Guntermann, 1978; Olsson, 1973).

Irritation has been defined as “the result of the form of the message intruding upon the interlocutor’s perception of the communication. . . . The irritation continuum ranges from unconcerned, undistracted awareness of a communicative error to a conscious preoccupation with form” (Ludwig, 1982, p. 275). Some researchers (Johansson, 1978; Ludwig, 1982) consider comprehensibility and irritation inextricably linked, equating lower comprehensibility with higher irritation, and vice versa, whereas others (Santos, 1984; Vann & Meyer, 1984; Vann et al., 1984) separate the two, regarding irritation more as a function of the expectations and characteristics of interlocutors, who may become irritated by errors even when the message is comprehensible to them.

Acceptability is the degree to which the interlocutor regards the speech or writing of the NNS as approximating the target language norms. Acceptability thus appeals to judgments about language, whereas irritation appeals to subjective reactions (the “bother factor”), which, however, may also include notions of acceptability.

# METHODOLOGY

This study employed a split-plot design (Pedhazur, 1982, p. 562) to answer the research questions. Two compositions written by

NNS students (one a speaker of Chinese, the other of Korean) were selected for evaluation; two sets of ratings were elicited (one for overall content and language, the other for individual errors); and two types of professors were consulted (those in the physical sciences and those in the humanities/social sciences). In addition, all of the professors were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to determine which independent variables (sex, age, native language, etc.) might be significant in their ratings.

# Subjects

A total of 178 professors at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), participated in the study. They were selected on the basis of their availability at the time of data collection and their willingness to participate in the study. They ranged in age from 27 to 77, with a median age of 45.6 years. Of the 178, 156 were males, 22 females; 144 were NSs of English, 34 were not; 96 represented departments in the humanities/social sciences, and 82 represented schools/departments in the physical sciences.

The participants were divided into four groups on the basis of availability and representation in either the humanities/social sciences or the physical sciences. Every effort was made to maintain a balance in each group between the disciplines. Group 1 consisted of 10 professors who read, rated, and corrected the composition written by the Chinese student. Group 2 consisted of 10 professors who performed the same tasks on the composition written by the Korean student. The 80 professors in Group 3 read and rated a partially corrected version of the Chinese student’s composition, and the 78 professors in Group 4 performed the same tasks on the Korean student’s composition.

# Materials

Subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire that requested the following information: department; sex; age; native language; proficiency in speaking other languages; the approximate percentage of NNS students in the professor’s classes; whether these students tended to be undergraduates or graduates; whether the professor had a policy in dealing with the writing of NNS students; and which of the following statements most closely corresponded to the way the professor generally dealt with the writing of NNS students: (a) does not correct errors and does not downgrade them, (b) does not correct and does downgrade them, (c) corrects but does not downgrade, (d) corrects and downgrades.

The two compositions were selected from among more than 100 written by NNSs referred to the ESL section of the English Department at UCLA. To fulfill their composition requirement, such students must successfully complete either English 36, Intermediate Composition for ESL Students, or English 106J, Advanced Composition for ESL Students. Students are placed in either English 36 or 106J on the basis of a 350- to 500-word composition they write on a set topic in a 75-minute period. The compositions are read and rated by two ESL writing instructors and, in cases in which there is a difference of opinion, by a tiebreaking third reader. (Instructions to the students and the composition topic are given in Appendix A.)

The selection of the two compositions to be used in the study was made on the basis of a number of criteria. First, since the vast majority of ESL students fulfill the composition requirement by passing English 36 (Intermediate Composition), representative compositions at that level were chosen. Second, essays were sought that contained a variety of representative errors, both local and global, made by ESL students. A composite of the findings of Tomiyama (1980), Vann and Meyer (1984), and Sheorey and Ward (1984), who consulted the literature of error analysis and conducted surveys of ESL instructors to determine which types of errors are most common among ESL students, was used to compile the following list (no ranking implied), which served as a reference guide: articles, lexical choice, logical connectors (e.g., relative pronouns, conjunctions), possessives, prepositions, singular/plural, subject-verb agreement, tense, and word form.

A third consideration was that the compositions represent two linguistic and cultural backgrounds found in large number at UCLA. Finally, it was thought that for greater generalizability the essays should be equal in length and employ the standard fiveparagraph system of organization and development, namely, introduction, body (three paragraphs), and conclusion. Indeed, the instructions to the students regarding the composition topic clearly, though implicitly, suggest such a structure (see Appendix A).

Given the criteria for selection, the two compositions (see Appendixes B and C) that were chosen were not radically different from one another, although at the same time they did exhibit certain idiosyncratic characteristics. Both conformed to the five-paragraph structure and contained almost the same number of words (392 for the Chinese student, 388 for the Korean). The Chinese student’s composition consisted of 19 sentences (including one fragment), 26 T-units (a single independent clause together with all of its modifying subordinate clauses), and 12 instances of embedding. The Korean student’s composition consisted of 23 sentences, 27 Tunits, and 13 instances of embedding.

Table 1 shows how the errors in the compositions were classified. Following Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman (1983), all grammatical errors were classified as being the result of omission, a wrong form, or a superfluous word or form. The general category of verbs was further divided into the subcategories of agreement, auxiliary, and so on.

It should be noted that at times the classifying of errors becomes a matter of individual interpretation and judgment. For example, how to classify the inappropriateness of the concluding sentence of the Chinese student’s composition (I should say example of first two points I mentioned is commonly found) is problematic. The primary problem here is not at the grammatical level but rather at the discourse level. Therefore, the entire sentence was classified under the error category of discourse cohesion, and the individual grammatical errors were also counted and classified, for example, articles and singular/plural. Furthermore, in cases when it was difficult to determine which of two error categories was involved, the error was entered twice. For example, the United State might have been a spelling error or an error with singular/plural. Since there was no way to be certain, it was classified under both categories.

# Procedures

The study consisted of two phases. In the first phase, 20 professors (10 for each composition) were presented with a typed copy of one of the two compositions in its original, uncorrected form and were asked to read and rate it on six 10-point scales. Three of the scales were for content (holistic impression, development, and sophistication) and three for language (comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation). The professors were then instructed to go back over the composition and correct everything that seemed incorrect to them. Finally, they were asked to list at the end the problems they regarded as the most serious in the composition. No time limit was set for the completion of these tasks.

The purpose of this first phase was to determine which of the many errors in the two compositions appeared most salient to the professors who read and corrected them. Of the studies of error gravity and error evaluation in composition, only McGirt’s (1984) started with natural, unaltered samples. The other studies used either textbook passages with inserted errors (Tomiyama, 1980; Vann & Meyer, 1984; Vann et al., 1984) or partially to extensively corrected, revised, and manipulated paragraphs or compositions written by NNSs (Johansson, 1978; Santos, 1984). Artificially prepared passages allow for maximum control of the variables by the researcher, but they also sacrifice the natural quality of unaltered connected discourse. Furthermore, they do not allow the NS judges to decide for themselves which errors are the most glaring. Finally, selectively inserted errors give equal weight to each error type by representing them only once each, an unrealistic condition that ignores the frequent recurrence of certain error types and the relatively infrequent occurrence of others. For these reasons, authentic, unaltered compositions were used in this first phase.

In Phase 2, the compositions were corrected for all but the most salient errors (see Appendixes D and E), as identified by the professors in Phase 1. The most salient errors were regarded as those that either all 10 professors or 9 of the 10 corrected. For the Chinese student’s composition, these numbered 17, and for the Korean student’s, 12. Table 2 presents a list of the error types represented in this phase.

Copies of the partially corrected compositions were typed, and the same 10-point scales for content and language given in Phase 1 were used in Phase 2. In addition, the sentences containing the most salient errors were typed separately and the errors underlined. Following each sentence were three 10-point scales for ratings of comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation.

All of the professors who participated in the study were seen personally by this researcher and were told that they should consider the composition they were being asked to read and rate as a piece of academic writing produced under the conditions described in the instructions to the students. They were also told how the terms comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation were meant to be interpreted.

The results reported in the following section are based on the responses of the 158 professors (Groups 3 and 4) who participated in Phase 2.

# RESULTS

# Ratings of Content Versus Language

The first research question asked whether there was a significant difference on a 10-point scale between professors’ ratings of the overall content and the language of an essay written by a NNS. The means and standard deviations of the ratings of content and language given by the 158 professors in Phase 2 were computed and Duncan’s Multiple Range Test run, using the general linear model of the SAS program. The results were the same for both compositions: The content was rated significantly lower than the language. In other words, the professors made a statistically significant distinction between the content of the composition they read and its language; they judged the content more severely than the language (see Tables 3 and 4).

# Order of Language Variables

The second research question asked about the order of comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation for the errors in the compositions. The means and standard deviations for the ratings of each error in the two compositions were computed and Duncan’s Test run to determine if there was a significant difference among the three language variables. The same statistically significant order was found in both compositions. Comprehensibility received the highest rating (7.5 for the Chinese student’s composition, 7.9 for the Korean student’s), irritation the second highest (5.8 for the Chinese student, 5.6 for the Korean), and acceptability the lowest (3.7 for the Chinese student, 3.9 for the Korean). That is, the professors found the sentences with errors highly comprehensible, reasonably unirritating, but linguistically unacceptable. This same order also obtained for the ratings of the overall language of the composition.

The individual errors were also rank ordered by means in four ways: for each language variable (comprehensibility, acceptability, irritation) and for overall means of the three (obtained by averaging the ratings of the three variables). Table 5 gives the rank order of errors in the Chinese student’s composition. The errors are presented in order of seriousness, from most serious to least, according to the overall means. The rank order of each error for each language variable is also indicated in parentheses below the mean ratings. The pattern that emerged shows that lexical errors in the composition were judged to be the most serious error type. Of the five most serious errors, four were lexical errors and one was the single article error. No other discernible pattern of order by error type was found. Of the seven verb errors, for example, two were rated toward the negative end of the scale, three toward the middle, and two toward the positive end.

Table 6 shows the rank order of errors in the Korean student’s composition. Again, the lexical errors were considered the most serious, followed by one of the three article errors. It is also interesting to note that the double negative error (They wouldn’t get nowhere unless they used a translator) ranked as the least acceptable and most irritating error, even though highly comprehensible (8.77 on the 10-point scale).

# Comparison of Ratings by Professorial Field

The third research question asked whether or not professors in the physical sciences and humanities/social sciences exhibited the same or similar patterns in their judgments of the compositions. This question was answered by means of several multiple regression analyses performed with the SAS program. The first analysis examined the overall ratings of content (holistic impression, development, sophistication) and language (comprehensibility, acceptability, irritation) by professors in the physical sciences and humanities/social sciences. The one significant difference among the six variables was language acceptability. Professors in the physical sciences rated the acceptability of the language of the compositions significantly lower than did those in the humanities/ social sciences.

The second and third analyses examined the ratings of the individual errors in the two compositions for significant differences between the two groups of professors. In the Chinese student’s composition, a clearly delineated pattern appeared. Of the 51 variables (17 sentences with errors and three 10-point scales for each), 12 showed a significant difference, all in the same direction: Professors in the physical sciences rated the 12 significantly lower than did those in the humanities/social sciences. Of the 12, 10 were for irritation and 2 for comprehensibility.

The results for the ratings of errors in the Korean student’s composition were less clear-cut. Of the 36 variables (12 sentences with errors and three 10-point scales for each), 11 showed a significant difference for the two groups of professors. Five variables, all for language acceptability, were rated lower by the humanities/social science professors, despite the fact that these were the same professors who had rated the overall language of the compositions significantly higher for acceptability than had the physical science professors. On the other hand, 6 variables, 5 for comprehensibility and 1 for irritation, were rated significantly lower by the physical science professors.

Based on these results, two generalizations might be made. First, only professors in the physical sciences were irritated by certain errors. Second, the humanities/social science professors exhibited a remarkable degree of tolerance in their ratings. Of the 93 variables (6 for overall content and language, 51 for the errors in the Chinese student’s composition, and 36 in the Korean student’s), they rated only 5 errors significantly lower—less acceptable—than did their colleagues in the physical sciences.

# Signiflcant Factors in Professors’ Ratings

The fourth research question asked what factors might account for the professors’ ratings. This question was answered by performing a stepwise multiple regression analysis; the ratings for overall content and language of the compositions were regressed on the items on the questionnaire that the professors completed. Two items proved to be significant: age and native language. The age of the professors was a significant factor in the ratings of one variable: the degree of irritation aroused by the language of the compositions. The older professors displayed a lower degree of irritation in their ratings than did the younger professors. For native language, the 32 NNS professors rated the acceptability of the language of the compositions significantly lower than did the 126 NS professors.

# DISCUSSION

In brief, this study yielded the following results: The language of the essays written by the two NNS students was rated higher than the content; the rank order of errors in the compositions, according to the professors’ ratings, was (from highest to lowest) comprehensibility, irritation, and acceptability; the error type considered most serious was the lexical error; humanities/social science professors tended to be more lenient in their judgments than did physical science professors; and two variables—age and native language— were significant in the professors’ ratings of some aspect of the language, but not of the content. The older professors rated the language less irritating than did the younger professors, and those who were themselves NNSs gave lower ratings to the acceptability of the language.

The findings for several of the research questions seem to lead to the conclusion that professors are willing to look beyond the deficiencies of language to the content in the writing of these NNS students. This conclusion would account for the fact that the content of the essays was rated significantly lower than the language. That the professors considered the errors in the essays linguistically unacceptable but nonetheless gave significantly higher ratings to the language than to the content also suggests they were both willing and able to make a distinction between the content and language of the writing of these NNS students. Put another way, it is a mark of their tolerance that although they regarded errors as linguistically unacceptable, the professors still judged content and language independently, to the extent that this was possible. However, this seems not to have been possible with the error type considered the most serious: the lexical error. It is precisely with this type of error that language impinges directly on content; when the wrong word is used, the meaning is very likely to be obscured.

It is also worth noting that although the physical science professors rated the overall language of the essays significantly lower than did the humanities/social science professors and were more irritated by certain errors, they did not rate the content of the essays lower than did the humanities/social science professors. This, too, seems to support the position that professors make a distinction between content and language, regardless of their attitude toward errors in the language.

The fact that these professors tried to separate their judgments of content and language may be a measure of their tolerance; however, another interpretation is also possible. Professors are realists and have come to accept, if not appreciate, the fact that the writing of NNS students—and, all too often, NS students—will contain numerous errors of language and that it would only be punitive, and probably futile, to downgrade heavily for them.

The fact that the double negative error (They wouldn’t get nowhere unless they used a translator) ranked as both the least acceptable and most irritating error in the Korean student’s composition, despite its being completely comprehensible, deserves special mention. lt seems clear that the reaction here is a social rather than a strictly linguistic one and is undoubtedly a transfer from attitudes toward less educated native speakers as well as attitudes ingrained after years of prescriptive education.

When considering the implications of the two factors that proved to be significant in the professors’ ratings of two of the three language variables, the one that seems less amenable to explanation is age. It seems counterintuitive that the older professors were less irritated by the language of the essays than were the younger professors. Yet a similar result was found by Vann and Meyer (1984) in their second study of professors’ ratings of errors in verb form, articles, and spelling. The older professors gave higher ratings to those errors than did the younger professors. One can only speculate why this might be so; for example, perhaps professors, as they become older, become more realistic in their expectations of students’ performance and thus more tolerant.

There seems to be a readily available explanation, however, for why the NNS professors rated the language of the essays as less acceptable than did the NS professors: NNS professors have attained an extremely high level of proficiency in English and, because of their investment of effort in the language, judge the errors of other NNSs more severely than do NS professors.

# PEDAGOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

Two findings in particular—that professors seem to make a distinction between content and language and that lexical errors are considered the most serious—have pedagogical implications. The first supports the current approach to teaching writing as a process of planning, composing, revising, and editing. NNS students need to improve their skills in the areas that most directly affect content, such as organizing, developing, and supporting their ideas and arguments, and these are the areas that are given the most attention by the process approach.

In addition, however, units on vocabulary building and lexical selection should be incorporated into an ESL writing course. Vocabulary has tended to be the neglected component in academic ESL courses, but the results of this study indicate that this area deserves closer attention. This could be done in several ways: through the use of vocabulary exercises, such as cloze and wordform exercises; through requiring students to keep a vocabulary notebook based on their readings and lectures; and through emphasis on the importance of lexical selection and the elicitation or presentation of synonymous forms of expression. Moreover, textbooks that deal with vocabulary for academic purposes would be valuable supplements to texts on academic writing.

This study has attempted to incorporate the major aspects of error evaluation in general—that is, the notions of comprehensibility, acceptability, and irritation, and ratings of errors at sentence and discourse level—while at the same time examining issues specific to the academic setting—that is, the content/language distinction and significant factors in professors’ ratings. Such research offers many benefits to both applied linguists and ESL instructors by adding to our understanding of the types of errors in writing that are considered the most serious by professors who read the writing of NNS students.

# APPENDIX A

# Instructions to the Students and Composition Topic

Write a 350-to 500-word composition on the topic below. You will have 75 minutes in which to plan and write the essay. You should pay particular attention to the content, organization, and grammar. Vocabulary and punctuation should also be taken into account.

# Composition Topic

There are things which are unique to each culture and which an “outsider” finds difficult to understand. This lack of understanding may lead to frustration, conflict, or a lack of appreciation of the values of the culture. Find three things about your culture which you believe most other people might not understand and which cause them to get a distorted impression. Write a unified essay in which you explain these aspects of your culture to outsiders, so that they will not misinterpret what they see and may avoid conflicts.

# APPENDIX B

# Composition Written by Chinese Student (Phase 1)

Generally Chinese culture is not well understood by Western people they think that Chinese’s standard of value and relation with people are relatively hard to understand and strange. There was a large number of

Chinese migrated to the coast area of America three decades ago. Today, in Los Angeles, Chinese form a small community in down town, called China Town. Althought, Chinese in the United State is increased; still most American do not understood Chinese well.

Personally I found the Chinese’s attitude towards others is not the same as most Western people. When Chinese finds that there are something wrong with their friend or they do not like the attitude of their friend, they would not mention or compliant about it unless it is disgusting. Sometimes, even if they really cannot take it, they would rather avoid that friend than make a compliant.

Besides the above point, there some other cultural practices that is hard to understand by outsiders. For example, when someone appreciate a person’s outlook belonging or thoughtfulness and tell the person what he feels, the person may reply “it is not good at all” or “No, not really, it is just fine”, if the person is Chinese. This may be rude to some people by dening other’s opinion; but this is Chinese’s way of being polite by denying their belongs is good or appreciable, and it does not mean to reject others.

Finally, Chinese is very closely related to the relative and surrounding people comparing to other races. For instance, once one of my American friend ask me why would not the main character in a Chinese story ran away from home when his family tring to force him to marry a girl he does not like or never meet. This is because in Chinese society elder is highly respected, and one must obey the elder. And if he runs away and marry the girl he loves, he may not accept by the society. He has lost his root, and root is something acient Chinese would change their life for.

Modern Chinese is not so strongly related to the others in respect to the acient Chinese. Especially those Chinese who did not born in China. However Chinese still have that the cultural background to a certain level. I should say example of first two points I mentioned is commonly found.

# APPENDIX C

# Composition Written by Korean Student (Phase 1)

There are three unique things in the Korean culture that a stranger from outer region or other country may not understand and may lead them to a frustration. These three things are the language, food, and the beliefs or religions which are unique to the Korean culture.

First of all, the Korean language have been originated more than 5,000 years. Language itself may represent the whole culture. Outsiders or foreigners who are visiting Korea may find him/her-self in frustration or in conflict because of language that they can’t understand. They wouldn’t get nowhere unless they call the translator. As they hear more and more of Korean language they may think Koreans are speaking in all same tone which is true. Soon after a stranger may find that the Korean culture is like the language itself. He/she will see that the same tone which flown in the language flow thru the culture.

The Korean foods are mostly made up of the vegetables, A foreigner or visitor may find a nothing but a hot and chilly taste of vegetables. It doesn’t mean that all of the Korean are vegetarians. It is a history which explains how come eating a meat become our least need. The Koreans use to believe the buddhism which was the national religion. In Buddhism killing or eating an animal was a crime. These thoughts handed down more than a 5,000 years. In these days many Koreans does not follow it anymore but still a forigner will not see any meat on the dining table except vegetables.

The third and last of all, religion or belief in Korea are various but are belief which most of the Koreans still believes is a pledge that they give to their ancestors. They (Koreans) pick one day from a year—and they prepare very carefully for that day. They believe that when they prepare all foods and drinks and pray, all of their ancestor who died will come eat and drink and enjoy. These belief may be strange and unpleasant to an outsiders but it is a very important to most Koreans.

These three kinds of culture, language, foods, and beliefs are the unique and very important to many Koreans. A stranger or an outsider would understand very easily if he/her tried to understand it from beginning.

Partially Corrected Version of Chinese Student’s Composition (Phase 2)

Generally, the Chinese culture is not well understood by Western people; they think that the Chinese’s standards, values, and relations with people are strange and relatively hard to understand. There was a large number of Chinese who immigrated to the West Coast of America three decades ago. Today in Los Angeles the Chinese form a small community in the downtown area called Chinatown. Although the Chinese population in the United States is increased, most Americans still do not understand the Chinese well.

Personally, I have found that the Chinese attitude towards others is not the same as that of most Western people. When a Chinese person finds that there are something wrong with his friend, or he does not like the attitude of his friend, he would not mention it or complain about it unless it was disgusting. Sometimes, if he really cannot take it, he would rather avoid that friend than complain.

Besides the above point, there are some other cultural practices that are hard for outsiders to understand. For example, when someone appreciate a Chinese person’s outlook belonging or thoughtfulness and tells the person how he feels, the person may reply, “It is not good at all,” or “No, not really, it is just fine.” This may seem rude to some people, but it is the Chinese way of being polite—by denying that their belongs are good or appreciable.

He has lost his root and root is something the Chinese would never change.

The modern Chinese are not as strongly bound to tradition in respect to the ancient Chinese. This is especially true of those who did not born in China. However, even these Chinese still have that the cultural background to a certain degree. I should say the examples of the first two points I mentioned are commonly found.

# APPENDIX E

Partially Corrected Version of Korean Student’s Composition (Phase 2)

There are three unique things in the Korean culture that a stranger from an outer region or another country may not understand and may lead him or her to a frustration. These three things are the language, the food, and the religious beliefs, which are all unique to the Korean culture.

First, the Korean language have been originated more than five thousand years. The language itself may represent the whole culture. Visitors to Korea may find themselves frustrated or confused because they can’t understand the language. They wouldn’t get nowhere unless they used a translator. As they hear more and more of the language, they may think all Koreans are speaking in the same tone, which is true. Soon, strangers may find that the Korean culture is like the language itself. They will see that the same tone which flown in the language also flows through the culture.

Second, Korean food is mostly made up of vegetables. Foreigners may find a nothing but a hot and chilly taste of vegetables. This does not mean that all Koreans are vegetarians. Our history explains why eating meat is unnecessary for us. Koreans used to believe in Buddhism, which was once the national religion. In Buddhism, killing or eating an animal was a crime. These thoughts handed down more than five thousand years. Today, many Koreans does not follow Buddhism anymore, but foreigners still will not see any meat on the table, only vegetables.

Third and last, religious beliefs in Korea are various, but are belief which most Koreans still believe in is a pledge that they give to their ancestors. The Koreans pick one day each year to honor their ancestors and prepare very carefully for that day. They believe that when they prepare food and drinks, and then pray, all of their ancestors will come to eat, drink, and enjoy themselves. This belief may sound strange to outsiders, but it is very important to most Koreans.

These three aspects of Korean culture—language, food, and religious beliefs—are the unique and very important to most Koreans. A stranger would not be frustrated or confused if he/her understood these things from the beginning.

This article represents a synthesis of concepts from contrastive phonology, speech processing, TESOL, and computer-assisted instruction for the purpose of improving the communication skills of international teaching assistants in U.S. colleges and universities. Although the focus is on speakers of Chinese, most of the concepts are equally applicable to speakers of other East Asian languages. Methods of interpreting and utilizing visual displays of speech patterns are presented throughout, with examples of both segmental and suprasegmental phonology.

Recent research in electrical engineering to produce voiceactivated machinery has resulted in the production of many efficient and low-cost machines for analyzing pronunciation. This article presents the results of 4 years of research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the application of such machines to language education. The research was prompted by the need to improve the communication skills of international teaching assistants.

In the face of the large and growing proportion of international students and the limitations on ESL programs, effective teaching of pronunciation is emerging as an important goal for the needs of these students as well as those of academic institutions. Because we still have no widely standardized entrance examination of pronunciation, many high-quality international students with reasonable vocabularies and grammar are admitted to universities, even though their pronunciation of English makes them difficult to understand.

Though the focus in this article is on the needs of Chinese students, most of the concepts are equally applicable to speakers of other East Asian languages, especially Japanese and Korean. Mandarin Chinese was chosen as the L1 because of its strong contrast to English and because of the large number of Chinese students in the United States.

Methods of interpreting and using visual displays of speech patterns in order to help international students overcome pronunciation problems are explained throughout this article. The examples and explanations included focus on the immediate needs of students who must quickly improve their communication skills in order to survive in a highly competitive environment. Though the equipment is also useful for precise analysis of differences among native speakers’ idiolects, that level of sophistication is beyond the scope of this article.

# THE ADVANTAGES OF COMPUTER DISPLAYS OF PRONUNCIATION

Traditional methods of communicating with students about pronunciation rely heavily on subjective evaluations or, even in the best of language labs, on student recognition of the differences between their pronunciation and that on the master tape. Many errors go unchanged. In these settings it is easy to imagine the following exchange reported to me by an ESL teacher working on the aspiration of initial $\bf { \bar { \rho } } / \bf { p } / $ .

Teacher: OK, I will hold a lit match in front of your mouth so that when you say the word pat, you will blow out the match.   
Student: Bat.   
Teacher: No. /ph/. pHat.   
Student: Bat.   
Teacher: Hurry up. You will burn my fingers.   
Student: Bat.   
Teacher: OK. This time I will appeal to your self-interest. You hold the match.   
Student: Bathhh. See it went out.

With a computer display of pronunciation comparing a native speaker’s model with attempts to match it, we can instantly show students objective information about the location, extent, type, and significance of the error, as well as the progress made in correcting the error.

In Figure 1, made on a Speech Spectrographic Display (SSD) 8800, which provides instant displays of speech signals, we can see why the teacher thought the student was saying bat. The distance between points 1 and 2 in Figure la is much greater than the distance between points 1 and 2 in Figure lb. This is because $/ \mathbf { p } / \mathbf { i n }$

![](img/50a924ca7807b92d0bcf4c103083d480a35fa013cb1793f8975acbdaf8db750c.jpg)

Figure la is aspirated. Aspiration comes between the initial explosion of the $/ \mathbf { p } /$ (la, point 1) and the beginning of the vowel sound (la, point 2). This is the feature the teacher in the story attempted to emphasize by having the student blow out the match.

In Figure lC there is also a short distance between the initial expIosion (of the $/ \mathbf { b } /$ , at point 2) and the following vowel (point 3). Americans seem to interpret the short distance between points 1 and 2 of Figure lb (unaspirated $/ { \bf { p } } / )$ as an attempt at the voiced stop /b/ rather than an attempt at an aspirated voiceless stop $/ \mathsf { p } /$ . This is why Indians saying pat, time, or coat are often perceived as saying bat, dime, and goat.

Figure 1 dispIays the spectral frequencies of the speech signals. The vertical axis is the frequency from O to ${ 5 , 0 0 0 } \ \mathrm { H z }$ . The horizontal axis is duration. The third dimension, amplitude, is indicated by the gray scale, which shows the strength of the signal. Note that the aspiration of $/ \mathsf { p } /$ in Figure la between points 1 and 2 is lighter than the bands indicating the following vowel. This means that the vowel has greater amplitude (or energy). The three dimensions of frequency, duration, and amplitude are sufficient for displaying all aspects of American English pronunciation, including both segmental and suprasegmental features.

Figure 2, made on a Visi-Pitch 6095, which also provides instant displays of speech signals, is a simpler display providing information only about the strength and pitch of the lowest frequency range $( 0 \cdot 4 0 0 ~ \mathrm { ~ H z } )$ of the signal. The lower bar corresponds to voicing, the upper to the relative strengths of all the sounds. So the distance from the beginning of $/ { \mathsf { p } } /$ to the vowel $/ \mathbf { x } /$ is indicated by the top curve starting farther to the left than the bottom line. The cursor has been placed at the onset of the vowel to show this clearly. Figure 2b shows the incorrect version corresponding to Figure lb. The onset of the vowel is too close to the beginning of the word, so listeners will think the word is bat rather than pat.

# FEATURES OF AMERICAN ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION THAT CHINESE NEED TO CONTROL

The features emphasized in this article have been divided into three levels: phoneme, word, and sentence. No attempt is made to promote the importance of segmental phonology over suprasegmental phonology, or vice versa. Both are necessary and easy to teach with instant displays of speech signals. In the author’s experience, the techniques described work well even with people who have been in the United States for 25 years and exhibit all the signs of so-called fossilized pronunciation.

# Phoneme Level

It is possible to listen to a good speaker of Chinese for an hour without hearing one clear phoneme that is also found in American English. Some phonemes are similar, such as lightly aspirated voiceless stops or lightly pronounced nasals. In general, the energy concentration of Chinese consonants has a higher frequency than American consonants. The differences in the duration of American $/ \mathrm { I } / $ and $/ \mathrm { i } /$ or of $/ \mathbf { v } /$ and $/ \mathbf { b } /$ are new to Chinese speakers. They try to make /I/as long as /i/ and /v/as short as /b/. This section on the phoneme level is divided into three parts: frequency (including voicing), aspiration, and duration.

Frequency. Telephone systems usually operate in a frequency range of ${ \mathsf { 5 0 } } { \mathrm { - 3 } } , { \mathsf { 5 0 0 } } { \mathrm { ~ H z } }$ . This captures the essential characteristics of speech and provides a signal of reasonable quality. Some of our sounds, such as $/ s /$ , have very high frequency, ${ 3 , 0 0 0 } \mathrm { { H z } }$ and above. Others, such as $/ \mu /$ , are very low. Many have a combination of high and low components, such as $/ \mathbf { z } /$ , which combines an /s/-like highfrequency component with voicing, which is low.

Since Chinese has no voiced stops and only one voiced fricative, the language in general has a higher frequency range than English. Therefore, it is important at the beginning of pronunciation lessons for Chinese students to start building more sensitivity to sounds in the low-frequency range. One way to do this is to help them learn how to control frequency. For example, by pronouncing $/ s /$ with the tongue very near the teeth, we have a very high-frequency sound. As the tongue is gradually moved back along the alveolar ridge and onto the palate, the frequency lowers. Figure 3a shows how the frequency lowers, and Figure 3b shows clearly how the amplitude rises.

![](img/45eb8d9130b6d53638a637bf31cb4ce8e8282705c6830f858be80ae76f7c63fd.jpg)  
FIGURE 3 Frequency Control Practice

Chinese uses parts of the range of Figure 3 for some of its sounds; English uses other parts. Figure 4 shows the parts of the range we use for $/ \mathbf { s } /$ and $/ \check { \mathsf { s } } / \overset { \vartriangle }$ . After students learn to control the range, they can find the proper levels of frequency. Then they learn, by practice, to associate the display with the feeling of producing the sound. The final goal is for students to associate the feeling with the sound.

FIGURE 4 Correct /s/ and /s/

![](img/8f9b3bebf7f868c50b2f51fb9108256cdfa7e6217e84a02fd559093d44e85932.jpg)

For a good many students, the intermediary step of seeing a visual display greatly accelerates their acquisition of this final step. This is because the visual display provides an objective measure that helps students focus their attention on the exact features that need to be changed. Because the communication is in the visual mode, students do not need to learn the linguistic vocabulary associated with phonological analysis.

Figure 5, which presents visual displays for the word shaped, shows the difference between vowel frequencies. The second band from the bottom of Figure 5a, points 2 and 3, is lower for $/ \mathbf { e } /$ and higher for $/ \mathrm { { I } }$ . We can clearly see the change in the diphthong from $/ \mathbf { e } /$ to $/ \mathrm { I } / $ . The relationship between the second band and the bottom band is different for each vowel, and each vowel should be demonstrated by the teacher.

Students need the chance to practice these sounds, with supervision, at the beginning of the term. It helps them both to learn to control the frequency and to interpret the graphics. They especially need help with $/ \pm / ,$ , as in the initial sound of apple, which is often pronounced as $/ \mathbf { e } /$ . They also need help with $/ \dot { \varepsilon } \dot { / }$ , as in let, which often sounds like late.

![](img/d306f0ea8be4bf82006f349b538b47a403860ca40f6906482d5a68025a391639.jpg)  
FIGURE 5 Correct shaped

Though there are sounds in Chinese similar to $/ \mathrm { { a I } / \mathrm { { , } \ / e I } / }$ , and /ou/, Chinese speakers of American English frequently do not use them in the appropriate places. They need practice in producing the sounds correctly in isolation and in individual words before using them in connected speech. This type of pattern recognition helps students with both pronunciation and listening comprehension.

To show Chinese students a simple way to produce $/ \mathbf { r } /$ and $/ 1 /$ , the teacher can give them a clear explanation of tongue placement followed by reinforcement from the graphics. One way that works well is to start with the sound /0/ as in thin. The tongue is broad and touching the teeth. Students can use this broad tongue to push against the back of the upper teeth while they say the /l/ of line. With the broad tongue pushing against the teeth, they produce a sound that we recognize easily as $/ \bar { \mathrm { l } ^ { \prime } }$ , even though it is not produced in exactly the conventional way. Then the teacher can explain that with $/ \mathbf { r } \bar { / }$ , the tongue does not touch anywhere. After the students understand tongue position, minimal pairs can be demonstrated, such as red and led in Figure 6.

Figure 6a, between points 1 and 2, shows that at the onset of $/ \mathbf { r } /$ , the second band slants upward to the right, but for $/ 1 /$ , in Figure 6c, between points 1 and 2, the second band is parallel to the bottom band. It may be very difficult for students to hear the difference at first, but they definitely can feel it and see it on the screen. By making it feel right, they can make themselves better understood even before they can hear the difference clearly. Gradually they learn to associate the feelings with the sounds, so that they make the sounds naturally in continuous speech after 4-6 weeks of class, 1 hour per week.

![](img/a9c7b8fd6dc8efe255e61b0357d5c1c2b1d4e335a8505ffb59b350b1b5540440.jpg)  
FIGURE 6 red and led

Initial /y/ is often spoken by students with a glottal stop, so that the year sounds like the ear (Figure 7). It is easy to show that in ordinary speech, there is a smooth transition from the to year (Figure 7a, point 3), so that there is no break in the sound. The year has a vertical gap between the words (Figure 7b, point 3).

Initial /w/ is often mispronounced as $/ \mathbf { u } /$ , so wood sounds like /ud/. Students need an explanation of lip movement so they can practice matching the pattern in Figure 8a, between points 1 and 2, where the second band slants upward to the right. If they pronounce $/ \mathbf { u d } /$ , the second band is parallel to the bottom band as in Figure 8b, between points 1 and 2.

In addition to the exercise exemplified in Figures 3 and 4, another good exercise is starting with a voiceless fricative or sibilant and alternating with its voiced counterpart, as shown in Figure 9. This type of exercise is very useful for $/ \mathbf { \bar { f } } , \mathbf { v } / , / \Theta , \mathbf { \delta } \delta / , / \mathbf { s } , \mathbf { z } / ,$ , and $^ { \prime \tilde { \mathbf { s } } , \tilde { \mathbf { z } } / }$ .

Students need a lot of help to realize that unvoiced fricatives and sibilants have voiced counterparts that have similar places of articulation. They usually are able to produce the voiceless sounds reasonably well, but the low frequency of the voiced sounds is generally difficult. This is also true for affricates. Students often pronounce $/ \mathfrak { J } /$ as $/ \alpha /$ or $/ \yen 1$ . They often pronounce $/ \yen 4$ as /s/ or $/ \mathfrak { J } /$ : Sometimes both /j/ and /z/ are confused with $/ \mathbf { y } /$ . Therefore, it is useful to work on a list of words such as mayor, major, mesher, and measure, as in Figure 10.

If a student is trying to say measure, then examples similar to Figures 10b, point 4, or 10f (at the cursor) are incorrect because there is a break in the word resulting from the pressure used to produce $/ \mathsf { J } /$ . To build the complex sound $/ \breve { \mathbf { z } } /$ , it helps to start with $\lceil \yen 1$ . The intermediate step with $/ \breve { \thinspace } \breve { \thinspace } I$ in Figures 10c, point 3, and $1 0 \mathbf { g }$ (between the cursors) shows how the top part of $\bar { / } \yen 4$ should look. Then by adding voicing in Figures 10d, point 3, and 10h, we get the complete form of $/ \yen 1$ :

If a student uses $/ \eth /$ in an attempt to say major, the result appears the same as Figure 10b without the voicing pattern at point 4. It is corrected by maintaining the pressure of the affricate and adding voicing.

Chinese students usually use voiceless unaspirated stops (Figure 11, point 1) when precise American English requires voiced stops. Thus, for a word such as big, the only voicing occurs during the vowel (Figure 11, point 2).

In precise American English we have prevoicing of voiced stops. This means that there is vibration of the vocal cords before the air pressure of the stop is released. Figure 12 shows the correct American English pronunciation of big. The dark horizontal band at the bottom of Figure 12a, point 1, represents voicing; the entire word is voiced. The voicing for both the /b/ (Figure 12a, point 1) and the $/ \mathbf { g } _ { \ast } /$ (Figure 12a, point 4) begins before the vertical bars indicating the release of the air pressure for $/ \mathbf { b } /$ and $/ \mathbf { g } /$ (points 3 and 5). In Figure 12b voicing is indicated by the horizontal line beneath the curve. The area to the left of the cursor in Figure 12b represents the $/ \mathbf { b } /$ of big.

There is a very large difference in the timing of voicing in Figures 11 and 12. This is significant for listening comprehension, especially if it is accompanied by problems in stress. Fortunately, it is not difficult to solve using homorganic nasals. By pronouncing a light $/ \mathbf { m } /$ before $/ \mathbf { b } / , \mathbf { \Lambda } / \mathbf { n } /$ before $\bar { / } \mathrm { d } /$ , and $/ { \mathfrak { p } } /$ before $/ \mathbf { g } /$ , especially when the stops are in word-initial position, students start to sound very American in their pronunciation. At first, students may make the prevoicing too long and separate from the rest of the word, as in $/ \bar { \bf b } /$ of big in Figure 13, point 1. Note that the student did not attempt to prevoice the $/ \mathbf { g } /$ (point 4).

This is not a bad beginning. With practice, the student should be able to make the prevoicing the appropriate length and connect it to

FIGURE 11 Incorrect big

FIGURE 13 An Attempt at Prevoicing: Incorrect big

the vertical bar. Chinese has the light nasal sounds required, so it is not difficult to use these sounds in this way. If students have trouble with $/ { \mathfrak { p } } /$ , the teacher can remind them that it is similar to the final sound for the word yellow in Chinese.

Aspiration. Though Chinese has three lightly aspirated, unvoiced stops similar to $/ \mathrm { { p , t , k / } }$ , students frequently omit the aspiration of $/ \mathbf { p } , \mathbf { t } , \mathbf { k } /$ in English. As explained earlier, this may cause Americans to perceive these sounds as attempts to produce $/ \tilde { \mathbf { b } } , \mathbf { d } , \mathbf { g } /$ because of the shorter time span between the release of the air pressure and the onset of the following vowel. This is especially important for wordinitial stops and word-medial stops before a stressed vowel. Wordfinal stops are usually not as strong, though in formal speech, they do retain all the features.

To help Chinese students with aspiration, the teacher can remind them that they have three sounds in their phonetic alphabet that are lightly aspirated voiceless stops. The teacher should explain that Americans use more air in English $/ \mathbf { p , t , k } /$ , so that if an American tries to speak Chinese, certain words sound too heavy. For example, the word wife sounds like tie-tie in Americanized Chinese. When students hear such heavy aspiration, they understand the difference. When they see the difference on the screen, it does not take long for them to match the shape of the teacher’s pattern.

It is reasonable to expect that students will take some time to master both voicing and aspiration. The concepts should be reinforced often, especially during the first few weeks of the term. It is desirable to move back and forth from pronunciation exercises to conversations and presentations, so that students are encouraged to transfer their new skills to natural situations. It is also a good idea to encourage students to listen more closely to English speakers in order to make better use of the potential reinforcement of the environment. They will ask why some people speak in less clear ways, and this provides a good opportunity to discuss differences between formal and informal speech.

Voicing and aspiration are two features that often change very little, no matter how long Chinese people stay in the United States. The visual channel of communication is very powerful for helping them focus their attention on the location, size, type, and significance of their errors. Bowen’s Patterns of English Pronunciation (1975) contains very helpful exercises for students attempting to master these contrasts in the context of sentences. Because students are able to see their progress, they learn the new style of pronunciation quickly. Thus, there is little need to worry that by working on these contrasts, they will not be able to appreciate suprasegmental features such as sentence stress or intonation.

Duration. It is both necessary and common to work on the duration of vowels such as $/ \mathrm { { I } } /$ and $/ \mathrm { i } /$ . It is less common but also necessary to work on the difference in duration between stops, which are short, and fricatives and sibilants, which are longer. If students try to pronounce a fricative or sibilant in the same short amount of time that it takes to produce a stop, then they do not give themselves a chance to pronounce the fricative correctly. One explanation they grasp quickly is that a stop is more like a punch, whereas a fricative is more like a scratch.

The duration of vowels, fricatives, and sibilants can be discussed easily by using visual displays, such as those in Figures 14 and 15. In Figure 14a, between points 1 and 2, we see that $/ \mathrm { \bar { d } } /$ is missing both the turbulence and the longer duration of /8/ in Figure 14b, between points 1 and 2. The contrast is shown in Figure 15 in a different way. To the left of the cursors, /d/in Figure 15a has lower amplitude and shorter duration than /d/ in Figure 15b. The higher amplitude in Figure 15b corresponds to the turbulence between points 1 and 2 of Figure 14b.

It is helpful to have students fill the screen with the pattern of a long fricative by pronouncing it once for more than 2 seconds; then they can see that they have real control of the sound. After they have the correct pattern, the teacher can explain that they only need to use a small portion of it to pronounce the word correctly. Again, for voiced fricatives, it is a good idea to start with the unvoiced counterparts and then add voicing, as in Figure 9.

# Word Level

End of the word. A typical word in Chinese consists of a consonant followed by a vowel. Mandarin does not have words that end in stops, sibilants, fricatives, or affricates. The only consonants possible at the ends of words are nasals. Even if students know how to pronounce the sounds correctly, they often omit them when they occur in word- or syllable-final position. This creates a very significant problem in communication. Compare the incorrect $/ \mathbf { g } ^ { \mathbf { \bar { \prime } } }$ in Figure 11, point 3, with the correct form in Figure 12a, point 5.

One way to explain the significance of consonants at the end of a word is to start with an idea about the Chinese language. When an American tries to learn Chinese, mastering the four tones is a difficult but crucial task. The Chinese word for ask has a falling tone. If by mistake the falling tone has a slight rising tone at the end, it means kiss. So the intended sentence Ask your friend could easily be misunderstood as Kiss your friend. It can be explained that consonants at the ends of words in English serve a similar function as the tone system in Chinese. We must pronounce them clearly so we can tell the difference between words such as map, mat, mad, math, mass, and mash Students should also know that final consonants are important because we listen very carefully to the ends of words to pick up grammatical signals such as -ed, -s, -ing, -ly, and -est.

It takes time, patience, and reinforcement to help students appreciate the significance of pronouncing consonants at the ends of words and syllables clearly. Once they start receiving positive feedback from outside the classroom regarding their improvement, their progress usually accelerates.

Computer displays for syllable- and word-final consonants look different from those for initial consonants. In general, initial consonants are bigger. In formal speech, final consonants, though smaller, still retain all of their features such as voicing and aspiration (see Figures 1,2,5,6,8,12,14, 15). Because of the sensitivity of the equipment, the teacher is free to decide which level of usage is appropriate to emphasize. “Broadcast” speech differs from informal conversation in many ways, including rules regarding assimilation of consonants at word and syllable boundaries. Since students bring their own concepts of assimilation from their native language, it is important to stabilize these concepts at a more formal level before concentrating on various shortcuts employed in informal speech.

Some of the time spent on specific consonants can also be devoted to general work on consonant clusters as errors occur in students’ speech. The word-final consonant cluster in Figure 5 provides a clear example. Both sounds should be represented, but they are not as fully developed as, for example, the initial $/ \mathsf { p } /$ in Figures la and 2a.

Word stress. Short, unstressed vowel syllables such as the $/ \mathrm { I } / $ in president are often missing, even when students have learned the proper frequency and duration of such syllables. Figure 16 shows the correct and incorrect pronunciation of president. Note that in the correct versions, the /1/ (Figure 16a, point 5; 16c, cursor) is relatively small compared with the first and third syllables. This indicates its lower level of stress. The primary stress is indicated by the size and darkness of the first part of Figures 16a and 16b and by the height and width of the first part of the curve in Figures l6c and 16d. The cursor in Figure 16c passes through $/ \mathbf { I } / \mathbf { \Omega }$ . In Figure 16d it passes through the place where $/ \mathbf { I } / \mathbf { \Omega }$ should be. By leaving out the short, unstressed vowel syllable, students create unwanted consonant clusters that could result in assimilation of the consonants, thereby causing further confusion to the listener.

# Sentence Level

That kind of a boy is ambiguous. In the sentence I didn’t know he was that kind of a boy, the word kind could mean “such a nice boy” or “a certain type of boy,” depending on the placement of stress. Stress on kind in Figure 17a, point 2, emphasizes kindness. Stress on that and boy in Figure 17b, points 1 and 5, emphasizes a type of boy. We can easily see the differences in stress by the different size of the stressed parts. Stressed parts have more energy, so the amplitude is greater, resulting in a larger and darker display. The greater duration results in a longer display on the horizontal axis. Rhythm is indicated by the relative length of syllables, words, and spaces.

Figure 18 is a Visi-Pitch display of three words—who shaped America’s— taken from a complex sentence. The word shaped, which appears between the vertical cursors, was discussed earlier (see Figure 5). The horizontal line at the bottom of Figure 18 represents voicing. It is broken in three places, corresponding to the /s/ at the beginning of shaped, the cluster at the end, and the $/ \mathbf { k } /$ sound in America’s. Note that the final /t/ of shaped is connected to the initial vowel of America’s.

In addition to showing voicing, the lower line shows intonation. Sentence intonation shows up better on the Visi-Pitch display because students can see a rising, stable, or falling line corresponding to the intonation. The tone goes down for who and up for shaped. For America’s the tone starts going down, goes up for the second syllable, and then goes down again. Rising intonation corresponds to increased stress. Looking at the intonation peaks and their duration, we have an objective way to determine that the primary stress of these words is on the second syllable of America’s.

# PEDAGOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The techniques described in this article may be integrated into a traditional spoken English class as a special laboratory section meeting 1 hour per week with 7-10 students and an instructor. This is sufficient time for the instructor to provide orientation to students regarding the use of the equipment for a particular lesson and for students to take turns individually to master the patterns. Students learn from each other in this process and often help each other, so small-group work is more efficient than individual lessons. As capabilities develop for networking, in which several student workstations are connected to a host computer, it will be possible to have larger classes with lower cost per student. Some students prefer a simpler display such as the Visi-Pitch. As an instructor, I prefer to use the SSD-type of display because it provides more information.

It is possible to start a program at the sentence level and work on specific sounds only when needed, an approach that might be best for more advanced students. Instruction at the sentence level can also be integrated into a more traditional approach starting with individual sounds. Students usually need help with all levels. Segmental phonology, working with sounds in isolation, can be covered in a sufficiently short time so that any fluency that has already been developed will not be seriously damaged.

To enhance the transfer of clear pronunciation from lessons to professional communication, the teacher can include a variety of supervised activities in the lessons. In addition to drills and exercises, students should prepare and deliver presentations and engage in conversations. During these activities it sometimes helps to ask students to discuss their possible errors before pointing them out. The use of the equipment should gradually decrease throughout the semester until it is used only on an as-needed basis for review.

For those planning to use computer equipment, the following suggestions could be helpful:

1. Allow a few weeks for students to get used to the equipment before using it as a regular part of a class.   
2. Keep the microphone close to your mouth when speaking in order for all the pronunciation features to be reflected in the visual display.   
3. If a student sounds correct but the display looks wrong, check the location of the microphone.   
4. Learn to distinguish the natural difference in the display, resulting from women’s voices being higher than men’s, from significant differences.   
5. Ask students if they are familiar with spectral displays. Those in science and engineering may understand the principles of the machines very well, and if so, they can explain some of the technical details to other students.

# “Let’s See”: Contrasting Conversations About Teaching

JOHN F. FANSELOW Teachers College, Columbia University

Two common aims of supervision and observation are to evaluate and to help. Supervisors and observers with these aims provide products to those they visit: “helpful” prescriptions for improvement or a rating of the observed performances. The aims of supervision and observation presented in this article are to explore, to see teaching differently, not to evaluate or help; the emphasis is on a process—visited and visiting teachers sharing ways of looking to discover self. This process includes taping and transcribing excerpts from classes, grouping parts of the excerpts, arriving at a common language to discuss them, and making multiple interpretations about them, based not only on preconceived notions but also on a range of contrasting beliefs and goals. In short, this article tries to provide ways of looking so each of us can see our own teaching differently through observing others, reminding us all that we “are capable of acting on the world, and that these actions can transform the world” (Mehan, 1979, p. 207).

# AIMS OF SUPERVISION AND OBSERVATION

When I used to ask teachers to write down comments they recalled from conversations with supervisors or fellow teachers who had visited their classes or had watched videotapes of their teaching, the comments and exchanges between different supervisors/observing teachers and the observed teachers seemed very different from each other. Others have found this too. Gebhard (1984), in a review of different models of supervision— different ways of making comments or of having conversations about lessons between supervisors and teachers—uses these labels: directive, alternative, collaborative, nondirective, creative.

Although the conversations I asked teachers to recall often indicated an overall tendency to be, say, more collaborative than directive, or more directive than nondirective, I consistently saw elements of many distinct models in the same sets of comments or conversations. I also began to notice that all the distinct models had the same aim: to provide a means for a more experienced person to help or evaluate a less experienced person. Two articles on supervision in second language teaching use the following words and phrases to characterize the purposes of the supervision models they describe: functions as an arbitrator, commenting, evaluating, helping, provides (Freeman, 1982, p. 21); to direct or guide, to offer suggestions, to model teaching, to advise teachers, to evaluate (Gebhard, 1984, p, 501). All of these words indicate that the person doing the visiting, no matter whether that person is following a collaborative model, creative model, or any other, is there mainly to help or evaluate the practice teacher, fellow teacher, or inservice teacher in training.

On first thinking about it, what could be more reasonable than designing models of supervision that provide ways for experienced people to help or evaluate inexperienced people? But thinking about the idea of help in other contexts provides a different perspective. Haven’t you heard children shout to parents or teachers words like “Let me do it—don’t show me,” or “Don’t give me the answer”? When referring to the need of children to be allowed to do things on their own, Montessori (1967, p. 309) made the plea, Let them fill their own buckets. As Alinsky (1971) reminded us:

It is a human characteristic that someone who asks for help and gets it reacts not only with gratitude but with a subconscious hostility toward the one who helped him. lt is a sort of psychic “original sin” because he feels that the one who helped him is always aware that if it hadn’t been for his help, he would still be a defeated nothing. (p. 93)

The type of resentment Alinsky mentions is not necessarily universal. Some people seem to like to be helped and expect to be told what to do as well. For them, evaluations containing prescriptions of what to do are welcome. In discussing the appropriateness of different models for teachers at various stages, Freeman (1982) highlights the value of help and evaluation by pointing out that beginning teachers, for example, seem to prefer models and direction to collaboration. But even while pleading for help from the cooperating teacher or supervisor, many practice teachers assert, “The most valuable part of practice teaching was seeing other teachers teach!” Seeing other teachers teach is not the same as being told what to do by an evaluator, nor is it being helped by someone.

As a result of this keen interest that practice teachers and many inservice teachers have in seeing others teach, my fear that helping people can lead to resentment toward the one providing the help, and the fact that prescriptions from supervisor’s evaluations can be demeaning and decrease the teacher’s authority and responsibility, I see the need for an aim of supervision and observation different from the ones frequently practiced and described in the literature. Whereas the usual aim of observation and supervision is to help or evaluate the person being seen, the aim I propose is selfexploration—seeing one’s own teaching differently. Observing others or ourselves to see teaching differently is not the same as being told what to do by others. Observing to explore is a process; observing to help or to evaluate is providing a product.

Besides leading to resentment, help can also lead to “learned helplessness” (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). Helpful prescriptions can stop exploration, since the receiver, as someone in an inferior position being given orders by someone in a superior position, may easily develop the “ours is not to wonder why” syndrome.

A conversation reflecting the aims of the usual models might go like this: “Here I am with my lens to look at you and your actions and tell you or discover with you what is right and what is wrong and needs to be improved; I will then prescribe better activities or collaborate so we or you alone can discover better activities. ” A conversation reflecting the aim of observation I am suggesting might go like this: “Here I am with my lens to look at you and your actions. But as I look at you with my lens, I consider you a mirror; I hope to see myself in you and through your teaching. When I see myself, I find it hard to get distance from my teaching. I hear my voice, I see my face and clothes and fail to see my teaching. Seeing you allows me to see myself differently and to explore variables we both use.” Although supervisors may consider their roles so set that empowering teachers to make decisions seems impossible, such redefinition is possible in any field. The role of managers in relationship to workers, for example, is presently undergoing change in many companies.

Although observing others does not automatically lead to seeing oneself differently, mainly because the aim of seeing others to help them is so usual, over time an increase occurs in comments like these: “That teacher said ‘Ok, now’ to mark changes in activity just as I do”; “How little each of us walks around”; “That teacher spoke to students at eye level some of the time; I do so only during breaks.”

The model I am describing grows out of a range of sources, not only my examination of many transcripts of teacher-supervisor conferences. For example, Jarvis (1972) argued that in order for teacher preparation programs to be truly responsive, they need to shift “the responsibility for the decision-making to the classroom teacher. . . . It is perhaps time to train the teacher to analyze his situation and make his own decision for his situation” (p. 201 ). As Freire (1970) points out, learning “consists of acts of cognition, not transferals of information” (p. 67). Each of us needs to construct, reconstruct, and revise our own teaching. He reminds us that for learning to take place we need to resolve the “teacher-student contradiction” (p. 67).

When we observe others to gain self-knowledge and self-insight and when we generate our own alternatives based on what we see others do, we construct our own knowledge and engage in the type of learning Freire has advocated. In a discussion of education, Abbs (1986) has this to say: “Authentic education is to be found in that act of intelligent exploration . . . the first priority of teachers should be to secure the necessary condition for the autonomy of teaching and for the freedom to learn” (p. 21). Using the word supervisor — a person with super vision—hardly supports our autonomy. When I observe and when I invite others to observe me, I refer to all of us as visiting teachers to avoid the use of the word supervisor.

# PRACTICES

I and others have used various combinations of the following practices in pre- and inservice MA and adult education programs. Anyone genuinely interested in exploring, in seeing teaching differently, and anyone who believes that we can learn about our own teaching by seeing others can use the practices.

In my experience, trying to observe and supervise with the aim of exploring practices and of gaining insight into one’s own teaching does not in itself enable us to stop treating observation and supervision as a means of helping and evaluating others. For people to begin to learn that they can see their own teaching differently by observing others, I and others have found the following practices for collecting, describing, and interpreting observations useful:

1. Short amounts of time have to be set aside for observation and discussion.   
2. Segments from observed lessons need to be collected by note taking, taping, or transcribing.   
3. The exchanges and activities in the segments need to be grouped in a range of ways.

4. Finally, what was done, as reflected in notes, tapes, and transcripts, needs to be related to notions, beliefs, and goals. Coupling this data collection and analysis with discussions of freedom and the need for each of us to construct our own knowledge helps many visiting teachers to decrease their suggestions to others, to increase their descriptive and analytical comments about the lessons observed, and to relate their insights to their own lessons.

Although allowing time for discussions of observations as part of a teacher’s load is a policy I advocate, this policy is rare. Even in teacher preparation programs, there are not always long periods of time for discussions. Rather than putting off observations and discussions until sufficient time is available, thereby virtually ensuring that they will never take place, I recommend limiting observations and discussions to as little as 5 minutes.

Obviously, seeing 5 minutes of a lesson prevents us from seeing lesson development. But look how much we notice in l-minute commercials. In many classes, 30 questions are asked in a minute (Hoetker, 1968). A dozen instances of feedback–both the treatment of errors and communications made after acceptable student moves—can be seen in a minute as well (Fanselow, 1977). In a 30-minute period, hundreds of communications are made, each in split seconds (Jackson, 1968).

Though short segments provide much data, short discussions force a limit to the number of communications that can be considered and the number of alternatives that can be generated. Since one or two communications often affect what is done and since many of our communications are unconscious, we can only hope to see and later try out one or two alternative communications per class period. Short time segments do not of themselves lead to fewer evaluative or helping comments or more exploration, however, and that is why the following activities are used.

# Collecting and Describing Data

Transcribing and note taking. The first step in our observations, no matter how long, is to capture as many of the specific communications as possible by audio- or videotaping, by taking notes, and by drawing sketches or even taking photographs as communications are observed. Later, tapes can be transcribed to reveal details missed in notes and sketches.

Observers can take notes, sketch, and transcribe as they wish. Many put exchanges in dialogue form in their notes. But now and then, one will put teacher communications in the left-hand column of a page and student communications in the right-hand column to highlight them. Many write one line and pause, forgetting that the purpose of looking is to collect data, not to judge the teacher or think of ways to help the teacher. Some prefer sketches to notes, noting the position of teachers and students, their location, or expressions on faces of teacher or students. Others note what is done rather than what is said—movements, objects used, writing on the board.

Except for the instruction that observers are to write down only what happens, not comments about what happens, no directions are given about what observers are to note. Different observers often note different communications, reflecting differences in the values of the observers. Some observers write down things they are interested in seeing in their own classes that they cannot see while they are teaching. Though two observers are likely to capture some of the same spoken exchanges, they are not likely to have the same account of how the exchanges were said or what other communications were made. Discussing what took place and listening to tapes will make clear a central lesson of observation: What we see is not what takes place but what we value as important to see; observing is selecting.

While transcribing exchanges, drawing sketches, or otherwise noting or capturing specific communications, we cannot write comments such as these: “To make the class lively, this teacher needs more activities”; “This teacher should follow the responses with clearer feedback.” When not taking notes or transcribing, we tend to revert to our usual pattern of thinking of ways to help or evaluate another. This is a sure way to miss seeing anything differently, a sure way to limit our observations by trying to relate them to our preconceived notions of good and bad teaching.

Grouping activities. As data are collected, the observers, and in many cases the teacher observed, begin to group the communications. For example, if the teacher asks the students to give synonyms for some words and to draw sketches to show the meanings of other words, the two types of tasks are grouped. One possible grouping that emerges has to do with the fact that one task requires the students to speak and the other one requires drawing and silence.

A range of groupings of tasks and activities, rather than just one, is aimed for. Looking at the same exchanges again, we can group the questions on the basis of who was asked the question. Were students sitting in particular rows asked to perform some tasks more often than students in other rows? Were males asked to perform more of some types of tasks than females? How many tasks did students perform because the teacher requested them to, either by using names or pointing, and how many did they volunteer for?

The purpose of the questions and the grouping is not to imply that, for example, using names is better than pointing or getting volunteers. The questions are asked so that the same tasks or activities can be grouped and categorized on the basis of a range of characteristics. When we look at, say, a dessert menu, we see many characteristics. We have categories such as high calorie or low calorie, sweet or semisweet, high or low cholesterol, easy or difficult to prepare, for children or adults, and so on. By seeing that there are many ways to group the same communications, we basically are developing a checklist of options and the multiple characteristics of each.

As such lists and groupings expand, ways to vary our teaching— use different options—become more and more evident. Each activity, and the groups it fits in, provides at least one more variable, with a distinct range of characteristics, that we can manipulate in our own teaching. Each grouping also reminds us that communications have multiple dimensions, a fact that is hidden by one-dimensional terms often used to judge teaching, such as great pace, nice grammar work, or fine communications.

Data are also grouped by making lists. For example, one teacher may give the answer to a question after a student cannot answer, and another may give a clue rather than the entire answer. Thus, we have two specific items on a list of feedback possibilities. Clues, too, may be given in various ways. A teacher may sometimes say, “The word starts with a g.” Another time the teacher may say, “It has two syllables” or “It is a noun.” One of the insights that come as lists are developed of what is observed in distinct areas of teaching such as feedback, group work, and so on is that the range of activities observed in any one class is often small, but across many teachers the range becomes great.

Using technical language. If transcribed communications are merely listed without being grouped or categorized, the list can become very long, of course. By grouping different communications on the basis of inferences we make about them, the value of category labels—technical language—becomes apparent. Thus, from the descriptive statement “Students gave synonyms,” an observer and teacher might infer that memory was required but that no motor control was, as in the case of drawing sketches to show the meaning of words. Then, looking at communications from our own or other classes and seeing other activities that require memory alone or memory plus motor control, subsequent communications can be compared with the first ones in the category. The feedback activities listed, such as the distinct clues given, can also be compared and grouped. “Clues given with spoken words” versus “clues given with symbols on the blackboard” would constitute one way to distinguish clues, for example.

After a few discussions between observers (visiting teachers) and the teachers observed (visited teachers), the following general categories inevitably arise: questions that require students to share previous knowledge versus those that require information just presented; tasks done individually or in groups; answers for which the teacher is interested in the form of what is said versus the meaning; questions teachers know the answers to and those they do not know the answers to; communications containing experiences of students and those using language for its own sake; student-tostudent communication and teacher-to-student or student-toteacher communication. Observers are reminded to develop categories that refer to at least two dimensions of any item in order to keep in mind the aim of seeing multiple dimensions of any communication.

The categories for the lists made and the groupings can cover whatever areas that observers and teachers want, as long as the focus is on the data: transcripts, sketches, photographs, notes, and actual recordings as well, when possible. This concentration on the collection and grouping of data makes it difficult to think of helping or evaluating anyone.

Lortie (1975), among others, has said that one of the critical problems that teachers face is that they do not have a language to discuss what they do: “What students [practice teachers] learn about teaching, then, is intuitive and imitative rather than explicit and analytical” (p. 62). Lortie (p. 73) maintains that the absence of a common technical vocabulary limits the ability to analyze as well as the acuity of the observations that teachers make.

Giving category names to the groups of communications and lists of activities provides a technical language, since those noting the similarities and differences between communications and activities constantly have to go back and forth between data and names applied to distinct types of data until they agree on a fit between the terms and the data. Once teachers and observers have developed some technical terms, coding systems developed by others can be introduced. The one I introduce most frequently is my own, called FOCUS (Fanselow, 1987). COLT (Allen, Fröhlich, & Spada, 1984), TALOS (Ullmann & Geva, 1982), or any other coding system can also be used (Long, 1980).

Starting discussions with a published coding system can make the idea of categories clear earlier, but there are some disadvantages to their early introduction. If teachers and observers are unaware of the problem coding systems were designed to deal with, they may use the systems in a mechanical way. Starting with published systems can also imply that the observers and teachers working jointly may not be up to the development of categories. On the other hand, going through the steps of gathering data and grouping data often shows the value of a technical language. It is also more likely that somebody else’s categories can be made our own if we develop some of our own along the way. When those doing the observing develop the categories, knowledge is being created, rather than buckets being filled (Montessori, 1967) or information being transferred (Freire, 1970, p. 67).

# Interpreting Data

Once a range of communications is captured in the form of data and once activities are listed, grouped, or categorized, interpretations can be made. It must be remembered, of course, that collecting data and listing and grouping them according to jointly developed categories or published ones are not activities free of interpretation. In initial discussions, as in initial collection and grouping of data, most participants interpret data in light of preconceived notions of good teaching. But at this stage, attention is given to showing how the data and lists of categories already reflect values, notions, or theories of teaching and learning. If the data indicate, for example, that the teacher smiled constantly, one participant may point out that a person noted smiles rather than frowns or shaking of the head. As the observer who noted the smiles equates smiles with friendliness, he or she realizes how a belief affected what was observed.

Since it is very common for us all to see, list, and group, as well as interpret, what we see in light of our preconceived notions about teaching, there is no way to prevent such “filtered” data collecting, grouping, or interpreting. But this effect can be counterbalanced. After one observer or teacher says that the teacher’s smile showed that the teacher was friendly, other possible interpretations of a smile can be sought. Alternative interpretations emerge from asking what smiles have meant in our classes or by asking for possible negative meanings of smiles. Usually, a comment such as “Well, I often smile when nervous” comes forth. Or one will hear, “I smile sometimes when I want students to like me. ” Different data from the segment being discussed might also be noted: “The smile was fixed as I recall; I frowned a lot too—look at the sketch you made of me.”

To encourage interpretations that are quite different from the normal ones that people with similar preconceived notions offer, participants are taught to ask each other to provide at least one interpretation that is seemingly outlandish or different in intent from the ones given. If all the interpretations are positive, possible negative interpretations can be sought. And if all are negative, positive interpretations can be sought. In the case of the smile, a negative interpretation might be that smiling can be used to keep control. Arguments about the superiority of a particular interpretation are not allowed in the beginning. Rather, the goal is simply to try to remind the participants that each event we see can be interpreted in ways different from our usual ways of doing it because we are each limited by the ideas of reality we have.

Another central lesson that emerges from multiple interpretations of the same event is that each event has more than one cause and that these causes need to be specified precisely. A replay of the videotape or a review of the notes or sketches may reveal some of the exchanges that took place before the smile, exchanges that were not seen because they seemed unimportant: the realization that the smile was perhaps the result of a number of small events that had happened immediately beforehand. By searching for different interpretations, observers and teachers are thrown back to the data, lists, and categories, not to seek support for what they thought when they started, but to seek support for the seemingly outlandish new interpretations. Seeing our own teaching differently is not going to happen if we are simply looking at other lessons and interpreting them in the same way we have been looking at lessons and interpreting them all of our lives.

Data and categories can also be interpreted in relationship to beliefs about teaching the participants have heard about. For example, participants can search for communications that are congruent or incongruent with Smith's (1971) admonition that “information about an error and aid in performing a task correctly are more helpful than discouraging comments about an inadequate performance” (p. 229). If a teacher is heard saying “Why can’t you ever do it right?” the participants might respond at first by saying that the communication seems incongruent. Seems is used because “Why can’t you do it right?” if said humorously and with a smile, could be congruent with Smith’s advice. Such tentativeness among the participants is possible because of a self-developed realization based on engaging in the process of collecting data, listing specific communications and activities, and relating them to ideas over and over again in short segments of time.

Isolating beliefs about language teaching that can be related to data and categories is not difficult. Most articles and books are written to further beliefs or theories. By relating beliefs from the literature to what is actually done and observed in specific detail, participants clarify beliefs and see ways to translate the beliefs into practice. To translate Krashen’s notion of “comprehensible input” (see Dulay, Burt, & Krashen, 1982) into action, teachers and observers can first examine exchanges in a range of lessons and then group those that seem comprehensible and those that seem not to be. Barnes’s (1976) ideas about “exploratory talk” and “finished talk,” about “school knowledge” versus “action knowledge,” can be understood, seen, and translated into action only when related to data gathered from lessons.

In addition to relating data and categories to beliefs about learning, we can relate them to goals. If our goal is to ensure that students can obtain literal and implied meaning from what they hear and read but we never ask any inference questions of them, then our practices are not congruent with our goal.

Relating data to notions in articles and books brings us to another activity that can be used in the observations and discussions of teaching: reading. Just as one goal of working in pairs and groups is to provide multiple perspectives, so reading is used to provide different angles. When our partners give us a different view of a lesson, we have to take our usual lenses off, for a few seconds at least, to try to see what they have seen. Published notions, both of ways of looking at teaching (Bateson, 1972; Mehan, 1979) and ways of teaching (Haskell, 1987), show us different maps of similar territory that require us to try on a range of different lenses.

# Self-Observation and the Notion of Opposites

Transcribing, listing activities, grouping communications, categorizing and relating these activities to our notions, beliefs, and goals—all show the great number of different ways of seeing variables, relationships between them, and consequences, if these activities can be done in pairs or groups. However, often we cannot find even one person to observe us or to be observed.

The basis for getting multiple perspectives when we are in a group is simply to juxtapose different individuals’ perceptions. This same idea of juxtaposing, of using opposites, can also be used to provide different perceptions when we are alone. If in our own classes we see the students always sitting in chairs during speaking lessons, we can ask ourselves to juxtapose—to give an opposite posture. In this case two opposites come immediately to mind. Students and teacher alike can sit on the floor, if the room is carpeted, or everyone can stand. Though much conversation outside of the classroom takes place when we are standing, the point of juxtaposing or contrasting opposite situations is to see situations not seen before, not to argue about the absolute superiority of a particular format. And although some may object to standing or to sitting on the floor, by precluding alternatives based on what people might think, we close off inquiry and tend to limit what occurs to our preconceived notions of good and bad teaching.

In addition to generating alternatives by looking at aspects of the classroom, we can compare the communications in a class with those we see outside of a teaching setting. Using our chair example, we can compare where we sit in a teaching setting with where we sit in a nonteaching setting, such as a dormitory room, living room, or park. Finding opposites to what we normally do in a teaching setting or comparing what we do in teaching and nonteaching settings can be extremely valuable in providing the alternative perspectives a partner would supply in pair or group work.

The idea of opposites can also help to broaden the range of interpretations. If the first and only interpretation of a teacher’s smile is that the teacher is happy and no other interpretations come up in a discussion, an opposite interpretation can be offered: “I have interpreted the smile as a good communication; now let me consider a smile a bad communication. Then what could it mean? What are some disadvantages of smiling?”

In second language acquisition research, learner errors were first attributed to the first language of the learners. Then, some began to explain the errors on the basis of developmental stages. Different types of errors were later considered to be caused by different types of tasks used to elicit the sentences that contained the errors (Ellis, 1985). What are these but opposite interpretations of the same data? Most fields are enriched by multiple interpretations of the same data, and these multiple interpretations can be generated by considering opposite interpretations to those usually provided.

Even with the concept of opposites to provide different perspectives, self-observation is limited. It prevents us from getting distance from our teaching and seeing our teaching through others. Though transcribing our own teaching gives us some distance from what we do, since the written record removes our voice, the transcriptions often remain too much a part of ourselves.

# MEANINGS

Given the aim I advocate for conversations about teaching, labels often used to classify conversations about teaching, as well as the words in the conversations, take on new meanings. “Ask questions more rapidly” is not necessarily a prescription or an offer of help in a conversation in which exploration and seeing teaching differently are the goals. The meaning need not be, “Do this because I who visited your class know more than you do and you need help.” Rather, the meaning can be, “Try this to see how it alters what has been happening. I am going to ask questions more rapidly too; perhaps different reasons to ask questions both slowly and rapidly will become apparent. We can compare tapes when we have some descriptions of both quick and slow questions.” On the other hand, when a visitor in the role of a person in charge says, “You might try a slower pace,” though the modal might is used, the meaning can be a “helpful” prescription. The message can mean, “I know, and I want you to do what I say. ” Exploration can be inhibited or completely stopped because the underlying intention of the words can be to show who is in charge.

Even a comment such as “The quick questions were great” can be seen as a description rather than as a judgment if the aim is exploratory. In such a context, the great could refer to the execution of the direction rather than to the technique itself.

Words in our conversations, to be judgments, must imply that the speaker or hearer is attributing good or bad, superiority or inferiority, to a practice. If “good lesson” is said or heard to imply that you or a teacher you visited did what was prescribed—what the speaker or hearer considers to be the right way to do it—then a judgment is probably being made in our communication. The words must be heard in relationship to the aim of our conversation and the role of those having the conversation. In the conversations I advocate, judgments are avoided because they tend to close off exploration. They tend to end, rather than continue, a process.

Some label an emphasis on data and description objective. We avoid both the terms objective and subjective. The meaning of a lot in “You asked a lot of questions” is not subjective because of a lot. Nor are 42 and 2 objective in “You asked 42 questions in 2 minutes.” Both statements can be judgments or descriptions, depending greatly on what the speaker’s and hearer’s aim is and the role each is assuming. Again, if the words are used to see differently, as a means to explore—suggesting the importance of comparing the asking of 42 questions in 2 minutes with 22 in 2 minutes or a few with a lot—then, they are both simply descriptive. If the words are used because the speaker or listener—the visited or visiting teacher—is against frequent questions or feels that asking a lot of questions is not the thing to do, both groups of words are likely to be judgments. Both can be implied helpful prescriptions to use fewer questions if you want to do the right thing and be a good teacher, given the preconceived notion of good teaching held by the visiting teacher or visited teacher.

There is a reason that explanations or proof to support categories or interpretations has not been mentioned. Observers do not request explanations like “Why did you smile?” And teachers do not give such explanations: “I smiled because I thought at that moment the class needed reassurance.” These exchanges tend to lead to arguments and can be seen as veiled attempts to support or strengthen the authority of one of the participants. In the model presented here, explanations are replaced by what a person did; what the characteristics were of what was done; how these related to beliefs, theories, or goals; and multiple interpretations of the data and groupings and the relationships among these.

Trying to see how the same words that for so long meant one thing can begin to mean something else is, of course, not something accomplished only by going through a series of steps. Nor indeed is seeing differently—exploration—a point to reach, but rather a tendency, a movement toward.

This tendency, this movement toward, as well as the tendency back toward the usual conversations, is noted by recording the discussions among teachers and observers—visited and visiting teachers. The exchanges in the discussions are dealt within the same way as exchanges from classes: Short transcriptions are made, communications are grouped and coded, and multiple interpretations are made. They are related to the beliefs upon which this model rests—the trust that can come from joint effort without external evaluation; exploration; multiple perspectives; multiple causation; the idea that much of what we do in classes, just as outside the classroom, is beyond our awareness; and the notion that helping another from a superior position can lead to resentment and dependence.

The discussions of the observations often show confusion, struggles to group and categorize data. They also contain examples of simple causation (“The repetition of the sentence made them learn it”), prescriptions (“You should never put the directions up on the board when they are in their books”), and all the other normal types of conversations we usually have about teaching. But now and then the teaching act is discussed in a way that is congruent with the beliefs of this model.

# CONCLUSION

Judgments and predictable prescriptions are not limited to conversations about teaching. In a critique of Canby’s movie reviews, Carney (1986) reminds us that using words like charming, sincere, buoyant, funny, and clever to review films “amounts to an alarming aesthetic” (p. 30). He goes on:

One is accustomed to seeing invocations of charms, etc., as measures of value . . . in ads for Calvin Klein, Christian Dior, Clinique, and Club Med. But these are hardly the supreme values that one would expect in a serious reflection on art. . . . They are, indeed, precisely the values such a reflection should question. (p. 30)

If we discuss teaching with words implying judgments like exciting, boring, flowed smoothly—all variations of good and bad—we limit our perceptions in the same way that such one-dimensional, uncritical words limit our perceptions of film and other forms of art.

The usual conversations, full of prescriptive clichés designed to help or evaluate, no doubt provide more certainty than conversations whose purpose is to see our own and others’ teaching differently and to explore reality. In fact, Canby’s buoyant, funny, and clever might be welcome in many conversations about teaching. Conversations between Socrates and others in the Socratic dialogues could not be described in this way! These characters reflect more complexity in their conversations—movement from strongly held opinion to floundering uncertainty to a confused not knowing. Similar stages occur in conversations aimed at seeing teaching differently—exploring. An authentic quest for learning and meaning requires that these stages take place. Neat, pat answers to complex problems were not a part of the Socratic dialogues, nor are they a part of conversations exploring teaching. As Abbs (1986) reminds us in a discussion of Socrates:

To adopt the Socratic view of education would be to reaffirm that education in our culture is primarily concerned with critical reflection . with sustained inquiry into the various forms of meaning, with the lifelong process . . . that goes well beyond the enclosing pressures of the ego and the ephemeral clamorings of party politics. (p. 21)

To observe others and ourselves with the purpose of helping implies not only that we know that one set of practices is consistently superior to another, but that we know what needs to be done in each distinct setting. It also implies that there is a simple cause-effect relationship between a communication and a result: “Smile and the class will be relaxed’; “Speak slowly and the class will understand.” To help another or ourselves means we know what should be done and what practices produce what results. If experience in classes has taught us nothing else, we have learned that each day we and our students are different as a result of ongoing experiences and that practices that seemed to have particular consequences one day have different ones another day.

To help means we have something to give another, a product to sell. The whole thrust of the point of view and activities presented in this article is toward the value of process, not product, and toward the construction of our own knowledge, not the acceptance of the knowledge of others in some type of package, as a product. Freire’s (1970, p. 59) use of banking as a metaphor for education that stresses product highlights the aim of many conversations about lessons we observe: the passing of information from one person to another. As Mehan (1979) says:

In sum, providing people with prearranged packages of information is oppressive, for it fails to treat people as responsible for their own lives. Furthermore, these imposed programs often have little to do with the participants’ own preoccupations and practical circumstances. Providing people with ways of looking, on the other hand, reminds the participants that they are capable of acting on the world, and that these actions can transform the world. (pp. 206-207)

The model for visiting teachers presented here, like the ideas of Mehan and Freire, all come together in Bronowski’s (1956) discussion of the purposes of art and science. For the words science and works of art in the following quotation, one might consider substituting the words observation and lessons and conversations about lessons, respectively.

The discoveries of science, the works of art are explorations—more, are explosions—of a hidden likeness. . . . When a simile takes us aback and persuades us together, when we find a juxtaposition in a picture both odd and intriguing, when a theory is at once fresh and convincing, we do not merely nod over someone else’s work. We re-enact the creative act, and we ourselves make the discovery again. At bottom, there is no unifying likeness there until we have seized it, we too have made it for ourselves. (p. 19)

When we collect and interpret data from observations and reconstruct our teaching, we are, of course, reinventing the wheel. But why not? Why deny others or ourselves this pleasure? By providing pat prescriptions to help, we not only deny others or ourselves the excitement of constructing knowledge, we also imply that we ourselves or those we work with cannot construct knowledge. Moreover, helping can stop exploration. Again, Bronowski’s (1956) comments are appropriate. To him, the process of exploration is the “habit of truth”: “In science and in art and in self-knowledge we explore and move constantly by turning to the world of sense to ask, Is this so? This is the habit of truth, always minute yet always urgent” (p. 43).

# Exploring through Writing: A Process Approach to ESL Composition

Ann Raimes. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1987. Student’s Book, pp.   
xiii $+ 3 1 8$ ; Instructor’s Manual (in Instructor’s Edition), pp. 42.

■ Few ESL teachers choose to teach writing without a text of any kind, so that selecting a textbook, although no guarantee of a successful class, often goes a long way in directing the activities and assignments of a composition class. This past year I had the occasion to use Ann Raimes’s latest book, Exploring Through Writing, with ESL students in a pre-university composition class. The review that follows offers both a user’s and a reviewer’s perspective on the book.

Beginning with her textbook Focus on Composition (1978), Raimes has consistently used visual and graphic material, in addition to readings, as stimuli for writing. Many ESL teachers, myself included, owe our introduction to Magritte’s Portrait (1935), an unforgettable still life with an eye staring out from a slice of ham, to that book. In Techniques in Writing (1983), a text for teachers, Raimes devoted a chapter to the use of pictures, in addition to providing a solid grounding in other teaching techniques at all stages of the writing process. In her most recent book, Exploring Through Writing, Raimes again incorporates both pictures and readings into the text, this time gearing the level to more advanced students than she did in her 1978 book.

Like Focus on Composition, Exploring Through Writing i s nontraditional in content and organization. It contains three parts: Part I, Processes; Part II, Grammar: Twenty-One Troublespots; and Part 111, Materials: Pictures and Readings. On the surface, these components appear to be discrete and separate units. But upon careful reading, that impression dissolves, since the different parts of the book are intended to be recycled throughout the course. Part I involves students in activities that move them through all stages of the writing process. Part II offers guidelines on problem areas of grammar and short exercises, and Part III provides the content for writing through pictures and readings. The intention is for students to choose one of five general topic areas in Part III (places, possessions, work, family, or men and women) and work through the recursive stages of writing: motivation, idea generation, drafting, reformulation, editing, and publication (delivery to readers) as described by Coe (1986). In subsequent papers, or writing cycles, students choose other topic areas and generally move through the writing process at a faster pace.

The Instructor’s Manual, which is included in the instructor’s edition, is mandatory reading for anyone new to the writing process. It provides a brief rationale for the approach, suggesting teaching plans for a 15- and 8-week course and discussing how to use groups in the classroom. What follows is a short sketch of each of the three parts of the book.

Part I (Processes) drives the whole text and is noteworthy for the variety and depth of its writing activities at all stages of writing. Raimes divides the writing process into four components: getting started, finding ways in, writing and rewriting, and editing. Each component is further subdivided into strategies, resulting, for example, in five ways of finding ways in: listing and brainstorming, freewriting, asking questions, exploring new viewpoints, and telling a story. Teachers newly acquainted with teaching writing as a process may be tempted to walk students through all five strategies before they produce a first draft—on the theory that if one invention technique is good, five must be better. I have found it more productive to try one or two of the strategies with each paper so that students develop a repertoire of invention techniques by the end of the course.

Also noteworthy in the editing component of Part I are the sections on improving style and using a dictionary. To go beyond editing for correctness, ESL writers must consider features of style, such as sentence length and complexity, types of cohesive links, word choice, and tone. Stylistic concerns are rarely treated in ESL composition texts, although they are a common feature of freshman English texts for native English speakers. Though limited in focus to sentence types (short and choppy versus long and convoluted) and types of cohesive links, the section on improving style represents a step in the right direction. The section on using dictionaries is basic for all ESL teachers and a welcome addition to the book, since too many ESL teachers ignore or assume knowledge of dictionary skills.

The 21 grammar troublespots described in Part II reflect the choice of a seasoned teacher of writing but are by no means exhaustive. They fall into three general categories: sentence construction (types of sentences, sentence boundaries, sentence combining); grammar and syntax (parts of speech, word forms, word order); and mechanics (punctuation, forms of quoting and citing). They are not arranged in any explicit order, but rather reflect frequency of occurrence and, to some degree, level of difficulty. For example, basic grammar problems, such as those related to sentence boundaries and agreement, are listed before more advanced grammar structures, such as -ing versus -ed participles, articles, relative clauses, and conditionals.

The grammar troublespots contain general rules rather than complete descriptions of usage. But as Raimes herself points out in the Instructor’s Manual, the troublespots are not intended to explicate fully or to provide comprehensive practice with problem structures. Instead, they are meant to be used as an editing tool for a student to pinpoint a problem, to understand general rules about it, and to apply them in writing. The troublespots contain explanations, examples, and flowcharts as well as practice exercises. Raimes suggests that the teacher go through one or more of the troublespots with the members of the class so that they become familiar with their intended use and format. Students can then more profitably refer to the troublespots on their own or as recommended by the teacher. Students who desire a more complete discussion of rules, including exceptions, should be referred to a grammar reference text or style manual. Because the exercises included in the grammar troublespots are short, teachers will need to supplement them to provide adequate practice in problem areas for some students.

Part III (Materials) provides the content for Part I (Processes). As mentioned earlier, the pictures and readings in Part III are thematically organized into five units: places, possessions, work, family, and men and women. Each unit contains a series of blackand-white reproductions of paintings or photographs, sometimes excerpted from advertisements. Although the pictures themselves are chosen for high interest, unfortunately the poor quality of some reproductions detracts from that intention. Without knowing something about Gandhi, a reader would find it difficult to identify several objects in the photograph of his worldly possessions (Unit $\breve { \ 2 } _ { \scriptscriptstyle 7 }$ Possessions, p. 203), including a pair of sandals in the foreground. The same is true for a reproduction of Edward Hopper’s painting Gas (1940) in the Places unit (p. 181). My students had difficulty determining whether the light cast from the gas station was due to the sun or light bulbs. Although the cost of color reproductions may be prohibitive, sharper photographs would undoubtedly contribute to students’ ability to describe these artworks, which deserve better presentation.

In each of the five units, the series of pictures is preceded by preview questions and accompanied by brief questions that guide students in their reactions to the pictures. These questions are designed to elicit ideas that go beyond the picture itself, crucial for writers searching for connections to their own lives. Similar questions accompany each reading.

The quality and careful selection of the readings compensate in many ways for the problems with the pictures. Like the pictures that precede them, the readings are of high interest. Lively and engaging, they range in topic from a selection from the diary of Anne Frank to a description of job satisfaction and productivity, complete with tables. The readings are unedited and come with glosses of low-frequency words and colloquialisms in the margins.

A fundamental issue about Exploring Through Writing concerns its ongoing usefulness. Working through the book provides a classic exercise in self-learning. Once students go through two or three writing cycles, referring to Part I (Processes), Part II (Grammar), and Part III (Materials), they have no more use for the text. That is, by internalizing the various steps in the writing process and acquiring strategies for implementing them, students need only refer to the text for problem areas in grammar or to the pictures and readings for ideas. However, a grammar reference text and teachermade materials would accomplish the same purpose. Does this mean that Part I, covering the first 77 pages, is the only essential part of the book? Yes and no. For the teacher new to the writing process and/or new to teaching writing, the book makes it possible to put theories about the composing process into practice. The pictures and readings, with their accompanying questions, offer basic materials that teachers can then expand or substitute on their own. The grammar troublespots, though not a complete grammar reference, provide enough information for most students to get back on track in their writing.

A problem some students and teachers may have with this text is that there is very little to “take home” after the course is over: no set rules about writing, no complete grammar reference, no style manual. For the most part, the learning with this book takes place in the doing. But if students have accomplished the goal, that is, made strides in their writing, is the text somehow lacking? If, in fact, students work themselves out of the need for a writing text, this should be cause for praise, not criticism. Learning how to write should not be equated simply with learning how to control grammar, mechanics, and the conventions of academic writing. Throughout the book, Raimes demonstrates that since writing cannot really be taught, students learn most from doing more themselves—writing and discussing their work with each other and with the teacher. As such, Exploring Through Writing should be commended for delivering what its subtitle claims: A Process Approach to ESL Composition.

Bennington and Richards (1986) put forth a list of general recommendations regarding the teaching of pronunciation and its place in second language learning. Their recommendations include helping the learner focus on longer term goals; bringing learners gradually from controlled, cognitively based performance to automatic, skill-based performance; and highlighting the interdependence of pronunciation with other aspects of language use. Sounds and Rhythm takes some admirable steps in implementing these recommendations.

Designed for a wide range of ability levels, Sounds and Rhythm begins with an overview of English pronunciation. When I used this text with a variety of adult learners from the newly arrived to longtime, quite fluent residents, I found that all appreciated the overall orientation very much. Word stress is introduced with nonlinguistic syllables, which in practice proved to be an excellent aid to those having difficulty hearing such differences. The orientation section also includes units on phrases and sentences, vowels, rhythm, and the “sound of English.” The latter unit includes an exercise in which sentences spoken by a native speaker are contrasted with the same sentences spoken by a foreign speaker. This is followed by an exercise in which the student must decide if the speaker of each sentence is native or nonnative.

Part 2 contains 13 units on basic stress, rhythm, and intonation. Each chapter tries to bring the learner from a controlled to an automatic performance by following a specific buildup pattern. In the chapter on falling intonation, for example, the lesson begins with a simple explanation of the use of final falling intonation, followed by a listen-and-repeat exercise, moves on to audition exercises, then to asking question-word questions and making statements about pictures, and finally to having the learners interview each other. As in most pronunciation texts, unfortunately, word stress is treated as an essentially random matter with no attempt to alert students to the control of stress by word endings such as -tion, -it, and -ity. The unit on compound-noun stress is similarly oversimplified, dwelling only on initially stressed compounds (BASEball, CANdy store, etc.) while neglecting finally stressed compounds such as afterNOON or New YORK.

Part 3 presents vowels in 35 separate units. In this section the text really shines in its creative communicative exercises. It begins with an overview of all vowels and then introduces learners to the three influences on the ‘length of vowels. This is an excellent chapter with one exception: In my experience, the closing consonant influence needs a great deal more practice than afforded here.

The chapters on individual vowels begin with the low central vowel /a/. In each of these chapters, learners move from words and phrases, to producing sentences and answering questions, to such communicative activities as telling a short story using targeted words. Links with grammar are highlighted, as for the vowel $\%$ in Chapter 21, where learners answer questions using the past tense of irregular verbs that are formed with the $/ \mathfrak { E } /$ sound:"T: How did you feel? (well), S: I felt well” (p. 51). Previously introduced vowels are contrasted and summarized periodically. Unfortunately, the importance of the schwa sound is lost by introducing it at the very end of these 35 units. A more appropriate place might have been in connection with word stress, as was done by Gilbert (1984).

Part 4 focuses on grammar words and sentence rhythm. Many of the chapters deal with reduced forms, and this material is handled well with the exception of having students attempt to learn to produce $/ \eth /$ before vowels and before consonants. Bowen (1975) has pointed out that this rule was developed from observations of formal speech and does not hold true for the pronunciation of informal speech toward which this book is directed.

In spite of the above mentioned faults, Sounds and Rhythm is a sound book (no pun intended) from which many students should benefit, especially high-beginning and intermediate-level speakers.

Another new text, Speak Up!, makes a similar attempt to integrate pronunciation into the language syllabus. It is designed to be used with the series Beginnings, though it can be used alone, as it was for this evaluation. This text is rich in variety and as comprehensive as most beginning pronunciation texts on the market, though it has serious errors.

Speak Up! is divided into 40 convenient two-page units, each starting with a comprehension dialogue from which the consonant or vowel pronunciation focus is drawn. The traditional word list with discrimination exercise is followed by a cloze exercise. Section C addresses suprasegmentals and reduced forms, and Section D is a listening exercise designed to give students practice in listening to reduced forms in context.

This text has many well-thought-out exercises. The dialogues on the set of four accompanying tapes, which are integral to the use of the text, are interesting and well performed; their natural speed and intonation present a realistic challenge. In the articulation focus section, the contrasting sounds presented cover the greatest needs of Asian and Spanish speakers, who form the largest portion of most pronunciation classes, at least in the San Francisco Bay area. Answers to almost all exercises are provided in the appendixes, though a few that were needed were omitted.

There are, however, some glaring errors. Using the traditional grammar-based approach to intonation, the text introduces students to the difference in “tunes” between yes/no questions and whquestions. The illustration shows wh- questions ending with a rising intonation, rather than the more common falling intonation, a serious fault. The wh- questions in the recording of the listen-andrepeat exercise that immediately follows, however, are given final falling-intonation contours.

The author maintains that only the vowels in stressed syllables are spoken clearly, or with full vowels. In fact, English abounds with words that have full vowels in syllables that do not carry the primary word stress, such as transportation, secretary, and so on.

Furthermore, some pairs of words are distinguished only by the production of a full or an unclear vowel in an unstressed syllable, such as in estimate as a noun and estimate as a verb.

Speak Up! also fails to explain why the rule that statements have final falling intonation and yes/no questions have final rising intonation, as well as the examples illustrating the rule, is contradicted by the dialogues on the tapes. In the very same lesson in the following dialogue, the male speaker on the tape makes the statement I want to report an accident with a final rising intonation. Surely, he did not mean an uninvested question signaled by rising intonation $( D o \ I$ want to report an accident?). As if to underscore this point, further on in the same dialogue, the female speaker asks a yes/no questlon with final fall-rise intonation, rather than expected rising one. These are not isolated examples as is evidenced by the fact that the very next unit begins with another yes/no question delivered with final falling intonation by the speaker. The dialogues sound natural so the problem is not in the speakers but in the rules, though these rules are the most commonly taught.

Though initially I was intrigued by the organization of this book and by its variety, I have since concluded that the frequent errors in theory as well as in answers to drills are sufficiently grave that this text should only be in the hands of teachers knowledgeable enough in the area of pronunciation to provide correct information for students. In addition, there is a preponderance of listening material and too little production work, especially of communicative speech. Although both of these texts offer some new ideas and presentation methods, we need to continue to think about improvements in the teaching of pronunciation. Most pressing is the need for a more valid presentation of the subject of intonation. As one can observe often on the tapes accompanying Speak Up!, the use of natural intonation in realistic situations does not substantiate the rules presented.

Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns, in Discourse Intonation and Language Teaching (1980), detail the argument against teaching the grammar-based intonation patterns used in the two texts reviewed here and in most current texts. Noting the problems with teaching intonation patterns as expressions of specific emotions (surprise, anger, excitement, etc.), they come to the conclusion that we need to think in terms of the role of speakers in relationship to each other and of intonation as “a function of discourse with implications for context and for moment by moment assessment of the communicative value of each part of each utterance” (p. 128). As a further complication, it has been found (see de Bot, 1981) that it is very difficult—even for teachers with considerable experience in pronunciation teaching—to judge intonation consistently, leading to the conclusion that “without doubt the fact that most teachers are unable to judge intonation in the speech of their pupils consistently constitutes one of the major problems of intonation teaching” (p. 36).

Recent publications should prove helpful in stimulating thought on how to present intonation more effectively. Bolinger (1986), for example, has posited three basic intonation profiles that are smaller than whole contours and has made some very useful generalizations on how and why they are used. Bolinger’s work as well as that of Gumperz (1982) and others should help us in understanding intonation as a factor in the roles played by speakers in discourse. These books are theoretically oriented, however, and much work lies ahead to transform new concepts into even better teaching methods and materials.

# Do We Need to Teach Spelling? The Relationship Between Spelling and Voluntary Reading Among Community College ESL Students

JEANNE POLAK Los Angeles Valley College

STEPHEN KRASHEN University of Southern California

■ It has been suggested that reading contributes to spelling competence (Ehri, 1986; Krashen, 1985; Smith, 1982b; see also Goodman, Smith, Meredith, & Goodman, 1987). Experimental studies indicate that readers can improve their spelling by exposure to words in texts (Gilbert, 1934, 1935). In addition, consistent correlations have been found between performance on tests of reading comprehension and tests of spelling ability (Hammill & McNutt, 1980). Although this relationship can be interpreted as showing the relevance of spelling ability to reading, it is also consistent with the hypothesis that reading experience causes improvement in both reading and spelling ability.

The three studies described here were an attempt to determine whether a relationship exists between spelling competence and voluntary reading for ESL students at the community college level. If such a relationship could be demonstrated, it would provide additional support for the hypothesis that reading contributes to spelling ability.

# METHOD

Three separate studies were conducted. The second study was done to see whether the results of the first study would hold for different test words. The third was done to determine whether first language had an effect. The subjects were students enrolled in intermediate-level ESL classes at Valley College in Los Angeles. (lntermediate is defined here as advanced enough to enroll in regular subject-matter classes taught in English.) Students qualified for this level by passing the previous level or by scoring between 30 and 37 on the Comprehensive English Language Test (Harris & Palmer, 1970), a test of listening comprehension, structure, and vocabulary that does not measure spelling proficiency. Students in this level do not receive formal spelling instruction, but they are penalized for misspelled words on their written work, and occasional spelling lessons are provided by some instructors. Subjects in the first two studies were members of intact classes $( N = 3 0$ and 15, respectively). Two additional intact classes were combined for the third study $( N = 7 8 )$ ; a larger sample was considered desirable so that a sufficient number of different first languages could be included.

In all three studies, subjects were first given a dictation and were then asked to fill out a questionnaire probing their voluntary reading. The dictation used in Studies 1 and 3 consisted of 103 words and was taken from Learning American English (Taylor, 1956, p. 87). In Study 2, an 85- word passage from Whaddaya Say? Guided Practice in Relaxed English (Weinstein, 1982, p. 13) was used. The passage was read twice, and students simply recorded what they heard. They were given time to check their work after the passage was read. Students’ scores were simply the number of words misspelled. If the same word was used and misspelled more than once, it was counted as only one spelling error. Students were aware that spelling accuracy was the focus of the activity.

After doing the dictation, subjects filled out a questionnaire developed by the first author to probe their current voluntary reading (see Figure 1). They were given one point for each item checked. The same questionnaire was used in all three studies.

# RESULTS

In all three studies a significant negative correlation was found between questionnaire results and spelling errors: Those who reported more free reading tended to make fewer errors (see Table 1). All three correlations were statistically significant, but not significantly different from each other (for Studies 1 and 2, $z = . 2 4 5$ ; for Studies 2 and 3, $z = . 4 4 2$ ; for Studies 1 and 3, $z = . 2 3 2 )$ ).

Oller and Ziahosseiny (1971) reported that college ESL students who spoke languages with Roman scripts made slightly more errors in English spelling on a dictation test than did students who were speakers of languages with non-Roman scripts. Differences were significant, but small. To determine the possible influence of first language, in Study 3 we kept a record of students’ first language. The following first languages were represented: Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, Farsi, Armenian, Arabic, French, German, and Slovak. For statistical analysis, languages written with Roman alphabets were coded as 1, whereas languages with non-Roman alphabets were coded as O. No difference was found in spelling performance between speakers of languages with Roman alphabets and speakers of languages with nonRoman alphabets $( r { = } \mathrm { - } 0 9 7$ , n.s.).

The combined effect of reading and first language was analyzed using multiple regression (see Table 2), which reveals the effect of each of the independent variables when the other is held constant. The regression coefficient (b) for reading is significantly different from zero $( t \bar { = } \ 3 . 0 5 5$ , $p < . 0 1 )$ , but the coefficient for first language is not $\mathbf { \Phi } ( t = 0 . 1 4 9 4$ , n.s.). Inspection of the betas (standardized regression coefficients) shows that reported voluntary reading has a much larger effect on spelling than does first language. In addition, incorporating first language into the analysis does very little for our ability to predict spelling scores. Alone, current reading habits account for $1 1 . { \dot { 8 } } 3 \%$ of the variance in spelling in Study 3 $( \boldsymbol { R } ^ { 2 } )$ , or $- . 3 \bar { 4 4 } ^ { 2 } )$ . Adding first language allows us to account for about $1 1 . 8 6 \%$ of the variance in spelling $( R ^ { 2 }$ in Table 2), less than $0 . 0 3 \%$ more.

A separate analysis of Spanish-speaking subjects in Study 3 resulted in a very similar relationship between reading and spelling $( r \bar { = } - . 3 2 3$ , $p < . 0 5$ ; $\pmb { n = 3 0 }$ ), confirming that the effect of reading is independent of any effect of first language.

# DISCUSSION

Correlations do not imply causality. Our results might mean that reading experience is responsible for spelling ability or that spelling ability underlies reading ability, which in turn results in more free reading. They could also mean that reading and spelling influence each other.

The hypothesis that spelling competence aids and thus encourages reading runs into trouble in the face of Smith's (1982a) arguments that spelling “has only a minimal role in reading” (p. 143). Smith presents evidence that word identification does not require previous letter identification and that knowledge of the features necessary for word identification and “the identification of meaning” from texts is built up by meaningful reading.

If free reading causes improvement in spelling ability, we must explain why the correlations found here are so modest; current reading habits account for only $2 2 . 4 \%$ of the variance in spelling in the study yielding the highest correlation, Study 2. One possible explanation, consistent with the hypothesis that reading causes improvement in spelling ability, is that our measures were not sufficiently sensitive. The reading questionnaire probed only current voluntary reading, not previous reading in the first or second language, and may not have given enough weight to certain kinds of reading. Also, the dictation test may not have probed a wide enough variety of words.

Of course, it is possible that other variables play an important role. Candidates include level of literacy in the primary language, perceptual/ memory factors, degree of concern with proper spelling, and amount and kind of spelling instruction (for strong arguments against the view that spelling competence comes primarily from writing, see Smith, 1981).

The fact that the measures used were so crude, yet our results so consistent, makes our results, in our view, all the more interesting. A more extensive test of spelling and a measure of reading that takes into account students’ past history of voluntary reading might produce stronger results.

Our results suggest that voluntary reading will help spelling and lead to what is at worst a harmless implication: Students should be encouraged to do pleasure reading on their own. Besides spelling, there is good evidence that voluntary reading leads to improvement in many areas of language, including reading ability, vocabulary, grammar, and writing style (Krashen, 1985; Smith, 1982a, 1982b).

However, even if improved spelling ability results from reading, this does not imply that extensive reading will result in perfect spelling. If Goodman (1982) and Smith (1982a) are correct, fluent readers do not need to pay attention to every bit of visual information, but only need enough to confirm their predictions. Thus, even excellent readers may have some gaps. (Most readers of this article, we predict, are good, but perhaps not perfect, spellers.) A spelling dictionary or spelling-checker program may be the best way of dealing with occasional demons.1

# The Effect of ESL Students’ Perceptions of Their Cognitive Strategies on Reading Achievement

YOLANDA N. PADRON University of Houston—Clear Lake

HERSHOLT C. WAXMAN University of Houston— University Park

Although a few studies have investigated the cognitive reading strategies used by Hispanic ESL students (Block, 1986; Knight, Padron, & Waxman, 1985), the effect of these students’ use of strategies on reading achievement has not been specifically examined. Furthermore, most of these studies have used think-aloud procedures and verbal reports to identify reading strategies, a methodology that has been questioned because students sometimes have difficulty assessing metacognitive processes (Afflerbach & Johnston, 1984; Ericsson& Simon, 1984).

On the other hand, a few studies have successfully used self-report instruments to identify the cognitive reading strategies used by students (Hahn, 1984; Paris & Myers, 1981). These instruments, however, have not been used with Hispanic ESL students, nor have they specifically examined the relationship between students’ reported use of cognitive reading strategies and performance on measures of reading comprehension.

# METHOD

The sample in the present study consisted of 82 students who were randomly selected from the population of Hispanic ESL students in the third, fourth, and fifth grades of a public elementary school in a small industrial town located near a major southwestern city. The reading comprehension section of the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test (Karlesen, Madden, & Gardner, 1966) was administered in January and again in April to determine the relationship between the strategies cited by students and gains in reading comprehension. Immediately after completing the posttest, students were administered the Reading Strategy Questionnaire (RSQ) (Waxman & Padron, 1987), which was adapted from Hahn (1984) and Paris and Myers (1981). The survey administrators read the RSQ items aloud to the students so that reading proficiency would not interfere with the students’ ability to respond to the items.

The RSQ is a 14-item, Likert-type questionnaire on which students indicate the extent to which they use the described strategy by responding either (a) Always, (b) Sometimes, or (c) Never. A mean score of 3 indicates that the student perceived using the strategy all of the time, whereas a score of 1 indicates that the student perceived using the strategy none of the time.

The following seven strategies included on the RSQ have been found to be negatively related to students’ reading achievement: (a) thinking about something else while reading, (b) writing down every word, (c) skipping the parts you don’t understand in the story, (d) reading as fast as you can, (e) saying every word over and over again, (f) looking up words in the dictionary, and (g) saying the main idea over and over (Hahn, 1984; Padron, 1985). The following seven strategies on the RSQ have been found to be positively related to students’ achievement: (a) summarizing in writing, (b) underlining important parts of the story, (c) self-generated questions, (d) checking through the story to see if you remember all of it, (e) asking questions about the parts of the story you don’t understand, (f) taking notes, and (g) imaging or picturing the story in your mind (Hahn, 1984; Padron, 1985).

# RESULTS

Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations on the 14 RSQ items. The results indicate that the most frequently cited strategies were (a) asking questions about the parts of the story you don’t understand, (b) checking through the story to see if you remember all of it, (c) imaging or picturing the story in your mind, and (d) looking up words in the dictionary. The least cited strategies were (a) reading as fast as you can, (b) thinking about something else while reading, (c) writing down every word, and (d) skipping the parts you don’t understand in the story. The mean scores of the strategies are generally low, and most are close to 2, indicating that students reported using these strategies only some of the time. On the other hand, the standard deviations of all the items are quite large, indicating a great deal of variance in the way students responded to each item. This finding reveals that there were large differences in the ways students reported using strategies.

Stepwise multiple regression was used to examine which reading strategies significantly predict $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ students’ posttest achievement, after statistically controlling for students’ pretest achievement (see Table 2). Pretest achievement and the 14 RSQ items were included as the independent variables in the regression analysis. Then variables that were found to predict significantly posttest achievement were extracted from the overall equation in the stepwise procedure and entered in the final regression model. As expected, pretest achievement entered the regression model first and accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in students’ achievement scores $( R ^ { 2 } = . 6 6 , b = ^ { \circ } . 8 0 ^ { \circ } , p < . 0 0 1 )$ .

The strategy of thinking about something else while reading was selected for entry into the regression model next and accounted for an additional $6 \%$ of the variance in the dependent variable $( R ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { c h a n g e } } = . 0 6 $ , $p > . 0 0 1 )$ . The b-weight for this independent variable was negative $\mathbf { \dot { ( } } b = - 3 . 6 2 )$ , indicating that the more students used this strategy, the lower their achievement gain. The final variable that significantly predicted students’ posttest achievement and was entered into the regression model was the strategy of saying the main idea over and over. This variable accounted for an additional $1 \%$ of the variance $( R ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { c h a n g e } } = . 0 1 $ , $p < . 0 5 )$ , and the negative sign of the b-coefficient $( b = - 1 \ . 8 7 )$ also indicates that this strategy had a negative effect on students’ posttest achievement. In other words, the more students reported that they said the main ideas over and over again, the lower their achievement gain.

\*p <.05. o\*p<.001.

The overall regression model accounted for $7 3 \%$ of students’ posttest reading achievement scores, which indicates that a great deal of the total variance in the dependent variable was explained by pretest achievement and the two significant reading strategies. It should also be pointed out that the two reading strategies that were found to be significant negative predictors of posttest reading achievement were also considered to be negative or detrimental reading strategies on the questionnaire.

# DISCUSSION

The results of this study indicate that students’ perceptions of the cognitive strategies they use have predictive validity for their reading comprehension. As expected, two of the negative strategies included on the questionnaire were found to be negatively related to students’ gains in reading comprehension. Thinking about something else while reading obviously hinders students’ concentration and understanding of the story. Similarly, when students say the main idea over and over, they may be spending too much time rehearsing, in an effort to recall what the story is generally about, while ignoring other important aspects of the story.

These findings support previous metacognitive research conducted with monolingual, which has found that lower achieving students use less sophisticated and inappropriate cognitive reading strategies during reading (Brown, Armbruster, & Baker, 1983). The results of the present study suggest that the use of inappropriate cognitive strategies may be an additional reason why Hispanic ESL students generally score lower on reading achievement tests than English monolingual students. That is, the use of negative strategies by Hispanic students may be another factor other than English proficiency that interferes with their reading comprehension and thus negatively affects their reading achievement. Further experimental research needs to be conducted to determine if decreasing the use of negative reading strategies will result in increased achievement by Hispanic ESL students.

The results of this study also lend support to the use of self-report measures to assess students’ cognitive strategy use in reading. Self-report instruments have tremendous advantages over verbal reports of strategy use because they are easy and convenient to administer and do not require students to articulate the strategies that they use. Furthermore, the instrument used in this study can help students develop greater awareness of the strategies they employ during reading (Padron, 1985). This instrument may also be useful for classroom teachers because it provides them with important information on students’ strategy use and thus allows them to adapt instruction to the needs of individual students.

JOHN SWALES University of Michigan

This article reports the results of a diachronic study of the flagship publication of the TESOL organization, the TESOL Quarterly $( T Q )$ . A flagship periodical in any field is worth more than cursory interest because it self-evidently is something more than a passive reflector of contemporary trends and issues. The gatekeeping activities of editors—and of those called upon to serve as reviewers—set standards of scholarly and professional behavior and establish areas of greater concern. Although a major periodical is partly shaped by wider forces in the disciplinary culture, it also shapes that disciplinary culture by the way it goes about its business.

One obvious way of studying the 20-year development of a periodical is to construct a historical account. Here the investigator would largely tell the story of the periodical from within: the circumstances of its founding, its growth and development, its internal crises and key points of transition-and such events set against the wider background of the story of the rise and fall of movements, enthusiasms, and research fronts (see Bowers, 1986). In the pursuit of such a historical narrative, the historian is likely to spend time in interviewing key figures and in examining archival documents and will do so with the laudable and reasonable ambition of relating cause and effect. In particular, the journal historian, like his or her counterparts in the history of knowledge, is likely to give special importance to attribution-wherein the TQ’s pages did a particular concept first surface, and out of who’s head?

As it happens, I have had neither the time nor the right kind of experience to be able to construct such a narrative. My own contacts with TESOL and the $T Q$ are both short-lived and peripheral in comparison with those of many others. On the other hand, I have some familiarity with the procedures of citational analysis (Small, 1982), and Swales (1986) was an attempt to apply qualitative procedures to the English as a second language/English for special purposes controversy surrounding Communicative Syllabus Design (Munby, 1978). The present study is more quantitative; in effect, this means that the approach is archaeological rather than historical, for it examines, by stratified sampling, the surviving textual record. It investigates the pictures on the wall of the cave but has nothing to say as to why or how those artifacts come to be there. Although there is little doubt that editors, publishers, and prophets can all play critical roles, the approach I have adopted may be able to discern certain broader trends, perhaps divorceable from the influence of particular protagonists.

A direct inspiration for the present study was Bazerman’s (1984) analysis of spectroscopic articles in the Physical Review, 1893-1980. Following Bazerman, I examine the textual product in a broadbrush kind of way, even if I do not report for the $\bar { T } Q$ on some of the things that Bazerman investigated, such as syntactic, lexical, and rhetorical changes over time, and even if I have extended Bazerman’s procedures to include authorship characteristics and a comparison of the $T Q$ and its peer periodicals.

# PROCEDURE

This analysis is based on a selection of main articles across the history of the $T Q .$ . All other textual material, such as review articles, reviews, brief reports, and The Forum, has been excluded. The analysis starts with the main articles of Volume 2 (1968) —in the belief that after four issues the TQ would have found its feet—and then includes all the main articles at subsequent 4-year intervals until 1984. I also examined in somewhat more detail the first three issues of 1986 (1986, No. 4, contains an unusual composite on “Alternatives in Second Language Research,” and that issue was therefore excluded). The procedure produced a corpus of 192 main articles, of which the following features were investigated:

1. Authorship characteristics in terms of gender, number, location, and present occupation   
2. Article length and the degree and type of macrostructuring into sections   
3. The use of set-off nonprose material under such headings as Figure No. $X$ or Table No. Y   
4. The number of references per article and per 1,000 words of main text and the types of references cited (books, articles, chapters, etc.)   
5. The provenance of the references in the first three issues of the TQ, 1986   
6. The citational status of the TQ (1977-1985) and its status in comparison with other periodicals (1985 only)

# MAIN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 shows the percentage of single authors or first authors (of two or more) who are female. As the table makes clear, the data show a rise from $2 6 \%$ to $7 0 \%$ in the 18-year period, with a strong increase in this decade. It looks as though before 1980 the majority of single/first authors were men, but since then, the majority have tended to be women. It would be nice to think that the greater representation of women more closely reflects their preponderance in the ESL profession.

Table 2 gives the percentage of articles that are single authored. Single-authored main articles still constitute a majority, but the percentage has moved downward from $9 2 \%$ in the early years to $6 2 \%$ in 1986. The increase in multiple-authored articles is possibly due to a partial shift from a humanities to a social science orientation as witnessed by a rise in quantitative research (Henning, 1986). The actual average number of authors has increased from 1.08 in 1968 to 1.48 in 1986 (Nos. 1-3), but the 1986 average still remains well below the average of around three authors per article commonly reported for the sciences.

<html><body><table><tr><td>1968</td><td>1972</td><td>1976</td><td>1980</td><td>1984</td><td>1986</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>42</td><td>39</td><td>33</td><td>64</td><td>70</td></tr></table></body></html>

An analysis of 19 two-authored articles published in the TQ, 1984- 1986, shows that in all but 2 articles at least one of the authors held a professorial position. The other authors in these 17 professorially authored articles were fairly equally distributed among instructors/ teachers (7), students or ex-students (5), and professors (5). This pattern seems to suggest that diverse individuals perceive an advantage in collaboration, irrespective of a contemporary trend to downgrade co-authored articles in promotion/tenure decisions for professorial appointments in the humanities.

The data for Figure 1, which gives the geographical location of first/single authors, were derived from the biographical notes accompanying articles and refer to the current location as described in those notes. The figure shows the consistent preponderance of North American locations (United States and Canada) and offers little evidence of any diminution of U.S.-located domination of the TQ. Canada is the only other country that gets on the graph at all. Particular country locations outside North America occur only occasionally. According to this sample, there is no country outside North America that has a tradition or track record of having its ESL specialists appear as authors of main articles in the TQ.

1. University faculty (those with professorial posts in U.S. and U. S.- based administrations, or lecturers and professors in U.K. and U.K.-based administrations)   
2. University staff (those with instructor or lecturer positions in U.S. and U.S.-based systems; tutors in U.K. and U.K.-based systems)   
3. University students   
4. School instructors, whether public or private   
5. Professionals, such as inspectors, translators, or testers   
6. Others, such as those retired or working in non-ESL-related areas

The last four categories produced relatively few first/single authors, and as can be seen from Figure 2, the combined percentage for the first two categories has increasingly predominated (from around $7 5 \%$ to around $9 0 \%$ during the 1968-1986 period). The figure also shows for the present decade some fall in faculty authorship and some rise in staff authorship. This trend may be due to increasing opportunities for staff to carry out the major studies that we typically expect of $T Q$ main articles; alternatively, it may reflect the increasing difficulty that PhD holders have been experiencing in obtaining tenure-track positions.

Overall, the authorship data suggest that a clear majority of $T Q$ main articles have, throughout the periodical’s history, been written by university-based North Americans. The $T Q$ never was a journal written by teachers for teachers. In addition, there is evidence of a strong continuing trend toward female authorship and a weaker trend toward multiple authorship.

Table 3 provides data on the average length of the main articles during the 1968-1986 period. The figures are for the average length of the main text and exclude abstracts, tables, references, and appendixes. If we leave aside the 1968 average, there has apparently not been such a strong trend toward increasing length of main text as I suspect many readers of the $T Q$ would have anticipated. There has, however, been some standardization: For example, the 1972 peak is partly accounted for by the existence of two very long articles (around 12,000 words). Certainly, the later articles look longer because of the increasing numbers of tables, references, and appendixes, but if length is defined in terms of the main prose text, current averages are still under 6,000 words.

During the life of the $T Q$ there have been greater changes in sectioning and in the use of set-off nonprose material. The unsectioned main article was originally the norm $( 8 0 \% )$ but declined sharply and by 1984 had disappeared. Since 1972, sectioned articles have had a fairly steady average of about four top-level sections (as currently represented by large capitals). The percentage of articles without titled tables or figures has also declined (from $80 \%$ to $3 0 \%$ ), and the average number of such items per article has steadily risen from under 1 to about 2.5. Numerical tables have consistently provided the majority of the set-off items; thus, the $T Q$ has not evidenced the trend toward graphs that Bazerman (1984) noted for the Physical Review.

During the TQ’s existence there have been interesting developments in reference patterns. First, unreferenced main articles were always infrequent (a maximum of $2 4 \%$ in 1968) and have now disappeared. Concomitantly, there has been strong growth in the average number of references per main article, from 4 in 1968 to 34 in 1986 (see Table 4). A plateau can be seen in the 1972-1980 period, largely brought about by variability in citation practice. For example, of the 28 main articles published in 1976, half contained 10 or fewer references, 5 had between 11 and 20, 3 between 21 and 30, 5 between 31 and 50, and 1 with more than 50 references. Thus, in 1976, almost a quarter of the articles were highly referenced—if we accept that 30 or more references constitute a high degree of referencing. The main change that had occurred by 1984 was the virtual disappearance of main articles with 10 or fewer references, rather than an increase in references at the upper end of the scale.

Because articles vary in length, a somewhat more adequate indication of the upward trend can be achieved by examining the number of references per 1,000 words of main text. Table 5 shows a steep—and accelerating—rise from 1.6 to 7.0 references per 1,000 words.

TABLE 5 References per 1,000 Words of Main Article

References in the corpus were classified according to the following categories: (a) scholarly or teacher reference books, (b) textbooks (for ESL students or others), (c) chapters in edited books, (d) articles in journals and presentations, (e) technical reports and monographs, (f) dissertations and theses, (g) tests, (h) audiovisual materials such as tapes or films, (i) reviews, (j) literary works, and (k) others. Only the first four categories were prominent. Figure 3 shows a slow decline in the percentage of references that are made to scholarly or teacher reference books and the virtual elimination of references to textbooks. This latter trend would seem to suggest that $T Q$ main authors no longer consider ESL textbooks as primary sources of information or authority.

FIGURE 3 Types of Reference to Longer Works

In contrast there has been a rise (see Figure 4) in the proportion of references made to short scholarly or research pieces as typically represented by articles and chapters. Indeed, the combined percentages for Categories c and d have increased from $3 0 \%$ to about $6 5 \%$ over the 1968-1986 period.

I also examined in some detail the main classes of references in the main articles in the first three issues of 1986: references to journal articles and references to scholarly/teacher reference books or to chapters therein. In both cases I venture to suggest that the findings are not without interest.

In the 1986 corpus as described, there are 290 references to journal articles. These 290 references are spread around a remarkable total of 96 different journals, which represents a very low token-type ratio of 3:1. This wide spread may reflect either a vibrant interdisciplinary eclecticism or the existence of isolated authorial subgroups.

Two journals tower above the others: the $T Q$ with 53 references (the high self-citation rate in the $T Q$ is taken up later) and Language

![](img/9afec48146aedf9a7235affad63f995bd5e19fcde508a6419606cea248042670.jpg)  
FIGURE 4 Types of Reference to Shorter Works

Learning with 43. The remaining $6 7 \%$ of the 290 references are distributed among 94 journals. The leaders of the pack, as well as a crude approximation of the constituencies they principally serve, are presented below, in order of journals cited most frequently (after the $T Q$ and Language Learning):

Modern Language Journal— foreign language teaching   
International Review of Applied Linguistics— applied linguistics   
College Composition and Communication— Ll writing   
English Language Teaching Journal– E S L   
System– ESL   
Language— linguistics

There then follows a group of periodicals concerned with educational research, educational psychology, and psychology.

Thus far we have apparently seen a predominance of citations to journals that are concerned in varying proportions with language learning. One would then expect that each of the areas represented by these journals would have a large number of citations. However, if we examine the total list of journals (minus 11 that contain 12 references and fall into the category of miscellaneous), this expectation is not borne out. Indeed, the broader picture of which journals $T Q$ authors in the sample cite shifts quite dramatically— even assuming that I may have sometimes erred in placing a particular journal within a particular specialty. In the area of linguistics there is a total of 9 references (5 journals); in foreign language teaching, 23 references (6 journals); in English as an Ll, 26 references (12 journals); and in applied linguistics, 20 references (6 journals). Citationally, in 1986 the TQ’s strongest links appear to be with educational and psychological research, for which there are 77 references (44 journals).

However, the most interesting finding relates to ESL journals themselves—at first sight “natural” sources of references for articles submitted to the TQ. There are, in fact, but 10 ESL journals cited and a low total of 27 references (very similar figures for English as a first language). How can we account for the phenomenon that the authors in the sample find little citable in ESL journals other than the $T Q$ itself (and Language Learning in so far as it is concerned with ESL)?

The most plausible answer seems to be that the $T Q$ is considered largely self-sufficient as a source of appropriate and relevant ESL journal citations, and indeed the high $\bar { T } Q$ self-citation rate would support such a speculation. Of course, this is not to imply that the 1986 authors consider the $T Q$ as a self-sufficient source of ESL citations in general because considerable reference is made to ESL scholarly and teacher reference books (both edited and authored). What it does suggest is that there is no strong interest in incorporating findings from ESL journals that in some sense represent other regions of the world, findings from the JALT Journal and the RELC Journal for Asia, from System for continental Europe, from the English Language Teaching Journal for Britain and the Commonwealth, or from TESL Canada.

I also investigated the country of publication of books cited. There were 240 such books, of which 181 were published in the United States $( 7 5 \% )$ and 59 $( 2 5 \% )$ elsewhere, mostly Britain (39) followed by Canada (8). There were only three outside North America/Western Europe (Egypt, 2; Singapore, 1). Most striking is the low visibility of publishers in Western Europe, especially in Holland, where we know that several publishing houses are active in linguistics and allied fields.

So far I have concentrated on the TQ’s internal practices. I would now like to consider its role in the wider world. What is the TQ’s record as a cited journal? For this we can look for enlightenment to the final and seventh volume of the annual Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The figures for the 1977-1985 years, which are (as is customary in the SSCl) based on all citations, not just those found in main articles, are presented in Table 6. For example, the SSCI survey found 55 citations to the $T Q$ in 1977, 16 of which were made in 1977 to previous articles in the TQ by $T Q$ authors and 39 of which were made in 1977 by authors of articles published in other journals.

TABLE 6 S.SCl Citations of the TQ ( 1977-1985 )   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Year</td><td>Total</td><td>Citations of the TQ in the TQ</td><td>Citations of the TQ in other journals</td></tr><tr><td>1977</td><td>55</td><td>16</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>1978</td><td>88</td><td>40</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>1979</td><td>123</td><td>56</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>1980</td><td>101</td><td>26</td><td>75.</td></tr><tr><td>1981</td><td>148</td><td>54</td><td>94.</td></tr><tr><td>1982</td><td>131</td><td>38</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>1983</td><td>196</td><td>83</td><td>113</td></tr><tr><td>1984</td><td>227</td><td>91</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>1985</td><td>242</td><td>126</td><td>116</td></tr></table></body></html>

The previous section has illustrated that references in the TQ have been steadily increasing; according to the SSCl count of all references, these climbed from 451 in 1977 to 1,119 in 1985 (with a big jump between 1982 and 1983). This represents an increase of almost $1 5 0 \%$ , whereas total citations to the $\bar { T } Q$ have increased from 55 to 242, an increase of just under $3 5 0 \%$ . It therefore looks as though the $T Q$ is becoming a more influential periodical in absolute terms (i.e., in terms of increasing citations) as well as in relative terms (i.e., the growth in citations to the $T Q$ is increasing faster than the growth in the $T Q )$ . However, such a straightforward account cannot be sustained if we consider the figures in the last two columns in Table 6.

Clearly, references to the $T Q$ within the $T Q$ have been growing faster than references to the $T Q$ in other journals: The percentage increase for the former is almost $7 0 0 \%$ , whereas for the latter it is almost $2 0 0 \%$ . It therefore appears that the citational success of the $T Q$ is at least partly due to its own self-perpetuating tradition rather than being simply ascribable to the periodical’s increasing significance for the authors who publish in a broader coterie of periodicals.

Indeed, we can see some confirmation of this when we compare the $1 9 8 5 T Q$ figures with those for a number of comparable journals. (The ${ \mathsf { T } } Q \cdot$ relevant fields are comparatively small. A powerful and prestigious journal like Language collected over 700 citations in 1985, and a giant in a giant field, The American Economic Review, stacked up more than 5,000 citations to itself.) Table 7 shows that the $T Q$ belongs in the peer-group “big four” as far as total 1985 citations are concerned. However, if we examine citations to the $T Q$ that are not self-citations, it can be seen that the $T Q$ evinces the greatest place drop of all 10 journals—from third to sixth. It may be, of course, that the 1985 figures will turn out to be anomalous when data for 1986 are available. Certainly, a possible contributing factor to the TQ’s high self-citation rate is the encouragement of interactive commentary such as Forum-type replies and responses, which are bound to increase journal selfcitation.

# EVALUATION

Finally, is there, in the light of this rather odd study, cause for celebration after 20 years and 80 issues? I will look at this by trying to answer four questions.

1. Is the $T Q$ a major journal? In terms of peers in the applied language arts and sciences, the answer is yes, even if the affirmative is qualified by the abnormally high self-citation rate. 2. Is the $T Q$ a journal of research and scholarship? The answer is clearly yes (see Gaies, 1987, for an interesting discussion of the research “issue”).

3. Is the $T Q$ an international journal? Given the fact that ESL is a major global activity, the answer is no, at least in any geographic sense of international.   
4. Does the $T Q$ represent the profession? In terms of demonstrating to a wider world that ESL is too serious a business to be left to native-speaker amateurs, the answer is yes.

Certainly the rather dry facts that I have presented attest to growth and development in all kinds of ways (except for international aspects). Of course, as I mentioned at the outset, these facts are limited to textual, biographical, and citational features. A more complete study of the first 20 years of the TESOL Quarterly would also involve at least an analysis of its content, but that requires investigators with a greater courage in their categorical convictions.1

# English Language Proficiency and Academic Performance of Undergraduate International Students

PATRICIA JOHNSON University of Wisconsin-Green Bay

The study on English proficiency and academic performance of graduate international students at the State University of New York at Albany (SUNYA) reported in Richard Light, Ming Xu, and Jonathan Mossop’s recent article in the TESOL Quarterly (Vol. 21, No. 2, June 1987) is very interesting in its comprehensiveness and the nature of its findings. Readers may be interested in comparing a similar study that we recently undertook with undergraduates. This more limited study yielded results remarkably similar to those of Light, Xu, and Mossop; however, our interpretation of the data was different because of the lower language proficiency of the undergraduate students.

Our examination of the relationship between language proficiency and academic success of undergraduate international students was part of a self-study, following TESOL guidelines, of the nonintensive, developmental ESL courses and international student services at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay (UWGB). We were interested in the consistency of the relationship between the minimum TOEFL score of 500, required for undergraduate admission, and academic success, as measured by grade point average (GPA).

Unlike the SUNYA study, which included only first-semester graduate students, our study included all international students $\mathsf { \bar { ( } } N = 1 9 6 \mathsf { ) }$ enrolled as undergraduates at UWGB during the spring 1986 semester. Transcripts and records in the office of International Student Services provided TOEFL scores and GPAs, as well as information on course load, number of credits earned, nationality, and academic major. In addition, we conducted case studies of ESL students at the lower end of the language proficiency range and in their first semester of undergraduate study.

The mean TOEFL score for undergraduates admitted to UWGB was 537 $\left( S D = 5 1 \right.$ ), which was much higher than the mean score of the TOEFL reference group $( M = 5 \mathbf { \breve { 0 6 } }$ , $S D = 6 6 $ ) for students applying for admission to undergraduate school (Educational Testing Service, 1985). A similar difference in mean TOEFL scores was found between graduate students at SUNYA and applicants for graduate school in general. Both of these differences can be explained by the fact that $4 8 \%$ of undergraduate schools require a minimum score of 525-550 for admission, and $4 9 \%$ of graduate schools require a score in the 540-570 range (Educational Testing Service, 1985). As for academic achievement, the mean GPA of 3.00 $( S D = 0 . 6 4 )$ ) for international undergraduates was slightly above the mean GPA of 2.80 (SD n.a. ) for all undergraduates at UWGB.

Although such results are institution-specific, descriptive statistics for TOEFL and GPA, by academic major and language background, indicate that undergraduates at UWGB with TOEFL scores below 500 tended to have lower GPAs than those with TOEFL scores of 500 and above. However, there were exceptions to this general tendency, as was also the case for graduate students at SUNYA. UWGB undergraduates in business administration $( n = 7 6 )$ had a relatively high mean TOEFL score (541), yet their mean CPA (3.02) was lower than that for most other majors and very close to the mean GPA (3.00) for all international undergraduates. Japanese students $\left( n = 1 2 \right)$ had a low mean TOEFL score (490), yet their mean GPA (3.02) was very close to that (3.06) of the Malaysian students $( n = 9 4 )$ ), who had a high mean TOEFL score (553).

The overall mean TOEFL score of 537 for undergraduates correlated significantly with the mean GPA of 3.00 $\left( r = ~ . 3 6 \right.$ , $p < . 0 1 )$ . This moderately low correlation is higher than the one between TOEFL and GPA for graduate students in the SUNYA study. Furthermore, students $\textcircled { n } = \textcircled { 6 8 } )$ with TOEFL scores below 500 earned significantly lower grades $( z = - 3 . 7 7$ , $p < . 0 1 )$ than students $( n = 1 2 8 )$ with TOEFL scores of 500 and above. This result is in contrast to the SUNYA study, in which graduate students with TOEFL scores below 550 did not earn significantly lower grades than students with TOEFL scores above 550, the accepted level of language proficiency for graduate study at SUNYA. These differences in results for graduate and undergraduate students seem to indicate that the lower the language proficiency, the more important the role it plays in academic success.

According to the guidelines for interpretation of TOEFL scores (Educational Testing Service, 1985), there may be no relationship between TOEFL scores and academic performance when the minimum TOEFL score required for admission is relatively high, such that only those students with a high level of language proficiency are admitted, as at SUNYA. With higher language proficiency, prior exposure to subject matter, motivation, academic aptitude/experience, development of study skills, cultural adaptability, or financial security may become more important factors. In an institution in which the minimum TOEFL score required for admission is low, TOEFL scores may correlate strongly with academic performance, and nonnative speakers of English may be unsuccessful because of an inadequate command of English. Thus, in institutions like UWGB, in which the standard for admission is neither high nor low, the correlation between TOEFL scores and subsequent academic success may be moderately low.

GPA also correlated significantly with two TOEFL subscores— Structure and Written Expression $( r = . 4 3 , p < . 0 1 )$ and Vocabulary and Reading Comprehension $( r = . 3 6$ , $p < . 0 1$ )—but not with the subscore for Listening Comprehension. Similar results for graduates at SUNYA suggest that the listening skill does not play as important a role in academic success, in either graduate or undergraduate study, as might have been thought. However, this lack of correlation may also result from the fact that the Listening Comprehension subtest of the TOEFL is dependent on the skill of being able to recognize phonetic aspects of spoken academic language and thus may not reflect language proficiency. The significant correlations of the other two substests could be a result of both tests depending on reading comprehension, thus reflecting language proficiency and also a skill important for academic success.

Investigation of the relationship between language proficiency and undergraduate credit hours earned indicated a significant correlation $( r = . 8 0 , p < . 0 1 )$ , as was also the case for graduate students at SUNYA. However, because the number of credit hours earned and the amount of time in undergraduate school varied among our subjects, we selected for case studies 27 students at the lower end of the TOEFL range (450-525) who were enrolled in their first semester of undergraduate study. This selection of students was also based on the fact that students with lower TOEFL scores have a greater probable gain in language proficiency over a fixed period of time (Educational Testing Service, 1985).

We calculated by hand GPAs in courses in which these students were competing with native English speakers, omitting ESL courses. After consulting with instructors, we divided the courses into two categories: Type A courses were heavy in outside reading and/or writing assignments, depended heavily on lecture comprehension, or were offered at an advanced academic level (e.g., humanities, communication and the arts, biological and social sciences), whereas Type B courses included mathematics, laboratory/demonstration courses in science, or introductory courses that did not make heavy demands on reading and writing.

Students were divided into two subgroups: those $( n = 1 0 )$ ) who scored below 500 on the TOEFL, the accepted level for admission to UWGB, and those $( n = ~ 1 7 )$ ) who scored from 500-525 on the TOEFL. The difference between means for the two types of courses was greater for the students of lower language proficiency than for the students of higher language proficiency. For the 10 students of lower language proficiency, GPAs were lower in Type A courses $( M = 1 . 6 3 )$ than in Type B courses $\left( M = \ 3 . 2 9 \right)$ ). These students were taking a lighter course load than was normal for undergraduates—12 credits (4 courses), including 6 credits in ESL to improve reading and writing skills. In addition, these students had been carefully guided in course selection and did not drop any courses before the end of the semester.

For the 17 students admitted with TOEFL scores in the 500-525 range, the mean GPA was also lower in Type A courses $( M = 2 . 2 6 )$ than in Type B courses $( M = 3 . 0 4 )$ ). These students, who had more freedom of choice in selecting courses, were taking the normal course load of 15 credits (5 courses), including 3 credits in ESL to meet the undergraduate requirement in expository writing. However, these students tended to lighten class loads by dropping courses or taking “incomplete,” with a possible effect on overall academic performance.

These results seem to indicate that these students at the lower end of the TOEFL range (450-525) performed sufficiently; especially in courses that did not require a high level of English language proficiency, their performance was very solid. Similarly, in the SUNYA study, academic performance in courses requiring fewer verbal skills (i.e., science/mathematics/business) was also much better than in courses requiring a higher level of verbal skills (i.e., humanities/fine arts/social sciences).

The 10 students admitted on academic criteria other than language proficiency as indicated by TOEFL score seemed satisfied with their grades and course work. As these students were primarily in large introductory courses, their instructors tended to report only their grades and whether or not the students had requested help. However, the following comments, made by an instructor in a computing course requiring a high level of verbal ability, indicate the frustration of both students and instructors when language proficiency is inadequate for academic success:

Both of these students are in my COBOL class. I am giving them $D s$ rather than the Fs they have earned because of the unusual amount of determination and effort displayed. They have had enormous difficulty asking questions even in the “relaxed” setting of my office or the student workroom. My assistant and I spent several hours tutoring them on the first evening of class. It was immediately obvious that their skills in English were insufficient to allow them to complete the elementary selfpaced familiarization exercise required for that evening. Numerous incidents of academic dishonesty involving these students have occurred during the semester. They have obviously not been well rewarded for the time, money, and effort they have invested in my class. I would imagine that they have also endured a significant amount of emotional stress, resentment, and frustration.

In conclusion, when English proficiency is relatively low, TOEFL scores can predict academic performance. Even though basic academic requirements for admission must be met, sufficient language proficiency to undertake the academic program at the institution should be given foremost consideration.1
