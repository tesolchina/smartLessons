# Abstract

The EAP debates of the 1990s have challenged TESOL practitioners in postgraduate research contexts to reconsider the assumptions underpinning their teaching. As coordinator of an Integrated Bridging Program for international research students in a conventional Australian university, I have primarily seen my role as investigating the contextual expectations, as well as the text features, of the target research genres required in my teaching. In pursuing the first of these goals, I surveyed faculty research supervisors, asking them to prioritise the particular features they expected to see in a successful ‘research proposal’, as this is the compulsory assessment task for each research student’s initial probationary period. I also invited them to add personal written comments about their priorities. I then interviewed seven experienced supervisors representing all University faculties about the same issues. The results demonstrated an overwhelming concurrence of criteria for success in the research proposal across the University. Perhaps even more significantly, however, supervisors’ personal responses presented in writing and in interview suggested a recurring reading of the proposal not in terms of document features but in terms of the student who wrote it, constructed either as the discoursally instantiated writer/persona, or even as the embodied student as subject. For me, the implications of such assessment practices provoke a reconsideration of genreoriented pedagogy and strongly support a critical rather than a purely pragmatic EAP in research contexts.

# 1. Introduction

As an English language lecturer responsible for teaching the genres of research to international research students in a traditional, research-centred Australian university, I have followed the debates of the 1990s in English for Academic Purposes with great interest. For me, and I know for others in similar positions, Sarah Benesch (1993, 1996) and Alastair Pennycook (1989, 1994a, 1994b) tapped into an unease we were beginning to feel about our own practices as we made more and more pragmatic attempts to understand the target genres and to ‘improve’ our pedagogies for teaching them, without seriously considering, much less addressing, the inequities they might reproduce. Desmond Allison (1994, 1996), a self-confessed ‘pragmatically-inclined EAP practitioner’ (1994, p. 618), then brought our dilemmas to the fore. We felt he spoke for many of us (indeed to my mind still does represent the views of a majority of EAP practitioners in Australian contexts)1 when he argued that ‘. . .’’pragmatic’’ approaches [are] sensitive to contexts of discourse and of action’ (1996, p. 87) and they ‘can be adopted in pursuit of quite diverse educational and ideological goals, some of which will promote change’ (1996, p. 86).

In his response to this perspective, Pennycook (1997) illuminated the difference between a ‘vulgar’ and a ‘critical’ pragmatism. With Cherryholmes he defined vulgar pragmatism as ‘socially reproductive, instrumentally and functionally reproducing accepted meanings and conventional organisations’ (Cherryholmes, 1988, p. 151 cited in Pennycook, 1997, p. 256). With this argument, Pennycook strongly reinforced his own position and I was freshly challenged: ‘the pragmatism of EAP, to the extent that it is almost always a vulgar rather than a critical pragmatism, is indeed likely to ‘‘reinforce the status quo in academia and society’’’ (p. 256). To this Allison (1998) responded again, to clarify his own stance and to argue that

an ethically responsible EAP position could still find considerable room for a notion of ‘‘functional efficiency’’ that was premised on a reflective and provisional ‘‘acceptance of explicit and implicit standards, conventions, rules and discourse practices’’, in pursuit of purposes that people decided, after reflection and consultation, were deserving of their immediate efforts. (p. 313 author’s italics).

This call for a ‘functional’ yet situated EAP, predicated on reflection and consultation, is seductively attractive to those of us ‘people’ who, in addition to our personal sense of responsibility, are responding to increasingly local, political and commercial pressures. Meanwhile, however, the EAP debates are also informing us with much more global concerns in TESOL. The impacts of the spread of English as an international language have been made extremely relevant to our ‘immediate efforts’ (Canagarajah, 1998; Master, 1998; Pennycook, 1994c; Phillipson, 1992); the 1999 special edition of TESOL Quarterly ‘is about imagining and bringing into being new schemas of politicisation’ (Pennycook, 1999, p. 335) as well as giving practical examples of critical approaches representing ‘diversity and passion’ (p. 325); the recent work of Benesch (1999, 2001) coins the somewhat confronting term ‘rights analysis’, forcefully demanding that we adopt a ‘critical EAP’ through which we can offer students opportunities to question power relations and the status quo in academic settings, as they impact upon them, in order to develop agency in their own learning.

Positioned as we are then, decision-makers in our own EAP contexts, we are caught in this complex web of reticular priorities. But, as Canagarajah (1993) pointed out, such broadly theoretical arguments continue to need classroom situated exploration. Indeed, at whatever point we enter the discussion, there are recurring calls for contextualised research (Allison, 1996; Benesch, 2001; Pennycook, 1997). Each of us is encouraged to explore these crucial issues in relation to the specific institutional demands upon us and our students, and in particular to requestion the political as well as educational realities which we experience in the detail of our own learning and teaching commitments.

# 2. Genre pedagogy in the Integrated Bridging Program (IBP)

My own situated practice is as Coordinator of an Integrated Bridging Program (IBP) for international research students in an Australian University. This is a taskbased, semester-long program with a historical foundation in genre theory, built upon discipline differences in academic oral and written languages (see Cargill, Cadman, & McGowan, 2001). The overarching task for students is the writing and oral presentation of a ‘research proposal’. This proposal is written for the student’s department and forms the basis of the University’s assessment requirement for these students in their initial, probationary period of candidature.

Genre theory stresses the relationship between text and context as the precondition for, and integral to, the teaching of text structure (Bhatia, 1993; Christie, 1987; Freedman, 1994; Luke, 1994; Martin, 1999; Swales, 1990). The genre teaching ‘cycle’ originally developed for the Disadvantaged Schools Program in New South Wales by LERN (Literacy Education Research Network, 1990) has been adapted specifically for postgraduate writing (Clerehan & Moodie, 1997, p. 78), and the IBP team has critiqued this and other approaches [particularly that initiated by Halliday & Hasan (1985) as well as those of Swales & Feak (1994) and Weissberg & Buker (1990)] to develop authentic teaching materials and targeted teaching practices.

Thus, in teaching the research proposal to international postgraduates, my own explorations were initially focussed in two ways: first, on current, socially situated understandings of this text and its purposes within my own university, and second, on the linguistic and rhetorical features of research proposals as genres in this context. In this paper I should like to discuss my investigations of the first of these aspects, the context of situation, and consider some of the implications of my findings.

# 3. Context of situation

The Australian university research context in which I work is changing quite dramatically in three identifiable ways: politically, educationally and socially. First, new Government funding regulations now provide a research funding quantum based on research degree completion rather than on enrolment. Thus, pressure to complete the research project at all costs (to secure funding) has greatly increased, along with concretised performance hurdles for staff and students and the cementing of largely unarticulated departmental value systems.

Educational changes are clearly linked with these institutional moves. There are new emphases on ‘research training’ (Kemp, 1999) and ‘research education’ in terms of focussed instruction, large-scale scaffolded induction programs and ‘flexible delivery’ through information technology. Simultaneously, the university’s research profile is changing culturally and socially as international commercialisation of research programs in English has markedly increased the numbers of non native English speaking research students in Western universities (Ryan & Zuber-Skerritt, 1999, p. 5) .

In this high pressure environment, the research proposal has a distinct, and pivotal, role in the University’s institutional assessment procedures as well as in the academic learning process.

# 3.1. Institutional role

The research proposal’s formal role in the institution is immediately made clear to each newly enrolled research student at a postgraduate student induction. Every student is handed a booklet entitled Code of Practice for Maintaining and Monitoring Academic Quality and Standards in Higher Degrees (Adelaide University, 2000), and its contents are explained. The points relating to the research proposal are expressed as follows:

# [Point 1]

Each student commencing a PhD must complete a Structured Program (SP) of activities within the first twelve months of candidature. . . The program should include the completion and presentation (normally) of a research proposal. . . (Appendix A1, my italics)

# [Point 2]

2.2.3 The Research Proposal

In preparing the research proposal, there are several areas to which a student should pay particular attention:

Intellectual Property. . .   
Authorship   
Ethical Clearance   
Financial Implications. .   
Availability of and Access to Data/Materials. . . (pp. 8–9)

[Point 3] 2.2.4 Confirmation of Candidature The satisfactory completion of the Structured Program, the approval of the research proposal by the department or school, and the submission of a copy of the proposal to the Manager, Administrative Services, confirm the student’s candidature. In some faculties, the proposals require approval by the faculty Higher Degrees Committee (pp. 9–11, my italics).

From these points it is clear that the research proposal has particular purpose as an institutional document: it is a gatekeeping assessment tool used to confirm or deny the student’s entry from a first or probationary phase, into a second phase of candidature. It is required to be completed and presented within the prescribed period2 and ‘satisfactory completion’ is determined by the department or school, in some cases also by the faculty Higher Degrees Committee. Beyond that, the guidance provided in Point 2 focuses only on issues which might arise in relation to the institution’s perceived responsibility to provide or monitor facilities and outcomes.

It is noteworthy that at this institutional level, the university does not make any attempt to suggest criteria by which the research proposal may be considered to be ‘satisfactory’, nor to indicate any preferred format or process for its presentation.

# 3.2. Academic roles

In practice, this administrative function of the research proposal is quite distinct from the academic roles given to it by the supervising academics who guide students through the process of writing. Research students in this institution have historically usually had one or two academic supervisors and, as a mandatory first step in the Integrated Bridging Program, IBP lecturers conduct interviews with all new students’ supervisors, aiming to elicit their views on their student’s first semester of candidature, including the writing of the research proposal. From these routine interviews we have identified a very wide range of departmental purposes which the research proposal fulfils for faculty supervisors. This range can be represented by the following comments3 . For one supervisor the proposal clearly has administrative rather than academic importance: ‘‘the research proposal is somewhat of an administrative requirement that should (rather than must) be in line with their expected goals’’. Others have emphasised its function as providing a structure for research education, either as a teaching aid: ‘‘the research proposal would initiate students into the research culture but would not necessarily set them on a clear path. . . I therefore tend to emphasise the development of research skills through writing up a proposal’’; or as providing a descriptive account of a student’s work to date: ‘‘a ‘work in progress’ by a relatively inexperienced research worker. . .

Rather than focus on the educational function in this way, some supervisors have emphasised the pragmatic value of the research proposal by indicating how its content may be later reused in other documents which will be crucial to the students success, as in ‘‘The proposal will eventually contribute to their thesis’’, or by pointing out that it contains ‘‘some of the elements of grant proposal writing’’. In stark contrast, one supervisor stressed only the affective value of writing the proposal: ‘‘research proposals are therapeutic but that is all’’.

Such a variation in views (and thus, presumably, in supervision practices and assessment of student performance) raises the following questions which informed my investigation:

1. What are believed to be the predominant academic purposes of the research proposal text in this context?   
2. Is this genre believed by its assessors to possess any identifiable generic features which could be said to be obligatory elements within it?   
3. What is the role of the writing teacher of research students at the current nexus of political, educational and social action?

These questions only offer perspectives on the context of situation relating to the research proposal as a definable genre, rather than on the text itself. They nevertheless have the potential to be extremely revealing, particularly in relation to our teaching of this genre to those students who are new to the specific academic discourse communities which they are hoping to join.

# 4. Aims and methods of the investigation

As a first step, I designed a simple survey of all participating IBP supervisors over the previous 3 years (1998, 1999 and 2000). My aim was to ask these supervisors to prioritise particular features which they expected to see in a research proposal in their field, across a grid describing seven levels of importance from ‘extremely’ to ‘not at all’. There was also the possibility to add, if they wished, qualitative personal comments relating to other criteria on which they assessed the success of a proposal. Using understandings collected from supervisor interviews by IBP lecturers over the same period, I constructed the items in the survey to represent the recurring, fairly widely acknowledged features which we had previously identified as key expectations of a proposal in this academic context, in terms of its content and purpose.

As a second step, I conducted interviews with seven experienced supervisors representing all faculties across the University to gain their views on what they saw as criteria for successful research proposals. The interviews were semi-structured and addressed specific prompts in recent administrative documents emphasising the gatekeeping function of the proposal, as well as, where appropriate, eliciting comments on the reasons why the supervisor had recommended specific proposals as successful. Dialogues were then generated which followed interviewees’ own interests but specifically in relation to criteria for a successful research proposal.

# 5. Results and discussion

# 5.1. Quantitative

The quantitative results of the survey may be usefully expressed in two ways. First, the bar graphs in Fig. 1 show the full range of responses across the levels of importance accorded to each item. It is immediately apparent from these graphs that very few respondents used the full range of options relating to levels of importance for any of the of the selected items; indeed the results show that a majority of respondents $( n = 7 2 )$ used only options 7–4 which indicated a positive level of importance for all items. Items 1–7 especially, which identify features representing perceived academic processes, demonstrate that most respondents rated all these items as ‘extremely important’. Item 9 specifying the ‘feasibility of the project’ also reflects the same trend.

Table 1 shows the number of responses marking 7 and 6, the two highest levels of importance, for each item by percentage. From this table it is clear that almost $60 \%$ or more of respondents rated the same eight academic features and/or purposes (see Table 1) as ‘extremely important’ to the success of a research proposal. These centre on the document’s reflection of a logically defined, feasible project expressed as research questions and/or objectives, as well as wide and critical reading which serves to justify the project, identification of contemporary issues in the field, and appropriate methodology or methods for fulfilling the research goals. It is interesting to note that, despite rising panics about government funding tied to completion, these supervisors at the end of 2000 did not include ‘ability to complete within the time frame’ in this highly prioritised group. Nor, as supervisors of international students, did they stress the importance of accurate English expression. What is most striking from this general overview of quantitative results from all faculties across the university, is the overwhelming concurrence of the same prioritised features regarded as ‘extremely important’. In this research institution there seems to be an edifice of shared features and values for the research proposal. Significantly the features which are so valued are required to be in evidence by the end of the probationary period of a research student’s candidature (shortly to be reduced, see footnote 2), in seemingly unproblematised though not in any way linguistically explicit purposes and forms.

# 5.2. Qualitative

The majority of the survey respondents chose to add qualitative notes in response to the following prompt which I had placed after the grid: ‘‘Please would you add further comment below, indicating features you personally prioritise most highly in judging a proposal.’’ The resulting comments offer highly significant insights into how supervisors across the university assess the novice researcher’s performance in the research proposal. I should like to discuss these comments in three groups which represent a continuum of ‘readings’ of the proposal by its assessors.

# 1. Mention of project or text characteristics

One group of responses shows that some supervisors look primarily for specific project or text characteristics in the research proposal (as directly prompted by the survey question). It is notable that in this group there was almost total concurrence with the items previously given in the survey. Examples are:

research questions/objectives (‘‘concise, focussed research question the most   
important feature. . . as it acts as a road map for the rest of the proposal’’)   
locating the project in current literature (‘‘clear relationship of research quest   
to rest of literature’’)   
logic (‘‘clarity and logic of thought in the development of an argument’’)   
critical approach (‘‘key texts. . .should be dealt with thoughtfully and critically   
in relation to the student’s own research questions’’)   
English language expression (‘‘proficiency in English is an on-going part of the   
whole training so is not critical in the beginning’’)   
method/methodology (‘‘depth in the detailed methodology to be used’’)   
practical items (‘‘The key things are: will it work, can it be done (on time), will   
it be of use, what will it cost, who will pay’’)

Only five respondents in this group mentioned anything which was not in one of the given categories and in each case their priorities were interestingly idiosyncratic to their own disciplines (e.g. ‘‘modular (not monolithic)—i.e. made of sub-hypotheses and proposals so that if one effort fails something can be restored’’ or, a particularly nice one, ‘‘I need to be assured that the project can proceed with minimum disruption to the breeding program. . .’’).

These results again suggest that, where research supervisors chose to express their expectations of a research proposal in terms of project information or text content, they held a common respect for very similar and restricted features. This finding was strongly supported in the follow-up interviews with experienced supervisors. None of the interviewees mentioned less than three of the items highly prioritised in survey responses, and they all echoed the importance of ‘appropriate’ (‘‘doable’’, ‘‘suitable’’, ‘‘good’’, ‘‘clear’’) research questions and/or objectives. An interesting emphasis which emerged in interview with respect to these features was on the importance of the relationship between them:

The strength of this proposal lies in the clarity of the way in which the research question is built up. . . This is especially evident in the relationship between the question, the research objectives and the methodological steps which he ties back very tightly to the objectives. (Int 1)

The proposal is very clearly and logically put together with a strong logical connection between the objectives set up at the beginning, the literature that’s covered under the relevant topics, and the hypotheses which are set up to be tested by the data collected. (Int 2)

In our field the choice of methodologies is widening so now I think the most important thing is to see a good question which relates directly to the approach which will be used to answer it. . . For me it’s really important that the student reads widely in the literature which is appropriate to the approach that they want to follow, knowing the key names and issues in that methodological paradigm. (Int 5)

A good research question- this is vital here because in this discipline there are so many approaches you can take, and if you don’t have a clear question you don’t have a methodology. (Int 6)

Perhaps the ‘logic’ and ‘feasibility’ of a research project, which were so highly respected in the quantitative survey, may be better understood in terms of these key intratextual connections.

2. Unmarked conflation of the text, the writer as ‘persona’ and the human/social subject

A second group of responses may be identified which begins to increase the complexity of expectations of the research proposal. Many respondents replied to the directed question, not in terms of project assessment or text features, but in terms of their reading of the ‘persona’ of the writer as constructed in the proposal. Thus, even where they wished to emphasise one of the items previously mentioned in the survey, these respondents unreflectively expressed this priority in terms of the writer, or as a capacity of the student. Simple examples may be seen in

the student must be able to show where his/her project sits within the broad picture of the subject and discipline; the student should be well aware of current and past research; and the student should be able to propose methods for tackling the problem

This way of talking about the research proposal document (without any prompt to do so by the question asked) foregrounds what has been called the ‘‘textually instantiated ‘I’’’ (Fuller & Lee, 1997) or the ‘discoursally constructed’ self (Ivanic, 1998). Supervisors wrote of the proposal as needing to demonstrate ‘ability’, ‘understanding’ or ‘aptitude’ as in ‘‘student can demonstrate sufficient aptitude for topic and methods’’ or ‘‘Must have a clear and coherent understanding of the outstanding issues in the research field’’, thus blurring distinction between the ideational content of the text and its authorial stance. Similarly, in the interviews it was noteworthy that every one of the seven supervisors interviewed responded to questions about the proposal in terms of the student’s written ‘persona’ at some point during the interview, as in:

. and [in this proposal] the student seems to have a good knowledge of the field they’re working in (Int 2)

[In the proposal] I need to be able to see that the student is working with a clear idea of the goals and objectives of the thesis- where the project is going (Int 3)

this review should show that the student knows most of the key issues and main players in his or her research area and has a clear understanding of his or her research position (Int 7)

Another level of complexity then emerges when, as in some cases, supervisors seemingly unconsciously conflated the textual writer/persona they sought to identify in the research proposal with the embodied human subject of its writer. By writing specialists it has been shown that ‘textualised personae’ may or may not correspond to social subjectivity (Fuller & Lee, 1997, p. 413; Hyland, 2001, pp. 209–210), or to the ‘autobiographical self’ of a writer (Ivanic, 1998, p.24). For many of the survey respondents, however, this relationship was unproblematically assumed. Some leapt easily from one focus to another:: ‘‘widely read, critical, neat’’ (surely we do not expect the student to be ‘neat’ ?) or ‘‘practicality, originality, motivation’’ (the project to be ‘motivated’?); ‘‘it is highly important that they take a critical attitude to the literature (in the document?)—new students are too trusting’’. Others overtly prioritised their reading of the student over a reading of the research proposal as text: ‘‘English language competence, academic record, experience in common law methodology’’: ‘‘whether or not the candidate is capable of executing the project is the crucial point’’; ‘‘[I] take into account student’s previous experience—. . .I’m always impressed by previous projects’’.

This unarticulated, seemingly unconscious, reading of the student as discourse persona and even as embodied subject also came out in interviews:

[In this proposal] the student understands very clearly how the project is going to take shape and how he is going to carry out his tasks. . . he obviously knows what he’s doing (Int 1).

This is a proposal from a student who’s already established himself in this area in his home country. (Int 2)

I think the student should have a passion for the project they are creating and that is evident in their whole approach to the topic (Int 4)

For writing teachers the implications of such readings are particularly challenging. The research proposal as a piece of writing may be seen by its discourse community to require a certain kind of writer subjectivity in order to be considered a successful example of its genre. One survey respondent wrote: ‘‘I like the student to surprise me by going beyond expectations.’’ The assumptions underpinning this comment are perhaps beyond the scope of teaching: i.e. what these ‘expectations’ are, how they are manifested, what might constitute going ‘beyond’ (rather than ‘below’ or ‘outside’) them, what kind of ‘surprise’ is admired and what despised. From the student’s perspective it may not be possible to describe, much less become, a person who is capable of such surprises.

# 3. Explicit ‘reading’ of social/human subjectivity

A final group of supervisors that I would like to identify is those who, as previously described, used the research proposal text as a tool for assessing the human subjectivity of the student as a competent researcher, but, unlike those mentioned earlier, did so reflectively and stated this openly. Examples include:

It is important to feel that the student understands the work, not just that the words on the page are OK;

I need to be assured that 1) the student is genuinely interested in the proposed project. . .;

I look for evidence of enthusiasm/commitment to the research—a strong desire to ‘‘get stuck into the question’’ attitude impresses me as much as a technically well written research proposal.

In these responses there is an explicit (and perhaps interestingly unquestioned) interpretation of the human/social subject of the student through the written proposal. Such interpretation is here considered to be not only appropriate but also of overriding significance in assessing ‘performance’. One respondent introduced their own personal priority for the proposal—‘‘structure’’—because simply, ‘‘decisions about what goes in and what gets left out show whether the student has understood the work’’. My own experience of research students’ understanding of their ‘work’, as distinct from their understanding of ‘what goes in and what gets left out’ of a research proposal, would not support this claim.

It seems to me to be particularly significant if supervisors see the major role of the research proposal as introducing a learning process through which they are able to assess the human capabilities of their students, against their own well held but perhaps unspecified criteria. In this construction the proposal text itself may have minor significance. An especially strong expression of this view is seen in the comment: ‘‘One big problem is we never get asked—‘‘Is this person good PhD material?’’ (Bad English but clear sentiment) i.e. Can this person work, think, philosoph[ise]?’’ A similar expectation has been recognised in text-based studies, for example in comments such as ‘an essential element in the [proposal] is information that validates researchers as. . . individuals capable of carrying out the proposed study’ (Johns, 1993, p. 84). However, this relationship between ‘information’ and validation is perhaps an oversimplification. How a person who is ‘good PhD material’ becomes embodied in the written text of the research proposal, and what else contributes to the assessment process, become important questions for EAP. One of the supervisors interviewed in this study brought these issues out in discussion, pointing out that not only did she look in the research proposal for evidence of appropriate work on the student’s part in terms of ‘‘wide, extensive reading and a good grasp of the area’’ but that she also wanted evidence of ‘‘being able to talk intelligently about the topic so you can see the student really understands the issues’’ (Int 3). She noted quite explicitly:

The proposal is a way to see how the student is approaching the project—it is only a gatekeeping document in that it has no other role than to reflect how well the student understands the project, though of course that comes out in other ways as well. (Int 3, speaker’s emphasis)

Thus it may be the case that that one of the overriding contextual purposes of the research proposal as an institutionally validated assessment tool is to assess the person as distinct from the performance of the student in their research program. One respondent wrote to me that my survey about the nature of the proposal was ‘‘not a very productive exercise’’ because the process relies on ‘‘the exercise of ‘judgement’’’; in this view ‘judgement’ cannot be articulated at all. Such a suggestion has significant implications, not only in relation to the vague and largely hidden criteria by which such assessment may be made, but also to all our roles as educators in this field.

# 6. Challenges to a restricted genre pedagogy

The results of the investigation described earlier present a challenge to me in relation to the design and implementation of curriculum for teaching students from other academic cultures how to write a research proposal. Earlier I have clarified for myself that one of the keys to learning to write academically in a second or subsequent language lies in learning ‘who to be’, appropriately, in your own text (Cadman, 1997a, 1997b). The implications of this investigation, however, suggest that, in the reader–writer relationship, there is a much greater overlap between Ivanic’s (1998) ‘autobiographical’ and ‘discoursal’ selves than has previously been articulated; in fact, to be successful, we may be asking research students to take on new concepts of ‘who to be’ as embodied human beings, in their socially constructed ‘selves’, as an integral part of their research education.

I have suggested that the research proposal itself reflects an ‘edifice of shared features and values’ in my institution (features which are endorsed by textual studies, notably of research and grant proposals, e.g. Connor & Mauranen, 1999; Locke, Spirduso, & Silverman, 1993; Myers, 1985; Ostler, 1996). Identifying these valued features is very useful within the genre pedagogy framework on which most research proposal teaching is based (see, e.g. Paltridge, 1997). However, a further logic emerges, challenging us not to restrict ourselves within this framework. Genre pedagogy is acknowledged to be rooted in a ‘politics of access and equality’ (Lee, 1997). It is a pedagogy of induction, apprenticeship and mastery, offering ‘access to, and participation in, the discursive practices of a culture’ (p. 411). However, ‘among its effects is a defacto endorsement of official discourses. . ., a reification of genres of writing’ (p. 417) especially by those who practise and teach to it (see also Benesch, 2001). As has been strongly suggested in the EAP discussions within which this study is framed, the personal stance of the teacher in relation to the target genres is central to this process. The power relations between students and faculty form the context for learning and assessment.

In this academic culture these research writers are naturally positioned (and take up subject formation) on at least three levels: text content (field) within the discourse [with a small ‘d’, ‘just stretches of language’ (Gee, 1996)]; textualised personae (tenor) within the discourse (Fuller & Lee, 1997; Ivanic, 1998); and human, socially situated ‘selves’ within the ‘big D Discourse’ [Gee’s (1996; 1997) ‘way of being together in the world for humans’, simultaneously ‘active and passive, coordinating-andgetting-coordinated’ by the Discourses in which they are participating].

For me the significance of this third level of self-construction has been reilluminated by this study, especially in international teaching and learning contexts. As Lee (1997, p. 411) points out, ‘the interests of individuals and those of a dominant social formation are not necessarily unproblematically congruent’, and in my experience of research education contexts such as these, divergent interests are rarely be given space to be articulated. This obvious fact may then have significant impact on an individual’s agency in positioning her/himself as subject-inthe-text, notably through techniques of authorial stance (Ivanic, 1998) or ‘evaluation’ (Hunston & Thompson, 2000). There may be even greater implications for human subjects as they construct themselves in relation to their discipline’s big-D Discourse of successful-researcher-in-the-field. Perversely, the egalitarian goals of a purely pragmatic genre pedagogy may be contributing to assimilationist processes.

# 7. Strategies for a critical EAP in research education

In my own practice I am working to implement specific strategies for addressing these implications and for interrupting the perpetuation of dominance and subordination in research education. These strategies rely on reconceptualising EAP in several ways, perhaps most significantly in relation to the roles of teacher, learner and classroom.

The teacher’s first task in an institutional setting is to design or implement a curriculum for learning. In researching the basis for curriculum design, I think we must not lose sight of the understanding that all knowledge is ‘interested’ (Pennycook 1989, 1990), and thus we should be asking questions which extend beyond textual ones to embrace ideological and pedagogic issues. In this context some examples might be (and there are many more. . .):

# Ideological

What are the field assumptions contained in the dominant, unproblematised constructions of ‘successful-research-student’ both inside and outside the research proposal?   
In what ways does English language research Discourse work to reproduce the colonising social relations of knowledge dominance and marginalisation in which it is rooted?   
Whose interests are served by this Discourse, and what other interests are being negated or ignored by an uninterrogated acceptance of the need for students to be assimilated into a value-laden English language research culture?

# Pedagogic

How does it become possible for an international student to act textually out of the dominant successful-research-student position $I F$ they are primarily conscious of being positioned as an outsider, a novice, ill-equipped ‘other’ with language problems?

How might it become possible for international scholars to allow themselves to risk subordination and change through learning $I F$ their dominant subject position is that of a male, high status, greatly respected, professional expert from a patriarchal society? How can we design curricula and materials to disrupt existing power relations and to enhance agency for international research scholars, without disadvantaging their acceptance within their international field communities?

We can begin by opening up these questions with supervising staff as well as with students in order to articulate a theoretical framework for learning and teaching which is transformative as well as pragmatic. Salvadori’s model of ‘transculturalism’ exemplifies this approach and can bring us to see how we, teachers of restricted EAP skills, are uniquely placed to become learners from our students as international experts in their fields (see Cadman, 2000). An effective second step is then to consider a student-generated curriculum design such as the ‘control wedge’ model (Fig. 2; see Cadman & Grey, 2000; Cargill et al, 2001) through which teachers have a structured process for gradually handing over power and authority. Students are led, through targeted individual and group activities, to take up management of their own learning by articulating and prioritising their personal situations and goals, and negotiating with EAP staff, their supervisors and their classmates for appropriate curriculum. Issues of power, authority and ownership of knowledge are thus foregrounded and debated. At the end of the program, evaluations may be designed to open up discussion of students’ own satisfaction with the appropriacy of the curriculum for them, and the roles they played in its generation.

Fig. 2. The control wedge model of curriculum design (first published in Cadman & Grey, 2000, p. 24 see also Cargill et al., 2001).

Within this tripartite structure, the negotiation process can be extended to explore the ideological dimensions of research design and text structure. As Canagarajah (2001) has shown, successful multi-vocal texts can be produced through learning activities which seek to articulate individuals’ multiple identities as creators of written knowledge. EAP lecturers can be instrumental in facilitating students’ analyses of the local and global interests served by a recommended research design, or by valued features of authentic model texts, as well as by departmental supervisor’s comments on drafts (see Kamler, 1997) and in seminars. Published discipline-specific literature can be fruitfully reviewed when students develop confidence in questioning its taken-for-granted assumptions, interrogating its knowledge claims and rhetorical techniques as culturally rooted representations (see Kubota, 1999; Moore, 2002), especially in fields to which they bring knowledge from different educational perspectives. Their conclusions may, with circumspection, be shared and discussed with supervisors who are invited to join appropriate EAP activities. Sharpening research design, drafting, peer- and self-editing, collaborative redrafting and proofreading then become recursive, reflexive processes through which students help each other to express a personally owned research voice, as well as creating dialogue with a preestablished discourse community.

A final, perhaps crucial, feature of a critical EAP is the ‘culture’ of its classroom. None of the strategies suggested above can succeed in encouraging peripheral students to develop agency in their research programs and texts unless their learning spaces are shame-free, respectful, joyful and stimulating. Such a culture requires a classroom which recognises and values the full human person of all students, as family members, parents, partners, professionals, members of ethnic, religious or language groups—a classroom in which the teacher is similarly known, and where common experiences (child-raising, illness, success, embarrassment, loneliness. . .) are shared. Learning takes place best among students engaging respectfully with each other’s, and the teacher’s, strengths, struggles, irritation and, above all, laughter. We aim for research to come alive in the classroom as a natural extension of each student’s personal aspiration; students know each other’s projects, witness and contribute to their development, visit each other’s departments, attend and critique each other’s seminars. In such a learning environment at its best, the research proposal can become an exploratory site through which dominant paradigms of research and research writing are recursively contested by very differently accomplished student researchers.

# 8. Conclusion: English for Academic Possibilities

The attitudes and practices of the research supervisors in this study suggest that not only are research proposals gatekeeping assessment texts but they also seem to represent evaluated ‘readings’ of students, within a context of largely unarticulated criteria for what a ‘researcher’ is, how new knowledge can be made, and who can be allowed to make it. In my own EAP context of teaching the research proposal as a situated genre, I am moved to acknowledge the truth of Benesch’s (2001, p. 3) claim that power issues are often ignored in the name of pragmatism. Trying to find ever more effective ways of helping students to ‘master’ clearly established genre expectations, I often fail to address, or to take serious note of, the political and social dimensions of my practice.

I have tried to redress this by reconceptualising EAP as ‘English for Academic Possibilities’, returning to Roger Simon’s (1987; 1992; Giroux & Simon, 1988) conception of a ‘pedagogy of possibility’ as ‘one committed to the expansion of the range of human capacities contained within the requirements of securing diversity, compassionate justice, and the renewal of life’ (1992, p. 27). Such a ‘project of possibility’ has been taken up globally by Pennycook (1990, 1994c, 1999) and in South Africa by Peirce (1989) who described it as ‘a pedagogy that opens up possibilities for students and teachers of English, not only in terms of material advancement, but in terms of the way they perceive themselves, their role in society, and the potential for change in their society’ (pp. 402–403). In research contexts it can then become an integrated goal of EAP to offer students new and complex ‘‘prototypical possibilities for selfhood. . . [which are] available to writers in the social context of writing’’ (Ivanic, 1998, p. 27). In a pedagogy of possibility the research proposal is a site of struggle between knowledge and power on several levels at once:

on a political level, as critical access by world majority students to the research achievements and practices of developed communities disrupts the process of global knowledge transfer and competes with the spread of English language research cultures as imperialistic, dominant knowledge paradigms; on an educational level, as the proposal as genre offers the possibility for knowledges, skills, power and status to be re-formed, as we question its gatekeeping role which is dependent upon largely unarticulated and unproblematised text and social practices; and on a human level, as the research proposal creates possibilities for multiple self-constructions and ‘readings’ of students who will contribute to on-going dialogues between embodied and situated inhabitants of the world.

Such possibilities present us with the irresistible challenge of EAP in the future.
