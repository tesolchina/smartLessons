# Abstract

Global health pandemics (such as COVID-19) can result in rapid changes to sanctionable behaviour, impacting society and culture in a multitude of ways. This study examined how pandemic culture and accompanying moral order was produced within and through social interaction during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Australia. The data consisted of a corpus of 29 video-recorded paediatric palliative care consultations and were analysed using conversation analysis. Analysis showed how adherence to pandemic rules became morally expected, and moral concerns about actual or potential violations to these rules became relevant in and through social interaction during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a natural experiment for how accountable actions and a moral order are negotiated in and through our social interactions when our takenfor-granted ‘natural facts of life’ change in response to a global public health crisis.

# Introduction

Pandemics, such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), are already being shown to extend beyond healthcare, having an impact on society, culture, economy and the physical environment more generally (Lupton and Willis, 2021). At a sociocultural level, such pandemics can result in rapid changes to sanctionable behaviour. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many behaviours that were previously acceptable, such as physical greetings (Katila et al., 2020) or the handling of money (Mondada et al., 2020) were restricted or altogether prohibited. In the context of these rapid social changes, this article considers how these newly restricted or prohibited behaviours are treated as indicators of morality. These socially governed activities provide opportunities to make visible and understand the moral orders of pandemics.

In his classic sociological text, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Garfinkel (1967) describes how a ‘moral order’ is intrinsic to our everyday social conduct in society:

From the point of view of sociological theory, the moral order consists of the rule governed activities of everyday life. A society’s members encounter and know the moral order as perceivedly normal courses of action – familiar scenes of everyday affairs, the world of daily life known in common with others and with others taken for granted. (p.35)

These familiar, and taken-for-granted, scenes of everyday activities are what Garfinkel refers to as the ‘natural facts of life’ (p. 35), which, for members of a society, are ‘through and through moral facts of life’ (p. 35). Since the early work of Sacks (1992), studies in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (CA) have explicated how taken-forgranted social and moral ‘norms’ are produced, negotiated and contested within everyday social interaction. CA research has since explored in more detail how moral concerns become relevant in and through the social organisation of interaction, providing systematic evidence for the intrinsic quality of morality in everyday social interaction (e.g., Bergmann, 1998; Danby and Emmison, 2014; Drew, 1998; Sterponi, 2009; Stokoe and Edwards, 2009; Tileaga, 2010). Within this research, ‘mundane morality’ was defined as ‘the practices of everyday life in which people mix moral evaluations, a sense of right and wrong, blame, culpability, etc., with ordinary accounts and descriptions of persons, actions and events’ (Stokoe and Edwards, 2009).

Mundane morality is brought into focus within social interaction because social actions are accountable phenomena: descriptions in talk are always selective and incomplete and designed to accomplish a particular social action within a specific, local interactional environment (Drew, 1998). This ‘accountability’ of social action means that interlocutors are morally responsible for adhering to normative structures of reasoning and normative patterns of conduct, referred to as ‘relevance rules’ (Robinson, 2016). Breaching the relevance rules is sanctionable and warrants an ‘account’ (Robinson, 2016). The moral work of accounts in social interaction is often ‘seen but unnoticed’ (Garfinkel, 1967) or ‘implicit’ (Drew, 1998). Sometimes moral work, however, is more explicit where speakers orient to an overt transgression to some normative standards. Drew (1998) found that explicit moral accounts were associated with complaints about third parties’ behaviour (rather than one’s own) and were typically bounded sequences. These complaints involved explicit formulations of the transgressions, expressions of moral indignation and sought affiliation with the stance adopted towards another person’s conduct. Beyond complaints, moral work often can be seen to be done through other actions (such as accusations, insults, praise, admissions, confessions, apologies, excuses and justifications), membership categorisation and intonation/prosody (Bergmann, 1998).

The development of COVID-19 into a global pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on our daily lives, or what Garfinkel (1967) describes as the ‘natural facts of life’ (p. 35). Aspects of daily life known in common with others and taken-for-granted were changed due to public health restrictions, such as isolating people who felt unwell and physical distancing to slow the spread of the disease. The pandemic thus changed the rules for how some members of a common society acted in daily life, for an unknown period of time. Bergmann (1998) argues that, in societies that have become multiethnic and multicultural, there is no longer a singular institution that has a monopoly of defining an obligatory moral code for the whole of society; instead, members choose and build their own worldviews and belief systems. During the pandemic (in countries such as Australia where the data for this paper was collected), rules and restrictions were in place that limited this free choice more than usual (e.g. forced lockdown measures, border closures, closure of public facilities and physical distancing in public). Orientations to the ‘common culture’ (Garfinkel, 1967) of a pandemic saw a new moral order underway as shown in and through conversations and actions (such as wearing a mask and physical distancing) during this time.

This study aims to examine how pandemic culture and accompanying moral order was produced within and through social interaction in paediatric palliative care consultations during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in Australia. While social scientific research based on self-report data has connected morality and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic (Chan, 2021; Qian and Yahara, 2020; Schiffer et al., 2021), our current study moves beyond self-report data, to understand how people orient to moral conduct in actual (i.e. ‘real-world’) social interactions that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data consist of video-recorded paediatric palliative care appointments.

Paediatric palliative care is a holistic service that involves medical discussions about a child with a life limiting condition. The care of the child, and psychosocial and lifestyle discussions with families are designed to ensure that the whole family is experiencing quality-of-life across the lifespan of the child (Bradford et al., 2014; Hartley et al., 2016). Topics of conversations within these appointments are thus broad, including general talk about everyday life. Paediatric palliative care consultations thus provide one arena in which pandemic culture can be observed. Within appointments during the pandemic, the relevance of COVID-19 is pervasive, and discussed in relation to a range of matters (Ekberg et al., 2020). This paper examines how moral rules of pandemic life were produced and negotiated within these conversations, and how breaches of the expectancies of everyday life during the pandemic were oriented to and accounted for in social interaction. More specifically, the analysis will consider three practices observed in the data, including: orientations to potential violations of pandemic culture within the interaction; extended accounts for potential violations of pandemic rules and condemning others’ violations of pandemic regulations.

# Method

This study was part of a larger project that examined communication between healthcare professionals and families within paediatric palliative care services in Australia. The data consist of a corpus of 29 paediatric palliative care consultations that were video recorded in three children’s hospitals in three Australian states. Data were collected between March and September 2020, a period that coincided with the initial and second peaks of COVID-19 cases in Australia. The epidemiological trajectory of COVID-19 in Australia can be found in Figure 1 (DOH, 2020).

The consultations comprised 8 telehealth outpatient consultations, 11 inpatient consultations, 8 face-to-face outpatient consultations and 2 home visits. Consultations were an average of 38.38 minutes in duration $\mathrm { \langle S D = } 1 9 . 5 2$ ), with a total of 18 hours and $3 3 \mathrm { m i n } -$ utes of data. Participants included 19 families and attending health professionals in the consultation (including doctors, nurses and allied health professionals). There were 1–4 health professionals in a consultation. Four families had two or more consultations recorded. The children ranged in age from 3 to 18 years old $\scriptstyle { M = 8 . 6 }$ years, $\mathrm { S D } { = } 4 . 9$ ).

Staff and families involved in the paediatric palliative care service were informed about the research project by a member of hospital staff. All participants provided informed written consent themselves or by their guardian (for child patients). Prior to the start of each recorded consultation, a clinician set up two video cameras in the consultation room. No researchers were present during the video-recorded consultations. The video-recorded data were transcribed using the standard conversation analytic transcription conventions developed by Jefferson (2004). The data were analysed using conversation analysis (CA) (Sidnell, 2013) by all authors. In this analysis, all instances of talk related to COVID-19 and the associated changes to lifestyle during the pandemic $n { = } 7 0$ fragments) were examined for how mundane morality was both implicitly and explicitly oriented to within the interaction.

This study was approved by the Children’s Health Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/18/QRCH/86) and Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (1800000468), in addition to site-specific governance approvals. The study adhered to the principles of the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (NHMRC, 2018).

# Analysis

Analysis of the recorded consultations during the pandemic showed participants orienting to a new morally accountable order within their social interactions. Activities that previously had been morally non-accountable (e.g. shopping, visiting extended family, travelling interstate) were oriented to by participants as accountable actions that were currently morally reprehensible. Insofar as participants displayed concern for showing others that they were aware of what was or was not acceptable behaviour during the pandemic, an orientation to the local pandemic culture and its accounting for new moral orders could be located within their interaction. Actions that could be understood as potential violations of pandemic regulations now had to be accounted for within the interaction; that is, they were now required to be made visible. The first two sub-sections below show how participants oriented to potential violations of pandemic culture within the interaction and provided extended accounts for potential violations of pandemic rules. Similarly, actual violations (by others) were condemned within the interaction to display the impropriety of those actions. The final sub-section focuses on how participants condemned others’ violations of pandemic regulations.

Figure 1. The epidemiological trajectory of COVID-19 in Australia March–August 2020.

Within these accounting and condemning practices, participants could be seen and heard to be doing moral work – orienting to and providing accounts that produced an evaluation of the ‘rightness’ and ‘wrongness’ of actions during the pandemic through their social interactions.

# Orientations to potential violations of pandemic culture within the interaction

This sub-section will examine instances in which potential violations to pandemic regulations were accounted for in the interaction through post-expansions or the insertion of parentheticals, in which participants oriented to the current inappropriateness of the prior talk. Fragments 1–2 provide examples.

Fragment 1 comes from an inpatient consultation. The nurse and mother are talking about how the child has recently had an operation that allows her now to be able to sit in a chair for a couple of hours at a time, whereas she has been limited to lying flat over the past 2 years. This appointment was recorded in April 2020 during the first peak of COVID-19 in Australia. At the time of recording, most non-essential shops were closed (online shopping only) and residents were encouraged to visit shops sparingly and only for essential items.

01 Mum: but (.) she has been lay [ing flat for two years? ]   
02 Nur: [but ↑two hours is enough] ti:me, (.)   
03 when shops open again, (0.7) to like (.) go cruising around the   
04 ↑shop [s ]   
05 Mum: [£↑heck y]ea:h£   
06 (1.1)   
07 Nur: ↑could [↓like ↓win↑dow sho↓p and stu↑ff]

At line 2, the nurse begins her turn with ‘but two hours is enough time. . .’. At this point, she pauses for a micro-second and then adds a parenthetical (Mazeland, 2007), ‘when shops open again’, before pausing again and continuing her turn: ‘to like go cruising around the shops’. Without the addition of the parenthetical her turn would have been: ‘but two hours is enough time to like go cruising around the shops’. The action described in this turn would have been a breach to pandemic rules in place at the time, given most shops in the state where the conversation occurred were temporarily closed, and people were encouraged to make any necessary shopping trips hurriedly, visiting the shops only to buy necessary items before promptly leaving. To go ‘cruising around’ shopping centres was not encouraged at the time and thus a suggestion from the nurse to do this (particularly with a child with a life-limiting condition) may potentially receive moral judgement from the mother. The nurse goes to an additional interactional effort to preemptively self-account for this potential interference and possible moral judgement from the mother by adding the parenthetical, which re-designs her turn to be describing an event at some unknown time in the future (‘when shops open again’). Mazeland (2007) has described how parentheticals, like repair, can be used by a speaker to address issues in their turn such as accounting for something that is said or done in the host turn constructional unit and forestalling dispreferred inferences. The time reference ‘when shops open again’ is what Raymond and White (2017) have referred to as an event-relative time reference, which re-invokes shared cultural knowledge and membership in common society, in this case pandemic common society (i.e. knowing that shops are currently closed and will re-open once it is deemed ‘COVID-safe’ to do so). By adding the parenthetical time reference, the nurse thus constructs herself as a reasonable member of society rather than someone is proposing a moral transgression.

In the same appointment, the nurse is later talking about another activity that might be fun for the child to do now that she is sitting up.

14 Mum: ↓ye↑a:↓h.   
15 Nur: #yea:h#. (1.5) ‘cause you can do her ↑face now (.) is my   
16 ↑point.

In line 1, the nurse starts her turn with ‘I don’t know if they do it anymore’. She continues by describing a place that did ‘princess makeovers’ for children (lines 2–8). Across lines 4 and 6, the mother affiliates with the nurse’s suggestion, confirming that her children ‘would love that’. Following another aligning response from the mother at line 10 (‘ah:::’), the nurse adds a post-expansion to her turn: ‘I’ll see if (0.3) post-COVID if that’s a thing still’ (lines 11–12). This post-expansion is provided despite no signs of disaffiliation from the mother in response to the suggested activity. The post-expansion includes an insertion repair (Schegloff, 2013; Wilkinson and Weatherall, 2011), where ‘post-covid’ is inserted before the repetition of ‘if’ to post-frame this inserted material. This post-expansion, and the repair within it, accounts for the ostensible breach in pandemic culture in her previous talk. At the time of recording, a make-over would not be allowed during pandemic restrictions as it would not adhere to social distancing rules and would involve the make-up artist touching the face of a child with a life-limiting condition. In a similar way to the first example, the nurse orients to this proposed activity being something that would happen in the future, ‘post-covid’. The time reference is again an event-relative time reference (Raymond and White, 2017) as it is unknown as to the exact dates that such activities may resume, if at all. By referring to ‘post-covid’, the nurse re-invokes shared cultural knowledge and membership of a common pandemic society. The nurse’s turn thus orients to her awareness that such an activity would not be allowed during the pandemic, thus avoiding the inference, and potential moral judgement, from the mother that she is suggesting the mother do something that is against pandemic regulations.

Together, these two fragments demonstrate the additional effort of interlocutors to manage potential accountability and moral judgement associated with ‘doing the right thing’ during the pandemic. Talk about two activities that would go unnoticed from a breaching of the social order in non-pandemic times had to be managed by the parties as now being morally accountable and explicitly noted as unacceptable. In managing this potential accountability, the nurses also work to maintain credibility a positive identity by presenting themselves as someone who would not be recommending potentially dangerous activities for a child with a serious, complex condition during a pandemic. In the fragments analysed so far, the accounting turns were brief, involving a within-turn parenthetical and a single post-expansion turn, but sometimes participants’ accounting practices were more extensive, as seen in the next section.

# Extended accounts for potential violations of pandemic rules

At times, speakers engaged in more extensive accounting practices to display the propriety of their own conduct according to pandemic rules and restrictions. This was done often through ‘defensive detailing’ (Drew, 1998; Jefferson, 1985) where the speakers provided extensive details to build a case for an episode not constituting a transgression on their part. Fragment 3 provides an example. At the start of this telehealth appointment, the mother described the child as being ‘a bit sick today’ and that she is considering taking her to the local hospital. Prior the below fragment, the mother has also disclosed that they have just been to Victoria to attend a funeral because the mother’s grandfather had died (typically, a morally acceptable activity). In mid-June 2020, around the time of this recording, COVID-19 cases had begun to climb again in Melbourne, Victoria. On the way back from Victoria, the mother has reported that the child became ‘a bit snotty and breathing fast’ and has been vomiting.

37 Doc: [yea:h. ]

At line 2, the doctor requests confirmation from the mother that the child has had a runny nose. The mother responds with a description of the child’s symptoms, including sneezing, a bit of a runny nose, and that it ‘mainly seems to be the breathing now so::’. She deploys a prosodically marked ‘so’ in turn-final position to project an upshot that she does not go on to produce (Raymond, 2004). There is a 0.4 seconds gap in the conversation where neither party initiates a turn. The mother produces a post-expansion of her turn to deal with a potential inference that could be made about the child’s breathing difficulties mentioned at the end of her prior turn (namely that trouble breathing is one key symptom of COVID-19 (Huang et al., 2020). To manage this potential (negative) inference, the mother describes having seen the doctor yesterday, who gave her a referral to get tested for coronavirus. She adds the details of the testing site and the prompt timeframe of when she is going to do this (‘this afternoon’). These details show both her knowledge and intent to adhere to public health appeals to get tested for the symptoms associated with respiratory infections during the pandemic. The mother also adds that she thinks she might take the child ‘straight in to the hospital now’ (lines 12–13). Again, the mother highlights the immediacy of her proposed conduct (use of ‘straight’ and ‘now’), thus again showing that she is doing the right thing by taking cold symptoms seriously.

The doctor provides a minimal acknowledgement (‘okay’, line 14), before asking the mother another question at line 17. The mother has already told the doctor that they have been to Victoria and that the child’s symptoms started on the way home. At the time of the recording, COVID-19 cases had again begun to rise in Melbourne, Victoria, whereas cases were very low (if any) within their home state. The doctor asks the mother whether she is ‘a little bit more worried’ about coronavirus because of visiting Victoria (lines 17–18). This question orients to the mother’s previous descriptions and having just raised coronavirus testing herself in her previous turn. However, the question may also carry implicit moral judgement: the mother has taken her child to another state where COVID19 cases are higher. The doctor’s question is also designed as a yes/no interrogative, with a preference for a confirmatory response (Raymond, 2003). The question design thus also incorporates a potential inference that the mother did the wrong thing by travelling to Victoria. From line 20, the mother can be seen to understand the potential moral implications of the doctor’s question by providing an extended account for why she is not worried that the child could have caught coronavirus during their trip to Victoria. The mother describes that they were in close contact with her sister, who she reports having tonsilitis. By specifying this diagnosis, the mother discounts coronavirus as a possibility. She provides more details that her sister had tested negative for coronavirus while they were visiting. Across this turn, the mother makes the effort of describing them as being in ‘country Victoria’ rather than just ‘Victoria’. This is important because the number of cases in ‘country’ (i.e. regional) towns at that time were small and it was only the city of Melbourne that had (so far) seen a rise in cases of COVID-19. By referring to ‘country Victoria’, the mother thus alludes to a reduced risk of being exposed to coronavirus. The mother also describes her sister, who came from Melbourne (a greater risk location), as having done the right thing by being tested when she arrived in country Victoria. She goes on to state that they were not ‘really around anyone else’ and that it was ‘just the family. . .that were staying in the same house’ (lines 27–31). Here, the mother orients to the restriction that prevented too many different households getting together at one time although members of the same household could be together. She thus highlights her knowledge of the regulations and knowing how to do the right thing. She concludes that she is not ‘overly concerned’ about coronavirus (lines 34–36). The use of ‘overly’ here constructs her as a reasonable person who has some concern but that this concern has not been exacerbated by recent events. It also continues to mitigate any blameworthiness of her prior actions of taking her daughter to Victoria. She then provides a counter-diagnosis of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) for her daughter’s symptoms and orients to her epistemic authority (Heritage, 2013) for giving that diagnosis considering her daughter has had RSV ‘a couple of times’ before so she can recognise the same symptoms on this occasion (lines 34–36).

In sum, the mother goes into defensive detailing in this sequence to account for the family’s visit to Victoria and to show that their behaviour leading up to the child’s cold symptoms did not transgress pandemic rules and regulations. The mother’s extensive account highlights the importance of her showing that she was not morally irresponsible according to pandemic rules. In doing so, she produces herself as a ‘good mother’ who would not expose her child to any perceived risk. Again here, an activity that might not otherwise be an accountable action becomes accountable according a pandemic moral order being oriented to by the participants.

# Condemning others’ violations of pandemic regulations

The above section demonstrated how speakers accounted for their own potential transgressions to the moral order of pandemic life. Orientations to pandemic morality-inaction could also be seen within descriptions of other people’s behaviour. The following three fragments provide examples of explicit reports of rule-breaking behaviour during the pandemic within three, successive story-telling sequences from one face-to-face outpatient appointment. There is an escalation of moral accountability across the three stories, each one being upgraded from the previous one. Much of the moral work done across these sequences is through the speakers’ selection of categories to construct the protagonists within the story as rule-breakers.

In this appointment are the child patient’s grandma and grandpa (the child is not in the room) and four clinicians: two doctors, a nurse and an Occupational Therapist (OT). The six participants are sitting in a circle around a large table. Prior to beginning this fragment, the child’s grandma has been talking about the child receiving a wish from the ‘Make a Wish’ foundation. The child’s wish is to have a trip to the Gold Coast to visit the theme parks. On the day of this recording, 10th July 2020, the border between Queensland (where the Gold Coast is located) and New South Wales (NSW), the participants’ home state, was due to re-open due to low, controlled COVID-19 cases in all Australian states except Victoria. The theme parks on the Gold Coast were due also to re-open in the coming weeks.

At line 6, the OT delivers a closing to the sequence about the family’s potential trip to the Gold Coast: ‘Well hopefully things will start to open up’. Given that the borders between NSW and Queensland were to re-open that day, the OT inexplicitly orients here to the fact that a trip to the Gold Coast would not have been possible previously due to COVID-19 restrictions (both borders and theme parks currently closed) but such a trip may be possible soon. COVID-19 is not needed to be explicitly mentioned here for participants to understand what the OT means by things starting to ‘open up’ (line 6). The closures are treated as taken-for-granted common knowledge at that time. The child’s grandpa provides a hesitant/uncertain response to the OT: ‘Yeah well I don’t know cause it’s s-starting to shut down again’ (lines 12 and 14) with agreement from others (lines 15–17). Grandma expands Grandpa’s turn by providing an account for why things might need to shut down again: ‘Yeah well those sneaky Victorians tried to get up there over the border’. At the time of this appointment in Australia, Victoria was in a second wave of COVID-19 cases and under strict lockdown restrictions. All other states had closed their borders to Victoria. Grandma’s turn involves the use of ‘those’, highlighting an out-group of ‘others’ as well as a double categorisation of the people who tried to cross the border: they were ‘sneaky’ and ‘Victorians’. The categorisation ‘sneaky’ suggests devious intent and ‘Victorians’ highlights an identity category of people that are (1) most likely to be at risk of having coronavirus; and (2) supposed to be lockdown and not travelling anywhere. Grandma’s turn could have been complete at the end of ‘up there (i.e. north of their current location). By adding ‘over the border’ (line 21), she further highlights the breach in rules and emphasises the illegality of the action, because the State of Queensland had closed its borders to Victorians and had police checkpoints at border crossings. Overall, her turn designs an identity category of these rule-breakers as having purposefully done something illegal, with her account explicitly orienting to their immoral actions.

In response to Grandma’s description of ‘sneaky Victorians’, there is laughter from the OT (line 25) and Doc 2 repeats the categorisation ‘those sneaky Victorians’ with a smiley voice (line 26). There is also further laughter from the clinicians (lines 27–30). The nurse repeats ‘sneaky’ and taps her fingers together, in what is sometimes described as a ‘tenting’ or ‘steepling’ gesture. This gesture is consistent with those made by fictionalised villains, such as Montgomery Burns in the television show The Simpsons. Bergmann (1998) has noted that moral activities are often positioned within a non-serious or humorous frame. Holt (2012) showed how laughter in response to complaints helps to maintain social solidarity with the complainer without fully affiliating with the complaint. Recipients may be reluctant to fully affiliate with the complainer due to the moral work being done in complaining about a specific group of people. Laughter as response here can thus be seen to be a middle ground between full affiliation and disaffiliation with the complainer. At line 32, Doc 1 aligns with Grandma by providing an expansion: ‘I reckon a couple got through’, upgrading the offence from ‘trying to’ to having crossed the border. Grandma then upgrades the doctor’s ‘a couple’ to ‘they caught a vanful’ (line 35). Grandma uses ‘they’ here as a locally subsequent indexical in a locally initial position to refer to ‘the police’ (Kitzinger et al., 2012). She thus treats people who would catch border-crossers as common cultural knowledge, which does not need to be explicitly named. Her use of ‘caught’ highlights the illegality of the conduct. Further, a ‘vanful’ implies a greater number of people than ‘a couple’ (a number subsequently specified as six, on line 40), thus designing the infringement as even worse (i.e. a greater risk of spreading virus with more people). Across lines 35, 38 and 40, Grandma continues providing details on the event, including that it happened ‘the other night’ and providing the figure for amount of money they were fined for their transgression. These details further highlight the extent of the transgression – enough to be fined $\$ 24,000$ . Doc 2, Doc 1 and the OT respond with ‘oh’ change-of-state tokens (Heritage, 1984) (lines 43–45) demonstrating their surprise and aligning with the moral indignation of Grandma’s account. At lines 46 and 48, Grandpa repeats the upshot of her telling: ‘Six of em in a minivan trying to get over the Queensland border’, which receives further surprise responses from the clinicians (lines 50 and 51). The Grandma’s moral account is continued by the responses of others to it.

Grandma’s telling comes to be expanded following a turn by Doc 2, who asks if the Victorians were ‘hiding under the seats or something?’ (line 53). Both Grandpa and Grandma give a ‘no’ response (lines 55–56) and Grandma continues her telling at lines 56 and 58 to report ‘they were just all sitting in this minivan they were all Victorians’. Again, the moral accountability of the behaviour of these people is upgraded here – they were not even trying to hide their illegal action but ‘just sitting’ in the van, highlighting the deliberateness of their misconduct (Drew, 1998). And they were ‘all Victorians’ highlighting that all six people in the van would have considered high-risk and thus doing the wrong thing by travelling into another state. At lines 59 and 61 Grandpa adds that they tried to ‘sneak through with false declarations and whatever’. The repeat of ‘sneak’ from earlier in the sequence again implies devious intent and re-highlights the characteristics of the people involved being ‘sneaky’. In addition, the use of ‘false’ highlights the wrongdoing of their conduct. There are minimal responses from others (lines 62–63), which, along with Grandma’s upshot ‘they busted em’ (line 64) close down this first story, before Doc 1 initiates a second story at line 65 in Fragment 5b below.

Doc 1 initiates the second story with an announcement: ‘I heard about the KFC party’ (line 65). This initial turn indicates an upgrade on the previous story about a ‘vanful’ of people; she is now talking about a whole ‘party’. Doc 2 displays shared knowledge of the story and participates in joint telling (Lerner, 1992) by adding further detail that the fine for that case was AU\$26,000, again an upgrade on the fine in the last story, which was AU\$24,000. Doc 2 has interpolated laughter particles across her turn and follows with more laughter (line 71). Doc 1 aligns with Doc 2 by adding some quiet laughter (line 69) and a confirmation (line 72) and then continues the story: ‘they put in a great big order’ (line 75). She uses two descriptives to describe the size of order ‘great big’ and also gestures with her hands wide apart, again emphasizing the large number people involved in this story. This expansion of the telling occasions a response from Grandpa that displays his shared knowledge of the story: ‘Yeah I read that one too’ (lines 77–78). Grandpa thus positions himself as a within-culture participant who also knows the tale of this transgression, while Grandma has claimed (at line 67) not to know the story.

Doc 1 continues, adding: ‘And the police were like that’s a lot of food for not very many people’ (lines 82, 83 and 86). The use of reported speech here animates the skepticism of the police (Drew, 1998) in believing that so much food could be ordered for only 10 people (the number of people allowed to gather at this time). The recipients display their knowledge of the regulations, and thus of the transgression that has been made, in response. The OT joins the telling by also producing the end of the story in overlap with Doc 1: ‘for 10 people’ (line 87). She thus makes explicit orientation here to the restriction rules of no more than 10 people together at one time displaying herself as someone who knows the rules. Across both the first and second stories is an orientation to morality dur ing the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response to the story being told to this point, both the OT and Doc 1 (the story initiator) add laughter particles to their turn endings (lines 86 and 87). Doc 1 continues the story describing people hiding from the police when they arrived, thus displaying their intent and knowledge that they were doing something illegal (line 90 and 92). Grandma provides a display of incredulous surprise, ‘oh wow’, affiliating with the sense of indignation/wrongness of the other’s conduct. Doc 1 completes her story with a formulating assessment, ‘It’s insane’ (line 96), and Doc 2 adds ‘it’s crazy’ (line 97) in overlap, both explicitly assessing the actions as a transgression. Also, in overlap, Grandpa initiates a third story, shown in Fragment 5c below.

At line 98 and then again at 101, Grandpa initiates a new story: ‘There’s a bloke on. . bloke on A Current Affair’. In this turn, the person is categorised as a ‘bloke’, a slang word for a man and, as a person on ‘A Current Affair’, which is an Australian free-to-air television show that broadcasts stories about people accused of a range of illegal or improper acts. After ‘from’ on line 101, Grandpa adds a parenthetical ‘he’s a real estate bloke’ (line 104). Grandpa goes to additional effort here to add a parenthetical that contains a categorisation of the referent as a real estate agent, a category who has the stereotype of lying and cheating for personal gain (note – he retains the use of ‘bloke’ here rather than using ‘agent’). He then adds ‘from Melbourne’ highlighting that he was also a person from a location in Australia that was at greatest risk of having coronavirus at the time. The man is described as being ‘quite pleased himself’ and ‘bragging’ (lines $1 0 5 -$ 106), thus being constructed as a person who not only showed intent but also no remorse for his behaviour. Doc 1 and Doc 2 both start laughing response at this point, displaying a pre-affiliative stance to Grandpa’s story (lines 107–110). Grandpa finishes his turn describing how the man ‘got over the Queensland border on his motorbike’ (line 111). The use of ‘border’ highlights the breach in pandemic regulations where there are clear border closures. Across this extended turn, a lot of work is thus done by Grandpa to construct this man as a ‘bad person’. The description is also upgraded from the previous two stories – this person intentionally committed an illegal action, and he is not remorseful. There is more laughter in response from the recipients and Grandpa repeats the upgraded part of this transgression: ‘he’s bragging about it’ (line 117). This repeat receives an affiliative response from Doc 2 who responds with an elongated ‘yeah’ and shakes her head (line 119).

Grandpa continues his story with a description of what the man told the ‘cops’ at the border (lines 120–126). Grandpa uses the term ‘cops’ here when Doc 1 has used ‘police’ in the previous story. ‘Cops’ is a more vernacular term for a police officer (Jefferson, 1974) and using this term here may highlight contempt from Grandpa that the police let the man cross the border without a proper exemption. In a similar way to the previous narratives, Grandpa also uses reported speech to animate the transgression: ‘oh $\Gamma \mathrm { m }$ only going to get tyres for me bike’. Grandpa then reports that the ‘cops’ let him in on ‘compassionate grounds’ (this was the only way to get an exemption to cross the border at this time) before repeating the reported reason ‘to get tyres for his bike’, which is obviously not related to the need for a compassionate exemption (line 129). Grandma affiliates with the indignation of this reason for crossing the border by questioning how getting tyres for a bike can be classed as ‘compassionate’ (line 133). There is further moral accounting within Grandma’s turn here as many people who did have grounds for a compassionate exemption (e.g. a family funeral) were declined exemptions to cross borders but this man was apparently allowed to cross for a trivial reason. At lines 135–136, there is further reported speech from grandpa, again repeating information about the tyres and adding that the man reported that he would ‘be straight back’. Grandpa expands to describe what the man really did across the border, suggesting that he lied to the border police (lines 139–140). Grandpa describes that the man spent ‘a couple of days’ there and thus did not come ‘straight back’. The described activity in Queensland involved going to a ‘tattoo parlour’. Further moral accounting can be seen in these descriptions – the man did not cross the border to do an essential activity, or even shopping, or visiting family/friends, but engaged in an activity sometimes associated with ‘criminals’ and also an activity that requires close contact with another person (i.e. he could not have been social distancing). Grandpa finishes his turn with ‘and God knows (whatever)’ thus leaving unsaid what other reprehensible behaviour the man may also have committed.

The accounts of the man’s reported transgressional conduct does not end here, however. At lines 143–144 Grandpa expands again to report that ‘he videoed it all on his little video camera’. The addition of ‘on his little video camera’ makes the turn an overwrought utterance (Schegloff, 2002), which highlights his intent to video record and keep the camera inconspicuous to others. The OT completes the story (‘and then sent the footage to current affair’, lines 147 and 149), displaying her understanding of the upshot of the story: that is, the protagonist is so openly dishonest that he brags about his conduct by providing recordings of it to be broadcast on national television. The story ending receives some laughter in response as well as responses of indignation from the OT and Grandma of ‘Gosh’ and ‘Oh my goodness’ (lines 155 and 156).

Across these three successive stories, the participants co-construct protagonists as participating in intentional transgressions by breaking rules and restrictions implemented during the pandemic. The stories involved explicit formulations of transgressions to pandemic regulations as well as the participants’ expressions of moral indignation towards that behaviour. Activities that were usually acceptable, and could potentially go unnoticed, and fairly mundane norms (travelling interstate, having a house party) were depicted as actions that breeched previous behaviours, and their visibility were produced as challenges to the normal pre-COVID behaviour. Further, the shared sense of outrage and shared laughter worked to solidify the participants shared culture-in-action (Baker, 2000; Goodwin et al., 2012). This demonstrates morality work co-constructed within social interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Discussion

Moral work is pervasive in and through social interaction (Bergmann, 1998; Danby and Emmison, 2014; Drew, 1998; Stokoe and Edwards, 2009; Tileaga, 2010). Much of this moral work is implicit, or ‘seen but unnoticed’ (Garfinkel, 1967). At times however, morality suffuses conversation and becomes more explicit (Drew, 1998). Life, in some countries such as Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic involved adherence to strict rules and regulations that were imposed by governments and other organisations and limited peoples’ lives in extraordinary ways. This paper showed how, within the paediatric palliative care consultations, adherence to pandemic rules became morally expected, and moral concerns about actual or potential violations to these rules became relevant in and through social interaction during this period. The six fragments presented here showed how actions that were typically socially acceptable (‘cruising’ the shops, crossing a state border) became transgressions of the moral order, and thus morally reprehensible, during this time. The participants oriented to and managed these moments within social interaction.

Fragments 1 and 2 showed that, when proposing a typically acceptable activity that was restricted or proscribed during the pandemic (such as window shopping or having makeovers), participants went to additional interactional effort of adding parentheticals or post-expansions to their turns to display their awareness of such activities only being reasonable in a ‘post-COVID’ future. In so doing, participants worked to pre-emptively avoid potential negative moral judgement from their interlocutor that could be associated with doing something that violated pandemic culture. Fragment 3 showed how participants also engaged in more extensive defensive detailing to account for the propriety of their actions and display themselves as not having transgressed the pandemic moral order. In these first three fragments, participants’ accountability practices could be seen to be related to ‘saving face’ and maintaining a positive portrayal of an appropriate identity (Goffman, 1967). Lastly, fragments 4–6 showed how participants engaged in storytelling that condemned the transgressions of other people who had engaged in misconduct according to pandemic rules. These last three fragments provided examples of participants creating a shared (negative) emotional stance towards other (non-present) people who had transgressed the moral order. Across these six fragments that show how the participants made accountable behaviour during the pandemic, and the associated moral concerns, became relevant in and through the social organisation of interaction. Displays of ‘doing the right thing’ during the pandemic and knowing and following the rules to reduce the risk of public infections was of interactional concern to participants. The findings add to the previous CA research that provides systematic evidence for the intrinsic quality of morality in everyday social interaction (e.g. Danby and Emmison, 2014; Drew,

1998; Sterponi, 2009; Stokoe and Edwards, 2009). These pediatric palliative care consultations collected during the COVID-19 pandemic shows how moral order is talked into being, while at the same time, oriented to by others. In other words, we see ‘culturein-action’ (Baker, 2000). The social interactions showed how activities that were unremarkable were now managed by participants as having to be accountable actions to ensure that they were participating in a new moral order. The transgressions reported further cemented the unity of the participants as being members of this new way of acting and understanding these new social conditions.

In Sacks’ (1992) lectures, he classified two types of accountable actions: Class 1 and Class 2. While Class 1 actions have direct consequences flowing from the act done (e.g. if you put your foot in the fire, you will be burned), Class 2 actions require someone to see and do something to you to get the negative consequences. In other words, Class 2 actions are things you can get away with if not caught. The transgressions that have been the focus of this paper fall into the category of Class 2 actions. They are actions that are policed, but that someone could potentially get away with, without consequence, if not caught ‘in the act’. The negotiation of morality-in-action involved participants displaying to each other that they were not the type of person who would try to commit a Class 2 transgression and also condemning those people who had been caught for such a transgression. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a natural experiment for how accountable actions and a moral order are re-negotiated in and through our social interactions when our taken-for-granted ‘natural facts of life’ changed in response to a global public health crisis. Building on understandings of the sociocultural dimensions of the COVID19 pandemic (Lupton and Willis, 2021), the current study highlights the moral consequences of pandemics.

The interactions examined in this study were within a specific context of a healthcare consultation with families of child patients who had compromised immune systems due to their complex, serious conditions. It may be that the moral order of the pandemic was particularly salient in this environment because participants may be more aware of presenting themselves as avoiding potential infection risk for their child. Future research may examine pandemic morality-in-action in other social contexts, including mundane social interactions.
