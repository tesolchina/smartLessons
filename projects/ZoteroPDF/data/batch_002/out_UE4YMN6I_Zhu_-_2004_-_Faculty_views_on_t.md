# Abstract

This study examined faculty views on academic writing and writing instruction. Data reported in this article came from ten qualitative interviews with business and engineering faculty members. Transcripts of the interviews were analyzed inductively and recursively, and two views on academic writing and writing instruction were identified. One view held that academic writing largely involved transferring general writing skills, and writing instruction would be most effectively provided by writing/language teachers. The other view recognized the unique thought and communication processes entailed in academic writing and the role of both content course faculty and writing instructors in academic writing instruction. However, content course faculty and writing instructors each assumed a different set of responsibilities. Implications of the findings for academic writing research and instruction are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

The last two decades have witnessed a steady growth in research on academic writing. One of the most significant findings of this body of research is that ‘‘students entering academic disciplines need a specialized literacy that consists of the ability to use discipline-specific rhetorical and linguistic conventions to serve their purposes as writers’’ (Berkenkotter,

Huckin, & Ackerman, 1991, p. 19). This body of research highlights a sociocultural dimension of academic literacy and reveals that writing in academic contexts is governed by the communicative purposes shared, and communicative conventions sanctioned, by members of specific discourse communities (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Geisler, 1994; Hyland, 2000; Swales, 1990). A significant amount of research has focused on academic genres, particularly on generic structure and features. Research findings show that structural and textual features of genres vary both within and across academic disciplines and that such variation embodies different social relationships between the reader and the writer as well as different values and beliefs underlying discursive practices in various discourse communities (Chang & Swales, 1999; Conrad, 1996; Hyland, 1997, 1999a, 1999b).

In addition to professional genres, academic writing research has also examined the genres/tasks students are expected to perform in university content classrooms (Braine, 1989, 1995; Bridgeman & Carlson, 1984; Canseco & Byrd, 1989; Carson, 2001; Hale et al., 1996; Horowitz, 1986; West & Byrd, 1982; Zhu, 2004). In one of the first studies on student writing tasks, Horowitz (1986) analyzed 54 writing assignments from one graduate and 28 undergraduate courses taught in 17 departments of an American university. Horowitz identified seven categories of writing tasks expected of students: summary of/reaction to a reading; annotated bibliography; report on a specified participatory experience; connection of theory and data; case study; synthesis of multiple sources; and research project. While Horowitz’s study did not have a particular disciplinary focus, other studies examined written genres required of students in specific disciplines (e.g., Braine, 1989, 1995; Canseco & Byrd, 1989; West & Byrd 1982; Zhu, 2004). One finding is that much of what students need to write, particularly in upper division undergraduate and graduate level courses, is specifically tied to their disciplines.

Academic writing research that has examined writing in specific disciplinary courses indicates that writing serves different purposes in different courses and requires students to assume different social roles, and that communicative conventions are intricately intertwined with the content for, the aims of, and student roles in writing. More specifically, academic readers approach student writing with different sets of expectations, depending on the goals of writing, the perceived roles of the student writers, and the academic readers’ own disciplinary expertise. Herrington’s studies (1985a, 1985b) in two chemical engineering courses, Laboratory and Design, showed that students assumed different social roles in their writing in the two courses and were expected to use different lines of reasoning and provide different types of evidence depending on their roles. Faigley and Hansen’s study (1985) of writing in a psychology course and a sociology course showed different reactions to student writing from readers with different degrees of disciplinary expertise and different aims for writing. Kathy’s paper, written in the psychology course, was ranked highly by the teaching assistant because of its adherence to organization, style, and format requirements of experimental reports but not by the professor, who detected problems with research design and discussion. Linda’s paper, written for both her sociology course and a writing course designed to teach writing in the social sciences, received quite different grades and feedback from the sociology professor and the English professor teaching the writing course. While the English professor was largely concerned with the surface features in Linda’s paper, the sociology professor paid more attention to ‘‘what knowledge the student had acquired than in how well the report was written’’ (p. 147).

Research on academic discourse communities, student tasks/genres, and reader expectations has both provided valuable information for and raised questions about academic writing instruction. An important issue concerns the role of writing instructors and content course professors in helping students develop academic literacy. Faigley and Hansen (1985), based on the findings of their study, pointed out that ‘‘both the professional and liberal arts aims for teaching writing pose major difficulties for a writing teacher from outside the student’s discipline’’ (p. 141). In the field of English for Academic Purposes, a debate has centered on to what extent EAP writing teachers should socialize students into disciplinary discursive practices and address specific aspects of disciplinary discourse. Spack (1988) argues that

‘‘English teachers cannot and should not be held responsible for teaching writing in the disciplines. The best we can accomplish is to create programs in which students can learn general inquiry strategies, rhetorical principles, and tasks that can transfer to other course work’’ (pp. 40–41).

Other researchers, however, argue that language teachers should and can play a role in assisting students to acquire academic literacy through integrating authentic academic writing tasks in writing courses (e.g., Braine, 1988; Johns, 1988). Johns, in particular, argues that ‘‘ ‘general’ academic English, employing artificially constructed topics and materials, is insufficient for students who are exposed daily to the linguistic and cultural demands of authentic university classes’’ (p. 706).

Whether some common academic literacy skills are transferable and what the place is of these skills in the EAP writing curriculum has been discussed in publications concerning EAP writing theories and instructional approaches (e.g., Dudley-Evans, 1995; Johns, 1988, 1990, 1997). More recently, Hyland (2002) argues that addressing specificity is an essential task of EAP/ESP writing instructors. Hyland (2002) warns against the adoption of an ‘‘autonomous’’ view of literacy, which ‘‘misleads learners into believing that they simply have to master a set of rules which can be transferred across fields’’ (p. 392). Hyland sees teaching specificity as a good starting point.

Much discussion in this debate, thus far, has focused on the role of the language/writing teachers in teaching academic literacy and justifiably so. Yet, given that much academic writing occurs in content courses, and given that the changing demographic profile of the student population in many institutions makes it necessary that responsibility ‘‘be extended to all faculty for improving the academic literacy skills of our language minority students’’ (Snow, 1997, p. 292), it is important to examine faculty views on academic literacy and on faculty role in literacy instruction. Several studies have examined faculty views on academic literacy. For example, Johns (1991) interviewed two experienced political science professors, who identified six factors that they believed contributed to academic ‘‘illiteracy’’: lack of disciplinary schemata; weakness in identifying the larger purposes of texts; little planning when reading and producing texts; inability to connect concepts with examples or facts; limited disciplinary vocabulary; and ‘‘unwillingness’’ on the part of the students to be objective when approaching texts or topics representing conflicting values or beliefs.

An examination of content course professors’ views on academic writing and writing instruction could shed light on some of the beliefs underlying writing practices and instruction in content courses, which in turn could provide useful information for academic literacy instruction in the EAP context. This is the rationale for the study reported below.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Context and participants

The data reported here were collected as part of a larger study designed to examine several aspects of writing across disciplines. An essential goal of the larger study is to understand ESL students’ target academic writing needs by examining the writing demands and instruction available in university content classrooms. The study took place at a large, public research university in the Southeast of the United States. The university offers various bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral programs and enrolled about 35,000 students at the time of the study. The larger study collected data from several sources, including interviews of 23 faculty members from various disciplines. I report below the interview data from 10 business and engineering professors. I chose to focus on business and engineering here because they represent disciplines that are most attractive to international students (Davis, 1998). Examining business and engineering faculty’s views on academic writing and writing instruction could contribute to an understanding of various aspects of writing in the content classrooms many ESL students will enter.

Six business and five engineering faculty members were interviewed. I considered knowledge and willingness, two important requirements for interviewees (Rubin & Rubin, 1995), when selecting the initial interviewees. I contacted via e-mail a few faculty members who were experienced and who I believed had knowledge of writing in their program and field (e.g., tenured faculty members and assistant professors in their later years on tenure-track, program directors, dissertation advisers, and faculty with numerous publications). Interviews were then set up when the persons contacted were willing to be interviewed. The interview sample then ‘‘snowballed’’ as those interviewed mentioned or recommended colleagues who were perceived to be able to provide more information or have knowledge of a particular area. To maximize the possibility that the sample represented different points of view, a third consideration in selecting interviewees according to Rubin and Rubin (1995), I contacted and interviewed faculty teaching at the undergraduate as well as graduate levels. Four faculty members interviewed were teaching at the graduate level only, two at the undergraduate level only, and five at both undergraduate and graduate levels.2 The interviews were tape-recorded with permission;

one interview with a business professor could not be recorded due to technical difficulties. Because I would not be able to offer quotes representing the professor’s own voice from the unrecorded interview, I did not include it in this article. Thus, the present article is based on the ten-recorded interviews.

# 2.2. Qualitative interviews

‘‘Qualitative interviews’’ (Rubin & Rubin, 1995) were used because the purpose of the study was to understand ‘‘people’s more personal, private, and special understandings’’ (Arksey & Knight, 1999, p. 4) of academic writing. Specifically, semi-structured interviews were used in this study, with an interview guide prepared in advance (see Appendix A for the interview guide). Compatible with the central goal of the study, to assess students’ target writing needs, questions in the interview guide focused on the types of writing assignments required of students; faculty perception of student writing skills; faculty role in helping students develop academic writing skills; and the importance of writing. As is often the case with semi-structured interviews, the order of the questions was not fixed during the interviews, nor was the exact phrasing of the questions. The general, lead questions in the interview guide were asked first and were often followed by more specific questions to elicit further information. For example, the question on faculty perception of student writing skills was followed by more specific questions concerning writing performance by undergraduate versus graduate students and by ESL students. Interviewees were also asked questions pertaining specifically to their disciplines and programs and were asked to share anything that they believed to be relevant to issues of academic writing at the end of the interview. Many interview questions focused on aspects of writing relevant to both native and nonnative English speaking students (e.g., faculty views concerning the importance and nature of academic writing and writing instruction). Nevertheless, insight can be gained specifically about ESL students’ target writing needs and about EAP writing instruction from these interviews, although we cannot assume that the needs of native and nonnative English speaking students are always identical.

The interviews ranged from about 30 to 60 minutes, and my role during the interviews was to raise questions, rephrase the questions if necessary, listen to the responses, prompt for further information, ask for clarifications, check with the interviewees my interpretation of their responses, and answer faculty questions. Faculty interviewees also raised questions about academic writing, which I answered. For example, during one interview, an engineering professor raised several questions, one of which concerned the use of peer feedback. We then spent a few minutes discussing how peer feedback might be used in engineering classrooms.

# 2.3. Data analysis

The tape-recorded interviews were then transcribed. Informal analysis of the interviews started at the transcribing stage where summaries and notes were written about some of the interviews. Formal analysis began when the transcripts, totaling 77 single-spaced pages, were coded. Procedures utilized to analyze the interview data were compatible with those recommended for analyzing qualitative interviews (Arksey & Knight, 1999; Rubin &

Rubin, 1995). First, two interviews from business and engineering each were examined and preliminary coding categories developed and defined. The coding categories were then applied to the rest of the transcripts, and brief phrases describing the categories were written beside the interview segments that illustrated the categories. New categories were added as the interview transcripts were coded and were applied to interviews previously coded; several categories were combined. Thus, coding was very much a recursive process. To enhance consistency of coding, I kept notes which contained, among other things, definitions of the categories and decisions made for segments to which more than one category seemed to apply. I referred back to the notes frequently throughout the coding process. Once coding was completed, the coded transcripts were set aside and then reviewed. A few parts were recoded at this point. After this, the coded segments were cut out of the transcripts, with interviewee codes and brief notes referring to the context of the segments. Segments with the same codes were grouped and placed in a folder. Then, the interview segments were compared both within and across categories for similarities and differences and for links among themes identified.

# 3. Results

The faculty members discussed a variety of issues during the interviews. Due to the scope of this paper, I share below only faculty comments concerning the importance of writing, the nature of academic writing, and faculty roles in teaching and responding to writing in the disciplines. Ample quotes from the interviews are shared to illustrate the views expressed.

# 3.1. Importance of writing

Both the business and engineering faculty emphasized the importance of writing. They highlighted the role of writing as an important communication tool for business people and engineers in the real world. The importance of writing for career success in the business world was emphasized by the business professors:

We demand that students be able to create papers, reports; they have to do this all the time; they do it all the time in business administration, in the real world, and it’s one of the things you are most highly visible for to the people above you. (Business 2, p. 5)

It is very important . . . most of our world is based on requests for proposals, being able to circulate white papers on ideas and comments. (Business 1, p. 4)

Comments from the engineering faculty echoed those given by the business professors, again emphasizing how important writing skills are for career success, particularly in terms of ‘‘selling ideas’’:

In my discipline, writing is very important because engineers in the work place are considered professional people. Many engineers are in jobs working either as consultants or high level professionals within their companies, and they’ll all be writing reports, formal reports that will be going to clients or to upper management of their own company. They’ll be writing business letters and memos, and engineers, unlike a lot of other professionals, I think are almost always trying to sell their own ideas. They are not just reporting results of something that is going on but they design things, collect and analyze data and try to draw conclusions from it. And so to me, it [writing] is critical for the engineer to be a success, not in every job but a large number of engineering jobs. (Engineering 1, p. 1)

Critical. If they want to be successful, written communication skills, communication skills in general, are critical . . . If they are in any job environment where they interact with people, clients whatever, communication skills are critical. (Engineering 2, p. 3)

Very important. Actually to find a job later on, more depends on English actually. (Engineering 6, p. 7)

Interestingly, while writing was perceived to be a critical skill for professional success in both fields, the emphasis given to it in the academic curriculum seemed to differ in the two disciplines. This was reflected in faculty comments concerning the place of writing in the business and engineering curricula. Comments from the business faculty indicated that the importance of writing was recognized at the policy level, and there were some concerted efforts to integrate writing into the business curriculum, although the success of policy implementation may not always be known:

We have a college wide requirement that all classes are to have evaluated written work in them. I am not promising you that it’s actually done every single time, but that’s the college policy, and as far as I know, it’s pretty much universal. We actually do require writing and we think people should have it. (Business 2, p. 1)

So now what we are trying to do is to integrate that [writing] into all of the courses so faculty are encouraged to assign writing and have students make presentations. Not everybody does it, but at least we are trying to get at it . . . (Business 3, p. 7)

Compared to comments from the business faculty, those from the engineering professors suggested that integration of writing into the engineering curriculum was more limited, as reflected in comments such as ‘‘I can say that it is a part of many courses but only a small part’’ (Engineering 1, p. 2). The more limited integration of writing was also indicated in one engineering faculty member’s comment, which contrasted the attention given to writing in the curriculum with the importance of writing in the real world:

In school, they [students] don’t see it [writing] as a necessary skill. When they get out to work, they’ll change their mind on that. They’ll tell you it’s an important skill. But when they are in school, they don’t see it as an important skill, and professors don’t present it as an important skill. (Engineering 2, p. 3)

The faculty members accounted for the place of writing in the academic curriculum by referring to disciplinary culture. Two engineering professors made this particularly clear. One said that there was little practice on writing in engineering because of the quantitative nature of the discipline:

But we tend to be as a discipline very quantitative. We are more interested in the math, the graphs, the tables, and not so much in the texts. (Engineering 2, p. 1)

Later in the interview, this professor related lack of writing practice in engineering to disciplinary culture again:

But in the engineering culture, there is very little emphasis on the educational environment on writing skills . . . when it comes down to practice, very little emphasis. And I don’t think that’s any big secret. (Engineering 2, p. 5)

Another engineering professor mentioned student major as a reason for moderating writing assignments, indicating a relationship between the amount of writing practice and the nature of the discipline. This professor mentioned that he required short essays in his undergraduate classes, and when I asked him how long the essays were, he responded,

Maybe 500 words. That’s two pages. Again, remember we are engineers, we are not English majors. So I have to moderate what I ask because not everyone is interested. (Engineering 4, p. 2)

Note that the different disciplines (Engineering vs. English) were given as the reason for making the essay relatively short for the engineering students.

Comments from the business professors, however, indicated that writing skills were considered essential in the business curriculum. In fact, writing skills were considered business skills:

We happen to think of it [writing] in the College of Business Administration as a business skill. Obviously, it’s a communication skill. Being good at communication is important to business. (Business 2, p. 1)

According to one business professor, an emphasis on communication, both oral and written, characterized Business Information Systems as a unique discipline and separated it from other similar fields (e.g., Computer Sciences). This professor contrasted assignments required in Computer Sciences with those required in Business Information Systems and pointed out that assignments in Computer Sciences ‘‘are more mathematically oriented. They are more programming oriented’’ (Business 1, p. 4). According to this professor, discussing how information technology projects would be managed constituted an important feature of the assignments in his courses:

whereas in my course I ask ‘how would you manage this project?’ and you can’t do that in a mathematical equation. You have to say that is how I would treat my people, this is how I would schedule them, here is the budget I would need, which has to be a written assignment, so I think that is what a College of Business Information Systems program is all about. It is combining the technical with the managerial with the human aspects of the problem and bringing them all together. (Business 1, p. 4)

The professor added that an emphasis on writing ‘‘is what I think differentiates us from the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences’’ (Business 1, p. 4).

To some extent, the attention accorded to writing in business could be seen as a reflection of the discipline’s desire to respond to the needs and expectations of the business world, particularly the prospective employers, who were perceived to be the ‘‘customers’’ of business programs.3 During the interviews, two business faculty members mentioned prospective employers’ needs when discussing the place of writing in the business curriculum. Their comments revealed that communication skills, spoken and written, were on the very top of the list of skills prospective employers desire, and this was one reason for emphasizing writing in business course work. One of the professors said,

We try to present a consistent message. They [students] know . . . our majors understand we talk to each other about what’s important in our courses and we go in and say ‘here is what they [employers] want. They want communication skills.’ See, this is ranked in the order of importance [the faculty member showed me a list of skills]. Communication skills, then they look at work experience, then they look at interpersonal skills. What do they want? They want somebody who is smart, who is motivated, who is competent, and the academic credentials come down last, but it’s more important to be a good communicator. (B6, p. 1)

# 3.2. Nature of academic writing

The faculty members shared their views on academic writing in the interviews. Their comments indicated two related views concerning the nature of academic writing.

3.2.1. Academic writing largely entails the transfer of general writing skills to different contexts

This view held that success in academic writing largely depended on a set of welldeveloped general skills which could be transferred to different contexts. The general skills that faculty mentioned often in the interviews included audience awareness, logical organization, paragraph development (e.g., a paragraph should have one main idea only), clarity, sentence structure, grammar, and mechanics. This view, however, acknowledged that students would need to grasp discipline-specific terminology. Responding to the question concerning similarities and differences between writing in the interviewee’s discipline and other disciplines, one business professor emphasized the similarities in terms of good organization and clarity:

Economics as with other disciplines has its own jargon. Other than that, I don’t think so. I think the goal would be to organize something well and present the results with clarity and with good grammar and punctuation. (Business 3, p. 4)

One engineering professor emphasized the common need to consider the audience:

You know it’s like anything. Your reader is not going to be that technical. So it has to be a general audience. When you write a journal paper, people reading it are practicing engineers, so you have an obligation to write in a style and manner so that what you did and what you found can be easily understood. Otherwise, it serves no purpose. So I think that is true in any subject. (Engineering 4, p. 6).

The emphasis on general skills was further reflected in the belief that writing skills did not have to be developed in particular disciplinary context:

I don’t think we need necessarily business examples if we want to learn critical thinking, organization, writing for argumentation, writing for persuasion, writing for agreement. It doesn’t matter what the topic is. I’ll take the topic the professor gives me and work on the skill. (Business 2, p. 10)

3.2.2. Academic writing involves knowledge of unique thought and communication processes; basic/general writing skills, however, serve as the foundation

This view recognized the uniqueness of writing in diverse disciplinary contexts with respect to thought processes and ways of communication. One engineering professor commented on the uniqueness of engineering writing because of the design and experimental processes involved:

I think it’s a bit different just because of the nature of our work and the way we traditionally have organized our processes, our design processes, our experimental processes, and so on. I think there is some uniqueness there. I think anybody who tries to teach English writing to engineering students should spend some time looking at engineering reports, published papers, engineering memos, and things like that. I think it would help them target the students better. (Engineering 5, p. 7–8)

A business faculty member described a business writing style that values briefness and simplicity:

If you write these huge volumes, like you do in your English class or whatever, you are going to bore your audience to tears and you are not going to be effective . . . You have to write in such a way as to gain attention and keep attention, and has to be short, sweet and simple. On the other hand, it has also to lead them by the hand through every aspect of the business. (Business 5, p. 3)

Thus, this view saw that academic writing involved more than the simple transfer of general writing skills and would require writers to have specific knowledge about disciplinary thought and communication processes. However, it considered the general skills as the foundation. In fact, this view implied a layered model of academic writing, with the disciplinary thought and communication processes built on a foundation laid by well-developed general writing skills. This view, for example, was reflected in comments given by the business faculty member quoted above on business writing style. When asked about how business writing skills could be developed, the faculty member said, ‘‘Number 1, you should learn proper English’’ (Business 5, p. 4). In a similar vein, an engineering professor mentioned three skills that students would need in order to write successfully in engineering: the skill to present ideas concisely; the skill to use a ‘‘somewhat’’ engaging style; and the skill to ‘‘condense, summarize technical literature.’’ The professor described the last one as ‘‘kind of discipline specific’’ but believed that ‘‘if they [students] can’t do the first two, then they won’t be able to do the third one’’ (Engineering 2, p. 3).

# 3.3. Faculty role in teaching and responding to writing in the disciplines

The business and engineering faculty interviewed believed that they had a role to play in helping students develop academic writing skills. This belief was expressed in comments such as ‘‘all professors are obligated at all times to try to help students develop writing skills’’ (Business 2, p. 1). One engineering professor in fact indicated that content course professors would have a more important role to play, given their knowledge of writing in their disciplines:

First of all, I would agree that the professors in all disciplines have a role to play. I believe that their role is more important than the role of the English professors simply because in the discipline we all should have a good understanding of the kinds of writing the students will be expected to do, you know, when they are practicing in their field later on . . . (Engineering 1, p. 6)

Perhaps not surprisingly, faculty members interviewed saw their role in teaching academic writing as secondary to teaching content and technical skills. One business professor put it this way, ‘‘I think it [teaching writing] is secondary to the technical skills for the particular course that they are in, but if you can see how to help them, you should’’ (Business 2, p. 1). One engineering professor shared this view and said that ‘‘I see my role more as helping them become better designers than writers. So if it is mentioned, it’s tangential. It’s never the main part’’ (Engineering 4, p. 10).

During the interviews, some faculty members described their role in helping students develop academic writing skills more specifically in terms of providing writing opportunities and feedback. Two faculty members defined their role as providers of opportunities for writing:

And so definitely I try to play a critical role in giving them the practice. I don’t know whether I give them enough feedback, but I try to give them the experience of different types. (Engineering 5, p. 7)

We would all say we do that [teaching writing]. I would say I doubt we know whether we succeed or not. Our implication is that because you do the task, you get better at it. (Business 2, p. 6)

Faculty comments indicated that the focus was on content and accuracy of information when faculty members provided feedback on student writing although spelling and grammar errors were corrected or identified when necessary. One business professor said:

I see my role as when I am handed something in, I read it for content first. I don’t read it for grammar or punctuation. Is the person bringing the right facts together to draw the right conclusions to go to the next step in the problem? If I see that, then, I am pleased. I am not going to critique the writing skills of the project. It is where I see the writing or the ESL hindering the person from getting the content that . . . If I see that, I’ll circle paragraphs, I’ll draw lines of logic flow, saying basically there is a gap in the logic here or your understanding is not clear in this part of the paper. Now once I give it back to them, I sort of leave it up to them as to whether they want to come back and say, ‘‘help me do that better.’’ I would say that not all of them do that. (Business 1, p. 3)

An engineering professor said that his chief goal was to help students in the technical area when providing feedback:

Actually, I don’t try to improve their writing because I feel their writing is pretty good but their technical problems, for example, if they couldn’t analyze, I try to help to improve . . . more in the technical area, not in the actual writing of the report. (Engineering 6, p. 4)

Later on, this professor said,

I certainly would like to point it out if I discovered something wrong in the writing. I would certainly point it out to them. (Engineering 6, p. 6)

Two faculty members (B3 and B5) reported that they allowed students opportunities to revise based on feedback they provided.4 One professor said that graduate students in his class would do a number of article synopses and were given opportunities for revision if a paper was rejected. The decision for rejecting a paper, however, was made based on the content rather than the writing:

I should clarify that. I either accept or don’t accept the paper. When I accept the paper, that means that they convey to me that they understood the main thrust of the article. When I don’t accept the paper, that means that . . . I never reject a paper because of the grammar and the writing style. I would reject it because they didn’t understand the article . . . Now, if a student has turned in the paper on time, and I reject it, then they rewrite it and get it back to me. They have the option of doing that. They can do that as long as they want. They keep rewriting and getting it back to me until I accept it. (Business 3, p. 4)

Although this professor primarily evaluated the papers on content, ‘‘the things that I find I spend most time on is correcting their grammar and English usage’’ (Business 3, p. 3). This professor mentioned that he even wrote students little notes sometimes about the differences between ‘‘that’’ and ‘‘which,’’ ‘‘further’’ and ‘‘farther,’’ and ‘‘affect’’ and ‘‘effect.’’ The professor reported that he noticed improvement in his students’ writing during the semester.

During the interviews, the faculty expressed two views on academic writing instruction. The first view, consistent with the view that academic writing largely involved the transfer of general writing skills, held that academic writing instruction would be most effectively provided by the writing instructors although content course faculty should help the students as much as possible, through, for example, providing opportunities for writing and providing guidelines for and feedback on student writing.

Faculty comments indicated that this view was rooted in notions of disciplinary specialization and expertise. A business professor’s comment illustrated this view and its source:

We should stick to the applied stuff we are experts at, and if there are other experts in the college, let’s let the other professionals do the teaching [of writing]. It would be presumptuous for me to think that I can teach communication better than you. You had better be better at it than me. It’s your Ph.D. It’s your life, and your application of skill goes to that. I want to see the result. But to think that I can generate the results better than the outsiders, there is no reason to believe that. (Business 2, p. 10)

The second view suggested a process of academic writing instruction jointly undertaken by language/writing and content course instructors. Consistent with the layered model of academic writing, which saw general skills as the foundation upon which disciplinespecific literacy could be built, this view of writing instruction held that language/writing teachers ought to be responsible for helping students develop basic/general writing skills, and content course instructors would assume a leading role in teaching aspects of writing specific to a discipline. This view was presented elaborately by an engineering professor. This professor did not seem to see the need for offering writing courses specifically designed for engineering majors (he referred to this type of courses as ‘‘some kind of a course on report writing’’), and emphasized the role of content course professors in teaching discipline-specific writing:

I think I see the role as splitting. As a sort of customer of the English professors, what I would like to get from them, I would like for the English professors to show my students proper vocabulary, proper punctuation and still be able to instill creativity. I would also like to see them helping the student to develop the ability of expressing some logic, logical steps or whatever. That kind of background, good vocabulary, good punctuation skills and good grammar skills and some good creativity and good logic. Then our work will be pretty simple in the sense that we can help them to plan and express the kinds of information to people in the discipline. Like in engineering, for example, I don’t think that it is so important that our students get some kind of a course on report writing but that they be able to get all of the other stuff so that when they get here in our classes we can begin the second half ‘here’s what you need to include in your report.’ Give them perhaps an outline, ‘do your report by this outline.’ Classes will review drafts of reports, comment on them and send them back to our students for a final draft. We could focus then not so much on finding grammatical errors but really on the completeness with which they express various topics and looking at the organization and flow and looking at the content. The student will have the ability to throw out any kind of proof reading mistakes they might have and if they went and rewrote a section, it would come back well written. So that seems to me that if you think about it, almost the English professors and all of the other professors are almost partners where the English professors take the lead in developing the basic skills of the students; in the discipline, the professor comes in and shapes the student into the way we do things because certainly the writing of an engineer and a psychologist and a historian are to be very different. I don’t think they expect the English Department people to be responsible for all those different disciplines. The professors in the disciplines need to do that. (Engineering 1, p. 6)

The idea that content course professors ought to be responsible for teaching disciplinespecific writing was reiterated by another engineering professor. Earlier in the interview, this professor mentioned three skills that students would need in order to perform writing successfully in engineering, one of which was considered discipline specific (i.e., ‘‘condense, summarize technical literature). Later in the interview, the professor commented on the teaching of these skills:

It’s only a technical writer that can help them [students] with the third one. But I think any writing environment, any communication environment would be very helpful. I don’t think you actually have to focus on technical writing per se; the fact is that many students couldn’t write a letter. (Engineering 2. p. 3)

Thus, the second view of academic writing instruction represented a model of ‘‘division of labor’’ between language/writing instructors and content course professors.

# 4. Discussion and conclusion

This study examined 10 business and engineering faculty members’ views on the importance of writing, the nature of academic writing, and faculty roles in teaching and responding to writing in the disciplines. Both the business and engineering faculty interviewed emphasized the importance of writing as a communication tool in the real world; however, their comments indicated that the emphasis given to writing in the academic curriculum differed in the two disciplines and that the differing place of writing in the curriculum reflected differences in disciplinary cultures. Faculty members expressed two views on academic writing and writing instruction. The first view held that academic writing entailed the transfer of a set of generalizable writing skills across contexts, and as such its development would be most effectively addressed by the writing/language instructors. This view reflected an ‘‘autonomous’’ view of literacy, a view shared by discipline faculty members in other studies (e.g., Lea & Street, 1999, cited in Hyland, 2002). Faculty who expressed this view, however, did indicate that they had a role to play in helping students develop academic writing ability. The second view expressed by the faculty interviewed held that academic writing involved particular disciplinary thought and communication processes, but that basic/general writing skills served as the foundation for the development of discipline-specific processes. The accompanying view of writing instruction held that content and writing instructors ought to be both involved in developing student academic writing skills, but each would play a different role: the writing/language instructors would be charged with the task of teaching basic/general writing skills, and the content course professors would assume responsibility for teaching those aspects of writing related to a specific discipline. Interestingly, those comments that academic writing involved unique thought processes and that the unique processes needed to be taught by faculty in the disciplines came from the engineering faculty, although not all engineering faculty members shared this view. This suggests that faculty in a particular discipline do not all share a particular view of academic literacy and that it is important to examine the diverse views held by the faculty.

Faculty comments concerning their role in academic writing instruction indicated that the faculty saw themselves largely as providers of writing opportunities and as providers of content-related feedback on student writing. Although the professors interviewed reported that some feedback on organization, grammar, and usage was offered in the form of notes, corrections, and identification of errors, the faculty focused on content when commenting on student writing, and opportunities for students to act upon the feedback and revise were not common. Thus, the feedback provided on student writing was largely summative than formative. The greater emphasis on providing opportunities for writing (than on providing feedback) by some faculty members and on content (than on the writing) when commenting on and evaluating student writing suggests an approach which values ‘‘writing to learn’’ (Griffin, 1985; Herrington, 1981) and in which writing is used as a means to help students acquire content knowledge and to meet the pedagogical needs of content area professors and programs (e.g., assessment of learning). While ‘‘writing to learn’’ could provide a good rationale for integrating writing into content courses because of its emphasis on content learning (Herrington, 1981), how it can lead to ‘‘learning to write’’ in university content classrooms is not entirely clear, particularly given the frequent absence of formative feedback and opportunities for revision. The emphasis on ‘‘writing to learn’’ and the view that writing and communication skills are most effectively addressed by the writing instructors suggest that in university content classrooms many second language learners may not always receive the kind of systematic feedback important for writing development. Therefore, EAP writing classrooms constitute an extremely important place for students to improve writing skills through instruction, feedback, and practice. Of particular importance seems to be formative feedback that can help students internalize the revision and editing processes so that students can initiate the revision and editing processes when necessary in the content classrooms. In addition, EAP writing instructors can familiarize students with various resources (e.g., handbooks, dictionaries, websites, writing centers, and tutoring services) available for revision and editing and help students develop strategies for seeking and attending to feedback. Preparing students in this fashion is not simply to ‘‘accommodate students to the content and pedagogy of mainstream academic classes’’ (Benesch, 1993, p. 711); rather, it is providing tools which ESL students can use in the content classrooms so that they can more effectively and independently deal with content in the subject area.

Faculty comments concerning the nature of academic literacy and faculty role in academic writing instruction indicate the need for teaching specificity in the EAP context. The view that academic writing largely entails the transfer of general writing skills reflects an ‘‘individual skill perspective’’ on literacy (Mckay, 1993), and such a view may prevent content area faculty from effectively teaching disciplinary discourse. This view may also prevent content area faculty from effectively addressing ESL students’ writing difficulties and needs as ESL students’ difficulties with academic writing may be perceived simply in terms of lack of general rhetorical and language skills. A few faculty members expressed a view of academic writing that recognized specific disciplinary thought and communication processes, but even for these faculty members, it is not clear to what extent they were involved in teaching those processes. For example, one engineering professor (E5), who commented on the unique processes involved in writing in engineering, perceived his role in helping students develop academic writing skills mainly as the provider of opportunities for writing. Thus, we cannot assume that academic literacy instruction will always take place in content courses, and we need to play a role in teaching specificity. However, the view that unique thought processes are embodied in academic writing, and that these processes need to be taught by content area professors (as expressed in E1 and E2), also poses the familiar perplexing question for teaching specificity in the EAP context: Can EAP writing instructors, not being members of other disciplinary communities, teach the unique thought processes and the conventions used to express them? This is the question that triggered the initial debate on whether or not EAP instructors should initiate students into disciplinary discourse communities (Spack, 1988), and one that seems to continue to present difficulties for the argument for teaching specificity.

Given the socially situated nature of academic literacy (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Berkenkotter et al., 1991; Swales, 1990), teaching specificity is a necessity in the EAP classrooms if we want to effectively prepare our students for academic writing. To address the difficulty posed by the question concerning whether or not EAP writing instructors have the expertise to teach discipline-specific thought and communication processes, we may want to consider more carefully what constitutes teaching specificity, and what are our specific roles in it. Does teaching specificity involve presenting to students specific discourse conventions, along with teaching the related content, values, and thought processes of the target discourse communities? Or does it involve raising students’ awareness that there are multiple literacies through using various authentic tasks and texts? Or does it involve providing opportunities ‘‘for students to conduct their own explorations of the discourse they hope to gain control of’’ (Hirvela, 1997, p. 83), for example, through analysis and reflection in the form of disciplinary portfolios? These all represent efforts to teach specificity, albeit in different ways, but require EAP writing instructors to play different roles. For example, the first conceptualization of teaching specificity would require EAP writing instructors to possess disciplinary knowledge of the target discourse communities and assume the role of experts in the disciplines. The third conceptualization, however, sees EAP instructors as facilitators and perhaps co-investigators of discursive practices in the target communities. In this role, EAP instructors can teach specificity without expert knowledge of the discourse communities whose discursive practices the students are hoping to acquire. In the debate on whether or not to teach specificity, it is the first conceptualization that seems to pose difficulties for teaching specificity with respect to EAP writing instructors’ knowledge of the various discourse communities. This is not to suggest that these are the only roles that EAP writing instructors may play or that EAP instructors cannot teach disciplinary discourse conventions but that it may be useful to consider what constitutes teaching specificity and what are our specific roles in teaching specificity.

Perhaps we may also want to consider what constitutes the specificity we want to teach. To what extent does specificity consist of disciplinary discourse conventions and features, and to what extent can it be defined based on the notion of disciplinary discourse community? Academic writing research has indicated that disciplinary communities are not monolithic and has revealed the ‘‘local contextual dimensions’’ (Casanave, 1995) of disciplinary communities. In addition, academic writing tasks are highly situated (Prior, 1995, 1998), and what are perceived to be appropriate discourse conventions vary within the same discipline, depending on the specific contexts and roles students are expected to assume (Herrington, 1985a, 1985b; Samraj, 2002). Thus, a part of the specificity we need to teach deals with the context for writing (Hyland, 2002; Johns, 1997), and recent research indicates that the context surrounding writing in university classrooms is quite complex.

Samraj (2002) provides a useful framework for depicting the context for writing in university content courses which captures the complexity and interaction of various factors influencing the production of texts in university classrooms. Five contextual variables are identified: academic institution, discipline, course, task and student, and these variables are arranged as layers ‘‘to depict how various contextual elements may be related to one another’’ (p. 165). The most general element, academic institution, is placed at the top, and increasingly more specific elements of the academic discipline, the course, the task, and the student, form layers below it. Each layer is connected to and influenced by but does not completely overlap with the layer(s) above it. Samraj examined graduate student writing in two courses in a Master’s program in environmental science and found that the contextual elements influenced student writing to various degrees and that ‘‘features of different contextual layers can be in dissonance’’ (p. 173). This dissonance and students’ lack of consideration of certain layers of context explained some unsuccessful features in students’ texts. Samraj’s work shows that consideration of the disciplinary context alone is not sufficient and suggests that an understanding of the ‘‘layers of context’’ and their influence on student roles and texts produced should constitute an important part of the specificity we want to teach.

Academic writing is highly complex and is influenced by ‘‘layers of context.’’ Successful academic writing instruction depends on a sound understanding of the complexity of writing in university content classrooms, and investigating faculty views on academic writing and writing instruction represents efforts to understand one aspect of the complexity. Future studies could examine how faculty views on academic writing actually influence instructional practices in content classrooms. Future studies could also examine how faculty members actually comment on student writing and how students perceive and use the feedback. Through continued research, we can gain a better understanding of writing in content courses, which should enable us to better prepare our students for academic writing.
