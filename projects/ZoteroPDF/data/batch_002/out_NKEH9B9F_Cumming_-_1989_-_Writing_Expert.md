# Writing Expertise and SecondLanguage Proficiency\*

Alister Cumming University of British Columbia

The second-language writing performance of 23 young adults on three composition tasks was assessed in relation to their writing expertise and second-language proficiency. Both factors accounted for large proportions of variance in the qualities of written texts and problem-solving behaviors in the second language. But the factors exerted independent effects, suggesting they are psychologically distinct. Writing expertise proved to relate to: qualities of discourse organization and content in the compositions produced; attention to complex aspects of writing during decision making, problem-solving behaviors involving heuristic searches; and well-differentiated control strategies. Second-language proficiency proved to be an additive factor, enhancing the overall quality of writing produced, and interacting with the attention that participants devoted to aspects of their writing. But second-language proficiency did not visibly affect the processes of composing. In all analyses, more cognitively demanding argument and summary tasks produced significantly different behaviors from a less cognitively demanding letter task.

# INTRODUCTION

Writing expertise and second-language proficiency have been studied extensively in recent years, as separate abilities, in quite different bodies of research. But very little is known about how the two combine in writing performance in a second language. It is not clear whether writing expertise and second-language proficiency interact, thereby affecting the processes of writing differently for people who have greater or lesser levels of each. Noris it certain whether writing expertise and second-language proficiency are well-differentiated---making different contributions to writing performance in a second language. If they do interact, which aspects of writing behavior are affected? If they are differentiated, to what extent is this so? How might this appear in writing behavior in a second language?

These issues have come to the fore in recent discussions reconceptualizing writing instruction in a second language. Following advances in mother-tongue writing instruction (reviewed in Scardamalia $\&$ Bereiter, 1986; Hillocks, 1986), many authors have argued that instruetion on writing processes in a second language can form a basis for overcoming the artificial separation between language instruction and intellectual or sociocultural development imposed by conventional language curricula (Zamel, 1982, 1985; Hughey, Wormuth, Hartfield, & Jacobs, 1983; Raimes, 1983; Cummins, 1984; Krashen, 1984; McKay, 1984; Woods, 1984; Cumming, 1985; Edelsky, 1986; Meath-Lang, 1986; Mohan, 1986; Urzua, 1987). Current approaches to writing instruction in a second language (following Graves, 1983 and others) advocate the negotiation of meaning between student writers and their audiences, sequential processes of drafting and revising compositions, and the development oflearners' abilities to diversify their capacities for written expression. This pedagogical orientation stands in marked contrast to conventional approaches to language instruction, which have relied on the transmission of metalinguistic information to students, with little regard for students' thinking about the value and formation of their substantive expression; however, only a limited amount of research---mostly case studies, analyses of test results, or outcomes of programs of action research-has been offered to support these innovations in second-language education. The processes and elements integral to writing in a second language are not well-described or documented. A consensus on two points has emerged from this research, nonetheless.

Firstly, it is evident that many of the processes of writing in a second language are comparable to those of writing in a mother tongue (Zamel, 1983; Raimes, 1985). Within-subjects comparisons of people writing in their first and second languages have shown them to plan content (Jones & Tetroe, 1987), revise texts (Gaskill, 1986),use thinking strategies (Cumming, Rebuffot, & Ledwell, 1989), use uniquely personal writingstyles(Arndt, 1987), and integrate knowledge into writing (Edelsky, 1986) in fundamentally the same way in both languages. Performance errors that do occur while writing in a second language appear to stem from constraints in people's mental capacities to process information (Jacobs, 1982), inadequacies in their writing strategies (Jones, 1983), constraints on their functional hypotheses about language (Corder, 1983), or knowledge in general (Jacobs, 1982). This appears to occur in much the same manner in a second language as it does for writingin a mother tongue (cf. Shaughnessy 1977; de Beaugrande, 1984, Bereiter & Scardamalia 1987).

Secondly, empirical research has converged on distinctions in the cognitive dimensions of writing in a second language. Differences in performance appear to arise-- while writing in a second language--- from the knowledge, procedures, or strategies people use to produce their writing (Jacobs, 1982; Jones, 1983, 1985; Mohan & Lo, 1985; Raimes, 1985, 1987; Cumming, 1986; Jones & Tetroe, 1987). Research on instructional effects would sug. gest that learning strategies--such as setting and monitoring goals for improvement(Cumming, 1986), modeling invention heuristics (Spack, 1984), or attention to pertinent feedback (Cardelle & Corno 1981; Cohen, 1987)--- are aspects of cognition amenable to change resulting in improvements in second language writing performance. But little more has been established in this research.

Differences in cross-cultural values for literate behavior would appear to obtain for many second-language learners (Weinstein, 1984; Zamel, 1987). But research on literacy indicates that similar variation exists within single languages, such as English, internationally (Purves, 1984) or within different subcultures speaking the same language in the same environment (Charnley $\&$ Jones, 1979; Griffiths & Wells, 1983; Heath, 1983; Street, 1984). This would suggest that differing values of literacy may not be a crosslinguistic phenomenon per se (Mohan & Lo, 1985).

Nonetheless, there are major gaps and contradictions in what is known about writing performance in a second language. Forinstance, Widdowson(1983)claims-- along with common wisdom-that people writing in a foreign language are primarily constrained in their attention to choices about textual features of the language. That is, educated adults writing in a new language possess relevant conceptual and discoursal knowledge for composing (based on their native literacy), but they lack information about the syntactic or lexical features of their second language. In contrast, Zamel (1983) claims that, for the six ESL learners she studied, attention to language use was relatively unproblematic and infrequent within their overall processes of writing in a second language.

Jones (1985) has found both claims to have some empirical truth (i.e., for one student but not for another, both of whom wrote ESL compositions of equivalent quality). Moreover, an analysis of Widdowson's claim by Freedman, Pringle, and Yalden (1983, p. 10) argues that the constraints of writing, without full proficiency, in a second language mayimpose psychological limitations on people's abilities to conceptualize their intended meanings and its organization as discourse. This position concurs with research findings on information-processing constraints in the second-language writing observed by Jacobs(1982).

A further discrepancy is evident in descriptions of the decision-making processes involved in planning, editing, or revising writing in a second language- and the difficulty of relating these findings to qualities of the written texts that second-language learners produce(Jacobs, 1982; Jones, 1983). If anything, an image of individual differences is conveyed in most of the studies documenting the mental activity second-language learners apply to their writing processes (Jones, 1983; Raimes, 1985, 1987; Cumming, 1986; Gaskill, 1986; Arndt, 1987; Jones & Tetroe, 1987). On the other hand, a large body of research on the assessment of written compositions confirms the consistency of the characteristics of texts produced by students at different levels of second language proficiency(Carroll, 1980; Jacobs, Zinkgraf, Wormuth, Hartfiel, & Hughey 1981, Perkins, 1983).

Much of this confusion can be attributed to the fact that this research has not adequately distinguished writing expertise from second-language proficiency. Aside from exploratory studies by Raimes (1987) and Jones and Tetroe (1987), research on second-language composing has implicitly confounded these two seemingly different factors. Moreover, only a few studies of secondlanguage writing have controlled for obviousintervening variables--- such as learners' mother tongues, previous education, and cultural backgrounds. Likewise, the variation that could be expectedin different kinds of writing tasks has not been studied systematically. An overriding limitation is that studies of writing processes in a second language have, so far, worked with very small numbers of students, a number too small to permit meaningful statistical analyses or substantive generalizations.

# METHODS

The present study aimed to assess how writing expertise and second-language proficiency relate to the performance of composing in a second language. A 3 (writing expertise) $\times 2$ (ESL proficiency) $\times 3$ (tasks) factorial design was used. Three aspects of writing performance were studied:

1. qualities of texts produced,   
2. attention devoted to aspects of writing during decision making, and   
3. problem-solving behaviors used to control writing processes.

# PARTICIPANTS

Twenty-three young adult Francophone students-- at three levels of writing expertise (in their mother tongue) and two levels of ESL proficiency-participated in the study. Participants were carefully selected so that (1) potential intervening variables (including native language and culture, previous education, age, sex, and instrumental motivation) were controlled for and (2) sufficient variation in writing expertise and second-language proficiency could be isolated for analysis. The participants, all Quebecois(es) in their late teens and early 20s, were studying in an English/French bilingual program at an Ontario university. They were selected from among volunteers who responded to a letter distributed in eight different ESL classes. In return for their participation, each person was offered an evaluation of his or her writing abilities and individual instruction after the research was completed.

Participants were classified, for the purposes of the research, on the basis of their proficiency in ESL and writing expertise in French.' Classification of participants' writing expertise in French was accomplished through holistic rating of compositions they wrote in French; selfratings of abilities to write in Fronch in a variety of common situatons; and self-report.- ofwhether or not they had professional experience writing in French. Correlations among these three variables were very high $( . 8 p < . 0 1$ to . $9 \ p < . 0 0 1 \}$ .Instructions for the writing task were, "Qu'est-ce que vous faites, d'habitude, pour ameliorer vos habilites pour ecrire en anglais?" These compositions were rated independently by two experienced teachers of French $( r { = } . 9 )$ , who had no information on the students' backgrounds or ESL proficiency.

Three levels of writing expertise were distinguished (according to their mother-tongue writing): professionally experienced writers $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { n } = 5 )$ , average student writers $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { n } = 8 )$ and basic writers $\mathbf { \omega } ( \mathbf { n } { = } 1 0 )$ . Among the professionally experienced writers, the two at the intermediate level of ESL proficiency, Claude and Claudine, had published books in French. They appeared to have slightly more experience writing than did their counterparts-Francois, Ferdinand, and Francoise---at the advanced level of ESL proficiency, whose writing experience in French was limited to regular, work-related composing tasks (reports, articles, reviews, letters). Basic writers had self-acknowledged deficiencies in their writing skills, which were obvious as errors, poor rhetorical development, and inadequacies of expression in their written texts. Average students were intermediary between the two extremes.

Participants' proficiency in ESL was established through scores from interview tests developed and administered by the university's ESL faculty. Assessments of oral proficiency were used to prevent confounding with the factor of writing expertise. Two levels of ESL proficiency were distinguished-intermediate and advanced. Intermediate participants received scores of 2.0 or 2.5(out of a maximum of 5.0) on tests of their spoken English. Advanced participants received scores greater than 3.0 on the same test. Documentation on the interview tests indicated that the students' conversational abilities in English were assessed for lexico-grammatical competence; sociolinguistic competence; discourse reception and production; strategic competence; and pronunciation and comprehensibility. Scores on the interview tests proved to correlate closely (.9, $p { < } . 0 0 1$ ) with the participants' length of residence in Ontario. The advanced group had, for the most part, spent a year in Ontario, whereas the intermediate group had spent only one or two months in the

English-speaking environment.

# DATA COLLECTION AND TASKS

Each participant metindividually with the researcher to write three tasks in English, one week apart, for periods ranging from one to three hours. Participants received thinking-aloud training at their first session, using an arithmetic problem (following Ericsson $\&$ Simon, 1984, pp. 375-379). Participants were asked to think aloud in the language(s) they were currently thinking in- during the training and writing sessions. Participants switched frequently between English and French, according to their trains of thought.

Participants wrote- --at separate sessions, in English, while thinking aloud--an informal letter, an expository argument, and a summary of a booklet. Each task was expected to make slightly different demands on participants' writing abilities, entailing differences in such elements as rhetorical form, appropriate register, sources of information, relation to personal experience, and intended audience. The design of the research was not sufficient, however, to test the specific effects these elements might exert on participants' writing.

The letter task asked participants to write a letter in English describing the courses they were currently taking in English. The prompt for the task was a letter from the researcher addressed personally to each participant. The task (similar to one used by Raimes, 1987) was devised by the researcher to represent an informal, but conventional mode of writing, in which participants could compose on a well-structured domain based on familiar experiences.

The argument task was selected from items prepared, tested, and studied by the National Assessment of Educational Progress(1978,p. 381). Theprompt forthe task was phrased, "Some people believe that a woman's place is in the home. Othersdonot. Takeone side ofthisissue. Write an essay in which you state your position and defend it." This task was selected to represent: the kind of writing conventionally required of students in composition tests and courses; a demanding, intellectual topic with abstract as well as personal implications; and expectations for writing in a formal, academic register.

The summary task asked participants to read a popular science booklet, then to write a brief summary ofit. The booklet (Cole, 1982) was a lengthy, 48-page description of the functional anatomy of cats. It contained numerous full-page illustrations and biological diagrams. This task was chosen to resemble an academic assignment, involving the integration of reading and writing, world knowledge, and a fixed information source. Instructions for the task were, "Read this booklet, then write a short summary ofit." The instructions did not specify an audience or purpose for the task, nor were indications given about the kind of summary expected (Hidi & Anderson, 1986).

# TRANSCRIPTION OF PROTOCOLS

Transcription of the think-aloud protocols elicited during the writing sessions was selective but systematic. Only verbalizations of participants' decision making were transcribed. Any words participants uttered, while writing, above and beyond the words of their texts were considered to be instances of decision making-subjects thinking-aloud about their writing. This excluded participants' verbalizations of: their text production (i.e., the sounding out of a phrase before or while writing it down)

or the reading aloud of text already written. The protocols were segmented into separate decision statements, each representing participants' utterances about their writing. To distinguish the stretches of verbalization from one another in an overall protocol, a single criterion---a silence of three seconds or more before and after the statement--- was applied to determine the junctures of decision statements. Following Flower and Hayes (1981) and Ericsson and Simon (1984), these pauses were taken to represent segmentation of units of thought?. All were verified by a second transcriber---a native speaker of French who is an experienced language teacher. Differences perceived in the transcription of English portions of the protocols were discussed and resolved by consensus. These were too few in number to warrant calculations of reliability.

The transcriptions attempted to represent participants' tape-recorded speech as it would usually appear in expository prose, although several special conventions were used. A capital letter indicates the beginning of the spoken equivalent of a sentence; a period indicates its closure, usually followed by a pause. A comma indicates a shorter pause or abrupt shift in the flow of an utterance. A question mark indicates a questioningintonation. Words, phrases, or lettersin double quotation marks indicate participants were treating them as text: by writing(or having written) these items in their compositions; by considering them as potential candidates for text; or by reading them in a source text (such as the prompts for the tasks). Words or phrases inside number signs (#) were spokenin French. Three dots (...) indicate where subjects were trying to complete a phrase but were not able to, as suggested by a rising, prolonged tone. Hesitation markers (e.g., ah, um, $\mathbf { m m } ,$ were transcribed verbatim. Contractions were transcribed where subjects made these reductions in their speech. Although the spelling of words in the transcriptions follows standard conventions, no effort was made to modify subjects' syntactic or morphological deviances from standard forms, these being transcribed to approximate the way they were spoken.

All transcriptions of participants' uses of French in their protocols were verified by a second transcriber---a native-speaker of French who is an experienced language teacher. Differences perceived in the transcription of English portions of the protocols were discussed and resolved by consensus. These were too few in number to warrant calculations of reliability.

# CODING AND RATING OF DATA

The quality of the texts of the 68 compositions? produced for the three tasks were rated for content, discourse organization, and language use. Ratings were done with a slightly modified version of Jacobs, Zinkgraf, Wormuth, Hartfiel and Hughey's (1981) ESL Composition Profile.3 Ratings from one to four were assigned to three aspects of each composition: content, organization, and language use. All of the compositions were rated for the three categories by the researcher and a second rater, who had no access to information about the prior classifications of participants in the study. The independent judgments of both raters were tallied to make a composite, total rating (i.e., maximum of 8). Reliability between the two raters was .72 over 204 judgments.

The second analysis involved coding each decision statement in the 68 protocols for the aspects of writing which participants indicated they were paying attention to as they uttered the statements. Categories for this coding scheme were adopted from Scardamalia and Paris' (1985) study of children's and adults'recall oftheir mothertongue writing. The categories of the scheme represent five aspects of writing people may focus their attention on while composing: language use, discourse organization, gist, intentions, and procedures for writing. These five categories were used to code the aspects of their writing that people referred to in the decision statements they made while composing. They were also used to form combinatorial categories for instances where people focused on more than a single aspect of their writing while making decisions. These were designated as double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple configurations when participants proved to make reference, in their verbal reports, to two, three, four, or five of the basic categories. In this way, the five basic categories permitted 31 possible permutations. Appendix A shows example statements from the more prevalent single and double categories.

The full set ofdata were coded for these five categories by the researcher after establishingreliability $(87 \%$ agreement over 448 coding decisions) with a second rater on a randomly-selected $10 \%$ (i.e., 7) of the protocols. Raters coded each decision statement for the five categories, then the quantity of multiple configurations was derived mechanically from these codings. One week after coding the full set of protocols, the researcher randomly selected another $10 \%$ of the protocols to be assessed for intrarater reliability. The agreement between the initial and subsequent codings averaged $9 5 \%$ over 565 decisions.

The third analysis involved coding all of the decision statements in all of the think-aloud protocols for the problem-solving behaviors which the decision statements indicated participants engaged in while they were writing. The scheme used to code these problem-solving behaviors contained five categories, derived from a preliminary review of the data with respect to categories used to describe problem-solving in mother-tongue writing (Flower & Hayes, 1980, 1984; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1983, 1986) as well as other domains (Newell & Simon, 1972; Case, 1985). These categories distinguish between thinking which involves knowledge telling, problem identification, problem resolution) and heuristic search strategies for evaluating a problem. The five categories used for coding are defined and exemplified in Appendix B.

Preliminary study of the protocol statements revealed six distinct strategies for heuristic searches which participants used frequently to evaluate problems they encountered during their composing:

1. engaging a search routine, such as enumeration, association, use of a mnemonic, imaging, or scanning a source text-aimed (usually) at finding a single element;   
2. directed translation or code-switching, involving deliberate uses of cross-linguistic resources in order to find, generate, or assess an element or elements (i.e., as in the strategies of search routines or generating and assessing alternatives, but cross-linguistically);   
3. generating and assessing alternatives, involving the production of different items or notions, then evaluation of their appropriateness, qualities, or desirability;   
4. assessing in relation toa criterion, standard, explana. tion or rule to deliberate over the appropriateness, accuracy or desirability of an element or elements;   
5. relating parts to whole, where elements are compared individually and collectively to make a decision; and   
6. setting or adhering to a goal, that is, the choice (or

reconsideration) of a particular objective to guide decision making in achieving a specific purpose.

In most of the protocol statements, several of these strategies were used in conjunction. For this reason, coding of different heuristic search strategies was not undertaken. As in the previous analysis, all decision statements in the transcribed think-aloud protocols were coded by the researcher, after establishing reliability (0.87 over 224 decisions) with an independent rater on a randomly selected $10 \%$ of the data (i.e., 7 protocols). Intrarater reliability, established one week after the initial coding, was 0.98 for 271 decisions in seven different protocols.

# RESULTS

# QUALITIES OF COMPOSITIONS

Overall, participants with greater writing expertise and greater ESL proficiency tended to receive substantially higher ratings on all three aspects of their compositions. There was an increment (of roughly $10 \%$ ) in ratings ofthe compositions for groups with higher levels of writing expertise or ESL proficiency, compared to groups with lower levels of writing expertise or ESL proficiency. This difference was greater for the qualities of discourse organization and content on the two more cognitively demanding tasks. Exceptionally high mean ratings (of 7 or above out of a maximum of 8) appeared only in the compositions of the professionally experienced writers. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the mean ratings for the three qualities of writing on the three tasks.

A repeated measures MANOVA for the three category ratings on the three tasks revealed large main effects for the factors of writing expertise $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 2 5 . 1 , p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ and ESL proficiency $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 5 3 . 8 $ $p { > } . 0 0 0 1$ .There was no interaction between the main factors: $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) = . 2$ $\scriptstyle { p = \mathbf { n } . \mathbf { s } }$ Ratings on the compositions increased in a linear progression with participants' writing expertise: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 4 9 . 1 $ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ . The magnitude ofthis effect indicates there were consistentlylarge differences between the ratings given to the compositions of more- and less-expert writers.

Figure 3. Mean ratings of language use on three tasks

Additional multivariate tests confirmed that the ratings of the three qualities (content, discourse organization, and language use) of the compositions differed significantly across the three tasks: $F ( 2 , 1 5 ) { = } 1 2 . 7$ $p { < } . 0 0 1$ Likewise, the ratings for each category contrasted significantly with each other within tasks: $F ( 4 , 1 3 ) { = } 4 . 1$ $\scriptstyle p < . 0 2$ Ratings of the three categories on the argument and summary tasks were significantly different from ratings on the letter task: $F ( 1 , \ 1 6 ) { = } 1 0 . 9$ $p { < } . 0 0 4$ .Ratings for discourse organization and content, when considered together for the three tasks, proved to be significantly different from ratings for language use: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 6 . 7$ $\pmb { p } { < } . 0 2$ . The differences in ratings given to discourse organization and content (but not language use) related significantly to participants' writing expertise: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 6 . 0$ $p { < } . 0 3$

# ATTENTION TO ASPECTS OF WRITING

The decision statements from participants' thinkaloud protocols were analyzed for content (what they indicated people were paying attention to) and complexity (whether people were attending to one, two, or more aspects of their writing). All references made to gist, language use, discourse organization, and their procedures for writing were tallied for each protocol. References to intentions occurred too infrequently to warrant inclusion in the analysis. Because many of the statements referred to more than one aspect of writing, the tallied figures were treated as cumulative percentages (rather than as discrete proportions summing $100 \%$ for each protocol). Group means for these references are displayed in Figures 4, 5, and 6.

Group means indicate clearly that gist predominated as the aspect of writing to which all participants devoted the majority of their attention in their decisions in each task. The percentages of protocol statements coded under this category-ranging from 74 to $9 5 \%$ for all groupssuggest that all participants attended to the substantive content of their writing in almost all of their thinking about their writing. References to language use were evident in 30 to $83 \%$ (as group means) of the decision statements participants made as they wrote; attention to discourse organization appeared in 8 to $30 \%$ (as group means) of participants' decision statements; procedures for writing were referred to in 7 to $40 \%$ (as group means) of these statements.

The great majority of participants' statements referred to either one or two aspects oftheir writing. Therefore, two categories were formed for multivariate analyses: (1) references to single aspects of writing and (2) references to more complex aspects of writing (i.e., mostly double references). These were treated as percentages proportional to the total number of statements in each protocol. Figure 7 displays the proportions of more complex references made during decision statements in the three writing tasks.

Basic writers at both levels of ESL proficiency referred to two or more aspects of their writing in only about half of the decisions they made (45 to $60 \%$ ). In contrast, professionally experienced writers at both levels of ESL proficiency attended to two or more aspects of their writing in the vast majority of the decisions they made (67 to $89 \%$ . These proportions varied for average writers according to their ESL proficiency. Average writers with intermediate ESL proficiency referred (as did the basic writers) equally to single and more complex aspects of their writing: in 43 to $63 \%$ of their decision statements. In contrast, average writers with advanced ESL proficiency acted like the professionally experienced writers, referring mostly to two or more aspects of their writing, in 67 to $8 5 \%$ of their decision statements.

Figure 7. Percentages of complex references to aspects of writing: Group means for three tasks

A repeated-measures MANOVA for the four categories of attention to aspects of writing expressed in protocols in the three writing tasks revealed significant main effects for the factors of ESL proficiency: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 5 . 0$ $p { < } . 0 4$ and writing expertise: $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 0 . 0$ $p { < } . 0 0 1$ . There was also an interaction between these two factors: $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 5 . 9$ $p { < } . 0 1$ . The effect for writing expertise proved to be linear: $F ( 1 , \ 1 6 ) { = } 1 9 . 9$ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ .Large differences were evident in the attention participants with higher and lower levels of writing expertise paid to these aspects of their writing.

The interaction obtained between the main factors of ESL proficiency and writing expertise formed a quadratic (not linear) trend: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 1 . 7$ A $p { < } . 0 0 4$ . This reflects the differences in means (described above) for the average group of writers, whose attention to aspects of writing altered substantially depending on their ESL proficiency. For average writers, the advantage of ESL proficiency was much greater than for people with high or low levels of writing expertise. For basic or professionally experienced writers, the aspects of their writing that they attended to was more discretely related to the independent factors of their writing expertise and ESL proficiency. The attention average writers paid to aspects of their writing drew largely on the combined factors of their ESL proficiency and writing expertise.

Multivariate tests determined that participants' attention to aspects of their writing differed overall across the three tasks: $F ( 2 , 1 5 ) { = } 5 . 8$ $p { < } . 0 1$ . Likewise, the relative attention participants paid to gist, language use, discourse organization, and procedures differed greatly: $F ( 3 , 1 4 ) { = } 2 9 4 . 3$ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ .Univariate contrasts between the attention participants devoted to gist as opposed to the three other aspects of their writing revealed enormous differences: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 8 8 5 . 3 $ A $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ . Smaller effects were evident in contrasts between attention paid to language use as opposed to the variables of discourse organization and procedures: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 2 9 . 0 $ $\scriptstyle p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ as well as contrasts between discourse organization and procedures: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 7 . 2 $ $p { < } . 0 0 1$ . Univariate tests showed that the argument and summary tasks, together, elicited greater attention to different aspects of writing than did the letter task: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 0 . 6 $ $\pmb { p } { < } . 0 0 5$ ; but the argument and summary tasks elicited attention to aspects of writing which were relatively similar: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 . 4$ $\scriptstyle p = { \mathbf { n } } . { \mathbf { s } }$

A repeated-measures MANOVA compared participants' references to single aspects of writing to their references to more complex (double, triple, etc.) aspects of writing in the three tasks. A main effect for writing expertise was evident $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 8 . 4$ $p { < } . 0 0 3$ , as was an interaction effect between writing expertise and ESL proficiency: $F ( 2 , \ 1 6 ) { = } 4 . 7$ $p { < } . 0 3$ The effect for writing expertise proved to be linear $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) \mathbf { = } 1 6 . 7 , p \mathbf { < } . 0 0 1$ . This reflects the tendency (noted above) for less-expert writers to make few complex references to aspects of their writing---and for more-expert writers to consider two or more aspects of their writing frequently in their decision making.

In contrast, the interaction effect for the main factors proved to be quadratic $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 9 . 3 $ $\pmb { p } { < } . 0 0 8$ rather than linear $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } . 1$ $\mathbf { \omega } _ { p = \mathbf { n } . \mathbf { s } . }$ . This relation mirrors the pattern in means (described above) for the average writers, who tended to have fewer or more references to complex aspects of their writing, depending on their levels of ESL proficiency. Univariate tests of interactions with task variables showed participants performed the summary and argument tasks differently than they executed the letter writing task: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 1 6 . 1$ $p { < } . 0 0 1$ . People referred to more complex representations of their writing while they wrote the two more cognitively-demanding tasks.

# PROBLEM-SOLVING BEHAVIORS

The proportions of problem-solving behaviors displayed in the three tasks are charted in Figures 8, 9, and 10. Very large differences between the behaviors of moreand less-expert writers emerged in the group means for statements demonstrating heuristic search strategies to resolve problems. For basic writers, thinking of this kind was evident in only 2 to $16 \%$ of their decision statements. For average writers, such statements accounted for 7 to $23 \%$ oftheir protocols. In marked contrast, the professionally experienced writers displayed this kind of mental activity in 29 to $5 5 \%$ of their decision statements.

Very few (3 to $12 \%$ ) of the decision statements in protocols were coded as instances of the participants applying a heuristic search to evaluate a problem but then not resolving it. For decision statements in which participants identified problems then quickly resolved them, without applying any heuristic searches, group means were quite similar for all participants. This behavior accounted for 29 to $49 \%$ of the total statements made by all groups.

Figure 10. Proportions of problem-solving behaviors in summary task

Decision statements coded as problem identification without resolution or heuristic searches made up a large proportion of the reported behaviors of basic writers (28 to $40 \%$ , a slightly smaller proportion of the decision statements of the average writers $( 2 2 t o 3 9 \% )$ , and a considerably smaller proportion of the decision statements of the professionally experienced writers (8 to $21 \%$ ). These ranges did not vary across the two levels of ESL proficiency. Statements coded as knowledge-telling accounted for a very small proportion of the decision statements in all protocols, ranging from 7 to $20 \%$ , but with large standard deviations from group means, suggesting little consistency within groups.

Separate multivariate analyses were conducted for the different problem-solving behaviors coded, so as to avoid computing the same numbers more than once. These analyses were revealing, however, only for the category of decision statements showing heuristic search strategies used to resolve problems. The repeated-measures MANOVA of the percentage of protocol statements with heuristic search strategies leading to the resolution of problems revealed main effects for writing expertise and ESL proficiency. The main effect for writing expertise was large: $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 2 9 . 0 $ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ . It was distinctly linear: $\mathrm { F } ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 5 1 . 3$ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ , indicating that this behavior increased with participants' levels of writing expertise. The effect for ESL proficiency was considerably smaller: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 5 . 2 $ A $p { < } . 0 4$ . There was no interaction between the two main factors: $F ( 2 , 1 6 ) { = } 2 . 1$ A $\scriptstyle p = { \mathbf { n } } . { \mathbf { s } }$ . The letter task produced significantly fewer heuristic search strategies than the summary and argument tasks did: $F ( 1 , 1 6 ) { = } 4 . 4$ A $p { < } . 0 5$

# OBSERVATIONS

In general, the think-aloud protocols of the ten basic writers demonstrated approaches to composing that exhibited a lack of control or appropriate self-regulation. Their decision making was visibly constrained in a variety of ways. In contrast, the five more expert writers approached their composing with clear notions of what it should entail, knowledge of how it should be organized as discourse, and concerns for how it might be best expressed in language. They appeared to write, implicitly or explicitly, in reference to well-formed scripts (Schank & Abelson, 1977), rhetorical plans (Flower & Hayes, 1984), or goal-directed planning (Burtis, Bereiter, Scardamalia, & Tetroe, 1983) which guided their decision-making overall. Expert writers appeared to know what they ought to do in their compositions, and subsequently went about doingit, or successfully figuring out how they would do it. Because they were able to reach major decisions about the gist and organization of their compositions with facility and confidence, they subsequently devoted much of their attention to evaluating their intended expressions at the level of wording and phrasing.

# ATTENTION TO GIST AND DISCOURSE ORGANIZATION

For expert writers, gist and discourse organization appeared to be well integrated conceptually.  Expert writers often considered these aspects of their writing in conjunction, while making calculated decisions about the overall planning of their texts. They visibly shifted their attention between a more frequent level of local decision making about wording and specific thoughts and a less frequent, higher level of planning their overall gist in explicit units of discourse.

In contrast, most of the inexpert writers formulated their gist in progressive but constrained steps, focused exclusively at the level of a single phrase, sentence, or thought. Less expert writers seldom appeared to have definite notions, from one phrase to the next, of what they would write. They often displayed a what next strategy (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987), asking themselves what they should say next:

Oh, what can I say after that? (Antoine, letter, 1:36) I'm thinking what I want to say after that. (Antoinette, letter, 1:30) Mmm, what else I can say? Mmm. Mmm. One, two, three, four (counts pages written). No, it's hard to say this. There's no easy answer. So, what else? What else? (Daniel, argument, 33:28)

A related approach was the unmonitored production of writing. In this behavior, less expert writers wrote virtually everything they thought, transposing almost all of their thoughts spontaneously to paper, without reflections or modifications As Daniel remarked, tellingly, during the letter task, "I'm almost writing everything that I think." (4:44). Some participants seemed to generate their content by topical, rather than analytical, association--a process that led them to write freely on any relevant topics that came to their minds:

I'm thinking about this course. Oh, it's very easy and we don't have a writing homework, just be in shape and to speak, because it's a course..."We have to be in shape." (Bernard, letter, 4:41)

At times, this process of generating content to write about would exceed inexpert writers' abilities to control their writing behavior:

"I'm getting, ah, getting out of the track now. I'll be coming back later." (Danielle, letter, 10:22)

A dramatic instance of someone losing deliberate control over their writing production occurred when Denise, while grappling with a personally challenging point in the argument task, wrote several sentences in French midway through her English text. She was astonished to realize, a few minutes later, that she had been doing this:

"Ah, #empecher#?I, ah, switch in French. I'm writing in French now." (Denise, argument, 25:14)

Perhaps an even more striking demonstration of Iosing control over one's writing occurred when Dominique (as noted above) experienced "writer's block" during the summary task. In other cases, inexpert writers also made conscious choices not to monitor their writing, by resolving not to edit or proofread their written compositions:

"Finished. I don't want read it again. It's too long" (Anne-Marie, summary, 118:12)

The control that expert writers displayed over their composing was most evident in the well-differentiated approaches they took to planning their writing. They displayed two different approaches to organizing their intended gist as discourse: through advance planning or emergent planning. Interestingly, the background expertise of the two emergent planners (Claudine and Francois) was in the area of creative and literary writing, whereas the expertise of the two advance planners (Claude and Ferdinand) was in the preparation of technical reports and documents. Francoise appeared to alternate between the two approaches.

The advanced planners, Claude and Ferdinand, carefully thought out the content of each of their compositions before they began to write their texts. They initially spent several minutes deciding on the major elements they would discuss in their texts, itemizing these as numbered points to be presented in a fixed order. Only when they were satisfied they knew what they would write were they prepared to produce their compositions:

We have, ah, yes. Yes. This is the essential ideas. I can write now. (Claude, summary, 50:01) So, all my ideas are there. I can start my letter now. (Ferdinand, letter, 8:06) Okay, I think I have everything on that. So, a brief introduction, description of the body, hunting habits in relation with the, his senses and the way he catches his prey, grooming, social behavior, and kittens. (Ferdinand, summary, 31:50)

After this point, they proceeded to execute their plans in writing, following (and if necessary adjusting) the planned elements as a kind of script. While writing, they referred back to these planned elements as signposts to guide their decision making---at distinct junctures where they completed major units of their compositions then passed on to the next ones. They cited the points either through enumeration or a sort of keyword identifying the planned point:

Now the goals. (Ferdinand, argument, 14:25) Now the third point, ah. (Ferdinand, argument, 18:24) Okay. Number two, the evolution of feminism.

(Claude, argument, 12:04)

Claudine and Frangois, in contrast, planned each composition as it was emerging on the page. They focused on crafting individual sentences, thinking out implications, ensuring they stated their thoughts precisely. As they attended to the forming of particular phrases, they also reviewed their previous text, rereading it every few minutes. And they looked ahead, thinking about how the whole composition would take shape- in reference to their current decisions. They discovered what they wanted to express, as they were expressing it: amending, adding to, and reordering their phrases frequently, reconsidering how best to state what they were most recently deciding they wanted to state. The texts they produced were covered in crossed-out words, editing marks, and other indications of progressive rewriting.

The protocols of Claudine and Francois showed them reaching their major decisions about gist and discourse organization at various, but distinct points midway through their writing. Once they were satisfied they had completed a section of their compositions, they came to think about the following section. This was usually done in explicit reference to the preceding discourse:

#Bon#. Thisis the introduction. Ah, I have written the introduction. I'm not really satisfied, but I need now to find some, ah, points for the development. (Francois, argument, 29:44) Okay, a more positive approach. And this was a point for the more positive approach. And a woman's place is in the home? Okay. Integration, ah. Okay, work. Outside the home there is work, there is, mmm, work, home, um, maybe the new ideology, no. (Claudine, argument, 47:57)

# ATTENTION TO LANGUAGE USE

Expert writers characteristically deliberated over their choices of words or phrases. They frequently considered both the form and content of particular expressions, searching out alternative phrasings or translating between their two languages before deciding on the most felicitous word:

"To exert"? Ah, "are able to..." Ah, "to have". No, not "to have". "To exercise"? Yah, yah. "Exercise a career"? No. Ah, "to work". (Francoise, argument, 3:03)

These concerns of expert writers ranged from brief considerations of preposition usage to lengthy searches for words, as the following extract of decision statements from seven minutes of Claudine's letter task shows:

"By..." #imaginons la situation# "By acting",no. "By actingthis way." #Bah.# Oh,it's hardto getoutofthat. "By actingthis way, he..." #pousser dans le dos? Ca sera quoi?# "By acting this way, he pushes ourself..," ah, #entretient nous#, oh. Okay, #de cette facon, il, il pousse, non, en le dos, non.# "He puts us in a situation that, ah, "keeps us in a continual..n "Effort"? No, well, okay, maybe, anyway. (Claudine, letter, 46:11) "Keeps," no, "keep us" (Claudine, letter, 49:13) "Keep us in"? "On"? No. (Claudine, letter, 49:36) Ah, not "energy," but, ah, okay. Can I say "effort"? #Un effort? S'efforcer, non, un essai, non.# "A constant.." Okay, not "learning," ah, #pas phenomene, comment dire ga? Ca commence par p.# Okay, ah. #C'est pas une phrase.# "In a constant...# Ah, okay, anyway, who cares? That's not what I want to say anyway. (Claudine, letter, 49:52) Oh, yeah, "Constant learning..." What's the word? Ah, "process." I knew it begins with ap. Right? It's not exactly a precise explanation, but it's okay. (Claudine, letter, 52:47)

Basic writers showed very little concern for the qualities of word choice; however, one participant, Denis, presented an exceptional case. He displayed concerted, but restrictive, attention to linguistic accuracy in his decisionmaking--demonstrating the kind ofbehavior Jones(1985) calls monitor-overuse (afterKrashen & Pon, 1975)in acase study of a similar, adult ESL student with little writing expertise. Denis' attention was most often drawn locally to surface features ofthe language he was using, applications of grammatical rules, and verifications of spellings:

Ah, "an essay." I forgot my "an." (Denis, letter, 11:00) "The rodents"? Does "rodent" take a "t'? Or no "t"? "Rodents,"' I put that somewhere. Did I write it down somewhere? I think that I didn't write it, but it's not important. Look in the booklet.

Where is "rodents'? Ah, "rodents" takes a"t " (Denis, summary, 57:20)

Denis' behavior differed qualitatively from that of more expert writers, who also tended to monitor their language use while writing. Expert writers tended to search for language which best conveyed their intended meaning, considering the connotations, appropriateness, and purposes of their expressions, in conjunction with their linguistic accuracy. Denis' concerns for language, in contrast, were almost exclusively focused on its grammatical accuracy---to the point of his neglectingits semantic or pragmatic dimensions.

# DISCUSSION

The major finding emerging from this study is that multivariate analyses showed writing expertise and second-language proficiency accounted for large, but distinctly separate, portions of the variance in: (1) qualities of the compositions participants produced in their second language and in (2) problem-solving strategies participants used to control their composing. As there were no significant interactions between the two factors, these analyses indicate that writing expertise and second-language proficiency each make quite different contributions to the processes and products of writing in a second language. Indeed, it would appear writing expertise and second-language proficiency are psychologically different.

# WRITING EXPERTISE

Three characteristics of writing expertise have been verified empirically, as they appear in second-language writing performance: extensive use of heuristic search strategies for evaluating and resolving problems, attention to complex aspects of writing while making decisions, and the production of effective content and discourse in compositions. In addition, further characteristics of writing expertise were observed in people's decision-making--- as well-differentiated strategies for advanced or emergent planning and as concerns for choosing appropriate words and phrases. These characteristics appear to apply across different kinds of writing tasks, but they are more prevalent in tasks that are more cognitively demanding.

These findings are substantiated by much previous research on the nature of mother-tongue writing expertise. The behaviors that expert writers displayed in their second language performance are consistent with the findings about expert writers'performancein their mothertongue: (1) that is, they use particular strategies to actively solve problems while they write (Flower & Hayes, 1980, 1984); (2) transform their knowledge as they write (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987); (3) use complex mental representations to guide their decision making (de Beaugrande, 1984; Flower & Hayes, 1984; Scardamalia & Paris, 1985; Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987); (4) produce more effective content and discourse organization in their compositions (Freedman, 1977; Breland & Jones, 1984); (5) interrelate planning and production processes in sophisticated ways(Burtis, Bereiter, Scardamalia, & Tetroe, 1983); and (6) attend frequently to word choices (Gardner, 1983).s

Qualitative differences observed between the writing approaches of participants may have several explanations. These differences indicate that writing expertise is something that is relatively flexible and varied, varying with the individual mental models (Johnson-Laird, 1983) that individuals can develop to guide their cognitive processes. For instance, the framework proposed by Frederiksen, Donin-Frederiksen, and Bracewell (1987) might suggest that the thinking of advance planners could be frame-driven. These people define the overall frames of their writing, then supply relevant propositions as they compose. Emergent planners, in turn, may have models of writing that are proposition-driven, involving the building up of propositions to construct larger frames progressively over the period of composing.

Alternatively, Bereiter and Scardamalia's (1987) distinctions between two fundamental cognitive models of writing-knowledge telling (an inexpert strategy) and knowledge transforming (an expert strategy)-would suggest there are fundamental similarities in the two approaches. Advance planners appeared to have split their planning into two phases. They applied knowledgetransforming strategies first while thinking out their content. Once they had organized their relevant knowledge into well-defined scripts, they then applied similar strategies to make local decisions about wording and phrasing. In contrast, emergent planners seem to have used a model of knowledge transforming throughout their writing. They approached decisions about organization, as well as phrasing, through persistent approximations, judgments, and revisions. While they produced their texts, they enhanced their mental representations as they gained a greater awareness of their own knowledge.

Participants wholacked writing expertise showed the absence of differentiated control strategies they could apply to their writing. Most did not have a guiding mental model of how to proceed in their writing, so they persistently asked themselves what they should do next. Although inexpert writers thought about their writing--to an extent comparable to average or expert writers- -they did not appear to know how to regulate their thinking productively or appropriately. Although they were able to produce phrases and sentences with evident fluency in their second language, they had great difficulties conceiving how these phrases would cohere strategically in their overall discourse. Although they ultimately generated full, topically coherent texts, the compositions of inexpert writers were judged to be obviously lacking in quality. Like most novices in an unfamiliar realm of activity, the inexpert writers in the present research were able to perform--but they appeared to lack relevant procedures, strategies, and knowledge (Case & Bereiter, 1984).

# SECOND-LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY

The present findings suggest a purely additive model of second-language proficiency. As people gain proficiency in their second language, they become better able to perform in writing in their second language, producing more effective texts, attending more fully to aspects of their writing. Unlike writing expertise, however, attaining greater second-language proficiency does not appear to entail qualitative changes in the thinking processes or decision-making behaviors used for composing. Indeed, the processes of composing in a second language did not appear, in this study, to be visibly affected by secondlanguage proficiency.

The image that emerges is one of writing expertise as a central cognitive ability--with second-language proficiency adding to it, facilitating it in a new domain, and possibly enhancing it. Measures of the second-language proficiency of participants proved to correlate, almost perfectly, with length of residence in an English-speaking milieu. This finding concurs with other research which has concluded that the time people spend learning a second language is a major determinant of their achievement (Carroll, 1975; Spada, 1985; Stern, 1985). This can be presumed to relate to learners' experiences comprehending and producing the language meaningfully (Tarone, 1981; Krashen, 1982; Swain, 1985) while progressively matching their individual behavior to standards salient in the social environment(McLaughlin, 1978; Schumann, 1986).

Secondly, participants in the present research were able to exercise their writing expertise directly in their second language. Their second-language proficiency facilitated this performance, but it did not determine its principal characteristics. Participants' writing expertise appeared in second-language performance in uniform ways---according to prior classifications of their mothertongue writing abilities, and regardless of participants' second-language proficiency. Hence there was no progression, such as the behaviorist term transfer might imply (Corder, 1983), to this process. People simply enacted composing strategies, characteristic oftheir mother-tongue expertise, in their second language.

Thirdly, and more speculatively, it is possible that the bilingual proficiency of some participants in the present study may have enhanced their writing expertise. This interpretation could explain the performance of average writers, who appeared to benefit most extensively from increased second-language proficiency, particularlyin their attending to aspects of writing while making decisions. As theories of the benefits of bilingualism claim (Albert & Obler, 1979; Cummins, 1985; Hakuta & Diaz, 1985), having two languages should, in principle, provide a person with additional linguistic resources as well as foster his or her analyses of differences in language forms and content. Such cognitive effects may be most likely to occur, in writing performance, for learners who have neither well-developed writing expertise nor obvious limitations in their writing abilities.

In general, the present findings confirm Krashen's (1982) and Carroll's (1985) claims that second-language knowledge is an aspect of cognition that is not readily analyzable. Even though second-language knowledge can be monitored, analyzed, and deliberatelymodified (Bialystok, 1982; Ellis, 1986), it appears inefficient and unusual to do this during task performance. The one participant who did monitor his second-language use extensively--applying learned rules of grammar, spelling, and punctuation-- appeared to do so at the expense of his attention to his composing and intended meaning. As Jones (1985) concludes from a case study of a similar monitor overuser, this would appear to be a misdirected strategy for regulating one's writing performance. On the whole, participants proved to attend mainly to their gist, and secondarily to their uses of language, as they wrote in their second language. This finding supports Swain's (1985) claim that language learners' attention to comprehensible output is---like Krashen's comprehensible input (1982)--a viable means of their (implicitly or explicitly) developing proficiency in the uses oftheir second language, by establishing necessary form/content relationships.

# IMPLICATIONS

This research supports several well-established theories that distinguish between cognitive faculties of intelligence and language. Fodor (1983) and Chomsky (1980, 1988) have argued that the human language system differs structurally from central, intelligent processes of cognition. The language system is said to develop from innate knowledge, functioning in an informationally en. capsulated form, like visual or other sensory input systems. Intelligent thought, in contrast, is said to mediate these input systems in a controlled manner--reasoning, evaluating, and making deliberate choices. Gardner(1983) has proposed that humans can develop several different kinds of core intelligences, one of which is writing expertise. In second-language research, Cummins (1980, 1984) has similarly concluded that children develop conversational skills in a second language separately from cognitive-academic skills, which develop over longer periods in the mother tongue or second language.

These distinctions seem necessary to explain the present findings. Writing expertise appears to be a specially developed intelligence (in Gardner's, 1983, sense) with unique cognitive characteristics that can be applied across languages. Second-language proficiency, in contrast, entails the development of the language faculty to function appropriately within the parameters of a specific language code (differing from the mother tongue). Both obtain in writing performance in a second language, but appear to contribute different elements to second-language writing performance. This interpretation, based on a relatively small sample of learners, needs further assessment with regard to different language groups, other kinds of writing tasks, and other kinds ofintelligent skills.

With respect to educational policy, these distinctions suggest there are strong reasons for promoting the development of writing expertise and second-language proficiency, particularly in the many academic settings worldwide in which students' achievements are performed and assessed through their writing in their second language. But at the same time, this research suggests that writing expertise and second-language proficiency are distinguishable. Because the two are not necessarily dependent on each other, there are empirical reasons to justify their development through different learning curricula.

The present research indicates students' levels of second-language proficiency do not make substantial differences to their processes of decision making while writing. This may suggest that writing expertise is as easily attained in a first or second language---a point worthy of study in future research. Participants in the present research had developed their writing expertise in their mother tongue--though their development of writing expertise could, otherwise, have occurred in their second language, as in the well-documented cases of such authors as Joseph Conrad, Samuel Beckett, or Guillaume Apollinaire. Students who lacked writing expertise had evidently not developed this ability during their earlier education (in their mother tongue). Students who had developed high levels of writing expertise had apparently done so either through professional experiences outside of educational settings or through the application oftheir previous schooled learning to those circumstances.

The confirmation that writing processes are realized in people's first and second languages in fundamentally the same ways (Zamel, 1983; Raimes, 1985; Jones & Tetroe, 1987) suggests that approaches to writinginstruction evaluated in, for example, de Beaugrande (1984), Scardamalia and Bereiter (1986), Hillocks (1986), or Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987), would appear to be as appropriate for second-language education as they are for mother-tongue education. Conversely, there are no apparent reasons to assume that special approaches to writing instruction-such as controlled composition or error correction---should have a validity for the development of second-language writing that they do not have for mother-tongue speakers of a language.

Two qualifications might be necessary, however. One is that language learners may require sufficient levels of second-language proficiency to be able to sustain the selfregulated behavior that writing performance in a second language requires. The present study did not assess the performance of students beginning to learn their second language, where writing performance may be less fluent and more linguistically-focused. This may not be a very weighty qualification, however, in view of the many examples documented in Edelsky (1986), in which young students with very little knowledge of literacy or their second language proved able to compose purposefully, and on their own initiative, in their second language (see also Cumming, Reboffot, & Ledwell, 1989, for similar findings with adults). The second qualification is that writing instruction in second languages needs to be supplemented by the development of students' second-language acquisition, particularly through reading. Extensive reading and other purposeful uses of a second language appear necessary to facilitate the long-term development of effective writing performance (Elley & Mangubhai 1983; Krashen, 1984).

Expert writers might not need instruction in writing in their second language. They may benefit more from writing practice and other uses of their second language. For basic or average writers, it appears that the procedural dimensions of writing in a second language need to be made accessible and manageable--in the same ways that obtain for learning writers in their mother tongue (Applebee, 1984; Hillocks, 1986; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986). Two obvious goals for instruction of inexpert writers arise from the present research: (1) helping them learn to use problem-solving strategies to evaluate their writing effectively while they are composing and (2) fostering their attention to the interactions of multiple aspects of their writing. Given the variation in personal approaches to writing observed in the present research, it is clear that such goals have to build on students' individual approaches to writing and capacities for development (Case $\&$ Bereiter, 1984; Cumming, 1986). Further research needs to assess the extent to which these cognitive characteristics of writing expertise are teachable or how they arise developmentally(Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987).

Revisions need to be made to the common claim that second-language learners should be instructed to attend to meaning in their writing. Because it has been found that ESL students usually do attend to their gist, in almost all of the decisions they make while writing, a refinement to this prescription is needed. Building on the present findings, it would be sensible to encourage students to focus on the gist of their writing in relation to other aspects of their writing, such as language use, discourse organization, or intentions. Tasks that prompt students to attend, while writing, to planning goals (Jones & Tetroe, 1987), audience concerns (McKay, 1984; Urzua, 1987), or personal goals for learning (Cumming, 1986) might facilitate this.

Similarly, it may be inferred that instructional approaches that prompt students to focus on single aspects of their writing, such as syntactic errors (Hendrickson, 1980), may have the disadvantage of directing learners' attention away from considerations of the complexity of their composing in the ways required to develop more expert performance. Likewise, pedagogical prescriptions about the interference of learners' mother tongue in second-language performance- espoused in audio-lingual methodologies and theories of linguistic transfer or contrastive rhetoric- --appear misdirected in view of the present study of learners' performance. Students' mother tongues proved to be an important resource in their continual processes of decision making while writing. Notions of contrastive rhetoric (Kaplan, 1967; Jenkins & Hinds, 1987) were not alluded to in any of the decision statements reported by participants.

The findings of this research expose a logical problem in the kinds of assessment that are conventionally used to test second-language proficiency in writing. An analytic rating scheme of the kind widely used to assess students' compositions in their second language has been shown to assess two distinct aspects of students' abilities: their writing expertise and their second-language proficiency. This fact has profound implications for educational and instructional policy, especially where admissions, grades, or credits are granted on the basis of such assessments. It is vital for people and institutions using such measures to be aware of their dual nature---not to claim that such measures test either language proficiency or writing expertise alone.

# NOTES

1Participants are referred to by pseudonyms representing this classification. Pseudonyms beginning with the letter A identify participants $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 5 )$ judged to have basic writing expertise and intermediate ESL proficiency. Pseudonyms starting with the letter B identify participants $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { n } = 4 )$ with average writing expertise and intermediate ESL proficiency. Pseudonyms starting with the letter C indicate those $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ with professional writing expertise and intermediate ESL proficiency. Pseudonyms beginning with the letter D refer to participants $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 5 )$ with basic writing expertise and advanced ESL proficiency. Pseudonyms beginning with the letter E identify participants $\scriptstyle ( n = 4 )$ with average writing expertise and advanced ESL proficiency.

Pseudonyms starting with the letter $\mathbf { F }$ indicate participants $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { n } = 3 )$ with professional writing expertise and advanced ESL proficiency. One participant, Dominique, experienced writer's block during the summary task, and did not produce a text. Her casehad to be excluded from multivariate analyses.

2Modifications made to the instrument were: (1) to conflate the original categories of vocabulary, language use, and mechanics into one category called language use; (2) to convert the weighted scores for criteria in each category to simple numeric figures (i.e., one, two, three and four); and (3) to alter two descriptive criteria to accommodate the summary task.

4However, it is not possible to say, on the basis of the present research, whether writing expertise is performed in identical ways in people's first and second languages. Results from a within-subjects comparison of adult Anglophone students of French writing summary tasks in their first and second languages (at beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency)indicate that individuals use comparable proportions of heuristic search strategies in equivalent tasks in both languages (Cumming, Rebuffot & Ledwell, 1989). As in the present study, individuals' uses of problem-solving strategies prove to vary with their writing expertise rather than with their second-language proficiency. Raimes' data(personal communication, 1987)appear tobe consistent with the differences in problem-solving strategies between more- and less-expert writers composing in ESL reported in the present study.

# APPENDIX A: CODING SCHEME FOR ATTENTION TO ASPECTS OF WRITING

Language Use---These statements indicate participants are focusing on their use of English as a linguistic code. Many of these statements refer to grammatical, punctuation, or orthographic conventions:

No, no, no $" \mathbf { m } ^ { \mathbf { \nu } }$ .And a comma there. (Antoine, argument) "Information"? "Informations"? Okay, because sometimes words are plural and it doesn't take an $^ { 6 6 } \mathsf { s } ^ { \pmb { \mathscr { n } } }$ I'm not sure. I don't know. (Beatrice, letter)

Discourse Organization---In these statements participants' attention focuses on the organization of their written discourse, its structure beyond the level of the clause. Reference is made to organizational or rhetorical units, their interrelationships, or discourse types, such as paragraphs, introductions, conclusions, points, examples, essay, summary, or letter:

I write, like, an essay. An introduction and a conclusion. Okay. (Denise, argument) Now the third point. (Ferdinand, argument)

Gist--These statements focus on the substantive content of the writing- the writer's thoughts or ideas. These statements may indicate participants are formulating, considering, reconsidering or searching for content in their writing:

Okay, new paradigms. (Claude, argument) I'm thinking that, now, she can have, ah, she can receive an education. She can work. But it's not, ah, in some cases they work and they go to school, but they also, ah, they are also a housekeeper. But it's not every case, but, sometimes the husband doesn't want to help the wife. So, she doesn't have less work. She has more work, even if she works outside. So, I don't know. (Denise, argument)

Intentions-In these statements participants attend to something they want to achieve through their writing.-- either in reference to an overall purpose of their text or to a personal goal they have set for themselves:

Okay, first, I'm just going to give an answer to the question.

(Bernard, argument) Okay, I try to find, ah, the, like, usually I put the use it will be before that. Okay, it will be, like, um, let's say to read a short, ah, thing on that, like for students, okay. Like I know who it is aimed at. It's aimed at students, but, I, ah, I'm not sure what, what will be the, who will be the reader of that. Like to summarize here, okay, let's say it will be for students. Okay, I read that, and I want them to do a small presentation about cats. Ah, that's why I will take only the more important information on it. (Emile, summary)

Procedures-In these statements participants say they are focusing on their procedures for doing something in their writing. Such procedures include writing itself, making notes, checking something, reading, changing something in a text, switching languages, or starting or finishing something:

I'm reading it again.   
I'm finished.

(Danielle, letter) (Dominique, summary)

# EXAMPLES OF ATTENTION TOTWO ASPECTS OF WRITING

LanguageUse/Discourse Organization

Ah, because, ah, this sentence doesn't follow the same pattern.   
It doesn't have the same structure as the next one.

(Elizabeth, summary)

# Language Use/Gist

No, I'll put the present perfect because I think that we still learn about this thing. (Claudine, letter)

# Language Use/Intentions

No, I don't have to put "me" in my letter. If I want to talk about "me" I will put it in general. (Claudine, letter)

# Discourse Organization /Gist

Equality in the society? No, that can be my conclusion. No, I'm going to put that in my conclusion. (Antoine, argument)

# Discourse Organization /Intentions

Maybe I can express my own opinion in the conclusion. (Antoine, summary)

# Procedures/Gist

Um, I'm just trying to find out if something's missing. I know that there's a lot of things that are missing, but I want to look through it so... (Brigitte, summary)

# Procedures/Language Use

I check some words in the dictionary. Okay. Ah, "behavior". Ah, okay, so that's good. "Behavior", that's a good word. Ah, ah, "to stimulate, to increase the amount". Okay, so that's good, that's good. (Ferdinand, argument)

# Procedures/Discourse Organization

Is this enough? I don't have a conclusion. Should I write a short conclusion? Okay. (Frangois, letter)

# Procedures/Intentions

I decide to write by myself and not to look at the text. (Dominique, summary)

# Gist /Intentions

I have to prove that this fact, ah, is not so bad for "the company". (Ferdinand, argument)

# APPENDIX B: CODING SCHEME FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING BEHAVIORS

Knowledge-Telling: In these statements there is no indication of thinking that involves problem solving. Participants justtell their knowledge. They either describe an action they are performing while writing (a kind of statement which may be an artifact of the conditions of reporting mental processes to the researcher) or they tell the knowledge they have about a topic- -an immature strategyfor generating content(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1985).

I'm just writing my name. (Brigitte, summary) I always live with a catin my, my house, and I know all the habits of a cat. When I was a baby we had nine cats at home. So I know how they react. (Dominique, summary)

Problem Identification: No Heuristic Searches; No Resolution. In these statements participants detect a problem, but they do not evaluate it, nor do they resolve it.

I'm not sure about the word here. (Danielle, summary) It's too long. (Claudine, summary)

Problem Identification: Resolved Without Heuristic Searches. These statements show participants identifying a problem then immediately resolving it, without engaging in any heuristic search strategies. It appears the recognition of the problem implies its resolution. Heuristic searches may not be necessary because participants believe they know how to resolve the issue automatically.

Is it in the introduction that I have to say if I agree or don't agree with this? I think so. (Denise, argument) "Will be"? No, that's "would be". (Beatrice, argument)

Problem Identification: Heuristic Searches But No Resolution. In these statements participants identify a problem, applying one of the six strategies for heuristic searches (defined above) in an effort to resolve it. But they do not reach a resolution of the problem.

Mmm, ah, okay, #acquisition#. "Acquisition' is not a word in English. "Acquire'? "Acquirement"? #Acquisition#? "Acquirement", I think. No, I'm not sure. (Claudine, argument) I want to do a conclusion, but I don't want to write, ah, something, ah, #technique#, ah, technical. (Andre, summary)

Problem Identification: Heuristic Searches with Resolution. In these statements participants identify a problem, actively apply one of the six heuristic search strategies defined above, then resolve the problem to their own satisfaction.

# Engaging a Search Routine---With Resolution

Ah. Ah, what's this period? What's the expression? What's the expression? Ah, I'm looking for an expression. Ah. No. I'm looking for a word. That period when the kid is born and it don't go to school? Ah, "infancy"? Yah. (Dominique, argument)

# Directed Translation or Code-Switching .--With Resolution

"The..." #les biens#? Okay, "the completion". No, "completion"? Is this a word? #completer#? "Completion", #g'est pas un mot en frangais#. No, it doesn't work, I think. Ah, okay, #complementalite#. "Completion". Is that the word? "Complementary"? Ah, okay, you have to use an adjective. (Claudine, argument)

# Generating and Assessing Alternatives With Resolution

"That they born'? "That they bore'? No, "that they bear children". Do you "bear children" or you "bore"? You "bear", ah.

(Francoise, argument)

# Assessing in Relation to a Criterion, Standard, Explanation, or Rule---With Resolution

"A child need", ah, "a child needs", because it's the third person. (Denis, argument)

# Relating Parts to Whole--With Resolution

I've talk about, okay, human person, goals, babies, and conclusion. In the conclusion, maybe, I have to #resume# these three points and to finish with the position of the woman at home.

(Ferdinand, argument)

# Setting or Adhering to a Goal-With Resolution

Okay, first, I'm just going to give an answer to the question. And in the development, I'm going to give some examples why I think that, and prove, prove it. Okay. (Bernard, argument)
