# ABSTRACT

There are four interrelated aspects in teaching learning process that is teacher, students, materials, and evaluation and assessment. The things that should be paid attention related to materials are materials selection, materials development and design, and materials evaluation or textbook evaluation. Regarding to textbook evaluation, this article aims to describe one of the three methods of textbook evaluation, checklist method. It discusses what checklist method is and some suggested checklist method that can be used in evaluating textbook. There are fifth different checklist models displayed in this article. They include Tucker (1975), Daoud and Celce-Murcia (1979), William (1983), Sheldon (1988), and Cunningsworth (1995). The fifth models are quoted from journals and books.

Ada empat aspek yang saling terkait dalam proses belajar mengajar yaitu guru, siswa, materi, dan evaluasi dan penilaian. Hal-hal yang harus diperhatikan terkait materi adalah pemilihan bahan, pengembangan dan desain material, dan evaluasi bahan atau evaluasi buku teks. Mengenai evaluasi buku teks, artikel ini bertujuan untuk menggambarkan salah satu dari tiga metode evaluasi buku teks, metode daftar periksa. Ini membahas metode checklist apa dan beberapa metode checklist yang disarankan yang dapat digunakan dalam mengevaluasi buku teks. Ada lima model checklist berbeda yang ditampilkan dalam artikel ini. Mereka termasuk Tucker (1975), Daoud dan Celce-Murcia (1979), William (1983), Sheldon (1988), dan Cunningsworth (1995). Model kelima dikutip dari jurnal dan buku.

Key words: teaching learning process, textbook evaluation, checklist method

# A. Introduction

In teaching learning process, textbook has an important role because it leads teachers in conveying materials to be taught over a period of time. Also, for students, textbook make them easier to understand what are being taught. With textbook, students can learn the lesson/topic at home. Regarding to the importance of textbook, Cunningsworth as cited in Demir states that the roles of ELT course book are serving to present the written and spoken materials, promoting interaction, serving as reference of vocabulary and grammar, acting as a source for classroom activities and offering selfaccess work or self-directed learning.

Talking about textbook, there is one interesting thing to be discussed, that is textbook evaluation. According to Ahour, Towhidiyan, and Saeidi, “textbook evaluation is a requisite to qualifying the content of the textbook and homogenizing it with the teaching/learning requirements in EFL/ESL settings”. Textbook itself should be evaluated because of some reasons. Hutchinson and Waters as cited in Ahour, Towhidiyan, and Saeidi say that the aim of textbook evaluation is “to determine the suitability of the materials to our particular purpose”. Cunningsworth cited in Alshehri argues that the reasons for evaluating textbook are to adopt new course books, to find out the particular strengths and weakness, and to aid in the development of teachers and provide insights into a textbook’s various components. Contrary to the both former experts, Tomlinson says that why textbook should be evaluated because it provides teachers with insights into the application of language theories.

# B. Literature Review

In the light of textbook evaluation, many researches over the worlds have been carried out in different content and perspectives. A study conducted by Sarem, Hamidi, and Mahmoudie (2013) evaluate the specialized book of English for International Tourism based on the checklist developed by Daoud and Celce-Murcia. The obtained results showed that the current book can be used as an acceptable textbook to teach to students who are interested in studying tourism.

Two studies in the same year (2014) conducted by Ahour, Towhidiyan, and Saeidi, and Rashidi and Kehtarfard. Ahour, Towhidiyan, and Saeidi investigate the appropriateness of “English Textbook $2 ^ { \circ }$ for Iranian EFL second grade high school students from the teachers’ perspectives. The participants of the study consisted of 25 English teachers (8 females and 17 males) randomly selected from different high schools in Boukan, Iran. The evaluation of the textbook was conducted quantitatively through an adapted checklist developed by Litz. The results of the study revealed that teachers’ perceptions about these criteria were not favorable in general. Rashidi and Kehtarfard (2014) reports on the findings of a study conducted to evaluate an English textbook (the third-grade high school English book), which is being used in all state high schools in Iran by using a needs analysis framework. The results of the textbook evaluation revealed that although all language skills and components were almost important for the majority of the students, the textbook could not fully support all of them together.

Another study, Alshehri (2016), evaluate Cutting Edge, a textbook which is currently being taught at Najran University‘s Preparatory Year Programme. Twelve EFL instructors were asked to share their perspectives about the target textbook, and a forty-item questionnaire, which was developed by Litz was used for the purposes of the evaluation. The study‘s findings revealed that the instructors were largely satisfied with a majority of the textbook‘s features. They were most satisfied with the textbook‘s layout and design (mean score ${ : = } 3 . 7 4$ ), followed by its subject and content (3.65), its skills component (3.63), its activities (3.55) and its language type (3.51). By contrast, the respondents' opinions of the textbook‘s practical considerations were unclear. Meanwhile, Hussin, Nimehchisalem, Kalajahi, and Yunus (2016) evaluate the presentation of new vocabulary items in the Form Three English language textbook used in Secondary Schools in Malaysia. A group of purposively selected teachers $\mathbf { \bar { n } = }$ 5) used a checklist to evaluate the presentation of vocabulary items in the textbook. The findings showed that the textbook is weak in vocabulary presentation. It was found that no specific method was followed to teach the new vocabulary. There was no index of the new vocabulary at the end of the textbook. The results have implications for the learners, English language teachers as well as textbook developers.

Bouzid, Erguig, and Yeou (2016) conducted a study which investigate ways in which textbook evaluation can help in implementing a positive change in EFL teachers’ professional careers. It draws the attention of Moroccan high school English language practitioners to the viability of using textbook evaluation as a reflective practice to enhance teachers’ professional development. A survey was designed to explore the attitudes of Moroccan high school English language teachers towards the suggested model of textbook evaluation and its ability to promote teachers’ professional development. The findings demonstrated that the teachers were in favor of the suggested textbook evaluation model.

A study entitled “A Comparison of Teaching Materials (School Textbooks Vs Authentic Materials) from the Perspective of English Teachers and Educational Supervisors in Saudi Arabia” was conducted by Allehyani, Burnapp, and Wilson (2017). They explore English teachers’ and educational supervisors’ attitudes to using school textbooks and authentic materials in Saudi boys’ schools. Specifically, it aims to determine the preferred teaching materials (either textbooks or authentic materials which are not usually recommended in the current textbooks (or which are additional to the contents of the current textbooks) from the participants’ points of view. A mixed research approach - quantitative and qualitative - was used to investigate the favored teaching materials, while the contrastive research approach allowed both types to be evaluated. The results showed that the participants had positive attitudes to using authentic materials and that most teachers preferred them to school textbooks.

One of the seventh previous researches (Demir, 2014) is a development research in which he designed the eclectic checklist for ELT course book evaluation. Meanwhile, the others are based research. The difference of this study with the others that is this study is a library research which focus on suggested checklist method that can be used in evaluating textbook. In this theoretical studies, this article purposes to describe 2 things related to textbook evaluation, namely: (1) what checklist method is; and (2) various models of checklist method.

# C. Research Method

The method used in writing this article is descriptive qualitative method. The using of this method aims to describe two things, namely checklist method to evaluate book text and some models of checklist method.

# D. Findings and Discussion

# 1. Checklist as the Method of Textbook Evaluation

One of the three methods that can be used in evaluating textbook is checklist method. The checklist method is an instrument that helps practitioners evaluate course books in an effective and practical way. Meanwhile, Sarem, Hamidi, and Mahmoudie state that checklist is an instrument that provides the evaluator with a list of features of successful learning-teaching materials. According to these criteria, evaluators like teachers, researchers, as well as students can rate the quality of material. Based on these definitions, I conclude that checklist is an instrument to assess the worth of materials along with some determined aspects.

According to McGrath, there are four advantages of checklist method as follow.   
1) It is systematic, ensuring that all elements that are deemed to be important are considered.   
2) It is effective, permitting a good deal of information to be recorded in a relatively short space of time.   
3) The information is recorded in a convenient format, allowing for easy comparison between competing sets of material.   
4) It is explicit, and, provided the categories are well understood by all involved in the evaluation.

# 2. Various Models of Checklist Method

# 1) Tucker (1975)

Tucker divides his checklist into two main criteria. External criteria and internal criteria, which is consists of 3 categories. The third categories of internal criteria are pronunciation criteria, grammar criteria, and content criteria. The special features of this checklist are:

a. Tucker uses terms value scale (importance in context) and merit scale (quality) to assess the textbook.   
b. Value scale range from 0-5 and merit scale range from 0-4.   
c. The checklist has VMP (value merit product), the multiplication result of VS and MS. The scores from multiplication not only an arithmetical total but also a graph in which the actual and ideal profiles can be displayed

Tucker’s checklist model of textbook evaluation method is as follow.

# 2) Daoud and Celce-Murcia (1979)

Marianne Celce-Murcia is a Professor Emerita of Applied Linguistics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Her interests include English grammar and pronunciation. She has been (co)editor on all four editions of TES/FL ( $\boldsymbol { 4 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ edition, forthcoming, National Geographic-Heinle) as well as co-editing a fivevolume textbook series with M. Sokolik. Celce-Murcia has served as a member-atlarge on the Boards of both Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Language (international TESOL) and the American Association for Applied Linguistics (AAAL).

Daoud and Celce-Murcia checklist for textbook evaluation consists of five aspects. The first is subject matter, the second is vocabulary and structures, the third is exercises, the fourth is illustrations, and the fifth is physical make-up. The total items of the five aspects are 25.

# 3) Williams (1983)

David Williams is a Senior Lecturer and Head of the Language Arts Section in the Department of Education, Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria. He holds a doctorate in Education from the University of Malaya. His current research interests include reading comprehension, the teaching of literature, and attitudes towards varieties of spoken and written Nigerian English.

Williams splits his ELT textbook checklist into 7 criteria. The seventh criteria are general, speech, grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, and technical. The special features of his textbook checklist are:

a. Column for weighting on the left of the checklist. Weighting can be indicated by numbers or letters (e.g. 4: very useful, 3: quite useful, 2: fairly useful, and 1: not so useful). This left column can be used for weighting items according to their

usefulness in a particular second-language context, or at a particular educational level.   
b. The 5-point numerical rating scale on the right of the checklist. It can be used for adapting evaluative items to suit the particular demands of the teaching situation. The numbers given in the right-hand column indicate the extent to which a given textbook satisfies each criterion on the checklist.   
c. Sets of criteria can be evolved for comparative evaluations by multiplying the weighting of each item by the rating on each item.

In the following is the table of Williams’ ELT textbook evaluation checklist.

# 4) Sheldon (1988)

Leslie Sheldon is Director of ELT, Pitman Education and Training Ltd. He has taught at schools, universities, and teacher-training establishments in Canada, Iran, Algeria, Italy, Sweden and the UK, as well as having been an ESP consultant. In 1989 Dr Sheldon directed a British Council specialist seminar held in the UK, entitled ‘ELT Textbooks and Materials: Evaluation, Exploitation, Adaptation and Design’.

Sheldon designed his textbook checklist into 17 factors. The total items of the seventeenth factors are 53. The special features of his checklist are: (1) factual details (at the top of the checklist), (2) column comment for adding our comment about each factor, and (3) column for rating, which can be scored with pluses and minuses, or stars, etc.), but, in this article I use poor, fair, good, and excellent for the rating scale. Sheldon textbook evaluation checklist can be seen as follow.

# E. Conclusions

Based on the discussions of checklist model above, it can be concluded that everyone can use the desired checklist model of textbook evaluation that suits his/her needs. We also can make our questionnaire by modifying the existing models or design it by ourselves through research. Evaluation of textbooks is necessary to do as worthy input or not a textbook is used in the learning process. However, the determination of whether or not the book deserves depends not only on the judgment of someone or several person, but on some consideration.

The eighth checklist models have similarities and differences. The designers of checklist models create their questionnaire based on some principles. The other adapt and/or revise the formers design by adding, deleting, or reword the items of questionnaire. Even though the checklist model has advantages, it also has weakness. The checklist cannot give the descriptive reasons why respondents give a such score on the item/s in the questionnaire.
