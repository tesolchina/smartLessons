Disciplinary spoken academic discourse

Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentations have received global popularity, which develop the discursive competence of postgraduate students to communicate their disciplinary research to a wide audience. Despite increased research into aspects of 3MT presentations, little is known about how student presenters react to the audience’s knowledge base and recognize the possibility of rejecting their arguments. Therefore, this study focuses on the use of negation in 3MT presentations, suggesting how presenters introduce an alternative positive position into the dialogue, and hence acknowledging it, so as to reject it. We explored the frequencies, forms, and functions of negation at the discourse-semantic level with other appraisal resources in a corpus of 124 3MT presentations across hard and soft disciplines. Our results revealed that not, no, and negative contractions were the most frequent, and notably preferred by soft-disciplinary speakers. We also identified intriguing cross-disciplinary variations in the way negation was used alongside pronounce resources that expressed explicit authorial emphases to co-articulate the rhetorical effect in discourse. Pedagogical implications are raised as to the strengthening of students’ rhetorical awareness of linguistic resources to achieve effective academic presentations and wide communication of disciplinary knowledge.

# 1. Introduction

The discursive competence of research postgraduate students in scientific communication gains increased attention in the teaching and research of using English for Academic Purposes (Hyland, 2006; Hyland and Jiang, 2019, 2021; Jiang and Qiu, 2022; Sun and Xiao, 2023), and this seems resultative of the students’ need to control the level of persuasiveness in their discourse, acknowledging alternative views and building solidarity with the audience (Jiang and Ma, 2018; Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a). The dynamic of knowledge transfer together with developing communication technology suggests that research reaches beyond a traditionally small number of scientists and academics but a huge less predictable audience (Hyland and Jiang, 2019; Luzón and Pérez-Llantada, 2022), leading to “a blurring of the boundaries between the scientific community and the general public” (Carter-Thomas and Rowley-Jolivet, 2020, p. 2). Therefore, students need to adapt to the new academic context and develop discursive competence accordingly. As Shaikh-Lesko (2014) points out, being able to speak to people outside of a discipline is a crucial skill in a changing funding landscape.

Against this background, Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentations have emerged and gained global popularity in tertiary institutions. These spoken events challenge research postgraduate students to communicate their disciplinary research within 3 minutes to a general audience. This genre can train students’ academic speaking and more importantly develop their ability to communicate specialist knowledge to a wide audience (Boldt, 2019; Carter-Thomas and Rowley-Jolivet, 2020). The student presenters have been found to express stances and engage listeners (Hyland and Jiang, 2021) while building coherence in rhetorical moves (Hu and Liu, 2018; Jiang and Hyland, 2022; Jiang and Qiu, 2022; Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a,b). Although these aspects of language use suggest the voice the students give to what is presented, almost having escaped the scrutiny in the literature is how they react to the wide audience’s knowledge base and recognize the possibility of rejecting their arguments. Investigating the employment of negation in 3MT presentations can unveil interpersonal strategies in the spoken academic genre, shed light on how speakers display disciplinary knowledge to a wide audience, serve as evidence to demonstrate how disciplinary knowledge is constructed and negotiated, and contribute to developing EAP spoken course/ workshop material which may help less experienced speakers become aware of interpersonal strategies for academic presentations.

Therefore, this study seeks to remedy the oversight by exploring the negation used by student presenters in 3MT presentations. As argued by Martin and White (2005), negation gives us a way to see how presenters introduce “the alternative positive position into the dialogue, and hence acknowledging it, so as to reject it” (p. 118). To better understand the relationship between language and its contexts of use in the service of EAP instruction, we examine how negation is used alongside other interpersonal resources to co-articulate the rhetorical effect and how the particular rhetorical contexts of genre, register, and disciplinary knowledge impact students’ use of negation (Hu and Liu, 2018; Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a,b). In doing so, we hope to foster special rhetoric that students need to learn in the wide communication of scientific knowledge while furthering our understanding of the rhetorical role negation plays in academic discourse. Before presenting our study, we begin by introducing 3MT presentations and what is known about negation in academic discourse.

# 2. Three minute thesis presentations and interpersonal strategies

The 3MT presentation was proposed by the University of Queensland in 2008 and has been organized by over 900 universities across more than 85 countries worldwide (see https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au for more details). The competition is aimed to enhance the academic presentation and research communication skills of PhD students or the so-called Higher Degrees by Research (HDR) candidates. Student presenters are required to give a 3-min nontechnical account of their doctoral research supported by only one static slide to a disciplinarily heterogeneous audience. The 3MT competition emphasizes participants’ speaking skills to fascinate an audience of disciplinary outsiders, rhetorically engage with the audience, and convince them of research value, as summarized in Criteria 1–4 below (see https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/judging-criteria for the detailed judging criteria of 3MT competitions):

1. [Content] Did the presentation describe the impact and results of the research?   
2. [Comprehension] Did the presentation help the audience understand the research?   
3. [Engagement] Did the oration make the audience want to know more?   
4. [Communication style] Were the topic and its significance communicated in language appropriate to a non-specialist   
audience?

Accordingly, the 3MT presentation is viewed as an important spoken academic genre, which showcases PhD candidates’ logical and persuasive discursive practice seeking to ‘sell’ a disciplinary research idea in the ‘marketplace’ with non-specialist audiences ( Hu and Liu, 2018; Jiang and Qiu, 2022; Qiu and Jiang, 2021). According to Copeman (2015), the storytelling nature of 3MT presentations resembles a business pitch in the way of a carefully planned, easily understood spoken exposition of a new idea or product, intending to persuade listeners to accept its likely benefits (value proposition). Nevertheless, a wide communication of professional knowledge is often impeded by graduate students’ limited strategic use of accessible language and on-stage engaging persuasive skills (Boldt, 2019; Sugimoto and Thelwall, 2013).

In view of this, Feak (2016) emphasizes the necessity for EAP practitioners to train the essential communication skills of postgraduate students since they might need to negotiate with various stakeholders (e.g., government officials and commercial investors), and such needs “ha[ve] never been more true than it is today” (p. 496). In addition, 3MT presentations provide PhD candidates with chances to improve general presentational competence (Feak, 2016), prepare for PhD oral defences (Mezek and Swales, 2016), and redress the imbalance of prioritizing writing skills over spoken communication capabilities in higher degree programs (Hu and Liu, 2018). Therefore, the educational value of 3MT presentations has made the academic genre gain increasing popularity globally, particularly in nowadays academic contexts where interdisciplinary collaboration and research proposals for funding grants both require skills to communicate with people outside of a discipline (Feak, 2016).

As shown in the literature, an effective way to introduce propositions and engage with audiences is to use interpersonal strategies (e.g., hedges, boosters, and attitude markers). Previous studies have found frequent occurrences of stance and engagement markers in 3MT presentations, especially for stance markers which occur more frequently in 3MT presentations than research writing (Jiang and Qiu, 2023). The finding is supported by Biber’s (2006) argument that spoken genres commonly involve large numbers of stance features. As explained by Qiu and Jiang (2021), the frequent use of interpersonal devices relates to the rhetorical demands of the face-to-face competitive context of the 3MT genre. For example, Qiu and Jiang (2021) found that 3MT presentations contained a large number of hedging resources functioning to weaken authorial claims. The finding might be a consequence of audiences’ miscellaneous disciplinary backgrounds which could reduce presenters’ confidence in how much their propositions can be widely accepted. Similarly, attitude markers (especially those expressing importance and surprise) are widely used to intrigue non-specialist audiences with the news value of the research project (Qiu and Jiang, 2021). In addition, given the strict time constraint, students have to ensure their speeches are succinct and their position is prominent while highlighting the value of propositional information.

Embedded in the English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) context, previous studies have further revealed internal traits of disciplinary specificity regarding the use of interpersonal strategies in 3MT presentations. For instance, Qiu and Jiang (2021) found significantly more interpersonal markers (i.e., boosters and personal affects) in hard sciences than in social sciences. Such disciplinary variations indicate that the talks given by PhD candidates were based on both background experience for face-to-face communication and knowledge of discipline-specific communicating conventions. In addition, Qiu and Jiang (2021) reported that speakers from hard disciplines may engage the audience by soliciting agreement following a statement, e.g. “It’s a scary thought, isn’t it?” By comparison, such tag questions rarely occurred in social sciences, suggesting that students from soft disciplines might attempt to eschew face threats by refraining from using tag questions to pressure audiences into agreeing with the speaker.

Taken together, investigating the disciplinary use of interpersonal devices sheds light on persuasive strategies and how the strategies would represent a community’s system of values (Hyland, 2000, 2006; Jiang and Qiu, 2023; Sun and Xiao, 2023; Xiao and Sun, 2020). Considering that graduate students face “growing pressure to share their work with non-experts” (Feak, 2016, p. 496), such findings based on the academic genre of 3MT presentations are expected to have pedagogical implications for catering to the need to speak with a non-expert audience in mind while tapping into how the talks are formulated to make sense to the current interactants (Hyland and Jiang, 2019).

# 3. Negation in academic discourse

As an interpersonal device, negation expresses semantic opposition by “introducing alternative positions into dialogue so as to deny or reject them” (Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022b, p. 3). Within the appraisal system (Martin and White, 2005), negation resources are typically realized as non-affixal negation (Tottie, 1991), which is also referred to as clausal negation (Biber et al., 1999) and comprises denying verbs/auxiliaries as in (1) or non-verbal constituents (2). All the extracts/examples are from our 3MT corpus, where we bolded negation alongside other appraisal features and italicized examples of appraisal resources (e.g., couldn’t, not) in the extracts/examples, and their appraisal types are given in parentheses with the corresponding discipline noted in square brackets.

academic genres (Swales, 2019), “negation plays an important role in shaping academic arguments” (p. 4) and thus helps writers to negotiate the authorial stance, acknowledge possibilities of alternative positions, and modulate the strength of certainty (Jiang and Hyland, 2022). Therefore, investigating the use of negation can elucidate how writers assess readers’ needs, negotiate a sustained dialogue, and build solidarity with readers which are regarded as key skills for academic persuasion (Hyland, 2014).

As a consequence of the important functions in discourse, negation has been increasingly researched in a range of academic genres. For example, Webber (2014) explored negative expressions in research articles and saw negation functioning to work out research value, distinguish between authorial and other voices, forestall potential criticism and misunderstanding, and clarify authorial stances on controversial issues. In addition, Herriman (2019) found that negation occurred frequently in advanced learners’ argumentative essays indicating a high degree of writers’ subjective involvement. By looking into written academic discourse, Don (2017) summarized the key functions of negation, which included denying background information, refuting text/discourse information, and challenging readers’ anticipation. Drawing on Webber’s (2014) taxonomy, Sun and Crosthwaite (2022a) categorized negation into disalignment, cautious detachment, and unfulfilled expectation when studying how negation occurred alongside other appraisal resources to ‘establish a niche’ in the introduction section of PhD theses. Their results revealed frequent uses of negation items and intriguing co-occurrences of negation sub-types alongside other appraisal resources, which help thesis writers to “mini-critique” the defective “product” and strategically “sell” their viewpoints in gap statements (p. 204).

Against the backdrop of ESAP, recent studies have further uncovered the disciplinary use of negation by specific academic communities. For instance, based upon a diachronic corpus of research article abstracts, Jiang and Hyland (2022) found that negation is increasingly favored by sociology research writers, while a falling use of negation is seen in linguistics and its use by biology and engineering writers has been relatively stable over time. Examining the ‘limitations’ sections of PhD theses across disciplines, Sun and Crosthwaite (2022b) identified significant cross-disciplinary variations regarding both individual negation items and the way negation is used alongside justify resources to construct interpersonal meaning. Therefore, the “co-articulation” between negation and other appraisal resources is noteworthy, suggesting how they “work together to produce a particular effect” (Martin and Rose, 2010, p. 266). Accordingly, Zolfaghari (2023) compared the use of negation alongside relevant appraisal items in research articles across six disciplines and showed a strong preference for negation in soft sciences and different co-articulating patterns across disciplinary subcorpora.

Overall, previous studies on negation have cumulatively shown that negation is an important evaluative feature and rhetorical device for academic persuasion. Nevertheless, negation has been less examined in disciplinary spoken academic genres by ESAP analysts, despite the fact that negation is around twice as frequent in speech as in writing (Biber et al., 1999; Tottie, 1991). Don (2017) argued that negation plays a role in “put[ting] words in people’s mouths” (p. 37), in other words, projecting an assumed voice of the audience. According to Yang’s (2020) findings, compared with British National Corpus (BNC) and British Academic Written English Corpus (BAWE), the top over-used keywords in the 3MT genre include “wouldn’t” and “wasn’t”. To effectively engage with the audience, 3MT speakers tend to ask negative rhetorical questions (e.g., “Why don’t we need to.?”) or use directives (e.g., “Imagine the world [if] there is no .”) while starting their talk. The strategic use of negation has also been reported by Hu and Liu (2018) who explored rhetorical moves in 3MT presentations. They suggested a relatively frequent occurrence of negation in the obligatory move ‘rationale’ which functions to persuade the audience of research value by addressing gaps/problems/needs, for instance, “We do not fully know why .” and “One thing we do not expect .”.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the forms and functions of negation in 3MT presentations across knowledge fields. As Zolfaghari (2023) points out, “any approach to interpreting negation should build on the available scholarship on its systematic analysis” (p. 193), so we adopted Sun and Crosthwaite’s (2022b) approach to explore the frequencies, forms, and functions of negation at the discourse-semantic level with other appraisal resources (Martin and White, 2005). In doing so, we seek to uncover how negation may “accumulate, reinforce, or resonate” (Hood, 2006, p. 38) with other relevant appraisal resources to co-articulate interpersonal relationships in 3MT presentations. Specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions:

(1) What are the frequencies, forms, and functions of negation in 3MT presentations?   
(2) How does negation co-articulate with other appraisal resources to express authorial stances and engage with the audience?   
(3) What is the extent of disciplinary variation regarding the use of negation in 3MT presentations?

# 4. Data and methods

# 4.1. Corpus

To address the research questions, we constructed a corpus comprising 124 latest 3MT presentations from mechanical engineering, biology, education, and history since they produce most of the student presenters (see Table 1 for the 3MT corpus). These disciplines largely represent hard and soft sciences respectively (Becher and Trowler, 2001). To ensure representativeness and comparability across groups, all the selected presentations have met the criteria that they were presented by doctoral students in English and that they all exemplified the principal characteristics of the genre (i.e., live audience, 3-min time limit, using only one static slide, and prohibited from providing any extra prompt).

The videos were downloaded from public domain sites (including https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/, http://media. podcasts.ox.ac.uk/oucs/thesis/2015-06-23_three_minute_thesis_visokyte.mp4, and https://www.youtube.com/) using search queries, such as “3 min thesis $^ +$ biology”, “3MT $^ +$ history”. The selected videos were transcribed verbatim, removing hesitation, repetition, and gestures which were not the focal point of this research. To ensure the accuracy of the transcripts, we invited two native speakers of English to audit-check against the original video recordings. After ensuring no inconsistency in the transcribed texts, the authors imported the transcriptions into UAM CorpusTool (O’Donnell, 2019) for measuring text lengths and further analyses.

# 4.2. Identification and annotation of negation alongside other appraisal items

To reliably identify all the negation resources, we first summarized a list of negation items based on previous studies, including not, no, cannot, nothing, none, neither, nobody, nor, nowhere, and negative contractions (n’t) (Biber et al., 1999; Jiang and Hyland, 2022; Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a,b; Zolfaghari, 2023). Then, we checked all the selected texts to annotate these negation items using the UAM CorpusTool and more importantly ensure that none of any negation items specific to the spoken academic genre were left out.

For the purpose of offering a systematic and rigorous account of negation from a prosodic view, we also investigated the co-articulations of negation alongside other appraisal resources. We drew on a simplified appraisal system (Lam and Crosthwaite, 2018; Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a,b) to make a balance between the intricate original framework and the feasibility of corpus-based manual annotations. The appraisal system adopted in this study is shown in Figure 1. Detailed elaborations of each appraisal item are listed in the Appendix.

To annotate the appraisal items while minimizing any potential subjective interpretation (Coffin and O’Halloran, 2006), we took the step-wise approach (Fuoli, 2018) by which we first selected around $1 0 \%$ of the corpus data (i.e., six samples from each disciplinary group). Then, we carefully checked each file, selected the segments of texts fitted within the appraisal framework, and annotated the target segments with corresponding appraisal labels using the UAM CorpusTool. Furthermore, two raters (both English as first language speakers with over five years of teaching experience) were solicited to double-check the samples (including 227 annotated segments) for accuracy. The unit of our analyses was the span of text that could realize an appraisal function. For example, the use of ‘might’ created dialogic space for various possibilities and realized the function of entertaining a range of possible positions, and thus it was annotated as an entertain feature. The two raters browsed each annotated segment separately and determined whether they agreed (‘yes’) or disagreed (‘no’). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the analysis (2 way random, general consistency, $\ k = 2$ ) was .799, which showed an ‘excellent’ level of agreement (Cicchetti, 1994). Ensuring no inconsistency in the annotation of the samples, we went on to annotate the rest of the 3MT corpus.

# 5. Findings

# 5.1. Frequencies, forms, and functions of negation in 3MT presentations

We identified a total of 430 negation items in the 3MT corpus, and the normalized frequency of negation was 6.88 (i.e., instance per 1,000 words). To compare the distribution of negation across disciplines, we further used the log-likelihood $( L L )$ test to measure (if any) statistical variation concerning the frequency of each wording across disciplines. Following Rayson (2016) and Gabrielatos (2018), LL and %DIFF served as critical value and effect size respectively. According to our results, compared with hard disciplines (frequency $\ l = \ 1 8 9$ , normalized frequency $= ~ 5 . 9 6 \cdot$ ), soft disciplines (frequency $= ~ 2 4 1$ , normalized frequency $= 7 . 8 3$ ) adopted significantly more negation resources $p < . 0 1$ , $L L = 7 . 8 9$ , $\% D I F F = 2 3 . 8 0$ ).

As summarized in Table 2, among the 10 types of negation markers, not, no, and negative contractions were the most frequent. In most cases, the negation markers occurred more frequently in soft disciplines, especially the item neither, which was significantly commonly adopted by 3MT speakers from the soft fields $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ .

Note: $^ { * } p < . 0 5$

To be more specific, the contractions category incorporated 15 forms of contracted negation (see Table 3). There were significant cross-disciplinary variations regarding the use of didn’t, wasn’t, and wouldn’t, which were more common in soft disciplines $\left( p < . 0 1 \right)$ . By comparison, isn’t $\left( p < . 0 1 \right)$ , can’t and won’t $( p s < . 0 5 )$ were noticeably preferred by speakers from hard fields.

# 5.2. Co-articulations of negation and other appraisal features

In this section, the authors further examined the most frequent co-articulating patterns of negation alongside other appraisal items, with the purpose of revealing how negation co-occurred with other appraisal resources to express speakers’ voices and engage with audiences in the spoken academic genre and whether any nuanced use of negation differed across disciplines.

# 5.2.1. Co-articulations with attitude

As shown in Table 4, negation often occurred alongside (especially preceded) attitude, while it was less common for negation to be surrounded by attitude devices. Please note that in Tables 4–9, the figures in each cell stand for raw frequency followed by its ratio within each disciplinary group. In the spoken genre, a noteworthy realization of the pattern “negation $^ +$ attitude” was to engage the audience by first stating the authorial position and then requesting listeners’ agreement with a tag question as in (3).

(3) However (counter), one ton of aluminium is 2000 dollars, isn’t (negation) that amazing (reaction_inscribed_positive)? [Hard-discipline]   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-discipline</td><td>Soft-disciplinee</td></tr><tr><td>negation + attitude</td><td>42 (48.84%)</td><td>48 (41.03%)</td></tr><tr><td>attitude + negation</td><td>36 (41.86%)</td><td>41 (35.04%)</td></tr><tr><td>attitude + negation + attitude</td><td>8 (9.30%)</td><td>28 (23.93%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Similar to Sun and Crosthwaite’s (2022a) findings, the patterns “attitude $^ +$ negation” and “attitude $^ +$ negation $^ +$ attitude” were often used to indicate research gaps by arguing that the existing materials/methodology cannot solve evolving issues as seen in (4) to (7).

(4) Things that we take for granted (normality_invoked_positive) aren’t (negation) always (upscale) available for those who struggle with reading [Soft-discipline] (5) The point is a conventional (normality_inscribed_positive) shock absorber cannot (negation) save any energy. [Hard-discipline]

Therefore, the attitude devices within these two patterns tended to be conveyed in the positive polarity, suggesting that although ‘familiar or good’, the existing solutions were still not always effective.

(6) So (justify), we can do a great (reaction_inscribed_positive) job protecting mangroves in general (upscale) but (counter) if we don’t (negation) protect the right (tenacity_inscribed_positive) kind of mangroves, we may (entertain) be missing these key (valuation_inscribed_positive) nursery grounds in the future. [Hard-discipline]   
(7) Also, a sole (downscale) episode of deflation is good (reaction_inscribed_positive) but (counter) not (negation) that useful (valuation_inscribed_positive) in isolation (downscale). [Soft-discipline]

# 5.2.2. Co-articulations with engagement

This section will concentrate on common co-articulating patterns of negation and other frequent engagement devices, including counter, entertain, justify, and pronounce. Our goal was to uncover how negation co-articulated with these engagement elements in the spoken academic style and to scrutinize (if any) subtle cross-field variations in the use of negation.

# (1) Co-articulations with counter

Among all the engagement devices, the most frequent resource co-occurring alongside negation was counter, especially for the pattern “negation $^ +$ counter” which was the most common in both disciplines (see Table 5). As shown in (8), “negation $^ +$ counter” could construct dialogical possibility by complementing the above negative statement with ‘a forward option’.

(8) You’ve no (negation) option but (counter) to go into exile to an island in Bass Strait. [Soft-discipline]

Table 4 Co-articulations of negation and attitude devices.   
Table 5 Co-articulations of negation and counter devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-discipline</td><td> Soft-discipline</td></tr><tr><td>negation + counter</td><td>46 (48.42%)</td><td>45 (66.18%)</td></tr><tr><td>counter + negation</td><td>43 (45.26%)</td><td>15 (22.06%)</td></tr><tr><td>counter + negation + counter</td><td>6 (6.32%)</td><td>8 (11.76%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

The pattern “counter $^ +$ negation” was relatively more favored by hard disciplinary speakers since it enabled them to present a factual description before stepping back through the use of a connective but/however. The use of counter might suggest that certain issues were somehow counter-expectational (9).

(9) But (counter) we did not (negation) know how the organisms cause this disease because (justify) we lack the genome sequence for this organism. [Hard-discipline]

In addition, a notable use was witnessed with respect to concise sentences of the spoken genre. For example, in Excerpts 10–12, adjuncts just and even not only invoked a contrary position but also stressed the denying proposition initiated by negation especially when they were placed immediately adjacent to negation.

(10) It just (counter) doesn’t (negation) work. [Hard-discipline] (11) They don’t (negation) even (counter) average. [Soft-discipline]

By comparison, negation was rarely surrounded by more than one counter items (12), probably because the more complex pattern could lead to lengthy sentences which might not be a customary practice in spoken genres.

12) But (counter) if we were in France in the 18th century, you probably (entertain) wouldn’t (negation) just (counter) be looking at yourselves but (counter) a few (downscale) people known to you, like your family, and how their actions affect your honour, your reputation. [Soft-discipline]

(2) Co-articulations with entertain

Table 6 displays the co-articulations of entertain and negation devices. For both hard and soft disciplines, it was the most likely for entertain to precede negation, especially when speakers adopted the second person pronoun “you” to appeal to listeners’ knowledge/view and thus brought listeners into the ongoing speech (13) and (14). However, considering that understanding/positioning might vary across each individual audience, speakers had to sometimes use entertain devices to tone down their voices so as to be accepted by most listeners.

(13) You may (entertain) think it’s purely (sharpen) imagination, but (counter) it’s not (negation). [Hard-discipline] (14) Perhaps (entertain) you were led to believe that either you are creative (capacity_inscribed_positive) or you’re not (negation), and that’s the end of it. [Soft-discipline]

Table 6 Co-articulations of negation and entertain devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-discipline</td><td> Soft-discipline</td></tr><tr><td>entertain + negation</td><td>26 (65%)</td><td>30 (76.92%)</td></tr><tr><td>negation + entertain</td><td>10 (25%)</td><td>7 (17.95%)</td></tr><tr><td>entertain + negation + entertain</td><td>4 (10%)</td><td>2 (5.13%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Speakers might also use “negation $^ +$ entertain” to indicate careful authorial detachment. As demonstrated in (15) and (16), entertain devices (e.g., would, perhaps) functioned as hedging strategies to reduce epistemic commitment to propositions or claims. Accordingly, the co-occurrence of negation and entertain mitigated the degree of denial and extended discursive room for alternative views.

(15) If these guidelines are not (negation) changed, would (entertain) there be another explosion? [Hard-discipline] (16) It does not (negation) perhaps (entertain) automatically guarantee learning. [Soft-discipline]

It was not usual for 3MT speakers to make extensive use of entertain features surrounding negation. As shown in Example 17, although such a pattern could reduce the possibility of objection by expert listeners, it might also result in lengthy sentences and somehow lessen the validity of authorial positions by making excessive rhetorical space for other possibilities.

(17) While (counter) it may (entertain) take some coaxing to get all (upscale) students to learn from the same curriculum in the same classroom and at the same time, it’s not (negation) such the monumental (valuation_inscribed_positive) task you might (entertain) think. [Soft-discipline]

# (3) Co-articulations with justify

As shown in Table 7, 3MT speakers generally preferred “negation $^ +$ justify” (18) or “justify $^ +$ negation” (19). In other words, within a sentence, speakers tended to present only one piece of proposition and justified the position with a reason.

(18) Now current research suggests (endorse) that the process is not (negation) safe (security_inscribed_positive) because (justify) when we increase the pressure, the leakage rate will increase. [Hard-discipline] (19) Because (justify) drama scripts are not (negation) provided by the teachers, students need to write their own script for acting. [Soft-discipline]

Table 7 Co-articulations of negation and justify devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-disciplinee</td><td>Soft-disciplinee</td></tr><tr><td>negation + justify</td><td>23 (60.53%)</td><td>12 (48%)</td></tr><tr><td>justify + negation</td><td>12 (31.58%)</td><td>10 (40%)</td></tr><tr><td>justify + negation + justify</td><td>3 (7.89%)</td><td>3 (12%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

In comparison, the pattern “justify $^ +$ negation $^ +$ justify” accounted for the lowest proportion (20).

(20) The next flight was unavailable as (justify) there was no (negation) space for more (upscale) passengers because of (justify) the cargo load. [Harddiscipline]

# (4) Co-articulations with pronounce

Table 8 presents the co-articulations between negation and pronounce devices as well as their cross-disciplinary comparisons. Hard-disciplinary speakers tended to adopt “negation $^ +$ pronounce”, using pronounce devices (e.g., actually, really) as intensive words and placing them immediately after negation to emphasize speakers’ voices (Excerpts 21–22).

(21) The thing is that we don’t (negation) actually (pronounce) know exactly (tenacity_inscribed_positive) how these things work and that’s what I’m trying to find out. [Hard-discipline] (22) Now the problem is research has shown (endorse) this spillover isn’t (negation) really (pronounce) happening. [Hard-discipline]

Table 8 Co-articulations of negation and pronounce devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-discipline</td><td>Soft-discipline</td></tr><tr><td>negation + pronounce</td><td>22 (%)</td><td>15 (%)</td></tr><tr><td>pronounce + negation</td><td>2 (%)</td><td>19 (%)</td></tr><tr><td> pronounce + negation + pronounce</td><td>3 (%)</td><td>1 (%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

By contrast, soft-disciplinary speakers preferred “pronounce $^ +$ negation”. Pronounce devices (e.g., should, of course) constituted an overt intervention into the talk by the speaker’s voice so as to insist upon the warrantability of the proposition posed by the succeeding negation (23).

(23) That is a retreat which should (pronounce) not (negation) go unaddressed. [Soft-discipline]

“Pronounce $^ +$ negation $^ +$ pronounce” accounted for the lowest proportion and was rarely seen in both disciplines. As shown in Excerpt 24, the repeated use of pronounce could make the speaker’s voice highly salient. For example, compared with the bare assertion ‘the males are singing in and they are clustered’, embedding pronounce devices into the excerpt, i.e., ‘the fact (pronounce) that the males are singing in and the fact (pronounce) that they are clustered’ may constitute an overt intervention into the content and insist upon the warrantability of the speaker’s propositions.

(24) The singing roosts are aggregated in space so that (justify) the fact (pronounce) that the males are singing in and the fact (pronounce) that they are clustered has always (upscale) suggested a breading, but (counter) nobody (negation)’s actually (pronounce) studied them before. [Hard-discipline]

# 5.2.3. $C o$ -articulations with graduation

Table 9 shows the co-occurrences of negation and graduation resources and their comparisons across disciplines. On the whole, “negation $^ +$ graduation” was most frequently adopted and favored by 3MT speakers from both disciplinary groups. Speakers would use negation alongside graduation resources (e.g., always, much) to modulate the level of intensity of voice (25) and (26).

(25) This might (entertain) seem (entertain) normal (normality_inscribed_positive) because (justify) it is, but (counter) it hasn’t (negation) always (upscale) been like that. [Hard-discipline]

Table 9 Co-articulations of negation and graduation devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Pattern</td><td>Hard-disciplinee</td><td>Soft-disciplinee</td></tr><tr><td>negation + graduation</td><td>43 (71.67%)</td><td>51 (52.58%)</td></tr><tr><td>graduation + negation</td><td>9 (15%)</td><td>40 (41.24%)</td></tr><tr><td> graduation + negation + graduation</td><td>8 (13.33%)</td><td>6 (6.18%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Soft disciplinary speakers showed a notably stronger preference for “graduation $^ +$ negation”. By comparison, the uses of “negation $^ +$ graduation” and “graduation $^ +$ negation $^ +$ graduation” were distributed more equally between hard and soft disciplines (27).

(27) However (counter), this is often (upscale) not (negation) the case. [Soft-discipline]

By contrast, while using “graduation $^ +$ negation”, hard-disciplinary speakers would directly reduce the modality or intensity and then engage the readers with a negative interrogative form or counter the argument with a more crucial authorial position as in (28).

(28) Sounds a bit (downscale) strange, isn’t (negation) it? [Hard-discipline]

For both disciplinary groups, it was not common for 3MT speakers to employ several graduation resources surroundin negation (29).

(29) The mistake is the most (upscale) important (valuation_inscribed_positive) property of the fluid which is viscosity has not (negation) been completely (upscale) understood. [Hard-discipline]

# 6. Discussion

This research has investigated the frequencies, forms, and functions of negation in 3MT presentations and its cooccurrences with other appraisal devices across hard and soft disciplines. The study has innovatively explored the interpersonal use of negation in the spoken academic genre drawing on Martin and White’s (2005) appraisal system from an ESAP perspective. Our findings have revealed rhetorical potentials of negation and intriguing co-articulating interpersonal strategies in the genre.

Regarding the first research question, this study has observed a common use of negation in 3MT presentations in general, and the normalized frequency in the spoken academic genre (6.88) is noticeably higher than those in research articles (3.40) or research abstracts (4.22) found by Jiang and Hyland (2022) and Zolfaghari (2023). As pointed out by Tottie (1991), negation resources are typical of spoken discourse, and the appearance of negation is even twice as common in spoken genres as in written genres (Biber et al., 1999; Tottie, 1991). The frequent use of negation could be accounted for by the interpersonal nature of 3MT presentations since presenters have to not just express authorial voices, but more importantly, engage with the audience and rhetorically persuade the audience to accept their positions.

In addition, our findings have also revealed that not, no, and negative contractions are the most frequent negation markers by 3MT presenters from both disciplines. In line with the finding that not-negation is much more frequent than no-negation in conversation (Biber et al., 1999; Herriman, 2019), it can be concluded that not has the greatest potential for negating alternative positions and introducing dialogic space in spoken academic communication. It should be noted that negative contractions (n’t) are in essence another realization of not-negation, especially for spoken genres where clauses and sentences are generally shorter (Biber et al., 1999). As explained by Herriman (2019), the wide adoption of non-negation may reflect a tendency for users to draw on a somewhat more conversational style in academic genres. By comparison, although nonegation is also frequent in our disciplinary corpora, it is not as widely adopted as not-negation probably because no-negation could be more emphatic than not-negation (Herriman, 2019). According to Cheshire (1999), no-negation can “create an overstatement” (p. 39) as it represents an absolute at the end of scalar implicatures of usuality/modality/quantity. Accordingly, the negation indicators not, negative contractions, and no play a crucial role as a dialogic contraction device to introduce alternative positions into spoken academic communication, and this helps 3MT speakers to secure interpersonal involvement and persuade the audience to take on the authorial propositions.

In response to the second research question, negation would co-occur with a range of appraisal resources to convey speakers’ propositions and engage with the audience. Frequent co-articulating patterns incorporate negation and attitude, functioning to request listeners’ attention with tag questions or stating research motivation drawing on linguistic indicators, such as “not useful” and “isn’t effective”. Therefore, it could be reasonably assumed that such patterns might be commonly found in the ‘rationale’ move of 3MT presentations which emphasize research gaps. This indicates that the existing materials/ methodology are not satisfactory enough so that the need is justified to conduct the ongoing study being presented (Hu and Liu, 2018; Jiang and Qiu, 2022).

Another frequent pattern incorporates negation along with counter, especially “negation $^ +$ counter” which is of the highest proportion in both disciplines. The pattern, also known as “unfulfilled expectation” (Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022a, p. 197) or “comparison” (Jiang and Hyland, 2022, p. 7), has been identified as a key interpersonal strategy that draws on adversative conjunctions to create space for dialogic potential, express speakers’ dissatisfaction rather than outright criticism, and show contrastive relations between elements (Webber, 2014; Zolfaghari, 2023). In addition, it is also frequent for negation to co-occur with entertain. This is supported by previous findings which also note the prevalent employment of entertain and hedging strategies in 3MT presentations (e.g. Qiu and Jiang, 2021), probably because the audience’s heterogeneous disciplinary background may lower speakers’ confidence in the extent to which their positions be accepted (Jiang and Qiu, 2023). Therefore, speakers would use negation alongside entertain devices to express “cautious detachment” (p. 197) so as to mitigate the degree of denial and leave room for alternative positions. Negation might also co-occur with justify to put forward a proposition while justifying the position with a reason. As proposed by Aguilar (2016), in academic speech activities, speakers have to constantly negotiate a balance between solidarity with listeners and their authority. The coarticulations of negation and justify offers an effective way of not just captivating listeners by supplying counterexpectational views but also giving justifiable grounds to persuade the audience of their reliability.

As for the last research question, this research has revealed cross-disciplinary variations at the discourse-semantic level. For one thing, 3MT speakers from soft disciplines adopted significantly more negation resources, and most of the negation markers occurred more frequently in soft disciplines. This is consistent with previous research which also showed a notably more frequent occurrence of negation in soft-disciplinary academic genres (e.g., Sun and Crosthwaite, 2022b; Zolfaghari, 2023) as well as a significant increase of negation resources in soft fields from 1990 to 2000 (Jiang and Hyland, 2022). Grounded in the ESAP practice, scholars have underlined the epistemological potential of knowledge division (i.e., factual versus subjective matters) between hard and soft disciplines (Hyland, 1999; Webber, 2014). 3MT speakers from soft fields show a preference for adopting such dialogistically contractive engagement devices, which narrow down the dialogic space for alternative perspectives and thus magnify speaker-audience solidarity. In comparison, in hard fields, knowledge is taken as factual matters stated more plainly and directly, and uncovering such plain factual matters relies upon ever-accumulating empirical enquiry. Therefore, as pointed out by Sun and Crosthwaite (2022b), fewer numbers of negation devices would be expected in less dialogic-oriented fields.

In addition, at the co-articulating level, our results have revealed intriguing cross-disciplinary variation with respect to the patterns of negation and pronounce. 3MT speakers from hard disciplines tend to place pronounce after negation, while softdisciplinary speakers would constitute an overt intervention into the talk ahead of putting forward any position with negation. Soft-disciplinary 3MT speakers need to be easily understood by a disciplinarily heterogeneous audience outside the narrow precincts of the discipline. As such, negation is perhaps regarded as a rhetorical means to convey ideas and information (Erikson, 2008; Jiang and Hyland, 2022), and the insertion of pronounce ahead could assist speakers in holding listeners’ attention to their voices and persuade the audience so as to receive more approval. The finding aligns with previous literature regarding the effects of disciplinary culture on stylistic choices of interpersonal devices (e.g., Li and Wharton, 2012; Zolfaghari, 2023). By comparison, given the less interactive effects of factual matters, as opposed to the more unpredictable nature of human factors and subjective matters, it would be reasonable for hard-disciplinary speakers to stress the information in the first place and less assertively articulate the authorial stance (Fryer, 2013).

# 7. Conclusions

In this research, the corpus-informed findings have thrown light on the use of negation in 3MT presentations across hard and soft disciplines at the discourse-semantic level and confirmed the frequent use of negation in the spoken genre. In addition, the findings of this research have revealed both common and discipline-specific uses of individual negation markers and the co-articulations of negation alongside other appraisal devices in 3MT presentations.

Despite the innovative findings, as a preliminary attempt to explore the disciplinary use of negation as an interpersonal device in 3MT presentations, we have explored 124 presentations in total. Subsequent research could compile larger datasets including a broader range of spoken academic genres (e.g., academic blogs and conference oral presentations) to determine if speakers employ similar or divergent interpersonal strategies when presenting authorial positions and engaging with diverse audiences across different genres. It would also be intriguing to investigate how 3MT speakers establish a presence for their research solely through an appraisal analysis. Furthermore, it would be perhaps fascinating to go beyond two co-occurring features and examine the use of more complicated patterns (e.g., “counter $^ +$ negation $^ +$ attitude”) in either spoken or written texts. Moreover, delving into more complex patterns (e.g., “counter $^ +$ negation $^ +$ attitude”) in both spoken and written texts could offer valuable insights. According to Xu and Nesi (2019), exploring these intricate co-occurring patterns might assist in sensitizing novice writers and gatekeepers, yet this area has not been thoroughly examined by researchers thus far.

Nevertheless, despite the limitations mentioned above, negation strategies and their co-articulating patterns identified in this study add to the current body of knowledge on interpersonal strategies within 3MT presentations. Our cross-disciplinary comparisons of negation alongside its co-articulating patterns in the academic spoken genre provide evidential support to the previous argument that academic written genres’ linguistic and rhetorical features are shaped by particular disciplinary epistemologies and practices (Jiang, 2022; Sun and Xiao, 2023; Xiao and Sun, 2020). In addition, the findings of this research may also contribute to a growing understanding of how academic speakers convey stances, manage speaker-listener relationships, and hook their audiences within strict time constraints in a competitive environment. In this way, the findings could also raise pedagogical implications for postgraduate research students, 3MT workshop instructors, and EAP practitioners, who are devoted to enhancing oral academic skills or teaching such curricula. Our findings may also be of interest not only to graduate students who seek to adapt to publicly engaging positions or activities but also to less experienced scholars who are endeavoring to communicate their research to a wider audience than readers of conference papers and research articles.

To be specific, the employment of negation devices, co-articulations of negation together with other relevant appraisal resources as well as the explanations based on the interpersonal strategies can be used as an educational tool to familiarise undergraduate and postgraduate students with how interpersonal language is used in a given spoken context. Based on the findings, EAP practitioners may develop awareness-raising tasks to elucidate the targeted negation alongside appraisal devices and motivate learners to probe into more exemplary academic presentations as “models which can be analysed and emulated” (Hyland, 1996, p. 483). Further pedagogic approaches may involve prompting students to locate places where interpersonal resources have been removed or extraneous ones inserted, analyzing the implications of employing different interpersonal linguistic devices as well as their co-articulations, comparing the interpretations of identical forms in diverse situations/contexts, and examining the functional impacts of alternative forms (Hyland, 1996).

In addition, EAP practitioners may also consider developing data-driven learning workshops based on the findings and help students become aware of linguistic and rhetorical strategies for less experienced researchers and students. Nausa (2019) found that second language speakers in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context face challenges in giving a persuasive and engaging spoken academic delivery in English in either in-class presentations or international academic conferences. To tackle the issue, EAP practitioners can implement small-scale corpus-based pedagogic intervention, which according to Coxhead (2010) has great potential to enhance learners’ awareness of the target linguistic features and frequent interpersonal rhetorical patterns through exploring corpus data. Students who are offered the chance to interact with empirical findings during such workshops are witnessed to critically reflect on the likely rhetorical consequences of different linguistic choices and to effectively draw conclusions relevant to their own language production. In addition, as proposed by Chung (2022), interpersonal strategies alongside the appraisal framework may also serve as self-checklists introduced to tertiary-level spoken academic curriculums. Such interpersonal rubrics are suggested to be set as both guides and goals for learners, help learners deal with the demands of academic presentations, and ultimately enhance learners’ abilities to more properly express stances and engage with the audience.
