# ABSTRACT

This study applies Activity Theory to describe and analyze an out-of-school project in which eight Chinese university students utilized a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) to learn English. Based on data collected through questionnaires, gaming journals, gaming recordings and interviews, thematic analysis was performed to identify the recurrent themes, which were then mapped onto the activity system. Four contradictions were identified in the process. Temporary contradictions dominated the early phase of the project and were easily resolved. However, inherent contradictions, mainly manifesting themselves through inadequate competence and learner variation, remained unresolved. Efforts to overcome these tensions resulted in the evolvement of the activity system. In terms of the actual outcomes, there was evidence for the development and exercise of autonomy. Learners also reported enhanced confidence and gains in vocabulary, listening and oral fluency. The study contributes new knowledge to the field by revealing how non-gamers make use of digital gaming for language learning in an informal setting. Pedagogical implications for digital game-based language learning are discussed and suggestions for future research are also provided.

# Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt shift to online learning. Now that learning is taking place outside the classroom, the issue of out-of-school learning has become more relevant now than ever before. Meanwhile, as a rare exception during the current economic downturn, the gaming industry has experienced significant growth, with more people investing increasing amounts of time in digital games during the lockdown. Against this backdrop, the fusion of these two domains seems logical and necessary, and there is a need to explore ways to facilitate autonomous and effective online learning through digital games.

A number of studies have reported benefits of using digital games for language learning, such as enhanced motivation, lowered anxiety and vocabulary development (See Peterson et  al., 2020 for a recent review). One strand of the research has particularly focused on the learning opportunities afforded by digital games outside the classroom. It is found that autonomous digital gaming in out-of-school contexts is positively linked with language development, vocabulary learning in particular (Jensen, 2017; Scholz & Schulze, 2017; Sundqvist, 2019; Sylvén & Sundqvist, 2012a, 2012b). There is also evidence that digital gaming ‘in the wild’ can facilitate incidental and autonomous learning (Benson & Chik, 2011; Chik, 2014; Sundqvist, 2015). However, there is a lack of a comprehensive and systematic account of learners’ experiences of language learning through digital gaming in such a novel and informal setting. For example, what difficulties would learners face in that particular context? How would they deal with those issues? Current studies fail to address the challenges encountered during the whole process, but these issues merit further investigation since they have implications for improving and promoting the practice of game-based language learning (GBLL).

To fill this gap, the present study contributes to the literature by applying the activity theory framework to outline and analyze an extramural GBLL project, with a focus on the contradictions and resolutions, as well as outcomes of the activity system relating to learner practices and perceptions. In addition, instead of involving gamers, which is often the case in the current literature, this study targets non-gamers as there is a need to find out whether this group of learners are able to capitalize upon the affordances of digital games for L2 learning.

# Background

# Digital games, out-of-school language learning and autonomy

Digital games figure prominently in the current media landscape. To leverage this influential media for language learning, many CALL researchers have examined its affordance, namely ‘the possibilities for action that yield opportunities for engagement and participation’ (van Lier, 2004, p. 81). Some GBLL researchers have made efforts to integrate digital games into classrooms, but these attempts meet with many obstacles such as gaming’s negative image in some quarters, incompatibility with current curriculums, insufficient technical support and institutional barriers (DeHaan, 2019; Swier & Peterson, 2018). Aware of these constraints, researchers set out to explore out-of-school GBLL, that is, a context where learners take the initiative to play the game outside the classroom and in the absence of instructional support and intervention.

A handful of studies conducted in Nordic contexts have demonstrated that students’ out-of-school digital gaming is beneficial for L2 learning. For example, based on data collected through questionnaires and language diaries, Sylvén and Sundqvist (2012a) categorized 86 young learners in Sweden into three groups: frequent gamers, moderate gamers and non-gamers. The results of language proficiency tests showed that in terms of vocabulary, listening and comprehension, frequent gamers performed best while non-gamers had the lowest scores. The findings corroborate Jensen (2017), who examined the language diaries of young learners in Denmark and reported a positive link between out-of-school digital gaming and vocabulary size. In a later study, conducted on a larger scale, Sundqvist (2019) placed learners into different groups based on their experience of digital gameplay involving various game types. In addition to the positive impact of digital gaming on vocabulary, the results also revealed that in comparison with non-gamers, gamers were able to produce more advanced vocabulary. The test scores also indicated that for L2 learning, time spent on digital games mattered more than game type.

Students in these studies played digital games at their discretion and in the absence of institutional intervention and constraints. It is thus plausible to argue that the issue of autonomy, namely ‘the ability to take charge of one’s own learning’ (Holec, 1981, p.3), should be highlighted in such a context. According to Gee and Hayes (2012), digital games constitute a kind of out-of-school affinity space, where learners demonstrate a high degree of autonomy in choosing and managing their learning based on interest. Moreover, research suggests that in addition to the embedded game discourse (in-game texts displayed on screen) and emergent game discourse (in-game communication), players are also exposed to attendant game discourse or paratext related to the game, which includes walkthroughs, game reviews and game-related discussions (Reinhardt & Thorne, 2016). Confronted with the complex game-related linguistic resources (Thorne et  al., 2012), learners have to exercise autonomy so as to navigate the game world. Based on data collected from six experienced gamers, Bytheway (2014) noted that the in-game culture of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) underscored the importance of autonomous learning and players were expected to rely on themselves to learn the language essential for gameplay so as to advance in the game. To get a sense of how players exercise autonomy in their gameplay, Chik (2011) examined the gaming and learning practices of 10 Chinese-speaking Hongkong gamers with at least 5 years of gaming experience. The qualitative analysis of their gaming sessions, interviews and stimulated recalls showed that they were aware of the potential of digital games for language learning and were able to exercise autonomy in selecting the game, finding appropriate gaming/learning materials and participating in discussions with other gamers in the community. In a later study, Chik (2014) applied Benson’s framework on autonomy (Benson, 2011) to further analyze gamers’ out-of-school GBLL practices from the four dimensions of location, formality, pedagogy and locus of control. The analysis revealed that a new dimension, trajectory, should be added to the framework to reflect how these self-organized practices develop over time. The results further suggested that autonomous digital gaming in an out-of-school setting can result in incidental learning, but the author also cautioned that gamers tended to prioritize gaming over L2 learning.

The studies cited above have provided insights into out-of-school digital gaming. However, the existing research is still limited in this regard and just as noted by Benson and Chik (2010), digital games, as a landscape for autonomous language learning, remain under-researched. Moreover, one major concern regarding the current literature is the heavy focus on incidental learning outcomes and practices of gamers, which begs the question: how about non-gamers? Their experiences and perceptions should also be probed so that more uptake of GBLL activities can be realized and GBLL practices can be more widely accepted and promoted. In this sense, there is a need for studies dedicated to non-gamers to establish that GBLL can be effective regardless of prior gaming experience. Additionally, for the studies that report on the practices of autonomy in out-of-school digital gaming, caution is also needed when interpreting findings as the subjects of these studies are experienced gamers of advanced language level. It can be argued that the autonomy may be the cause instead of the result of such practices, indicating more evidence is needed in regards to the development of autonomy as a result of digital gaming.

# MMOG and language learning

Researchers to date have investigated different genres of digital games in relation to language learning, and in particular, it is the massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) that have received the most academic attention (Hung et  al., 2018). In MMOGs, players explore a theme-based virtual world in their avatars and they often work in groups to complete quests. A large body of research suggests that the anonymity and the low-stress immersive environment provided by MMOGs can positively impact affective factors, resulting in more willingness to communicate (Reinders & Wattana, 2011, 2014, 2015), enhanced motivation (Connolly et  al., 2011; Liu & Chu, 2010) and lowered anxiety (Grimshaw & Cardoso, 2018; Horowitz, 2019). As for the learning outcomes achieved, a majority of MMOG-based studies have reported improvement in vocabulary acquisition and highlighted the potential of using MMOGs to promote communicative competence (Jabbari & Eslami, 2019).

One common thread in the literature is that MMOGs can facilitate interaction and socialization as they provides venues where players are forced to produce target language (TL) and gain access to online communities of shared interest. For example, in an early study by Thorne (2008), one native speaker of English and one native speaker of Ukrainian played World of Warcraft (WOW) together. The analysis of the in-game conversation showed that gameplay did elicit interaction and the language produced demonstrated patterns beneficial for L2 learning such as negotiation, requests, repairs, and corrective feedback. Moreover, the two players were found to have developed a ‘social bond’ that extended beyond the game. In another study (Peterson, 2012), four EFL learners played the MMOG Wonderland for four 70-minute sessions held over one month. Discourse analysis of chat logs showed that learners managed to engage in dialogue in which they demonstrated a range of strategies related to positive politeness such as greetings, informal language, small talk and humor. Players were also found to offer peer scaffolding during gameplay. Collectively, these studies present evidence that MMOGs constitute engaging contexts for L2 development and socialization. However, there is another side to the story. For example, in Rankin et  al. (2006), four EFL learners played the game Ever Quest 2 for four hours per week over four weeks. Based on interviews and observation, it was found that in comparison with the intermediate and advanced level learners who benefited from gameplay, the beginner learner experienced difficulties in adapting to this new learning environment. Similarly, Rama et  al. (2012) investigated the gameplay of two Spanish learners who played WOW together. Based on data collected through observation, interviews, chat logs and journal entries, the analysis revealed the contrasting experiences of these players. It was found that the expert player with beginner level language proficiency enjoyed the interaction with the gaming community and reported satisfactory experiences, whereas the inexperienced player with advanced language proficiency struggled with game mechanics and expressed disappointments at her in-game performance. These finding suggested that the affordances of MMOGs for L2 learners may not be universal and there is a need for more research into the difficulties and challenges encountered during gameplay, especially the experiences of novice gamers who lack knowledge of game norms.

# Theoretical framework: activity theory

This study is framed by Activity Theory (henceforth AT), which examines human practices and actions both at individual and collective levels (Engeström, 1987). First initiated by Vygotsky (1978), AT builds upon the principle of social mediation. Visualized in the form of a triad, AT consists of three basic components: the subjects (the actors), the object (the goal or the driving force behind the activity) and mediating artefacts (the tools or the instruments), that is, mediated by the tools, subjects are able to achieve the object. Leont’ev (1978) advanced the theory by adding the social dimension to the landscape, contending that activities take place in socio-culturally specific contexts. Later, Engeström (1987) expanded the model into six components (subject, tool, object, rule, division of labor and community) so as to frame the unit of analysis from a collective perspective. As illustrated in Figure 1, tools, also referred to as instruments and mediating artefacts, mediate between the subjects and their object, which is the purpose of the activity. The model proposes that the individual does not act in isolation and thus the complex interrelations between the individuals and their community must be considered. The rules, explicit or implicit, govern the interactions within the community, which is organized through a certain division of labor. The object of the activity represents the intention which motivates the activity system as a whole and as a result of the interplay of the six components, object is transformed into the outcome.

The activity system does not remain static; instead, it is constantly working through contradictions and ‘equilibrium is an exception, tensions, disturbances and local innovations are the rule and the engine of change’ (Cole & Engeström, 1993, p.8). According to Engeström (2001, p.137), contradictions refer to ‘historically accumulated structural tensions within and between activity systems’ and they cannot be observed directly (Engeström & Sannino, 2011). Researchers have thus examined contradictions through their various manifestations which are termed in the literature as systemic tensions, misfit, disturbance, disruption, ruptures, breakdowns and clashes (Murphy & Manzanares, 2014). Specifically, contradictions may occur within individual components (primary), between components (secondary), between different developmental phases of a single activity (tertiary) or between different activities (quaternary) (Engeström, 1987). As the central concept or principle of the activity theory, contradictions are considered as ‘the source of change and development’ (Engeström, 2001, p.137). It was argued that the success or failure of the activity system depends on the handling and resolution of contradictions and in this sense, the investigation of how they are addressed sheds light upon the evolvement and transformation of the system (Dippe, 2006).

Figure 1. E ngeström’s activity system (Engeström, 1987).

In the field of CALL, researchers have employed AT to explore a wide range of issues such as tele-collaborations (Antoniadou, 2011; Basharina, 2007; Ryder & Yamagata-Lynch, 2014), collaborative writing (Blin & Appel, 2011), digital storytelling (Priego & Liaw, 2017) and autonomy (Blin, 2004). However, to date, it has been rarely used in GBLL research with a few exceptions. Ryu (2013) described and analyzed how six players of the game Civilization participated in the activity of English learning through an AT lens. The analysis showed that during gameplay, players (the subjects) can only learn words and phrases related to the game content. Driven by the contradiction between the desired game level and their current gaming skill, players extended their gameplay to other game-related activities, thus gaining access to expanded learning opportunities through beyond-game culture. The English-only rule on the fan website forced players to write posts in English and within the community, players assumed the role of both teachers and learners (division of labor). In a more recent study, Vosburg (2017) reported players’ perception of group dynamics and TL use of two groups of WOW players over a period of eight weeks. In line with the theoretical assertion of AT that human activity should be understood under a certain sociocultural condition, the focus of this study was to investigate how the group dynamics affected language output and motivation. The findings highlighted the positive and motivational role the native-speaking language guide had on the L2 learners, and it was noted that the benefits gained from digital gaming may be heavily dependent on the inter-relationships between players. These two studies demonstrate the potential of AT as a theoretical framework and data analysis tool to investigate out-of-school GBLL, but more research is needed to elaborate on how contradictions emerge and how the activity system develops in that particular context.

# Present study

This study contributes to the literature by employing AT as the theoretical framework and analytical tool to investigate out-of-school GBLL with a focus on contradictions and resolutions, as well as the activity outcome. This process-oriented study can benefit from the use of AT as it allows researchers to ‘make sense of complex real-world data sets in a manageable and meaningful way’ (Yamagata-Lynch, 2010, p.5). Moreover, as it is argued that AT provides an integrative framework to examine the development and exercise of autonomy in the context of CALL (Blin, 2004), there exists potential to draw upon this framework to describe and analyze the autonomous practices of learners in this out-of-school study. Applied to this setting, AT can shed new light upon how the subjects’ autonomous actions are mediated, what contradictions emerge and how they are handled. With this context in mind, the following research questions were formulated to guide our investigation:

1. What contradictions emerged in this out-of-school GBLL project? How did learners experience and resolve them? 2. What are the outcomes of the activity system?

# Methods

Due to the exploratory and naturalistic nature of this study, a case study design was adopted to collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data. As noted by Yamagata-Lynch (2010), case study is particularly compatible with the theoretical assertions of the activity theory as this method allows for a detailed account of the naturalistic process under investigation. Additionally, with its rich data, a case study is able to provide a holistic view by penetrating ‘situations in ways that are not always susceptible to numerical analysis’ (Cohen et  al., 2007, p. 253). In this study, data from multiple sources were garnered to provide a comprehensive account of out-of-school digital gaming. This triangulation can provide corresponding evidence to answer the research questions and address the validity of the findings.

# Context and participant

The study took place in the winter holiday in 2021 and lasted six weeks. The recruitment advertisement was posted on the bulletin board of a comprehensive Chinese university to invite volunteers to play the game Phasmophobia (https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/ Phasmophobia/) in English. Phasmophobia is a cooperative game in which players work in groups to gather information about ghosts by using various equipment. The objective is to identify the ghost type players are dealing with. In the game, players split up to search for clues in haunted places, so they need to remain contact with one another through in-game voice chat so as to share real-time information. This game was chosen for its abundant opportunities for linguistic input and output. Teamwork and in-game communication are a must to complete the quests. Moreover, as experience is crucial for advancing in the game, players are expected to read and watch game-related materials extensively to ascertain gaming tips.

Initially, 14 students responded and completed the entry questionnaire which was designed to solicit information on their backgrounds and gaming histories. As the study focused on the experience of non-gamers, three respondents were removed from the list. Then the remaining 11 students were asked to take the Oxford Placement Test (Geranpayeh, 2003) to measure their language level. One student of beginner level was further excluded as it is suggested that intermediate learners would benefit most from digital games (Poole & Clarke-Midura, 2020; Rankin et  al., 2006). Another two students dropped out during the first week due to scheduling issues. As a result, eight female non-gamers with intermediate language proficiency participated in this study. Their age ranged from 20 to 22 and they came from a diverse disciplinary background including English, linguistics, education, economics and foreign trade. They all had personal computers and home access to the Internet. Moreover, written consents regarding data handling were collected from all volunteers, who were given no extra incentives and were aware of their right to withdraw at any time.

# Research design

Prior to the project, the first author set up a group chat in Tencent QQ (https://international.qq.com/English1033.html, one of the most popular social networking tools in China) to host all the learning materials and support communication. At the outset, the participants were administered a pre-study questionnaire on their autonomy and they were introduced to the project and the game via group chat and the videos stored in QQ files. The participants then installed the game and familiarized themselves with the gameplay through tutorial videos and articles on gameplay strategies. Throughout the project, they were free to play the game at their discretion. The only requirement was to submit at least one recording of their gameplay each week, based on which the researcher gave individualized feedback in terms of grammar, pronunciation and vocabulary. The participants were also asked to keep a weekly journal to reflect upon their own gaming experience and elaborate on their game-related activities. This would offer insights into their daily learning/ gaming practices. It should be noted that due to the autonomous nature of this project, no requirement was mandatory. In the last week, an exit questionnaire was administered. In addition to the same items on learner autonomy in the pre-questionnaire, participants were also asked about their attitudes towards the learning experience. Based on responses to the open-ended questions, semi-structured interviews were conducted for clarification and to provide different perspectives on responses. To sum up, the activity system proposed for this study can thus be portrayed in Figure 2 which outlines the initial structure of the activity by specifying its different elements from the perspective of participants.

# Data collection

Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained so as to gain a comprehensive picture of the issues under investigation. To be more specific, the quantitative data came from learner responses to the Likert-scale items in the questionnaire, while the qualitative data consisted of semi-structured interviews, gameplay recordings, weekly journal entries, answers to the open-ended questions in the exit questionnaire, group chat, private messages with the instructor, and the instructor’s field notes.

# Instruments

Autonomy scale.  Following Sato et  al. (2020), 49 items from the 5-point Likert scale Measuring Instrument for Language Learner Autonomy (MILLA) were adopted to measure the autonomy level from the technical and psychological dimension (see Appendix A). Developed based on an extensive review, MILLA (Murase, 2015) has an acceptable level of validity according to the Goodness-of-fit statistics and a high level of reliability (Cronbach alpha $= 0 . 9 3 6 \AA$ ). The technical dimension (items 1-21) consists of behavioral and situational autonomy, focusing on learners’ ability to take control of their learning. As for the psychological dimension (items 22-49), the focus is placed on the ability to control learning through motivational strategies, metacognitive strategies and affective factors. A high score indicates a high level of autonomy and the items in the pre and post questionnaire were arranged in different order.

Exit questionnaire and semi-structured interviews.  At the end of the project, an exit questionnaire was distributed. Apart from the items on autonomy, the questionnaire consisted of another 19 items and 2 open questions (see Appendix B), which were adapted from Li et  al. (2021) to focus on learner perception, difficulties encountered, perceived benefits and suggestions for improvement. The Cronbach alpha of these items was 0.872, indicating good reliability. Based on their responses, follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted via QQ. Interviews were transcribed and translated for further analysis.

Figure 2. M odel for the activity system in the context of out-of-school GBLL.

Weekly game journals.  Participants were asked to keep a weekly game journal (see Appendix C). The journal, validated by two senior CALL researchers, was designed to elicit information regarding the duration of gameplay as well as game-related activities. Participants were free to use either English or Chinese.

Recordings.  As mentioned previously, participants were asked to submit audio recordings of their gameplay each week. Audio recording was favored over screen recording out of the concern that screen recording may hinder the smooth running of the game, especially given limited RAM and hard drive constraints. As a result, a total of 53 audio files were collected and then transcribed for further analysis.

# Data analysis

Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS. As for the qualitative data, thematic analysis was adopted in combination with the activity system analysis. Initial coding was performed to generate recurring themes, which were then sorted and grouped under the categories of activity system components operationalized by Mwanza’s (2001) Eight-StepModel. As the activity system from the perspective of the participants was taken as the unit of analysis, this study only focused on the primary and secondary contradictions within the system. In identifying the contradictions, the researchers were guided by the understanding that contradictions open up new opportunities and call for novel solutions that can lead to transformations in activities (Engeström, 1987). In other words, the transformative power of contradictions is the most relevant for this study, therefore this construct was conceptualized as sources of change, development and innovation. Then the mutual relationship between each component (eg. subject-tool, rule-community) was examined to locate and map the contradictions onto the activity system. The whole coding process was performed by the first and third author separately. Disagreements were then settled through discussion until agreement was reached so as to finalize the coding scheme for contradictions, as shown in Table 1 and to produce the activity system for presentation, as shown in Figure 3.

# Results

Based on analysis of the empirical data, the activity system for this out-of-school GBLL project can be portrayed in Figure 3. According to Leont’ev (1978), activities are driven by a motive and are directed towards an object. In this case, the subjects, namely the participants of the project, were motivated by the initial object of playing the game in English, and in attainment of the goal, they carried out a variety of goal-oriented actions. As a result, the activity system has evolved from its initial form (presented earlier in Figure 2) to include more elements in each node (marked in bold and italics in Figure 3). As noted earlier, the development or transformation of an activity system is driven by the contradictions that emerge. In Figure 3, dotted arrows represent the four contradictions identified throughout the process. The efforts to resolve them, successful or not, helped transform the object into actual outcomes. The following section provides a detailed interpretation of the AS from the perspectives of contradictions and outcome.

# RQ 1. What contradictions emerged in this out-of-school GBLL project? How did learners experience and resolve them?

Contradictions, marked by the dotted lines with two arrows at the ends, are identified in the three sub-triangles that constitute the activity system: contradiction A in the top sub-triangle (subject-tool-object), contradiction B and C in the bottom-left sub-triangle (subject-rule-community), and contradiction C in the bottom-right sub-triangle (community-division of labor-object).

# Contradiction A: tool versus object

Contradictions arose between tool and object as participants felt incapable of completing the object with the tools at their disposal and their current level of language proficiency and gaming skill.

Gameplay-related contradiction.  Contradictions in this regard quickly emerged with most of learners reporting technical problems in the first two weeks. They complained of an unstable network. However, this issue was easily resolved through the installation of the proxy recommended by the instructor. One learner found that her computer lacked sufficient memory to run the game. This was also resolved when she received technical support from a peer.

Another contradiction in this regard came from the learners’ inadequate gaming skills and limited digital literacy in navigating the online gaming world. As non-gamers, this group of participants experienced a steep learning curve when it came to gameplay, as can be seen in the comments below:

‘This is new for me. I have to learn from the scratch.’ ‘I often got lost in the game and don’t know how to use the equipment.’

At the beginning, the learners had to learn the gaming mechanics and once they mastered the basic skills, they also needed to obtain tips on how to advance in the game. To overcome these difficulties, the instructors provided them with videos and articles and recommended some gaming websites. Upon the request of two participants who found gaming especially difficult, the instructor joined them in the game to teach them how to play. One of them stated: ‘At first, I was not familiar with this game, and I felt disappointed that I lose every time. I was very frustrated.’ However, she went on to state that ‘Things got better after I got the hang of it. It’s not that difficult.’ The other said that after the instructor showed her how to play and she read some articles online, she was able to play the game and even come up with solutions on her own later on.

Language-related contradiction.  In the early stage of the project, learners had difficulty in employing appropriate vocabulary and expressions during the gameplay. This finding is illustrated in the learner feedback reproduced below:

‘Some things in the game are very common, like 斧头 (ax), but I just don’t know their English names.’

‘I know many academic words, but this game made me realize I don’t know many every day words. I don’t even know how to say 开关 (switch)’.

It can be inferred that playing this game drew learner attention to issues in their language learning. They resorted to different strategies to resolve these contradictions. To enrich their vocabulary, participants read and watched walkthroughs and took notes of the useful words and expressions (see Appendix D for an example). An excerpt from a game play transcript is reproduced below:

A: ‘Can you turn on the…the…?’   
B: ‘What?’   
A: ‘I forgot the word! Wait! Let me check!’ … ‘Oh, it’s thermometer! Turn on the   
thermometer!’

This excerpt shows that when the player did not know the necessary words, she would look up the word. This interpretation of the data was confirmed in the interview when the learner stated that she kept an electronic dictionary at hand during the game play. Other learners also reported that they would refer to their notes or smartphone when they were at a loss for words, which is evidenced by the following remarks:

‘If I don’t speak, I’ll die, so I put my smartphone nearby. When I don’t know how to say something, I can look up the words immediately.’

Some participants also used Chinese, or Chinese followed by some English for paraphrasing. For example:

C: I find the ghost! Come here! A: ‘Where are you?’ C: I’m in 地下室, underground.

Noting this, the instructor offered the English versions in the feedback and it was observed that in most cases, participants would use the correct word the next time when they wanted to express the same meaning, indicating that they read the feedback very carefully. Thanks to these efforts, this type of contradiction was greatly reduced after three weeks.

However, after mastering the basics, learners started to have higher requirements for themselves, with some not satisfied with the quality of their language output. They expressed this in the interview:

‘When I watch native speakers play the game, they can use different expressions, but I can only use the same word over and over again.’

‘After I mastered the basics, I want my language to be more native-like.’

From this feedback, it is clear that as the project progressed, the learners’ focus shifted from accuracy to quality and this language-related contradiction also took on a new meaning. In response, the instructor provided some alternatives that they could use in similar contexts when giving feedback and it was observed that they were able to utilize these words and expressions in later similar situations. This was confirmed by the learner who stated that:

‘I try to force myself to use different words every time. To use the words I newly learned to replace the words I’m already familiar with.’

As an example, one learner said $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ don’t have other choices’ during gameplay in week 2, but she used $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ have limited options’ in week 3 and ‘we are running out of options now’ in week 5.

# Contradiction B: subject versus rule

Teamwork was needed to play the game, but the interaction between this game rule and subjects brought forth a contradiction as subjects struggled to find teammates. They found it challenging to coordinate each other’s schedules for gameplay. However, learners managed to work out solutions on their own either by inviting their friends to join or by joining random groups online. Moreover, it is noteworthy that this scheduling issue served as a trigger to encourage innovation. Two learners overcame this obstacle by playing the game alone. They played the game as if they were livestreaming, talking about what they saw, what they did and how they felt during gameplay, as shown in the following excerpt:

‘What a sunny day! How about something meaningful? I got an excellent idea. I’ll play a very interesting game, Phasmophobia. Absolutely, I need more brave (bravery) and courage. Ok. I’ll get started. Here I go. I’m too excited. The game is loading. Ok. I’m in. Wow, look, I level up and my money is 90. I’m a big boss now.’

The learner demonstrated that she talked as if there was an audience watching her play. She explained this in the interview:

‘Sometimes when I want to play the game, my friends are not available, so I play it alone. I’ve seen some YouTubers did that. I think it’s interesting, so I give it a try.’

The instructor shared this innovative practice in the group chat and another two learners followed suit in the coming weeks. However, three participants expressed their dissatisfaction with these solutions as they believed that pairing and frequency of gameplay should be covered and made explicit in the project requirements.

# Contradiction C: subject versus community

Engeström (2001) pointed out that when a contradiction is the source of change, this change can lead to another contradiction that again is the source for further change. In our case, as a result of handling the scheduling issue, the community expanded from consisting of only the participants and the instructor to include participants’ friends and online gaming community. Within this expanded community, subjects had more opportunities to play the game. However, due to the introduction of new members, they had to deal with new contradictions. When learners tried to join others online, they were sometimes ejected from the game. They were also upset by strangers who were not that friendly and talkative. They expressed their frustration in the interviews:

‘I had hoped to talk with native speakers, but they didn’t talk much. I speak much more when I play with friends.’

‘I thought playing with native speakers can help me improve, but I was wrong because they only talk with each other, not with me.’

However, it was observed that instead of discouraging them, the unpleasant encounters with online gamers motivated learners to work for higher levels in the game.

# Contradiction D: community versus division of labor

Before the study commenced, all the participants were aware of the autonomous nature of this out-of-school project and expressed their wish for interdependence and freedom. However, as the project progressed, several participants expressed their desire for more instructor guidance. As some learners commented:

‘I am used to being told what to do.’   
‘I think the tasks should be mandatory. For example, everyone should summarize   
at least 5 words each week.’   
‘I think the feedback each week is very useful for me, but I think more teaching   
will be better.’

In this contradiction, learners had different expectations for the instructor, with some enjoying the autonomy given to them while some yearning for more and direct scaffolding. Therefore, the instructor, torn between her role as a facilitator and the learners’ desire for more scaffolding, faced a dilemma with regard to whether to set more mandatory requirements. In response, the instructor conducted regular checking with each individual and provided support accordingly, which partially resolved the contradiction that was present throughout the project.

# RQ 2. What are the outcomes of the activity system?

# Development and exercise of autonomy

The scores of the items concerning autonomy in the pre and post questionnaire were used to detect the possible development of learner autonomy from two dimensions. The descriptive statistics showed that learners obtained higher scores in the post test, indicating possible improvement of autonomy level. Due to the small sample size and thus the lack of normal data distribution, non-parametric test was employed to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in participants’ pre and post autonomy level. As illustrated in Table 2, the Wilcoxon signed rank test found a significant difference both in terms of the technical dimension $( Z = - 3 . 2$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 1 \dot { }$ ) and psychology dimension $\left( Z = - 3 . 3 5 2 \right.$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). This finding is also in line with learner responses to the item that they believed they gained confidence as an autonomous learner $( M = 4 . 1 2 5$ , $S D = 0 . 6 )$ and gained the ability to make use of game-related resources for the purpose of language learning ( $M = 4 . 1 2 5$ , $S D = 0 . 6 4 )$ .

Average time spent on gameplay each week   
Figure 4. Average time spent on gameplay each week.

In terms of their autonomous learning practices, weekly journal entries were examined. In total, the eight learners invested 148 hours in gameplay throughout the project $\mathit { T M } = 1 8 . 5$ , $S D = 3 . 9 3 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). As demonstrated in Figure 4, the average time spent on gameplay per week dropped in week 2, but went up gradually in the following weeks. At the end of the project, their in-game levels reached 19.25 $\mathrm { \Delta } S D = 3 . 7 3 \mathrm { \Delta }$ ) on average.

Besides gameplay, the participants also exercised autonomy in terms of their learning activities which fell into two categories: one was directly related to the gameplay itself such as watching walkthroughs, reading game review and browsing game-related websites, while the other included activities that were more oriented to language learning such as practicing pronunciation skills and summarizing useful language points. In their journals participants wrote:

‘In addition to playing the game, I would also watch walkthrough videos to learn some expressions. I note down the words and expressions so that I can use them when I play the game with my friends.’

‘The instructor pointed out several mistakes I made in my pronunciation and taught me some useful pronunciation skills such as linking. So I found some more materials to practice.’

‘Speaking in the game is not enough. I also did some practice myself, for example, to repeat BBC news.’

These remarks demonstrated that the learners did not only rely upon the game itself for learning, but also extended learning outside the game.

# Perceptions towards digital game-based language learning

Data show that the participants were overwhelmingly satisfied with the learning experience $\mathit { M } = 4 . 3 8$ , $S D = 0 . 5 2 $ ), stating that they were willing to recommend it to others $\mathit { M } = 4 . 6 3$ , $S D = 0 . 5 2$ ) and would choose to participate in similar projects in the future $\cdot M { = } 4 . 2 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 4 6 $ ). Learners used the word ‘exciting’, ‘novel’ and ‘worthwhile’ to describe the experience. Several participants expressed their willingness to continue to play the game even after the project ended, indicating their enjoyment with the game itself. Compared to conventional speaking classes, learners in general preferred to speak English in the game $\langle M = 4 . 2 5$ , $S D = 0 . 7 $ ). Additionally, the instructor’s role was well-received in terms of providing feedback $\mathit { M } = 4 . 8 7 5$ , $S D = 0 . 3 5 3$ ), materials $M = 4 . 6 2 5$ , $S D = 0 . 5 1 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), and gaming support and guidance $\mathit { M } = 4 . 6 2 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 5 1 7 .$ ). Learner comments in the interview and game journal highlighted the importance of instructor feedback. As noted earlier, learners benefited from the feedback in terms of language variety. It was also observed that they were able to correct the pronunciation mistakes pointed out in the feedback. It can be argued that feedback drew their attention to their mistakes and helped them perform better in the future. Unexpectedly, two participants even said that they were moved by the instructor’s detailed feedback and attitude. Three participants said that they valued this opportunity because they ‘don’t get feedback like this in class’. For the three participants struggling with gameplay at the outset, it was the detailed and individualized feedback that motivated them to continue. However, it should be noted that in spite of their favorable attitude to and positive comments on this novel way of learning, learners also expressed the concern that the learning ‘may not be systematic enough’ and considered it as only a good ‘supplement’ to formal learning.

# Perceived benefits

Participants agreed that they learned a lot $M = 4$ , $S D { = } 0 . 5 3 4 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and they believed that their listening $\cdot M { = } 4 . 2 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 4 6 2 { \it \Omega }$ ) and speaking $( M { = } 4 . 3 7 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 5 1 7 ,$ ) improved as a result of this project. From their perspective, learning stemmed more from peer interaction $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 4 . 3 7 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 5 1 7 .$ ) and supplementary materials $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = 4 . 1 2 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 6 4 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) than from the game itself $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = 3 . 7 5$ , $S D = 0 . 4 6 2 )$ . Moreover, all the participants reported that they felt more confident $\mathit { M } = 4 . 6 2 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 5 2 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and less anxious $M = 4 ,$ $S D { = } 0 . 5 3 )$ ) when speaking English. Learners stated that they ‘do not worry too much about grammar any more’ and ‘are not that afraid of making mistakes’. The following remarks further illustrate these observations:

‘This project has left a huge impact on me. I didn’t like to speak English because I was worried. But now I realize I can do it. I’m not that bad. I can speak and I can even speak a lot. Now I feel confident.’

‘I can feel a change in my psychology. Now I’m more willing to use English in my daily life. I even added some English words when talking with my friends in Chinese. I can feel I can take more initiative to practice oral English.’

In addition to confidence, participants also felt that they had stronger desire to speak English and their English has improved in terms of vocabulary and fluency, with some stating:

‘At the beginning, I needed to use some Chinese, but later, I can speak English the entire time because I am more fluent and I know many more words.’

‘I learned many words and expressions which are not taught in English classes. I don’t need to write down the sentences before I speak. This is my improvement.’

# Discussion

In this research, Activity theory was employed to systematically describe and analyze the experiences of eight non-gamers who utilized an MMOG for language learning in an out-of-school context. The findings of this study highlight that throughout the process, the subjects worked through contradictions and as a result of their efforts to handle these contradictions, the activity system evolved, with tools, rules, community members, division of labor and objects taking on new forms (Blin, 2004). In turn, the interplay of these components transformed the object into actual outcomes.

In this case, the game affords players opportunities to speak English outside the classroom. However, to fully leverage the affordances of the game, learners have to address various contradictions that emerged as the activities unfolded. The solutions resulted in the changed dynamics of the activity system. On the one hand, some of these contradictions only temporarily disrupted the system and were easily resolved such as poor Internet connection, inadequate PC performance, schedule clashes, and unfamiliarity with the gaming mechanics. On the other hand, some other contradictions were more inherent and remained unresolved. One such tension came from learners’ inadequate language competence. At the beginning, the initial objective was to play the game and their efforts focused on learning the necessary words and expressions. Later, when they no longer had difficulty playing the game using English, their focus shifted to the quality of their language output, indicating the activities transitioned from being gaming-oriented to learning-oriented. This contradiction forced learners to constantly improve their English. Another major unresolved contradiction manifested itself in the division of labor within the community. This was rooted in learners’ different expectations of the instructor, which required the instructor to offer individualized scaffolding to suit varying degrees of competence, echoing Zhao’s (2016) call for taking learner variation into account when utilizing MMOG for

L2 learning. It is worth noting that instead of causing the system to collapse, these contradictions, although not fully addressed, resulted in adoption of solutions that brought improvements to the activity system. In sum, the early phase of the project was dominated by the temporary contradictions and once these were resolved, the more inherent contradictions became more pronounced. This was accompanied by the shift of attention from playing the game to achieving higher levels in the game and language learning through the game.

According to Vygotsky (1978), the development path of a particular phenomenon is best understood through the analysis of the instances that are disrupted. It is demonstrated in this study that sometimes the solution of one contradiction may lead to a new one. As noted earlier, confronted with the scheduling issue (in Contradiction B), learners engaged with online gamers. This brought forth contradiction D (between community and subject), which in turn motivated learners to work for higher levels in the game. In other words, the solution of contradiction B gave rise to contradiction D, the solution of which resulted in more elements in the object. Moreover, sometimes contradictions and their solutions are interconnected or overlapped. For example, for the purpose of improving gaming skills, learners read and watched walkthroughs, which is also conducive to language learning.

As for the outcomes of the activity system, findings were overwhelmingly positive, especially in terms of affective factors, suggesting that even for non-gamers, GBLL is feasible. In particular, both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated the exercise and development of autonomy. Similar to the gamers reported in previous studies (Chik, 2014; Zhao, 2016), non-gamers in this study also managed to make use of materials around the game. Besides that, they also made deliberate efforts to improve their oral English through intentional learning such as pronunciation practice, note-taking, review and reflection. This intentional learning is a step further compared with the incidental learning reported in the literature, suggesting that learners have developed the awareness and ability to harness this game for language learning. Moreover, the GBLL literature has long stressed that it is crucial to balance gaming and learning as it was found that gamers may prioritize gaming over learning and learning may be only a by-product of gaming (Chik, 2014; DeHaan et  al., 2010).However, for non-gamers in this study, they deemed digital learning as an enjoyable way to learn English and their priority was to improve their language ability through it. In this sense, it is plausible to argue that in an out-of-school setting, digital gaming may be more effective for non-gamers than for gamers, highlighting a need for more studies into the differences and similarities between these two groups in the context of out-of-school GBLL.

It is worth noting that despite the autonomous nature of the study, the instructor was found to have played a critical role in helping participants manage contradictions through actions ranging from recommending software to providing scaffolding both in terms of gameplay and language. The findings suggest that, in out-of-school gaming projects like this one, instructors should remain alert to learners’ needs and issues so as to strike a balance between autonomy and scaffolding. In particular, the instructor feedback was the most well-received. As noted previously, timely and individualized feedback enabled learners to correct mistakes, improve their output and even served as a source of motivation. However, as the study focused on participants’ experiences and AT is descriptive rather than prescriptive in nature (Nardi, 1996), the learning achievements were not quantified, indicating more quantitative studies are needed in this regard. Moreover, future research may benefit from the ‘multi-voicedness of activity system’ (Engeström, 2001, p.136) by incorporating the activity system from the perspective of the instructor into the investigation.

Another issue meriting attention is that despite their favorable attitude towards GBLL, participants reported unpleasant encounters with other gamers, which is contrary to the claim that digital games frequently afforded an affinity space (Gee & Hayes, 2012) where players socialize through shared interest. One possible reason for this finding may be the subjects’ unfamiliarity with the gaming culture and conventions. As a result, the non-gamers may have failed to follow certain unwritten rules without knowing. The above finding may also be explained by their low level in the game as it was observed that it was easier to establish a bond with other players after reaching a high level in the game (Chen, 2009; Ducheneaut et  al., 2006). This suggests that MMOG’s affordance of providing a venue for communication with native speakers may be over-estimated in the literature, or at least, this affordance cannot be equally leveraged by all the players. This finding serves as a caution that non-gamers, if propelled into gaming unprepared or too early, may be confronted with setbacks which may dampen their enthusiasm.

# Conclusion

Using a case study design, this research presented an analysis of out-ofschool language learning through digital gaming from the perspective of activity theory. As with most GBLL research, the study is subject to the limitations common in the field such as a small sample size, limited duration and a lack of control group, all of which may make it challenging to generalize the results. In addition, the self-reporting data may be subjective. However, the findings can shed some light upon the complex process of out-of-school GBLL, which is especially important for exploratory studies. Despite these limitations, the study contributes to the expanding research in three ways. First, it applied AT to depict out-ofschool language learning through digital gaming, with a focus on the contradictions that arose throughout the process. This research demonstrates that AT can provide a useful lens to frame such investigation. Second, to the best of the researchers’ knowledge, this is one of the first GBLL studies that targets non-gamers and it provides empirical evidence that even for this learner group, it is feasible to use MMOG for L2 learning. The findings highlight the need for more longitudinal and large-scale studies along this line to produce more quantitative data regarding the learning outcomes of out-of-school digital gaming and the differences between gamers and non-gamers in this context. Third, this study presents the first attempt to measure the development of autonomy as a result of digital gaming in an informal setting. However, more research is needed to investigate how instructors can facilitate autonomy in such a context.
