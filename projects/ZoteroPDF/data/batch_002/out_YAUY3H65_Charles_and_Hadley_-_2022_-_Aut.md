Data-driven learning

Corpus use by EAP students has reportedly increased over the last decade, with considerable optimism about the future of this approach (Chen & Flowerdew, 2018a). However, much research employs data from short classroom courses; little is known about how student corpus use has varied over a span of multiple years. This paper uses long-term trend data from a corpus-based course for graduates which ran 50 times (2009-2017) at a UK university. The course taught students to build do-it-yourself corpora based on their research topic and promoted autonomous consultation of this resource. Questionnaires on corpus use were administered at three stages: precourse (544 students), immediate post-course (343) and delayed post-course, after one year (221). The data show that pre-course corpus use was constant (mean $2 4 \% )$ , while immediate postcourse use (mean $8 7 \%$ and delayed post-course use rose only slightly (mean $6 2 \%$ ) from 2009 to 2017. The lack of appreciable growth in corpus use over nine years does not support the expectation of increased take-up in future. However, the means for regular autonomous use $( \geq 1 /$ week) at $6 1 \%$ (immediate post-course) and $3 7 \%$ (delayed post-course), show the success of the do-it-yourself corpus approach in fostering the autonomous use of corpora by graduates.

# 1. Introduction

Recent surveys have reported that the use of corpora by EAP students has increased markedly over the last decade. For example, Tribble (2015) notes a rise in the number of instructors using corpora in their teaching, and since the majority of respondents to his survey are active in university setings, most are likely to be engaged in some form of EAP. Similarly, Chen and Flowerdew (2018a) found a substantial increase in the number f papers on corpus use in EAP published between 2010 and 2016 in comparison with the previous 10 years, again sugesting that more students are being exposed to data-driven learning (DL). There is also mounting evidence that the informed application of corpus tools and techniques promotes both vocabulary learning (Lee et al. 2019) and language leaning more generall (Boulton & Cobb, 2017). Such findings support the view that student corpus use isincreasing and the expectation that it will continue to do so in future. Prospects for the further adoption of corpus approaches in EAP therefore seem bright, a view underlined by Chen and Flowerdew's (2018a, p. 358) claim that DDL is becoming 'more mainstream'.

learning (CALL in order to cast some doubt upon the extent to which corpus use has become a widespread and accepted technique in second language teaching and leaning. Bax (2003) distinguishes seven stages in the normalisation of CALL, the last of which refers to the point at which the technology becomes so integrated into the language learning and teaching environment that it i no longer the focus of atention. Bax (2003) arues that i is only when the technology has become invisible in this way that we can consider is use to be fully normalised. Bulding upon Bax's work, Chambers (2019) notes the existence of a gap between the published accounts of research using corpora in the classoom and most language teachers everyday teaching reality. Thus she questions the extent to which corpus use has become normalised as an accepted part of teachers' practice. Perez-Paredes (2019) deals with the issue of the nor. malisation of corpus use from a sightl different standpoint. He reviews papers on pedagogic corpus use that appeared in the top five research journals in the field of CALL over the period 2011-2015 and analyses the factors likely to impede the wider adoption and normalisation of DDL. Among these, he points to the fact that most of this research dealt with corpus use in class i.e. not indepen. dently, and analysed only the short-term impact of DDL on language gains; les attention was paidto students cognitive ailities and their long-term autonomous corpus use. Like Chambers, he perceives a disconnect betwen research and teaching, noting that the main stake-holders in these papers are researchers rather than teachers or students. These two studies suggest that, although the reported increase in student corpus use provides some grounds for optimism, there is nevertheless a long way to go before DDL can be considered as normalised.

The research focus identified by Perez-Paredes (2019) on brie, one-ff class-based courses does not enable enquiry into either students' autonomous corpus use outside clas or their long-term corpus use afer the course has ended. These two isues are closely intertwined, ince students who are in the habit of independent corpus consultation have the means to apply these sils over the entire duration of their academic, professonal and personal lives. See in this light, it i clear that developing a greater understanding of the two issues is of prime importance if corpus use is to become more firmly embedded within EAP teaching and learning.

Boulton's (2017) research timeline shows that during the early years of the twenty-first century much research on student corpus use was concerned with establishing the extent to which the practice was efective. Thus many reports were limited in scope, examining the performance of a single group of students during or fter asingle course or intervention, which itelf was often a one-off phenomenon. As noted in Charle (2022), such experimental clasesallowed ittl, if any, autonomous corpus use and often lasted only a matter of weeks (e.g. Boulton, 2010 Crewel, 2007; Perez-Paredes et al, 2013). While some accounts inluded the suggestion that the research should be replicated using an extended time-frame (Gaskell & Cobb, 2004; Huang, 2011; Perez-Paredes et al, 2011), such work seems rarely, if ever, to have been reported. Autonomous corpus use has been a particular focus for studies of graduate leaners (Charles, 2012, 2014, 2015; Cortes, 2007; Cotos et al., 2017; Lee & Swale, 2006). It has often been researched through detailed case studies of small groups of leaners, typically using a longer time-frame of several months (e.g. Chang, 2014; Park & Kingerer, 2010; Yoon, 2016b; Yoon, 2008). More recently, however, there have been large-scale investigations of whole cohorts following a specific academic programme with an element of autonomous use; these include Chen and Flowerdew's (2018b) research on graduate workshops and Crosthwaite et al.'s (2019) report on graduates' corpus work over the course of four to five months.

It would seem, then, that Flowerdew's (2015) cl for more longitudinal research is currently being addressed and with it the investigation of autonomous corpus use. Undoubtedly, the studies mentioned above have provided much valuable information about students' reactions to corpus work, their corpus enquiry behaviour and degree of engagement with the approach. However, the time period examined stil tends to be relatively hort (i.e. a matter of months), which means that the findings cnnot give us a sense of the development of student corus use over the years. In order to do so, this paper takes a different aproach: it provides a long-term trend study of data from a single course which ran 50 times from 2009 to 2017. The course taught students to build do-it-yourself (DIY) corpora based on their research topic and promoted autonomous consultation of this resource.

Following Holec, 1979, p. 3), we define autonomy in language learning as the ability to take charge of one's own learning'. Accordingly, we examine the students' use of their corpus outside the classroom and with no input from corpus experts. Based on responses to questionnaires administered at three stages, pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course, this study investigates the extent to which this autonomous corpus consultation was adopted by students over the nine years. I i guided by the following research questions (RQs):

RQ1 How prevalent was pre-course corpus use for English language learning (ELL) 2009-2017?   
RQ2 How prevalent was immediate post-course use of the DIY corpus outside clas (i.e. autonomously) 2009-2017?   
RQ3 How prevalent was delayed post-course use of the DIY corpus (i.e. after one year) 2009-2017?   
RQ4 How prevalent was regular corpus use ( $\geq 1 .$ /week) at the pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course stages 2009-2017?

To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other study of EAP corpus pedagogy has taken this long-term view, spanning multiple iterations and years. Such research enables us to see the degree to which corpus use has become an integral and normalised part of student writing practices over an extended period of time.

# 2. Context of the research

The course in question, entitled Writing in your Field with Corpora', ran once a year at a UK research university and formed part of the in-sessional provision on academic writing for graduat students. The course consisted of one 2-h session for six weeks and was held in a computer laboratory, although many students preferred to use their own laptops and were encouraged to do so. During the nine years of the study, four to seven parallel multi-disciplinary classes were ffered each year and the course was taught by four different tutors. As the course was open-aces and non-credit-ering, aendance was irregular, but an average of nine students atended each class (Range: 3-14). Following the approach of Lee and Swales (2006), students built their own DIY discipline- and topic-specific corpora from research articles (RAs) they had already downloaded and saved for their research purposes. The aim of the course was for students to create a tailor-made resource for individual ongoing use. In-clas, they explored realisations of specific discourse functions within their own discipline using aset of search terms provided by the tutor, while outside clas they were encouraged to consult their corpora autonomously for help with their research writing. See Charles (2012, 2014, 2015) for further details on the course and materials. The software used was AntConc (Anthony, 2018). Over the research period, the course underwent several name changes; improvements to the tasks were also introduced and timetabling isues sometimes dictated changes in the sequence of topics. These were minor modifications, however, because the aims, structure, content, and approach of the course remained essentially unchanged.

# 3. Method and data

The data for this paper derive from three questionnaires which were administered to students who attended the course: pre-course (Qre1), immediate post-course (Qre2) and delayed post-course (Qre3). Qre1 and Qre2 were paper-based questionnaires completed in class Qre1 during the first classof the course and Qre2 at the end of the final clas. Qre3 was istributed approximately one year after the end of the course and was intilly supplied as an email atachment (2009-10); thereafter it was administered through a link to an on-line survey hosted at the SurveyExpression website (SurveyExpression.com). Student responses were entered into spreadsheets and statistical procedures were carried out using Excel and StatPages.org (https://statpages.info/anova1sm.html).

# 3.1. Questionnaire data

Further details about the nature and collection of the questionnaire data wil now be considered. Not all students completed all questionnaires and not ll students gave responses to all itms on the questionnaire. However, in order to provide the fullest possible account of the data, the figures given in this paper cover all responses given to any item discussed.

Qre1 consisted of 19 closed questions; here we focus on prior corpus use. This question was addressed by four items on the precourse questionnaire, given here as a) to d) below.

a) Had you UsED a corpus or corpora before this term's classes? Yes . No

If students answered affirmatively, they were directed to three further questions:

b) If yes, which corpus/corpora have you used? c) How often do you use a corpus?

In response to question c),students were invited to choose one of the following options: several times day, about once a day, about five times  week about once  week, about once  month, seldom, other. Students who chose the option ther were asked to specify how often they used the corpus. A fourth question asked students to give the purpose for which they used the corpus:

d) What have you used a corpus for?

Students were asked to select one of the following options: composing written work, revising written work, both composing and revising written work, other. Students who chose the option other were aked to specify their purpose in more detail. The responses to question d), together with the name of the corpus used, enabled ELL purposes to be distinguished from other research uses.

Qre2 included 27 open and closed questions; the present paper reports on responses for frequency of autonomous use. The data used to answer RQ2 come from the following item, e), on the immediate post-course questionnaire completed at the end of the last session of the corpus course:

e) How often do you use your corpus outside class?

Students were ofered the same options as for question c) in Qre1, with the adition of never, a choice which was not covered by a prior item on this questionnaire. It should be noted that the form of question e) was designed to obtain only data on students autonomous use of their own DIY corpus. In-class use and use of other corpora were excluded.

The email version of Qre3 consisted of 12 open and closed questions, while the on-line version was expanded, with 27 open and closed questions. This paper focuses on data concerning the frequency of autonomous use. The form of the questions was virtually identical in the email and online versions of the questionnaire; the two items, f) and g) read as follows:

f) Have you used your own corpus AT ANY TIME since the academic writing course ended? Yes/No g) If you answered 'yes', how often do/did you use your own corpus?

The wording of item f) was chosen to reflect the fact that many students had used their corpus regularly for only a limited period o!

time, they stopped because they were no longer doing any academic writing. This particularlyaffected Masters students, who tended to use their corpus while writing their issertations, but stopped afer they graduated as they no longer needed to writ academic texts. It was considered important to include data on such respondents, since they wil have used their DIY corpora autonomously according to their own needs. The options offered for g) were the same as those for question c) from Qre1. This consistency enabled accurate comparisons to be made between pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course responses.

A summary of the research questions and the questionnaire items used to answer them are provided in Table 1.

The number of questionnaires reeived fluctuated over the years because administrative issues meant that the number f parall classes varied considerably (ranging from four in 2015 and 2017, to seven in 2011). Given the elective nature f the course, there was a considerable drop-of in the number of questionnaires received between pre- and post-course tages, with 544 responses for Qrel and 343 for Qre2. Furthermore, contacting participants one yearafter the course had finished proved challenging, since many students had completed their studies and no longer had university email adreses. This led to  further decrease in the reponse rate for the delayed post-course questionnaire (Qre3), which amounted to 221. Nonetheless, Qre2 data are available for roughly $6 0 \%$ and Qre3 data for about $4 0 \%$ of Qre1 respondents. Fig. 1 shows the number of responses received for each questionnaire by year. These data are sufficient to allow a long-term view of the take-up of corpus use over 2009-2017to be sen. Thus they providea novel way of asessing the extent to which the corpus approach was acepted by learners and incorporated into their autonomous language learning practices.

# 3.2. Participant data

Most of the students took the course during the third term of their first year of graduate studies. In total, doctoral students made up the majority of participants at $5 7 \%$ as against $3 2 \%$ at Master's level and $1 1 \%$ of other status (e.g. postdoctoral or diploma students). These percentages remained stable over the period 2009-2017. Students belonged to over 80 different disciplines, $4 1 \%$ of which were natural sciences, $3 5 \%$ social sciences and $2 4 \%$ humanities. The percentage of natural science students remained fairly constant over the nine years, but that ofsocial sciences showed a tendency to decrease, and that of humanitie to increase. Participants reported 51 different L1s, with the most frequent being Chinese ( $2 8 \%$ of the total), Spanish $( 9 \% )$ , German $( 7 \% )$ , Italian and Japanese $( 6 \% )$ . These five L1s accounted for over $5 0 \%$ of all responses to Qre1 and there was little change in their relative occurrence over the study period. In total, there were $5 3 \%$ female and $4 7 \%$ male participants, with a slight increase in the participation of males during the nine years. The make-up of the participant groups in terms of degre level,disciplie, LI and gender showed lttle variation over the study period.

# 3.3. Data on students' DIY corpora

Each student built an individual DIY corpus based on the RAs that they had already downloaded and saved for their research purposes. Since these papers were usuall in pdf format, they had to be converted to plain text in order to be readable by AntConc (Anthony, 2018). Initially (2009-2014), files were converted individuall, but from 2015, the AntFileConverter (Anthony, 2017)

became available, which enabled batch conversion of files and greatly speeded up the proces. Most corpora consisted solely of RAs in the topic area of the student's research, but those who wished to include other genres or who were working on inter-disciplinary topics, created sub-corpora of different genres or discilines. Students were advised to select papers from respected journals and to choose a range of ifferent writers. Although tutors explained how to clean the corpus files (by removing items that are not part of the running text e.g. references and tables), most students did no further file preparation and the corpora remained dirty. Although this may mean that the number of words in the corpora is somewhat nflated, these quick and dirty corpora proved adequate to the needs of these students, as shown in their evaluations (Charles, 2012). Students were asked to save their corpora on the institutional server and to update them as they added or deleted files; these records provide figures for the size and number of DIY corpora. However, as some students failed to upload their corpora at al, while others did not keep their corpus folders up to date, some figures are likely to be under-estimates. The data are supplemented where available by students responses to queries from Qre2 and Qre3 asking them to record the size of their corpus. Data on corpus size are available for 33 participants. The number f fle in each corpus spans a very wide range from five to 2053, with the majority $( 4 6 \% )$ consisting of between ten and 19 files. The corpus size in words by the percentage of students is presented in Fig. 2.

As can be seen, the majority of these corpora are very small, with $6 7 \%$ under the 300,o00 word size often recommended for a specialised corpus (see e. Flowerdew, 2012). While accepting that such smal corpora would not be considered adequate for corpus linguistic research, it should be noted that these DIY corpora are specialised not just by discipline, but even more narrowly by the student's research topic. For example, the research of one doctoral student in the discipline of geography/environment concerned the role of transport and travel behaviour in shaping subjective welbeing and health level. His corpus consisted of 14 RAs on this topic and amounted to 129,738 words. Such a narrowly focused corpus is likely to contain many examples of lexicogrammatical features relevant to the topic, although it would not be adequate for more general queries in the field of geography/environment. Despite ther smal size, we would argue that such corpora are valuable in achieving the specific purposes for which they have been compiled. The geography/environment student referred to above found his corpus helpful for language learning, as demonstrated in Qre2 by his strong agreement that using his corpus helped him improve his writing.

# 4. Results and discussion

This section is organised by research question (RQ) and includes a discussion of each result in turn.

4.1. RQ1: how prevalent was pre-course corpus use for ELL 2009-2017?

Students were asked whether they had used acorpus before the course and if s, about their frequency and purpose in doing so. The data for RQ1 on all corpus users appear in Fig 3. Based on the 544 responses recorded, it can be seen that the use of corpora for ELL remained stable over the study period with a mean of $2 4 \%$ (SD $5 \%$ . This consistent trend shows that there was no increase in acceptance or take-up of the corpus approach among these EAP students, rrespective of their prior ELL background or exposure to corpora. Thus the increased research interest in corpus-based language learning noted by Chen and Flowerdew (2018a) does not seem to have translated into a rise in the take-up of the corpus approach by the students themselves.

In answer to question b) about the corpora they had used, 146 students $( 2 7 \% )$ mentioned a total of 166 corpus resources, with some students noting more than one. Most students gave the names of well-known resources, including for example, the British National Corpus (76 mentions; $1 4 \%$ , Just the Word (38; $7 \%$ ) and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (5; $1 \%$ . A small number of students (12; $2 \%$ ) mentioned using a corpus for their own research purposes, with about half of these mentioning Greek and Latin resources $( 7 ; 1 \% )$ . Only a small minority (8; $2 \%$ ) erroneously mentioned non-corpus resources such as online dictionaries (e.g. The Oxford English Dictionary, Lexico) and other databases (e.g. The Manchester Phrasebank, JSTOR). Thus the majority of the students who reported on the corpora they had used showed an accurate understanding of what a corpus is.

4.2. RQ2 how prevalent was immediate post-course use of the DIY corpus outside class (ie autonomously) 2009-2017?

Students were asked about the frequency of their corpus use outside cass. The number f responses received amounted to 343 and Fig. 4 shows the results forall users. The data show a high take-up of corpus use overall, which increased only very slightly over the study period, from $8 4 \%$ in 2009 to $8 8 \%$ in 2017, with a peak at $9 2 \%$ in 2015 (Mean $8 7 \%$ SD $2 . 7 \%$ . This suggests that one effect of the corpus course was to stimulate these students to try out the approach autonomously for their own purposes. The fact that this was a consistent efect provides a validation of the efficacy of the DY corpus approach for these students. However, th sight increase seen here in the adoption of the corpus approach over time provides scant support for the notion that corpus-based work is gaining increasing acceptance by EAP students. In fact, it may reflect a more general increase in students willingnessto make use of technological tols to assist with writing, as noted by Crosthwaite (2017). See Strobl et al. (2019) for a review of such tools.

4.3. RQ3 how prevalent was delayed post-course use of the DIY corpus (i.e. after one year) 2009-2017?

In Qre3, students were asked if they had used their corpus at any time since the course and if so, how frequently. There were 221 responses and the data on all users appear in Fig. 5. The results show a predominantly stable trend, which ries only slightly over the research period. The mean percentage of users is $6 2 \%$ (SD $1 1 . 3 \%$ . These results indicate the success of the course in encouraging the adoption of the DIY corpus approach and underline the importance of a narrowly focused discipline- and topic-specific corpus for graduate students. However, they provide ittl, if any, support for the suggestion that corpus use among students is increasing.

Fig. 4. Percentages of students' immediate post-course corpus use outside class.

In sum, the results for student corpus use from 2009 to 2017 at pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course do not provide convincing evidence for an upsurge in corpus use by students.

4.4. RQ4 how prevalent was regular corpus use $\geq$ 1/week) at the pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course stages   
2009-2017?

As noted above, the results given so far cover all use, including students who reported only consulting their corpus occasionally. In order to shed further light on the extent to which corpus use has become embedded as a customary component in students' writing practice, it is necessary to examine regular corpus use, since it is possble that this has indeed increased over time.

A regular user was defined as one who reported using the corpus at last once per week. Accordingly, we compared the the set of data for regular users at the pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course tages (Fig. 6). Results are based on responses to questions c), e) and g) (see Table 1); the data cover the following student responses: several times a day, about once a day, about five times a week, about once week. In Fig. 6, the bottom data serieshows pre-course data the midde series ives thedelayed post-course data, while the top data series refers to immediate post-course data. For pre-course respondents a mean value of $1 1 \%$ (SD $4 \%$ ) was found and the trend remained constant over the nine years. The data on immediate post-course users exhibit a somewhat different pattern: there was a clear upward trend in regular use over the nine years, from $5 8 \%$ in 2009 to $7 1 \%$ in 2017, peaking at $7 5 \%$ in 2016 (Mean $6 1 \%$ SD $6 . 8 \%$ . At the delayed post-course stage, the mean percentage of regular users stands at $3 7 \%$ (SD $1 0 . 3 \%$ and there was just asight rise over the nine-year period. Aone-way  run on these three sets f dat shows that al iffernces are signficant at the $p = < 0 . 0 5$ level.

Fig. 6. Percentages of students' regular corpus use at pre-course, immediate post-course and delayed post-course stages.

Comparing the data from a long-term perspective, it can be seen that the rising trend at the immediate post-course stage is much more pronounced than that at delayed post-course. Thus it i only these immediate post-course data that provide good evidence for the suggestion that there has been an increase in student corpus use over time. One possible reason for this rising trend at the immediate post-course stage might be that it reflects increasing demands upon graduate students over the years and that such pressures may be particularly acute at the end of students' first year of graduate studies. However further research would be necessary to verify this conjecture.

We turn now to individual comparisons, examining first the immediate and delayed post-course data. Results show that there was a considerablereduction in the percentages of those who used their corpus regularly between these two stages. Thus, the very high levels of corpus use achieved immediately afer the course were not maintained one year later. There are several possible reasons for this First it i necessary to consider the academic tage of the student's development, the research tass they need to accomplish and the type of texts they ned to write. In this regard we may distinguish between Masters and doctoral students. Responses to question g), which asked about delayed post-corpus use, would include data from Master's students who had to submit disertations by the beginning of the subsequent academic year. However, it would exclude responses from those who had submission dates at the end of the summer term, whose data would only appear in the immediate post-course results. This factor may account for some of the discrepancy between regular immediate and delayed post-course use among these students.

The academic situation of doctoral students is rather diffrent. At the end of their first year, they are required to produce an upgrade paper, which is text of considerable length and importance, since its successul completion enables the student to move from probationer to full research student status. Thus, the demands of the research and writing process are likely to lead to regular corpus use reported at the immediate post-course stage. However, in their second year, many doctoral students are engaged in field or experimental work, which is likely to mean a reduction in the amount of academic writing carried out and thus les need for corpus consultation at the delayed post-course stage.

Of course, in accounting for the difference between regular use reported in the immediate and delayed post-course questionnaires, other factors may alsocome into play: the novelty effec f new lerning resource may have won ff and it i ossile that the lack f expert advice andweekly practice make it les ikely that students will persvere with corus use. wver, despite thee dsinenives, the mean percentage of regular users at the delayed post-course stage $( 3 7 \% )$ still shows that a considerable number of students find regular corpus consultation a valuable addition to their writing techniques and tools.

Moving on to acomparison of regular useat the pre-course stage with the data at immediate and delayed post-course stages, we see that the mean percentage is considerably higher at both post-course stages ( $6 1 \%$ and $3 7 \%$ respectively) than the pre-course mean of

a Figures do not include unclear responses $( 7 \% )$

$1 1 \%$ This shows the success of the course in encouraging autonomous DIY corpus use and underlines the importance of an individ ualised discipline- and topic-specific corpus for graduate students.

Finally, when we compare the data for regular users Fig. 6) with those for all users (Fig. 3-5), it i cler that there is a considerable disparit, which persists throughout the nine years. Some discreancy is to be expected, but i is worth noting that the reduction in use amounts to a large number of potential users who decreased corpus consultation subsequent to the immediate post-course stage.

Further evidenceof this decline in use can be seen in Table 2, which presents the mean percentages of non-use, all use and regular use. When compared to the immediate post-course stage, the mean percentage of both all use and regular use decreased, whil tha for non-use increased substantially from $6 \%$ to $3 9 \%$ an indication that students have discontinued corpus use. The differences in the group means as determined by one-way ANovA were found to be statistically significant $( p = < . 0 0 1 )$

As noted earlier in this section, there are many possble factors which could lead to a decline or discontinuation of corpus use, including dissertation submission dates and the student's academic stage and activities. Although the mean percentages of regular users sill represent a substantial number of students who are committed to using thir corpora, the disparities between non-use all corpus use and reula use are tilla cause for concen. One possble reason for the deline en in corpus use is that some students have already developed a writing procedure which is successful for them and which they do not wish to modify (Charles, 2014). Student motivation i another factor that may well have n impact (Liou & Liu, 2021). It may also be that a corus approach is not well-suited to the learning preferences of certain students; for example, Dudley-Evans and St John (1998, p. 208) argue that technophiles' are more likely to benefit than technophobes', while Boulton (2009) suggests that leaning style preferences may afect DL use. It i likely, then, that a combination of multiple factors, personal, academic and contextual, comes into play when students decide whether to use a corpus or not. Further research is necessary toclarify the reasons for the observed decline in corpus use and to identify the traits that characterise the regular user.

# 5. Pedagogical implications

This research leads both to a set of specific recommendations that can be made for the type of course provision that is likely to benefit graduate students, as well as to wider implications for the adoption of corpus work in EAP more generally.

As Kwan (2013) points out in the Hong Kong context, many doctoral students have access t littl or no writing support during their studies, a situation which may wellaso affect Master's students. Given such limited help, the long-tem trend results presented here suggest that both doctoral and Master's students would benefit from a DIY corpus course towards the end of their first year of graduate studies. One way in which such corpus work could be integrated into graduate studies is through the use of on-line platorms such as those described by Crosthwaite et al. (2019) and Cotos (2016) Such systems allow students ready acces to the resources they require at the point of need, an important consideration for busy graduates.

After an initial introductory corus course, the needs of doctoral and Master's students diverge, which implies that ifferent fllow. up approaches are necessary for the two types of students. Masters students would find it helpful to have extended practice in using large online corpora, which would enable them to addres any later, more general language learning needs. Doctoral students, on the other hand, would profit from short just-in-time rfresher courses on using their DIY corpora as they move into the writing-up phase f their studies and particully as they preare ther firs aadmc rech articles as erly care rercher. Onine support groups could also play an important role in re-activating doctoral students knowledge of corpus use so that they atain or exceed the level of corpus competence achieved at the end of the original DIY corpus course.

However, such interventions, although necessary, may not be sufficient to persuade students to adopt the new writing practice of using corpora. One strategy which might have some succes, especially with graduate students, who are being trained to evaluate evidence and arguments, could be to introduce them to some of the relevant empirical data which supports the claim that corpus pedagogy is successul, for example by presenting selected findings from Boulton & Cobb (2017) or Perez-Paredes (2019). Another strategy which could complement the discussion of data is suggested by Rogers (2003) in his work on the iffusion of innovations. He notes the importance of success stories in persuading users to adopt novel behaviours. Instructors could adopt such an approach, ncouraging current and former studets torcount ther scees to their pes, theey opening up the corus clas to discussion of difficulties overcome, writing improvements endorsed by supervisors and thees/dissertations scesfully complete. Incorporating elements of both data and stories ocasionall into corpus casses might well prove motivating to novice and/or hesitant corpus users. In the end, however, it is practical considerations of utility and particularly the individualised discipline- and topic-specific nature of the DIY corpus that is most likely to drive students' continued use of their corpus.

A further pedagogical suggestion emerges from the observation that at allstages (pre-course, immediate and delayed post-course) there is a wide and persistent dicrepancy betwen all corus users and reular users. This points to the existence f a izeable number of students who use the corpus only ocasionally or not at all It i noticeable that this gap remains considerable throughout the nine years of the study. Similar student groupings have been noted by Kaszubski, 2011 who termed them 'adopters' and 'minimaliss' and by Crosthwaite al. (2019) who called them persistent users' and search gurus. If we seek to argue that using a DIY corpus would benefit the majorit of graduate students, then we ned to ask why some students become regular users, while others remain ocasional users or non-users, 'refusers' in Kaszubski's terms or 'quitters' for Crosthwaite et al.

Rather than employing such simple three-part categorisations, however, it may be more enlightening to consider Bax' (2003, pp. 24-25) seven stages in the adoption of CALL as a means of better understanding the possible process that students may be experiencing (Table 3).

Most EAP students, who have had no exposure to the use of corpora at all are likely to be at stages 1 and 2. However, afer their sixweek corpus course, the students in the present study can be situated at tages 36, depending on their level of use. Some non-users are at stage 3, rejecting corpus use as to time-consuming or not as useful as Google, while others are simply not doing any writing that warrants the use of their DIY corpus. Occasional users are likely to be distributed between stages 46, and regular users are probably at stage 6, perceiving corpus use as a normal procedure. Inded for some, corpus use may already have become full normalised. The pattern of adoption of DIY corpus use seen in these students supports the point made by Rogers (2003) and Bax (2003, 2011) that the diffusion of new technologies tends to be uneven in populations. This poses particular challenges for instructors who wish to promote corpus use, because it implies that different strategies are likely to appeal to ifferent groups of students, who could be within a single class but at varying staes of adoption. We consider therefore that instructors should attempt to take a more individualised and flexible approach as far as possible multiple strategies should be at their disposa, which can be applied todifferent groups at ifferent times and in different pedagogical contexts. This view is also advocated by Ackerley (2021) in relation to undergraduate corpus users.

Table 3 Stages in the adoption of CALL.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Stage</td><td>Explanation</td></tr><tr><td>1 Early adopters</td><td>A few adopt it out of curiosity</td></tr><tr><td>2 Ignorance &amp; scepticism</td><td>Most ignorant or sceptical.</td></tr><tr><td>3 Try once</td><td>Tried, but rejected due to early problems; no relative advantage.</td></tr><tr><td>4 Try again</td><td>Tried again, its relative advantage is recognised.</td></tr><tr><td>5 Fear &amp; awe</td><td>More use, but fear alternating with exaggerated expectations</td></tr><tr><td>6 Normalising</td><td>Gradually seen as normal</td></tr><tr><td>7 Normalisation</td><td>So integrated it is invisible, &#x27;normalised&#x27;.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Finall, there is a more general point to be made regarding the place of technology, in this case corpus use, and the process of its normalisation within EAP and more broadly within language learning. As Bax (2011, p. 13) argues, normalisation depends on far more than the attributes of the technology itelf .. it involves a host of social and cultural elements operating together in complex ways. This statement implies the necessity of a hift in emphasis away from a narrow concentration on the tchnology and tools themselves and towards a wider focus on the overall contex f learning. Thus, although improving the technological toos, i.e. corus construction and text analysis software, is undoubtedly important, it does not necessrily follow that the existence of better tools willead to an increase in more regular and committed corpus users. For this to occur, instructors and designers of software and corpora need constantly to bear the socio-cultural context in mind, not only by asking what technology the context requires, but more radically whether there is a need for tecnology in this context at all Such a re-orientation in our thinking about the pedagogical aplications of corpora has been advocated by several authors, (Charles & Frankenberg-Garcia, 2021; Chambers, 2019; Frankenberg-Garcia, 2012, 2016; Romer, 2009. It is the needs of the student end-user that must always be at the centre of future developments.

# 6. Conclusions

To summarise, this paper has traced the development of graduates' autonomous use of their DIY corpora over nine years from 2009 to 2017. Taking a long-tem perspective, it showed that prior to the corpus course,corpus use for ELL was stable, with all useat around $2 4 \%$ and regular use at around $1 0 \%$ of students. On completion of the course, immediate use was stable at $8 0 { - } 9 0 \%$ of students, while regular use took an upward trajectory, increasing from $5 8 \%$ to $7 1 \%$ from 2009 to 2017. Finally, data recorded one year after the end of the course showed that $6 2 \%$ of students had used their corpus since the course finished, while $3 7 \%$ were regular users, trends which showed only aslight rise over the nine year period. Although these findings reveal some grounds for optimism, the lack of significant growth in corpus use over the nine years does not support the expectation that there wil be increasing take-up in th future. There is still much work to be done in order to achieve this goal.

This study has a number of imitations which need to be borne in mind when interpreting the findings. First, the number of questionnaires completed showed a substantial drop-of from pre-course through immediate post-course to the delayed post-course stage. Whil some reduction in participation is probably unavoidable due to the one-year time span of the study for each cohort it would be particularly valuable i fuure rearch could achieve more consistent participation rate acrossthe three stage. Second, the present study provides data on students from a single course at one universty in the UK; socioculturaldifferences, especially in the pedagogical context of courses mean that generalisations should be made with caution. In order to gain a fullr picture of autonomous graduate take-up of the corpus approach over time, it is necesary tocary out further research on a range of dffrent graduate corpus courses in a number of institutions and countries. Finally, the course under study involved graduates in building their own individualised DIY corpora t would be useful to know whether the results shown here are relicated when different types of corpora are used. In terms of asessing and possibly improving the level of corpus adoption, it would also be valuable to examine the impact of other variables such as the timing and length of the course, the amount of intructor support available and the target writing assgnments. Taking a long-term view of such attributes of corpus pedagogy would provide a new perspective on the development of student corpus use, therey enabling instructors to tailor thir interventions to the needs of their students more closely and with greater confidence.

Such research, though, will not of itself lead to greater corpus use by students in the future. There isa pressing need for those wh are committed to the corpus approach to redouble their efforts to reach out directly to both students and their teachers. To realise th optimistic vision of corpus use as a mainstream activity wil require active engagement within the everyday practices of EAP.
