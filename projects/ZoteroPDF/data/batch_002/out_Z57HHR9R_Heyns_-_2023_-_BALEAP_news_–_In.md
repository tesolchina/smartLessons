# BALEAP news – Introduction to SIGs: Meet EAP for Social Justice SIG

You might wonder why the EAP for SJ SIG is needed? In the current era, it is difficult to ignore the fact that our universities, our countries and our world are riddled with inequality, but what has social justice got to do with EAP? The SIG aims to raise awareness of issues related to social justice in EAP, such as the unequal access to higher education, the marginalisation of certain groups, and the impact of neoliberal policies on education. Other themes tap into working within and around neo-liberal structures, inclusive and trauma-informed EAP pedagogies, decolonising the curriculum, equalities issues (gender, sexual orientation, race, class), English as an Academic Lingua Franca versus plurilingualism and translanguaging, “othering” in the academy, challenging the deficit model of L2 learners, EAP and sustainability, identity issues – role and positioning of EAP practitioners and students and more. Ultimately, the main goal of the SIG is to contribute to a more equitable and inclusive approach to EAP practice and research.

The aims of this SIG are:

• To put social justice on the agenda in EAP discussions concerning learning, teaching, scholarship of teaching and learning, research and operational matters   
• To demonstrate the value of adopting a social justice lens in EAP, by broadening and strengthening the evidence base of the impact that this can make in our field   
• To work together with relevant organisations, movements and initiatives in recognition of the complexity and intersectionality of social justice work   
• To facilitate the creation of a welcoming and active EAP for SJ community of practice, through which participants can support each other, share good practice and be inspired to take action within their sphere of influence.

Since launching in 2020, we have developed a platform for EAP (and ELT practitioners) to support and facilitate discussions, organising events and conferences, sharing of resources among its members, and engaging in research and advocacy related to social justice in EAP. We have almost 1000 followers on Twitter, regular blog readers and an increasing number of the EAP4SJ Jisc mail subscribers.

So far, we have run more than 20 online events, published over 30 blog entries, facilitated monthly ‘Get-Togethers’ and organised multiple calls for posts revolving around issues related to social justice including widening participation for refugees and access to HE, precarity, trauma-informed pedagogy and RefugEAP, global south versus global north division, sense of belonging, Black Lives Matter, race in EAP, assessment for social justice, ‘native-speakerism’, intersectional identities of EAP practitioners, diversifying EAP community, raciolinguistics, ethical values and so on. Collectively, as a result of engagement with the events and the reading of the blogs, the SIG members and the wider audience have created stimulating resources capturing the very essence of social justice in EAP - for details, visit the following Padlet pages:

• EAP for Social Justice   
• Race in EAP   
• Emerging Voices in EAP   
• EAP Assessment for Social Justice (shared with the TAFSIG SIG)   
• Delivery or Deliveroo (Rethinking Pre-sessional EAP)

Speakers, authors and podcast guests included Dr Vijay Ramjattan (raciolinguistics) and Dr Jan McArthur (assessment for social justice) amongst others. The attendance at the events, the engagement with the blogs and contribution to Padlets have been high. The feedback received indicates that the EAP practitioners appreciated the chance to connect with others, discuss social justice-related matters, work together to identify issues, and seek guidance on how to further instil social justice in their practices.

In April 2023, the SIG members all met up together in person for the first time at the BALEAP Biennial Conference at the University of Warwick where collectively we presented a number of sessions:

In the future, there are several plans in store for us. These plans involve promoting collaboration in between EAP and other sectors within HE as well as other BALEAP SIGs. We are planning to continue putting our provocative discussions to aid raising awareness of social justice amongst EAP Practitioners and creating more social-just oriented resources. We welcome new members to join our website and also invite those who are interested in leading an event or giving a talk for the SIG to submit a proposal through the provided link: http://eap4sj.weebly.com/contact-us.html.
