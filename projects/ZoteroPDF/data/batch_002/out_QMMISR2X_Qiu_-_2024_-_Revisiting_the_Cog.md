# ABSTRACT

Task complexity and communication modes are two task design and implementation factors that have been found to affect second language (L2) learners’ oral performance. While increasing task complexity and developing tasks according to the features of face-to-face and computer-mediated communication modes can optimise L2 production, few studies attend to how the two factors affect learner engagement in task performance–a crucial but under-explored concept contributing to academic achievement. To address this gap, this experimental study investigated the impact of task complexity (operationalised $\mathsf { a s \pm }$ pre-task planning time and $\pm$ intentional reasoning demand) and communication modes (synchronous video-based computer-mediated communication, SvCMC versus face-to-face real-time communication, FTF) on L2 learners’ engagement in interactive oral tasks. Sixty-four English-as-a-second-language (ESL) learners formed their self-initiated dyads to perform three interactive oral tasks (from simple to $^ +$ complex and $+ + \ell$ complex conditions) on Zoom or in a physical classroom. They were also interviewed about their affective responses to the tasks. The oral discourse of task performance and interview data were analysed in terms of behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement. The findings revealed that task complexity affected the behavioural and cognitive engagement of FTF and SvCMC learners. SvCMC learners were behaviourally more engaged in task performance than their FTF peers, but mixed results were found in cognitive engagement. Mixed affective responses were reported by FTF and SvCMC learners for all task conditions. The findings suggest that increasing task complexity may partially engage L2 learners,

# Introduction

With the common adoption of online teaching, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period, second language (L2) scholars are increasingly attending to how computers assist L2 learning and offer opportunities for learner interaction (Andujar & Salaberri-Ramiro, 2021; Wang et  al., 2021). One emerging topic is the implementation of task-based language teaching (TBLT) in computer-mediated communication (CMC) modes (Dao et  al., 2021; González-Lloret & Ortega, 2015), wherein L2 learners exploit their L2 repertoire to communicate in different CMC modes (e.g. text-chat, voice-chat) to complete an oral task developed from a real-time situation. Findings of empirical studies on this topic present the impact of communication modes on L2 task performance (Amiryousefi, 2016; Van der Zwaard & Bannink, 2016); thus, teachers may need to bear the features of CMC that differ from face-to-face communication in mind (e.g. physical distance, latency) and select tasks that are appropriate to CMC modes in their teaching (Baralt et  al., 2016).

Despite the exploration of different communication modes and task performance, few studies have focused on another crucial construct of L2 learning: learner engagement in task performance (Dao et  al., 2021; Philp & Duchesne, 2016). Learner engagement in task performance refers to ‘heightened attention and involvement’ of learners when performing tasks (Philp & Duchesne, 2016, p. 51). It is considered an indicator of academic achievement (Christenson et  al., 2012) and is also context-specific (Mercer, 2019). While exploring learner engagement in online learning environments is not a novel topic (Lee, 2020; Lyu & Lai, 2022), how L2 learners engage in different kinds of tasks in the CMC mode is relatively under-explored. Therefore, to address the research gaps, this study aims to investigate English-as-a-second-language (ESL) learners’ engagement in interactive tasks with different complexity levels (i.e. $+ /$ -pre-task planning time, $+ /$ -intentional reasoning demand) in the video-based synchronous computer-mediated communication (SvCMC) mode and the face-to-face real-time communication (FTF) mode. FTF communication entails L2 learners performing oral tasks in a traditional classroom, whereas SvCMC is defined as ‘the contiguous communication of two or more people, typically accomplished through the use of Voice-over Internet protocol (VoIP)’ (Jenks & Firth, 2013, p. 217). In this study, L2 learners perform tasks with video-based voice-chat on Zoom. The two communication channels reflect the real teaching and learning situation in the post-pandemic period. By comparing learner engagement in different task complexity levels and in different communication modes, this study sheds light on how L2 teachers might most effectively design and implement tasks in online and face-to-face teaching settings.

# Literature review

# Task complexity and L2 learning

The Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2001, 2011) is one of the fundamental TBLT theories. Robinson proposes that task design factors (e.g. pre-task planning, reasoning demand) affect the cognitive demands of the tasks or their complexity, which consequently influence L2 learners’ oral performance; moreover, tasks should be sequenced according to increasing task complexity to provide optimal support for learners to employ accurate and complex language to achieve real-life task demands.

After the proposal of this theory, numerous empirical studies were conducted to examine the relationships between task design factors and fluency, accuracy, and complexity of L2 learners’ oral utterances in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication modes (e.g. Amiryousefi, 2016; Ziegler, 2018). While most studies support the Hypothesis that  sequencing tasks with the increase of task complexity helps enhance L2 oral performance (e.g. Lambert & Robinson, 2014), few examine whether task complexity affects L2 learner engagement. Since engaging learners in tasks can expose them to the target language better and facilitate their L2 acquisition (Mercer, 2019), investigating how tasks should be designed to engage learners will contribute to L2 teaching and learning.

# Learner engagement in task performance

Learner engagement has been widely explored in educational studies, and it is a crucial concept in technology-enhanced L2 learning research as well (Lee, 2020; Lenkaitis, 2020). Despite its popularity, learner engagement has not yet been much explored in TBLT. More studies are needed, as learner engagement is context-specific and multifaceted (Philp & Duchesne, 2016), and its construct and operationalisations may differ depending on the contexts (e.g. corrective feedback, collaborative writing, peer interaction). In task-based research, learner engagement is illustrated using four dimensions: behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement (Philp & Duchesne, 2016). Behavioural engagement refers to L2 learners’ concentration, attention, and effort, such as time on task (Philp & Duchesne, 2016). Cognitive engagement means learners’ mental efforts to achieve task outcomes and their conceptual understanding of task content and language, such as clarification requests on content and meaning (Reeve, 2012). Emotional engagement reflects learners’ affective responses to tasks (e.g. enjoyment, anxiety) (Philp & Duchesne, 2016). Social engagement, which is unique in interaction, includes learners’ responses and involvement during interaction (Philp & Duchesne, 2016), often captured by backchannels (e.g. right, yes). The four dimensions inextricably form the construct of learner engagement in task performance.

Emerging research has explored how different task design factors (e.g. topic familiarity, learner-generated/teacher-generated task content) influence learner engagement in task performance (Aubrey et  al., 2020; Lambert & Zhang, 2019). The findings of this limited body of research not only reveal that different task design factors may affect learner engagement dissimilarly but also imply that increasing task complexity may not always engage L2 learners in task performance. For example, task repetition can enhance L2 oral performance (Bui et  al., 2019), but L2 learners may feel bored with repeating tasks with familiar topics (Qiu & Lo, 2017). Furthermore, Qiu and Cheng (2021) found that EFL learners were behaviourally, cognitively, and socially more engaged in storytelling tasks that are less complex than in opinion exchange tasks that are more complex; in comparison, the different task types did not significantly affect the learners’ oral performance. The impact of task complexity on learner engagement may also be mediated by different communication modes, such as computer-mediated communication and face-to-face communication (Baralt et  al., 2016). These findings suggest the necessity of revisiting the Cognition Hypothesis and re-investigating the impact of different task design factors from the learner engagement perspective.

Among the various task complexity factors proposed by Robinson (2011) under the Cognition Hypothesis, pre-task planning and intentional reasoning demand have been widely investigated in terms of their effects on L2 oral performance (e.g. Awwad et  al., 2017; Bui & Huang, 2018). They have also been regarded to impose potential influence on learner engagement in task performance (e.g. Baralt et  al., 2016). Pre-task planning is a resource-dispersing variable and intentional reasoning demand is a resource-directing variable. According to Robinson (2011), the deprivation of pre-task planning and the addition of intentional reasoning demand increase task complexity. He also proposes the SSARC model that suggests sequencing tasks from simple condition (no reasoning demand $^ +$ with planning time), more complex condition (with reasoning demand $^ +$ with planning time), to the most complex one (with reasoning demand $^ +$ no planning time). The three conditions have also been adopted in this study because task complexity levels can be well operationalised, and this is a clear distinction from less demanding conditions to more demanding ones.

# Pre-task planning

Pre-task planning, in this study, means that learners are given five minutes to plan their speech before task performance. The removal of pre-task planning increases task complexity (Robinson, 2011). Pre-task planning prepares learners to ‘perform the task by considering the content they will need to encode and how to express this content’ (Ellis, 2005, p. 3) and has been claimed to enhance L2 oral production in terms of fluency (Bui & Huang, 2018) and complexity (Foster & Skehan, 1996) among other things. Existing studies have also been conducted to develop in-depth understandings of planning behaviours. For example, Pang and Skehan’s (2014) study of a low-intermediate group and a high-intermediate group of ESL learners reported that while planning, both groups retrieved lexical items, decided the details of their speech, and considered speaking from the listener’s perspective, but the higher-proficiency group was likelier to attend to conceptualising the message content, whereas the lower-proficiency learners focused more on the formulation stage.

Notwithstanding its positive effects on L2 production, Qiu and Bui (2022a) investigated the influence of pre-task planning on 36 ESL learners’ engagement in FTF and SvCMC modes and found that under both modes, pre-task planning did not significantly affect behavioural, cognitive, and social engagement; mixed findings were found regarding emotional engagement because some learners felt more relaxed and less anxious with pre-task planning time, whereas others felt disengaged because planning before speaking did not feel authentic. The findings revealed that pre-task planning may not always engage learners in task performance. With a larger sample size, the current study, which is a follow-up study by Qiu and Bui (2022a), examines the impact of pre-task planning on learner engagement and contributes to this topic with further evidence.

# Intentional reasoning demand

In addition to pre-task planning, reasoning demand is a crucial task design factor that affects L2 oral performance (Robinson, 2011). Robinson has proposed three kinds of reasoning demands: spatial, causal, and intentional reasoning. While spatial reasoning and causal reasoning are related to navigating and giving directions and explaining the mechanisms of natural or mechanical events, respectively, intentional reasoning involves the explanations of behaviour focusing on intentions, beliefs, desires, etc. In this study, the focus was on intentional reasoning with learners being invited to discuss why they would recommend general education courses to an exchange student.

Previous studies have suggested that intentional reasoning, which enhances task complexity, leads to greater interaction and uptake of premodified input (Robinson, 2007) and higher syntactic complexity and grammatical accuracy (Awwad et  al., 2017). These findings, however, do not demonstrate how intentional reasoning affects learner engagement. The only study on this aspect is the one conducted by Baralt et  al. (2016), which has been reviewed earlier. Given the scarcity of empirical studies on the relationships between intentional reasoning demand and learner engagement, this study intends to address this particular research gap and investigate how intentional reasoning demand affects learner engagement in SvCMC and FTF modes.

# Computer-mediated and face-to-face communication

Besides task complexity, communication modes have also been found to affect learner engagement in task performance (e.g. Baralt et  al., 2016; Carver et  al., 2021). Previous studies have revealed some positive mediating effects of SvCMC on L2 learning. For example, under the SvCMC mode, L2 learners may produce more language-related episodes, repair moves, and self-correction than FTF learners do (Yamada, 2009; Zeng, 2017). They may be more willing to communicate (Lee et  al., 2022), participate, and collaborate (González-Lloret, 2020). On the other hand, disadvantages of SvCMC over FTF are also outlined. A few studies (e.g. Baralt, 2010) revealed that increasing task complexity can effectively enhance L2 output in FTF but not in SvCMC. Van der Zwaard and Bannink (2016) found that despite non-understanding, L2 learners were more reluctant to negotiate meaning during task-based video conferencing. This may be due to the physical distance, latency, internet disconnection, and audio quality in the SvCMC condition (Hampel & Hauck, 2004; Jepson, 2005; Van der Zwaard & Bannink, 2016). Moreover, Qiu and Bui (2022b) also reported mixed findings on ESL learners’ perceptions of FTF and SvCMC conditions and attributed the dissimilarities to learners’ different personality traits and even L2 proficiency levels.

While the effects of SvCMC and FTF on L2 learning have been discussed (Dao et  al., 2021; Van der Zwaard & Bannink, 2016), few of them have focused on how task complexity influences learner engagement in task performance in the two communication modes. Only a few studies are found to compare learner engagement in the FTF mode and the synchronous computer-mediated text-chat communication (e.g. producing chat text in the chat box without turning on video). For example, Baralt et  al. (2016) investigated L2 learners’ engagement in interactive oral tasks ( $+ /$ -intentional reasoning) under the face-to-face real-time and synchronous computer-mediated chat-based communication modes. The results suggested that the FTF learners were cognitively, emotionally, and socially engaged in task performance, especially in complex tasks ( $^ +$ intentional reasoning); however, they were not engaged when performing either type of task online because they lacked interaction and social support. Similar findings were also reported by Carver et  al. (2021), who investigated L2 learners’ engagement in interactive oral tasks in the FTF and synchronous computer-mediated text-chat communication. They found that FTF learners were cognitively and affectively more engaged in task performance than computer-mediated text-chat learners. The findings of these studies indicate the potential role of face-to-face and computer-mediated communication modes in L2 learners’ engagement in task performance. Nonetheless, these studies explored the text-chat mode only, whereas SvCMC was not considered. Given that SvCMC may better engage L2 learners in task performance than text chat (Dao et  al., 2021), it is worth investigating learner engagement in different oral tasks in the FTF and SvCMC modes.

# Research design

This study investigates the impact of task complexity on Hong Kong ESL learners’ engagement in interactive oral tasks. Task complexity (with or without pre-task planning time and with or without intentional reasoning demand) and communication modes (FTF and SvCMC) are independent variables, whilst learner engagement in task performance (measured using four metrics: behavioural, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement) is the dependent variable. This study aims to address two research questions.

1. What are the effects of task complexity on ESL learners’ engagement in task performance in face-to-face real-time communication and synchronous video-based computer-mediated communication modes?   
2. What are the effects of the two communication modes on ESL learners’ engagement in task performance?

# Participants

Sixty-four undergraduate students from a university in Hong Kong (mean age 20 years old), who spoke Chinese as their first language, voluntarily participated in this study in the FTF mode $\left( \ N = 3 2 \right)$ or the SvCMC mode $( \mathrm { N } = 3 2 )$ ). They were recruited via email invitations and posters, and their ethical consent was sought. They were all intermediate English learners, given that the university required them to achieve the intermediate level or above in English proficiency before being admitted to bachelor’s programmes. They also sat a C-test, which examined their general English proficiency level by gap-filling exercises of five passages with 103 blanks (Qiu & Lo, 2017). The FTF group’s mean accuracy rate was $5 7 . 2 8 \%$ (SD $= 1 3 . 8 5 )$ , and the SvCMC group’s was $5 6 . 3 4 \%$ $( \mathrm { S D } = 1 2 . 7 1 ) $ .1 There were participants from every faculty at the university: education and languages $\left( \mathrm { N } = 3 9 \right)$ ), arts and social science $\left( \mathrm { N } = 3 \right)$ , nursing and health studies $( \mathrm { N } = 1 1 )$ , science and technology $\left( \mathrm { N } = 5 \right)$ , and business and administration $\left( \mathrm { N } { = } 6 \right)$ . They had all been attending classes on Zoom for more than one year when the data were collected. Thus, they were familiar with both face-toface and online teaching settings.

# Tasks

Three interactive tasks (from simple to $^ +$ complex and $^ { + + }$ complex conditions) were designed (see Figure 1). All of the tasks (attached as supplementary materials) shared the same topic but different content. The participants were asked to recommend general education (GE) courses to an exchange student from Spain. In each task, participants were given a short description of an exchange student and each participant was offered two GE courses—different from what their partners received—which may be suitable for an exchange student. In the simple task, participants exchanged the information of the different courses they had, and by the end of the task, one of them reported the information of all four courses to the researcher. They were given five minutes to plan before their task performance. During the planning time, they could make notes on any aspects (e.g. organization, language) to prepare for their speech but were not allowed to communicate with their partners or refer to external sources. For the +complex task with the same planning time, they not only needed to share information of two GE courses with their partner but were also asked to determine the most suitable course for the exchange student. The requirements and procedure for the ++complex task were the same as those of the $^ +$ complex task, but participants did not have planning time; instead, they started their conversation immediately after they had read through the instruction.

# Interviews

Following previous studies (e.g. Qiu & Lo, 2017; Lambert & Zhang, 2019), semi-structured interviews were conducted with research participants in their first language (Chinese) to capture their emotional engagement. After task performance, the pairs were asked to share their affective responses during their performance of each task and the reasons for their emotional engagement. Given that all the participants in the study had prior experience chatting in English in FTF and SvCMC modes, they were also asked to compare their affective responses to FTF and SvCMC communication, respectively, after they completed the tasks. Each interview lasted around 25 minutes and was audio recorded.

# Data collection procedure

While inviting L2 learners to participate in this study, the researcher told them that they needed to pair up with their university friend, forming self-initiated pairs, and sign up for the study voluntarily. They were also told that they would be randomly categorised into the FTF or the SvCMC group. After seeking their consent, the participants were divided into the FTF and the SvCMC groups.

The FTF group performed the three tasks in a counterbalanced order2 in a classroom on campus, while the SvCMC group performed the same tasks in a counterbalanced order on Zoom (with the videoconferencing function) at home. They were asked to perform the tasks at home because the purpose of this study is to shed light on both face-to-face and online teaching, and attending classes on Zoom at home was the familiar learning environment for the learners, especially during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The SvCMC students turned on their camera and were asked to use only voice chat during task performance. The task performance of FTF learners was audio recorded and that of SvCMC learners was videotaped. This is because in a pilot study, student participants mentioned that in the FTF mode, the setting of camera affected their engagement during task performance (e.g. made them nervous and stressed), whereas they felt more comfortable when being recorded by an MP3 player. On the other hand, the recording function of Zoom was used for the SvCMC group because all the Zoom classes of the participants in their university study were videotaped and they could easily adapt themselves to it. They were interviewed immediately after their task performance.

# Data analysis

Two kinds of data sources were collected for analysis: spoken discourse and interview data. The spoken discourse was first transcribed by software, and then the transcripts were manually checked by a research assistant and the researcher. A pruned version of the transcript, excluding false starts, self-repairs, repetitions, hesitations, and filled pauses, was generated.

Measures for learner engagement in task performance were based on Philp and Duchesne’s (2016) framework, which is divided into four engagement dimensions (see Table 1). While the analysis of behaviour engagement was conducted by two research assistants, the researcher measured the spoken discourse regarding other engagement dimensions. From the participant data, $1 2 . 5 \%$ (eight participants) was randomly selected for inter-rater reliability checking. Both the researcher and the assistants analysed the same data sets, and correlation analyses were conducted with SPSS. While the results of the behavioural and social engagement indicators were identical, high correlations were obtained between the two sets of results for other indicators $\left( \mathrm { r } { > } . 8 3 0 \right)$ . Discussions were held within the research team, discrepancies were resolved, and the results for each indicator were finalized.

The quantitative data were then input into SPSS for inferential statistical analyses. Given that all the datasets were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were conducted. Friedman’s test was performed to compare the engagement results under different task complexity conditions of the FTF and SvCMC groups, respectively. Mann-Whitney tests were conducted when comparing the engagement results of the two groups. The interaction effects between task complexity and communication modes were not investigated because of the nature of the non-parametric tests. Content analysis was carried out for the interview data, which explored participants’ emotional engagement. The foci were task-facilitating emotions (e.g. positive emotions such as enjoyment, interest, relaxation) and task-withdrawing emotions (e.g. negative emotions such as fatigue, boredom, anxiety) (Reeve, 2012). All the emotions expressed by the participants in the interview were coded, and the reasons for such emotions were also highlighted. The researcher then explored learners’ emotional engagement under different task complexity conditions and different communication modes, from which a number of themes emerged. The researcher invited one TBLT expert to check the interview data of 48 participants $( 7 5 \% )$ , and the expert agreed with all the codes and themes. Hence, the qualitative findings were finalized. The findings of this study are reported in the following section.

Table 2 describes the means and standard deviations (in brackets) for different measures under different task complexity conditions (simple to $^ { + + }$ complex) and in different communication modes (FTF and SvCMC). The Friedman test results suggest that for the FTF group, significant differences were found in words produced (Chi-Square $= ~ 6 . 2 5 0$ , $\hbar ~ =$ .044), turns taken (Chi-Square $= 8 . 1 3 0$ , $p = . 0 1 7 ,$ ), and number of elaborative clauses per 100 words (Chi-Square $= 1 0 . 5 6 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p \ = \ . 0 0 5 , } \end{array}$ among the three task complexity conditions. For other measures, no significant differences were found as reported in Table 3 $\left( p > . 0 5 \right)$ .

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to compare words produced in the three complexity conditions, and the results indicate that FTF learners produced significantly more words in the $^ +$ complex task $\mathrm { \Delta } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { M } = 3 8 1 . 7 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 1 8 2 . 3 7$ ) than in the simple one $\mathrm { T } 1 1 = 3 2 6 . 6 9$ , $\mathrm { S D ~ = ~ }$ 146.43) with a small effect size3 , but no significant differences were found in other comparisons (Table 3). Furthermore, although the Friedman test results showed significant differences for turns taken, the follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank tests did not report any significances among the pair comparisons. Moreover, learners produced significantly more elaborative clauses in the $^ +$ complex task $\mathbf { \mathrm { \langle M = } } 5 . 0 2$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 1 4 )$ and the $^ { + + }$ complex one ${ ' } \mathrm { M } = 4 . 5 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 2 . 0 6 $ ) than in the simple one $\mathrm { ( M } = 3 . 7 5$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 2 2 )$ with a medium and a small effect size, respectively.

For SvCMC learners, significant differences were found in elaborative clauses per 100 words (Chi-Square $= 2 4 . 3 9 4$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ and negotiation moves aim at clarifying content (Chi-Square $= ~ 6 . 7 6 4$ , $\mathnormal { p } \mathnormal { = } \ . 0 3 4 )$ . The follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank test results (Table 3) suggested that the learners produced significantly more elaborative clauses in the $^ +$ complex $( \mathrm { M } = 3 . 8 3 $ , $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 0 7 )$ ) and $^ { + + }$ complex $\mathbf { \zeta } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 2$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 2 9 )$ ) tasks than in the simple one ${ ( \mathrm { M } = 1 . 3 8 }$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 1 . 3 2 \rangle$ with large effect sizes. The learners also had more discussions on the content in the $+ + \mathrm { c o m - }$ plex task $\mathbf { M } = 0 . 4 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 0 . 4 5 )$ than in the $^ +$ complex one $( \mathrm { M } = 0 . 1 5$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 2 7 )$ , with a medium effect size. Although the turns taken metric also achieved significance in the Friedman test (Chi-Square $= 6 . 9 2 1$ , $\boldsymbol { p }$ $\mathbf { \xi } = \mathbf { \xi } . 0 3 1 \mathbf { \xi } ,$ ), no significant differences were found between comparisons in the follow-up Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Furthermore, for other indicators, no significant differences were found, and the results are reported in Table 3.

To summarise, from the quantitative results, task complexity seemed to affect the behavioural and cognitive engagement of the FTF learners and only the cognitive engagement of SvCMC learners. More elaborative clauses were uttered in the tasks with reasoning demands than in the no-demand one.

# Learner engagement in FTF and SvCMC modes

Table 4 depicts the Mann Whitney test results of learner engagement in the FTF and SvCMC modes. In the simple task, SvCMC learners $( \mathrm { M } = 2 7 4 . 0 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 1 3 9 . 9 0 )$ spent a significantly longer time on the task than their FTF peers $\mathrm { \langle M } = 1 9 3 . 1 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 6 6 . 0 1 $ ) with a medium effect size. However, no significant differences were found in time spent on the $^ +$ complex and $^ { + + }$ complex tasks. SvCMC participants (simple: $\mathrm { M } = 1 5 . 6 2$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 1 9 . 4 6$ ; $^ { + + }$ complex: $\mathrm { M } = 1 4 . 6 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 1 0 . 2 1$ ) also held more turns in simple and $^ { + + }$ complex tasks than FTF learners did (simple: $\mathrm { M } = 1 1 . 4 7$ , $\mathrm { S D ~ = ~ 1 8 . 7 1 }$ ; $^ { + + }$ complex: $\mathrm { M } = 1 0 . 8 4$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 8 . 5 1 \rangle$ ), with small effect sizes.

Although SvCMC learners seemed to be behaviourally more engaged in task performance, they (simple: $\mathrm { M } = 1 . 3 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 1 . 3 2$ ; $+ { + c }$ omplex: $\mathrm { M } = 3 . 8 2$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 2 9 )$ produced fewer elaborative clauses in simple and $^ { + + }$ complex tasks than their FTF counterparts (simple: $\mathrm { M } = 3 . 7 5$ , $\mathrm { S D ~ = ~ }$

2.22; $^ { + + }$ complex: $\mathrm { M } = 4 . 5 8$ , $\mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 2 . 0 6 )$ , with a large effect size for the former and a small one for the latter. Nonetheless, SvCMC learners ( $\mathbf { \check { M } } = 0 . 4 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 4 5 )$ negotiated the content more frequently than FTF learners $\mathrm { ( M = 0 . 1 0 }$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 1 9 $ ) in the $+ { + c }$ omplex task with a large effect size. No significant differences were found in the other measures (see Table 4).

# Qualitative analysis of interview data

With the content analysis, learners’ emotions during task performance were investigated, and the findings are reported in consideration of the two research questions.

# Task complexity and emotional engagement

# Simple task

Two FTF participants $( 6 \% )$ and three SvCMC participants $( 9 \% )$ expressed positive emotions in the simple task. Four of them felt relaxed because the task was ‘easier than others’ (S29) and as they did not need to ‘struggle which course was the best’ (S30). S11 also shared that he felt less nervous and stressed during this task than the others due to the nature of information exchange without decision making.

On the other hand, five FTF learners $( 1 6 \% )$ and four SvCMC learners $( 1 3 \% )$ expressed negative emotions. Four of them (S4, S5, S19, S52) felt bored with the task, as it was ‘simply information exchange, but the exchange student was not present’ (S52). For the same reason, three (S16, S18, S25) felt they were not invested in the task, and one (S48) felt unmotivated. One SvCMC student (S14) explained his nervousness during task performance:

I felt extremely nervous, as I might pass the wrong information to my partner.

Despite the positive emotions reported, the participants’ negative emotions related to the simple task indicate that the simple condition may not always engage learners emotionally.

# +Complex task

A total of 10 FTF $( 3 1 \% )$ and 13 SvCMC participants $( 4 1 \% )$ felt positive about the $^ +$ complex task. They attributed their positive emotions to two different features of the task: reasoning demand and planning time. The positive emotions of six FTF and two SvCMC students—due to the reasoning-demand nature of the task—include the enhancement of enjoyment (2), engagement (1), and interest (1) and the lower level of nervousness (3). For example, S26 explained:

I felt more engaged when being asked to make decisions, because I needed to present my reasons.

Furthermore, five FTF and 12 SvCMC students pointed out that the planning time led to their positive emotions, including enhanced confidence (4), relaxation (2), motivation (1), excitement (1), engagement (1), smoothness (1), willingness to participate (1), and state of comfort (1) and decreased levels of nervousness (4) and embarrassment (1). Two FTF learners (S51, S55) even felt that they had their feet on the ground when given planning time. An example is $\$ 383$ sharing:

I felt better when given planning time. I listed out some points before task performance. The process went smoother, and I was more engaged.

Contrary to S38 and other participants’ positive emotions in the $^ +$ complex task, four FTF learners $( 1 3 \% )$ and one SvCMC peer $( 3 \% )$ reported negative emotions. While S8 perceived that the task was not challenging because the reasoning demand did not exert extra pressure on her, S22 and S24 found the task with reasoning demand to be quite challenging, and S58 and S34 felt nervous. In terms of nervousness, S58 expressed:

There was no requirement in terms of the content. I planned to share the course I recommended, but my partner suddenly asked me about the other choice. I was not prepared. I felt nervous.

S58’s explanation indicates that the spontaneous nature of the task may have led to his nervousness.

# ++complex task

Although the $^ { + + }$ complex task was cognitively the most demanding, eight FTF $( 2 5 \% )$ and six SvCMC participants $( 1 9 \% )$ felt positive about it. They found the task to be fun (5) and felt happy (3), excited (3), engaged (3), and motivated (2) during task performance, and the process went smoothly (3). Three found the task to be an exciting challenge for them. S54 commented:

It was fun and challenging. This task is quite different from academic presentations. It’s impromptu.

Unlike S54, S29 attributed her engagement to the relevance of the task:

It’s weird to plan before you speak. In the non-planning task, I was not so fluent, but like daily communication, it’s okay to be interrupted or to ask questions if I don’t understand.

S29’s reason was also repeated by two other SvCMC participants who expressed their positive emotions (e.g. relaxed). Moreover, S31 said that she felt pleasantly surprised when she and her partner managed to achieve the task’s goal without planning time.

However, 13 FTF $( 4 2 \% )$ and nine SvCMC learners $( 2 8 \% )$ expressed their negative emotions, including nervousness (10), challenges (3), anxiety (2), confusion (2), uncertainty (1), embarrassment (1), lack of motivation (1), and engagement (2). This is because of the non-planning nature of the task, which contributed to participants’ unreadiness for task performance. Three felt that without planning time, the task process was not smooth.

# Emotional engagement in SvCMC and FTF modes

All the participants had prior experience of carrying out speaking tasks on Zoom and in the physical classroom, so they were asked to share their emotions when communicating with others in both modes. Of them, 32 $( 5 0 \% )$ preferred FTF to SvCMC, and 20 $( 3 1 \% )$ acknowledged that the different modes affected their emotions. Their positive emotions in the FTF mode include relaxation (6), state of comfort (4), and sense of relatedness (3). This is because they can see each other’s facial expressions and gestures clearly, and the communication process is more natural and authentic.

However, they experienced negative emotions when chatting on Zoom, such as feeling awkward (7), embarrassed (1), distracted (1), disengaged (1), confused (1), and nervous (1). For example, S36 explained his awkwardness:

In FTF communication, we can look at each other when speaking. But on Zoom, I looked at the camera and the course information simultaneously.

Besides S36’s explanation, S51 attributed her negative emotions to ‘the physical distance’ between the interlocutors.

In comparison, five participants $( 8 \% )$ preferred SvCMC to FTF. They felt less nervous (4), stressed (1), and scared (1), and more relaxed (1) on Zoom than in the FTF mode. S42 explained:

The latency allowed me to have slightly longer time to think about how to speak fluently.

S42’s feelings were also shared by S43 and S46. S24 felt shy about making eye contact with others. He was less nervous on Zoom because he simply needed to ‘look at the camera, instead of the partner, when speaking’.

It is also worth noting that 27 students $( 4 2 \% )$ did not feel that the communication modes made any differences, especially concerning their emotions. While they acknowledged that the two modes had their distinctive features, they were psychologically prepared and able to interact with each other and complete the tasks. S21 added:

Online teaching with Zoom or Skype is quite common. When turning on the camera, we can still see each other. There is not much difference as FTF communication.

S21’s statement implies that the learners can be accustomed to both communication modes; thus, their emotions were not greatly affected.

In summary, task complexity affected the behaviour and cognitive engagement of both FTF and SvCMC learners. SvCMC learners were behaviourally more engaged in task performance than FTF peers, but mixed results were found in cognitive engagement. Moreover, mixed emotions were reported by FTF and SvCMC learners for all task conditions.

# Discussion

This study investigated the impact of task complexity on Hong Kong ESL learners’ engagement in task performance in FTF and SvCMC communication modes. This topic is rather timely because computer-mediated communication has been a popular trend in L2 learning and teaching (Andujar & Salaberri-Ramiro, 2021; Wang et  al., 2021). The findings also contribute to L2 teaching and learning in the post-pandemic period when teachers need to shift from face-to-face teaching to online teaching or vice versa from time to time, and thus, learning about how to design appropriate oral tasks for specific teaching contexts to engage learners is of great importance.

# Task complexity effects on learner engagement

The findings indicate that FTF learners produced fewer words (behavioural) in the simple condition than in the $^ +$ complex condition. Both the FTF and SvCMC learners also produced fewer elaborative clauses (cognitive) in the simple task than in others. The SvCMC ones also held fewer clarifications on content in the $^ +$ complex task than in the $^ { + + }$ complex task. These findings echo Robinson’s (2011) Cognition Hypothesis by suggesting that increasing task complexity may behaviourally and cognitively engage L2 learners in oral task performance (Baralt et  al., 2016).

The findings regarding emotional engagement, nonetheless, partly confirm the Hypothesis. For the simple task, nine participants $( 1 4 \% )$ reported negative emotions, whereas only five $( 8 \% )$ had a positive response. More participants $( 3 6 \% )$ expressed their positive emotions for the $^ +$ complex task as compared to the five $( 1 4 \% )$ who reported negative emotions. The findings indicate that intentional reasoning demands emotionally engaged learners in task performance. However, for the $^ { + + }$ complex task, 14 students $( 2 2 \% )$ were emotionally engaged, but 22 $( 3 4 \% )$ were not adequately engaged because of the lack of planning time and the reasoning demands. When the task was cognitively too demanding, the learners did not seem to engage. Learners’ lower engagement in the $^ { + + }$ complex task may be explained by their limited attention capacity (Skehan, 2014). In other words, when L2 learners cannot attend to reasoning due to the lack of planning time, the task process may not be smooth, and it is likelier for them to experience negative emotions (e.g. anxious). In comparison, when a task is too simple (e.g. no reasoning demand with planning time), learners may not be engaged as well (e.g. bored).

Regarding social engagement, no significant differences were found between the three task conditions, which suggests that task complexity may not affect the social engagement of ESL learners. One possible explanation is related to the pair-formation method. The participants formed self-initiated pairs with their university friends and voluntarily signed up for the study. The interlocutor’s familiarity may have enhanced their social support (Dao et  al., 2021). Even though the $^ { + + }$ complex task was very demanding, they could still be empathetic and encouraging. Hence, they showed similar degrees of social engagement under the three conditions.

# Learner engagement in different communication modes

For learner engagement in the two communication modes, FTF learners produced more elaborative clauses in the simple and $^ { + + }$ complex tasks than SvCMC learners did. This finding was consistent with those of existing studies (Baralt et  al., 2016; Carver et  al., 2021) that claim that L2 learners are more engaged in FTF than in CMC modes. However, the FTF learners spent a shorter time and had less turn taking than their SvCMC peers in the simple task, and fewer turns were also uttered by the FTF group than the SvCMC one in the $+ { + } c$ omplex task. The findings indicated that SvCMC learners were behaviourally more engaged in task performance. Their behavioural engagement in the $^ { + + }$ complex task may be due to the frequent negotiation acts aimed at clarifying content, as has been reported in the findings section. In the SvCMC mode, given that extralinguistic cues (e.g. gesture) may not be easily presented within the scope of the camera, learners may still need to rely on verbal communication to convey their meaning and clarify non-understanding (Van der Zwaard & Bannink, 2016). While Van der Zwaard and Bannink (2016) found that SvCMC learners were reluctant to negotiate despite non-understanding, the findings of this study indicate that the SvCMC learners are willing to negotiate meaning, especially when the task is cognitively demanding. Two reasons are proposed. First, interlocutor familiarity may have enhanced their willingness to participate, and hence, they may have felt more comfortable describing their information in detail to ensure the interlocutor can understand them and to request clarifications wherever non-understanding exists.

Second, all the participants have prior experience of computer-mediated communication and are familiar with the Zoom setting; thus, they are accustomed to the communication mode and can adapt their communication strategy (e.g. more verbal exchanges) to achieve the task goals.

Not surprisingly, echoing some previous studies (Hampel & Hauck, 2004; van Der Zwaard & Bannink, 2016), 20 participants $( 3 1 \% )$ reported positive emotions for FTF but negative ones for SvCMC for the following reasons: SvCMC was not natural, physical distance distracted them from communication, and extralinguistic cues could not be frequently provided. Nonetheless, it is worth considering that the two communication modes did not emotionally affect 27 learners’ $( 4 2 \% )$ engagement. This may be due to their familiarity with both modes. Depending on the pandemic situation, the target institution adopted different kinds of teaching modes (i.e. online teaching, hybrid teaching, face-to-face teaching) in the past two years. The learners were not only familiar with FTF communication but also had at least one year’s experience of attending Zoom classes. They were asked to participate in this study from where they would normally attend Zoom classes to ensure their familiarity with the physical surroundings. They felt that they could adapt themselves to both communication modes.

# Pedagogical implications

The findings of this study partly confirm the Cognition Hypothesis, which contributes to L2 learning and teaching by raising L2 researchers’ and teachers’ awareness of the impact of tasks on learner engagement (Hiver et  al., 2021; Lambert, 2017). One implication for L2 teaching is that increasing task complexity may behaviourally, cognitively, and emotionally engage L2 learners in task performance. However, if a task is cognitively too demanding and learners do not have adequate time to attend to different aspects of the task or their performance, they may feel emotionally disengaged. Drawing from the findings, tasks with reasoning demands and planning time may be appropriate for engaging intermediate L2 learners. Second, SvCMC and FTF communication modes may have distinctive advantages. The SvCMC communication mode may behaviourally engage learners and elicit more clarifications on content, whereas the FTF mode may encourage more elaborative clauses. To optimise learner engagement in the SvCMC mode, teachers can offer advice on how learners can deal with different unexpected situations and create more communication opportunities so that learners can be better prepared for tasks and become accustomed to the SvCMC mode. Pairing learners with their classroom friends to enhance interlocutor familiarity is recommended (Dao et  al., 2021).

# Conclusion

The findings of this study indicate that task complexity affects the behavioural, cognitive, and emotional engagement of FTF learners and the cognitive and emotional engagement of SvCMC learners. SvCMC learners are also behaviourally more engaged in task performance and have greater negotiations on content in the $^ { + + }$ complex condition, whereas FTF learners produce more elaborative clauses in the simple and $+ { \mathrm { + c o m - } }$ plex tasks. Out of the 64 participants, 20 were more emotionally engaged in task performance in the FTF mode than in the SvCMC mode, but 27 did not feel that the different communication modes affected their emotional engagement.

Despite its pedagogical implications, this study can be enhanced further. Capturing emotional engagement with merely interview data may not be reliable enough, as emotions can fluctuate during task performance. More data sources can be collected to explore emotional engagement. For example, learners may pause during their task performance to rate their engagement level. Their facial expressions and laughs during task performance can also be analysed. The interaction effects between task complexity and communication modes can also be further explored. A larger sample size may help to ensure the normality of the data sets so that parametric tests (e.g. repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance or MANOVA) can be implemented.

Notwithstanding the limitations, this study contributes to task-based research by offering insights into learner engagement in online and face-toface language teaching/learning. Although the two communication modes have different features, the findings show that learners can be engaged in both modes. The findings also present two possible directions for future research. The most prominent need is to explore how task complexity affects learner engagement in different types of tasks. Furthermore, a wider range of task design factors can be investigated so that a more robust conclusion can be drawn regarding whether the Cognition Hypothesis can be extended effectively to task engagement.

# Notes

1. Given that the accuracy rate for the FTF group was statistically similar as the one for the SvCMC group $\mathit { t } = . 3 1 0$ , $p = . 7 5 7 .$ ), learners’ L2 proficiency is not regarded as a potential confounding variable for learner engagement in task performance in the two communication modes.   
2. Counterbalanced order means the participants had different task sequences, such as from the simple task to the $+ + \zeta$ omplex one, from the $^ { + + }$ complex task to the simple one, from $^ +$ complex, $^ { + + }$ complex to the simple one and so on.   
3. According to Cohen (1988), the thresholds for small, medium, and large effect sizes are .20, .50, and .80 respectively.
