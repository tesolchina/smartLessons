# Preface

A third edition! My colleagues and I have never wavered in our conviction that the theory behind The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy is sound, as it is based on well-established findings of linguistics and cognitive psychology. But it is gratifying to learn that its scholarly soundness has   
found a practical resonance with the public.

A new edition is called for to keep up with the changes in American culture. This book contains about five hundred (out of nearly seven thousand) new entries, of which about two hundred are in the science and technology chapters. It is frightening to realize that when we wrote the second edition, almost no one knew what a Web page was. Of the remainder of the new entries, about half are in the fields of history, politics, and geography. A thousand entries have been revised for clarity and updated to reflect current usage. We hope that this book continues to be useful to Americans of all ages and backgrounds.

I say “to Americans” because the concept of cultural literacy implies a national culture. Of course the entries reflect content from many nations of the world, and the principle of cultural literacy is implicitly international. There are by now German, Dutch, and Swedish versions of this book. But each is different, having been adapted to the relevant national language and culture. People within each of these national communities are bound together not just by political institutions and laws, but also by shared values and allusions and a shared language. The public understands that in the United States, our shared language contains not just “the” and “was” but “Birmingham Jail,” “Sitting Bull,” and “pay through the nose.” (Explanations of idioms like “pay through the nose” have been especially welcomed by immigrant parents and children.)

The public also understands that these shared meanings are essential for communication inside our nation — or, to put the matter simply, they are essential for reading. We all know that reading is the most important academic skill, and that there is a big reading gap between haves and have-nots in our schools. We know that reading skill is a key not just to a child’s success in school but also, in the information age, to his or her chances in life. That is why the federal government and now most of the states have started to place an enormous emphasis on reading.

This is good news and bad news. It’s good news because becoming a good reader is so enormously important. It’s bad news because the people who make and carry out school policies have not been very sophisticated so far about what is needed, beyond sounding out words, to become a good reader. On the important matter of reading comprehension, their vision is vague and clouded. Talking about reading comprehension reminds me of Mark Twain’s comment on the weather: everybody talks about it, but nobody does anything about it. Reading comprehension scores have not gone up significantly.

In the United States, reading with understanding is based on the kind of background knowledge identified in this book, and it is to be hoped that our schools will begin to do a better job of imparting this kind of knowledge to all children in a coherent and cumulative way. When they do, reading comprehension scores will go up. (Data to support this can be found at the Web site of the Core Knowledge Foundation, www.coreknowledge.org). From the start, the premise of this dictionary was that true literacy — reading with comprehension — requires a lot more than sounding out the words on the page. Those who possess the needed, taken-for-granted knowledge can understand what they read, and those who lack that knowledge cannot. The haves learn ever more from what they read and hear; the havenots fall further behind and lose the chance to become participating members of the wider community.

That word “community” brings me to the second motivation behind this book, the connection between communication and community, especially in a democracy. A lot of American flags are flying these days. Some people think this is a worrisome show of nationalism, but I believe it is a show mainly of solidarity and community. Community is built up of shared knowledge and values — the same shared knowledge that is taken for granted when we read a book or newspaper, and that is also taken for granted as part of the fabric that connects us to one another.

Horace Mann put it eloquently in his nineteenth-century way in making a case for public schooling and a common curriculum. Shared knowledge, he said, would enlarge “the cultivated class or caste and . . . open a wider area over which the social feelings will expand; and if this education should be universal and complete, it would do more than all things else to obliterate [artificial] distinctions in society.” Mann thought that if everyone shared the enabling words and knowledge of our culture, everyone would gain a sense of solidarity with others. Social feelings would expand. Artificial distinctions of class and caste would be erased, and patriotic feelings would grow.

The love of country — patriotism — is a very different sentiment from nationalism. A fine book by Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities, beautifully distinguishes between nationalist and patriotic sentiments. Nationalism is an aggrandizing, tribalistic sentiment that defines one’s own group as opposed to alien groups, which are seen as potential rivals or enemies to be overcome or excluded. Patriotism, by contrast, implies love of country without necessarily implying hostility to anybody else. American patriotism is built of shared knowledge, attitudes, loyalties, and values, including the values of nonexclusion, toleration, and respect for other religions and cultures. Americans have proved that it is possible to feel patriotic about a cosmopolitan, diverse country, which is loved more for its vital diversity than for its racial or ethnic purity. That was Walt Whitman’s patriotism, and Herman Melville’s. For most of our history, the United States has imagined itself as a patriotic rather than as a nationalist state. George Washington thought of himself and was celebrated as Cincinnatus, the Roman hero who wishes only to return to his hearth and his farm once the necessary sacrifice and service to the patria is accomplished.

To that, Herman Melville added our modern idea of a nation that embraces all races and ethnic groups. He said,

There is something in the contemplation of the mode in which America has been settled that, in a noble breast, should forever extinguish the prejudices of national dislikes. Settled by the people of all nations, all nations may claim her for their own. You can not spill a drop of American blood without spilling the blood of the whole world. . . . We are not a narrow tribe of men — No: our blood is as the flood of the Amazon, made up of a thousand noble currents all pouring into one. . . . For who were our father and mother? Or can we point to any Romulus and Remus for our founders? Our ancestry is lost in the universal paternity, and Caesar and Alfred, St. Paul and Luther, Homer and Shakespeare are as much ours as Washington, who is as much the world’s as our own.

You might want to read the rest of this wonderful passage (Chapter ) from Redburn, written in . I won’t quote any more of it here. Suffice it to say that this American idea of a new kind of patriotism and community is a tradition that stretches from George Washington to Horace Mann and Herman Melville to ourselves, and it has not lost its pungency and capacity to inspire.

# Introduction to the First Edition

Although it is true that no two humans know exactly the same things, they often have a greatdeal of knowledge in common. To a large extent this common knowledge or collective memcommunities, and if it is shared by enough people, it is a distinguishing characteristic of a national culture. The form and content of this common knowledge constitute one of the elements that makes each national culture unique.

It is our contention that such a body of information is shared by literate Americans of the late twentieth century, and that this body of knowledge can be identified and defined. This dictionary is a first attempt at that task. It identifies and defines the names, phrases, events, and other items that are familiar to most literate Americans: the information that we call cultural literacy. Although few of us will know every entry, most of us will be familiar with the majority, even if we are unable to define each one exactly.

Cultural literacy, unlike expert knowledge, is meant to be shared by everyone. It is that shifting body of information that our culture has found useful, and therefore worth preserving. Only a small fraction of what we read and hear gains a secure place on the memory shelves of the culturally literate, but the importance of this information is beyond question. This shared information is the foundation of our public discourse. It allows us to comprehend our daily newspapers and news reports, to understand our peers and leaders, and even to share our jokes. Cultural literacy is the context of what we say and read; it is part of what makes Americans American.

Because this is the first time anyone has tried to identify and define the knowledge assumed in public discourse, we had to establish a number of rules for deciding what to include. First, we proposed that many things are either above or below the level of cultural literacy. Some information is so specialized that it is known only by experts and is therefore above the level of common knowledge. At the same time, some information, such as the names of colors and animals, is too basic and generally known to be included in this kind of dictionary. By definition, cultural literacy falls between the specialized and the generalized.

Our second test was to determine how widely known an item is in our culture. Only those items that are likely to be known by a broad majority of literate Americans ought to appear in this dictionary. Therefore, in selecting entries, we drew upon a wide range of national periodicals. We reasoned that if a major daily newspaper refers to an event, person, or thing without defining it, we can assume that the majority of the readers of that periodical will know what that item is. If this is true, that event, person, or thing is probably part of our common knowledge, and therefore part of cultural literacy.

Third, we proposed that cultural literacy is not knowledge of current events, although it can help us understand those events as they occur. To become part of cultural literacy, an item must have lasting significance. Either it has found a place in our collective memory or it has the promise of finding such a place. This is one of the things that contributes to the stability of cultural literacy in America. Some of the material in this dictionary has remained unchanged in our national consciousness since our nation’s beginnings.

In some cases, determining lasting significance was very difficult. In our age of communication, the lifespan of many things in our collective memory is very short. What seems monumental today often becomes trivial tomorrow. For the sake of the dictionary, we arbitrarily chose a memory span of fifteen years. If a person or event has been widely recognized for more than fifteen years or seems likely to be recognized by a majority of people fifteen years from now, that person or event deserved consideration for a place in this dictionary.

This rule of lasting significance tended to eliminate certain fields altogether, or nearly so. For example, our collective memory of most of the people and events in the fields of sports and entertainment is too ephemeral to take a permanent place in our cultural heritage. There are outstanding exceptions, however, and those are included in this dictionary.

Scientific entries presented a special problem. Because there is little broad knowledge of science even among educated people, the criteria used to compile the lists for the humanities and social sciences simply could not be used with the natural sciences. The gap between the essential basic knowledge of science and what the general reader can be expected to know has become too large. Our criterion for choosing a science entry was that the item must be truly essential to a broad grasp of a major science. The science-related terms in this dictionary represent our best judgments, and those of our advisers, about what literate Americans ought to know to achieve the levels of communication expected for the humanities and social sciences.

We realize that many of the entries included here can be questioned. We also realize that many items that are excluded are open to similar questioning. We debated these entries at length, and we hope that this dictionary will stimulate a similar debate among our readers. American culture is not the property of the elite or even of the majority — it belongs to us all.

This attempt at creating a Dictionary of Cultural Literacy remains an unfinished project. We hope our readers will become our collaborators in improving and expanding it. Our culture changes constantly as new things are added and others are forgotten, and new relationships are forged and broken. Defining cultural literacy is an ongoing project, and this is only a first step. We invite your participation.

# The Theory Behind the Dictionary: Cultural Literacy and Education

T he conceptions that underlie this dictionary are outlined in my book Cultural Literacy, published in . But in fact, the dictionary project was begun before I thought of writing a separate book, and the book itself was first conceived merely as a technical explanation of the ideas that led us to undertake the dictionary. The scope of the book outgrew that aim, but no one even considered the possibility that the book would become a best-seller or that it would be read outside the field of education. Although it did become a best-seller and its ideas have been widely discussed, many users of this dictionary may not be familiar with the concept of cultural literacy. So here, in brief compass, is why this project was undertaken, and why we hope it will help improve American public education and public discourse.

One good way of explaining the cultural literacy project might well be to list the points of strong agreement that have appeared in reviews of the book and in the hundreds of letters I have received from teachers and nonteachers alike. All these reviews and letters endorse the proposition that achieving high universal literacy ought to be a primary focus of educational reform in this country. They all accept the evidence that our national literacy has been declining since , not only among disadvantaged children but also among our top students. They agree that the decline has occurred at a time when truly functional literacy is becoming ever more important to our economic well-being. And they have usually stressed the idea that providing everyone with a high level of literacy is important in holding together the social fabric of the nation.

The novelty that my book introduced into this discussion is its argument that true literacy depends on a knowledge of the specific information that is taken for granted in our public discourse. My emphasis on background information makes my book an attack on all formal and technical approaches xii

to teaching language arts. Reading and writing are not simply acts of decoding and encoding but rather acts of communication. The literal words we speak and read and write are just the tip of the iceberg in communication. An active understanding of the written word requires far more than the ability to call out words from a page or the possession of basic vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and inferencing techniques. We have learned that successful reading also requires a knowledge of shared, taken-for-granted information that is not set down on the page.

To grasp the practical importance of that point for our entire educational system, we need to ask a fundamental question. Why is high national literacy the key to educational progress in all domains of learning, even in mathematics and natural sciences? We have long known that there is a high correlation between students’ reading ability and their ability to learn new materials in diverse fields. That sounds vaguely reasonable, even obvious, but why exactly should it be the case? Let’s try to understand the not-so-obvious reason for the high correlation between reading ability and learning ability.

The true measure of reading ability is the ease and accuracy with which a person can understand diverse kinds of writing. All standardized tests of reading ability include samples from several different subject matters. But why isn’t one long sample just as effective a test as several short ones? Well, if reading ability were a purely generalizable skill, one long sample would be an adequate diagnostic test. But in fact, reading ability is not a generalizable skill. If a young boy knows a lot about snakes but very little about lakes, he will make a good score on a passage about snakes, but a less good score on a passage about lakes. So to get a fairly accurate picture of his overall reading ability, we have to sample how he does on a variety of subjects.

But notice that this variability in a person’s performance shows us something of utmost importance about reading ability. To have a good general reading ability, you need to know about a lot of things. If you know about lakes and snakes, and rakes and cakes, you will have higher reading ability than if you just know about snakes. Aha! you might say, that simply means you will read better if you have a broad vocabulary. That is true. But remember what it means to have a broad vocabulary. Knowing a lot of words means knowing a lot of things. Words refer to things. Language arts are also knowledge arts.

We have now taken a first step in understanding the correlation between reading ability and learning ability. We have established that high reading ability is a multiplex skill that requires knowledge in a wide range of subjects. It turns out that the same is true of learning ability. A basic axiom of learning is that the easiest way to learn something new is to associate it with something we already know. Much of the art of teaching is the art of associating what kids need to learn with what they already know. The process of learning often works as metaphor does, yoking old ideas together to make something new. In the nineteenth century, when people wanted to describe the new transportation technology that went chug-chug-chug, they called the engine an “iron horse” and the rail system “track way” (if they were Dutch) or “rail way” (if they were English) or “iron way” (if they were French, German, or Italian) or “narrow iron lane” (if they were Greek). All of these metaphors successfully conveyed a new concept by combining old concepts.

As a consequence of the fact that we learn most easily when we attach the new to the old, people who already know a lot tend to learn new things faster and more easily than people who do not know very much. Mainly this is because knowledgeable people will have less to learn; they already know many of the key elements in the new concept. In learning about a railroad, for instance, they possess whole realms of relevant knowledge that make it unnecessary to explain a lot of subordinate facts about how wheels work, what the nature of iron is, what steam engines do, and so on.

It should now be clear why reading ability and learning ability are so closely allied. They both depend on a diversity of prior knowledge. You can easily read a range of new texts if you already know a lot; so too you can easily learn a broad range of new knowledge if you already know a lot. It should not surprise us, therefore, that back in the s the College Board found out that the best predictor of how well students would perform in school was their performance on a general knowledge test. “Reading, writing, and arithmetic” and the general ability to learn new things all show a high correlation with broad background knowledge.

I must ask your indulgence to take another step along the path I am leading you. Reading and learning ability depend on something more definite than broad, unspecified knowledge. To a significant degree, learning and reading depend on specific broad knowledge. The reason for this goes back to my earlier point that reading is not just a technical skill but also an act of communication. When somebody is reading with understanding, communication is taking place between writer and reader. Conversely, if communication isn’t taking place, the reader isn’t accurately understanding what he or she is reading. Successful communication depends on understanding both the text’s literal meanings and its implied meanings. These all-important implied meanings can only be constructed out of specific knowledge shared between writer and reader. Let me give a very brief example of why this is so. Here are the beginning words of a school textbook on chemistry:

You are beginning your study of chemistry at a time when growing numbers of people are concerned about the declining quality of life. Chemistry can help you gain a deeper and more satisfying understanding of your environment than you have now. If you are curious and wish to know more about natural processes, minerals of the earth, water and solutions, and gases of the atmosphere, the activities in chemistry beckon to you.

That’s it. As a child, I’m supposed to know before reading the passage that chemistry has to do with minerals, water, and solutions, that numbers of people are concerned about the quality of life, that quality of life has something to do with water and solutions. Understanding that passage will be easy if I already know what “chemistry,” “solution,” and “declining quality of life” are supposed to signify.

But just consider the words of that last phrase one by one, “declining quality of life.” They presuppose a whole realm of background knowledge that has no existence in the words themselves. To understand the phrase quickly and accurately, I need more than a knowledge of the individual words or possession of general inferencing skills. I need to know the writer’s taken-for-granted information — in this case, the widespread discussion in our culture about the pollution of rivers, atmosphere, and so on. Neither the word nor the concept of pollution is mentioned in the passage. But to understand the paragraph, I not only need to know that rivers and air are being polluted, I also need to know the unspoken convention that complaints about pollution are sometimes couched in the phrase “declining quality of life.” If I don’t share that background knowledge with the writer, I can’t quickly understand the passage. Even someone with a good command of English and technical reading skills who happened not to know that particular background information would be baffled for a long time by the juxtaposition of quality of life with a reference to aqueous solutions.

Reading ability, then, depends not only on broad knowledge but also on shared knowledge. Communication between writer and reader always depends on implications that remain unsaid, and that must be shared by writer and reader if the communication is to proceed effectively. Since successful learning from reading depends on the effectiveness of the communicative transaction, I am led to the conclusion that both learning and reading are powerfully affected by the degree to which background knowledge is shared between writer and reader, and between teacher and student. To learn well, I need to know a lot, but I also need to know the specific things that enable me to read between the lines.

Therefore, learning depends on communication, and effective communication depends on shared background knowledge. The optimal way to fulfill this requirement of communication is simply to insure that readers and writers, students and teachers do in fact share a broad range of specific knowledge. This makes good communication possible, which in turn makes effective learning possible, and also enables a society to work. In short, we have come round to the point of my book. An important key to solving the twin problems of learning and literacy is to attain the broadly shared background knowledge I have called “cultural literacy.” My book argues that the content of this literate background knowledge is not a mystery, and that it can be taught systematically to all our students. The book further claims that if we do impart this content, we can achieve the universal literacy that is a necessary foundation for further educational, economic, and social improvements. No active reading researcher — that is to say, no one who is thoroughly conversant with the empirical data in cognitive research — has challenged this analysis.

We know from the history of Europe that national schools can achieve high literacy for everyone in a multicultural population. France did so with a population that, up to the eighteenth century, spoke at least four different languages. The French school system turned illiterate “peasants into Frenchmen,” to use Eugen Weber’s phrase, and it was the school system, not the peasant home, that accomplished this miracle. Viewed in a long historical perspective, it has been the school, not the home, that has been the decisive factor in achieving mass literacy. Literate national language and culture are what Ernest Gellner aptly calls school-transmitted cultures. He observes that the chief makers of the modern nation have been schoolteachers. They helped create the modern nation-state, and they alone can perpetuate it and make it thrive. When the schools of a nation fail adequately to transmit the literate national language and culture, the unity and effectiveness of the nation will necessarily decline.

While avoiding the temptation to cast blame for our recent decline in literacy, we do need to understand and correct it. One important cause of the decline has been the use of “skills-oriented,” “relevant” materials in elementary and secondary grades. The consequent disappearance from the early curriculum of literate culture (that is, traditional history, myth, and literature) has been a mistake of monumental proportions. Modern basal readers constantly update the content that young children are taught, under the theory that modern materials will be of greater interest to them than older stories and myths, as though reading, writing, and oral communication were formal skills that could be perfected independently of specific literate content. Unfortunately, as we have seen, that theory is empirically wrong, and operating upon it has had disastrous consequences for national literacy. Research on expert performance shows a high correlation between skill and specific knowledge, and this correlation holds from the beginning stages up to the very top levels of performance.

Publishers and schools need to direct their energies to enhancing the effectiveness with which core literate content is presented. They should not try to overhaul the entire content of literate culture, which cannot successfully be done in any case. Professional linguists have often remarked on the inherent conservatism of literacy. Some of its elements do not change at all. Spelling, for example, is extraordinarily conservative, because so many people have learned the traditional forms, and so many books have recorded them, that successful spelling reform would require orthographical thought-police. This linguistic inertia induced by print and mass education also extends to other contents of literate culture.

But the conservatism of literate culture is far from total. New elements are constantly coming in, and old ones falling out of use. Americans have successfully pressed for cultural reforms, including greater representation of women, minorities, and non-Western cultures. In addition, literate culture must keep up with historical and technical change. Yet the materials of literate culture that are recent introductions constitute about a fifth of its total. The disputed territory of literate culture is much smaller still — about  percent. Thus,  percent of literate culture is undisputed territory, and, most striking of all,  percent of literate culture has been in use for more than a hundred years!

Such cultural conservatism is fortunate and useful for the purposes of national communication. It enables grandparents to communicate with grandchildren, southerners with midwesterners, whites with blacks, Asians with Latinos, and Republicans with Democrats — no matter where they were educated. If each local school system imparts the traditional reference points of literate culture, then everybody is able to communicate with strangers. That is a good definition of literacy: the ability to communicate effectively with strangers. We help people in the underclass rise economically by teaching them how to communicate effectively beyond a narrow social sphere, and that can only be accomplished by teaching them shared, traditional literate culture. Thus the inherent conservatism of literacy leads to an unavoidable paradox: the social goals of liberalism require educational conservatism. We only make social and economic progress by teaching everyone to read and communicate, which means teaching myths and facts that are predominantly traditional.

Those who evade this inherent conservatism of literacy in the name of multicultural antielitism are in effect elitists of an extreme sort. Traditionally educated themselves, and highly literate, these selfappointed protectors of minority cultures have advised schools to pursue a course that has condemned minorities to illiteracy. The disadvantaged students for whom antielitist solicitude is expressed are the very ones who suffer when we fail to introduce traditional literate culture into the earliest grades. Ideological partisanship on the subject of national literacy is more empirical than ideological. The overarching ideological decision has already been made in the commitment to universal literacy. What follows from that commitment is determined more by reality than ideology.

The real test of any educational idea is its usefulness. We hope this dictionary will be a useful tool. We also hope and expect that no one will be willing to stop with cultural literacy as a final educational aim. Cultural literacy is a necessary but not sufficient attainment of an educated person. Cultural literacy is shallow; true education is deep. But our analysis of reading and learning suggests the paradox that broad, shallow knowledge is the best route to deep knowledge. Because broad knowledge enables us to read and learn effectively, it is the best guarantee that we will continue to read, and learn, and deepen our knowledge. True literacy has always opened doors — not just to deep knowledge and economic success, but also to other people and other cultures.

# How to Use This Dictionary

T he Dictionary of Cultural Literacy is a departure from all other reference works in its attempt to identify and define common cultural knowledge rather than to present a lexicon of words or topics. Nonetheless, for the convenience of our readers, this book incorporates some of the conventions found in standard dictionaries and encyclopedias.

# Organization

# The Index

The first place to look for a particular topic in this dictionary is the alphabetically ordered index found at the end of the book.

# Subject Sections

The main body of the dictionary is divided into the twenty-three sections listed in the Contents. These sections follow the traditional division of subject matter that a student should have encountered by the senior year in most high schools. Some particularly lengthy subjects have been divided into two sections according to the most common divisions used in classrooms and textbooks. For example, the year  marks the dividing point between the two sections on American history because this date is traditionally used as a historical divider in American history courses. Within each section, entries are listed alphabetically. Proper names, quotations, or phrases are listed by their most commonly recognized element.

Because cultural literacy embraces more subject matter than is usually treated in an academic setting, this book contains several topics, such as proverbs and idioms, that may be encountered only indirectly in the classroom.

# Definitions

Each entry provides a concise definition and also the current cultural sense of the term.

xvii

# Cultural Associations

Most definitions make the cultural sense of an entry self-evident, but such is not always the case. Some entries require further information. Cultural associations follow the definitions and are identified by the symbol ✥ . When an entry has more than one cultural association, each one is preceded by the symbol.

# Cross-References

Cross-references throughout the dictionary expand the information given in each entry and indicate relationships between various entries. Set in small capitals, cross-references appear as part of a definition or cultural association, as in the example above, or are listed at the end of the definition. Cross-references refer to entry words included in the index.

# Pronunciation

Some of the entries in this dictionary have unusual pronunciations; therefore, a pronunciation guide is provided. This guide appears in parentheses after the entry word. No special symbols are required for understanding these pronunciations. Instead, pronunciations rely on individual letters or familiar combinations of letters to convey their sound. Variant pronunciations are given whenever necessary. Pronunciations are broken into syllables separated by hyphens. The primary accent in a word is indicated by capital letters. In most cases the sound represented in the pronunciation is easily understood, but a key is provided here for your use.

# Pronunciation Key

When A Sound It Should Be   
Appears As Pronounced As In

The Bible, the holy book of Judaism and Christianity, is the most widely known book in the English-speaking world. It is divided into two main parts, commonly called the Old Testament and the New Testament. The bestknown books of the Old Testament are Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Job, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Isaiah. Thirty-nine books make up the Holy Scripture for Judaism. Christianity built upon Judaism and included the Old Testament as the first part of its own Scripture, adding the New Testament, which consists of twenty-seven books. Its main books are the four Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which relate the life of Jesus and his teachings — and Revelation.

No one in the English-speaking world can be considered literate without a basic knowledge of the Bible. Literate people in India, whose religious traditions are not based on the Bible but whose common language is English, must know about the Bible in order to understand English within their own country. All educated speakers of American English need to understand what is meant when someone describes a contest as being between David and Goliath, or whether a person who has the “wisdom of Solomon” is wise or foolish, or whether saying “My cup runneth over” means the person feels fortunate or unfortunate.

The Bible is also essential for understanding many of the moral and spiritual values of our culture, whatever our religious beliefs. The story of Abraham and Isaac concerns our deepest feelings about the relations between parents and children. The story of Job is a major representation in our tradition of being patient during suffering. The parables and sayings of Jesus, such as “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth,” are so often alluded to that they need to be known by Americans of all faiths.

No person in the modern world can be considered educated without a basic knowledge of all the great religions of the world — Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity. But our knowledge of Judaism and Christianity needs to be more detailed than that of other great religions, if only because the Bible is embedded in our thought and language. The Bible is a central book in our culture, just as the Koran is central in other nations. The logical conclusion is that our schools need to teach more about the Bible than about the Koran, but they have a responsibility to teach about both. Far from being illegal or undesirable, teaching about the Bible is not only consistent with our Constitution, it is essential to our literacy.

Abraham and Isaac The first two patriarchs of the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis, God made a covenant with Abraham, telling him to leave his own country and promising to give his family (the Hebrews) the land of Canaan. This was the Promised Land. God also promised to maintain the covenant with Abraham’s son Isaac. After a time, God tested Abraham by telling him to sacrifice Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham obediently placed Isaac on an altar and took a knife to kill him. Then an angel of the Lord appeared and told Abraham to spare his son, because Abraham had proved his faith.

$\clubsuit$ Both Jews and Arabs (see Arab-Israeli conflict) claim descent from Abraham: Jews through Isaac, Arabs through Abraham’s other son, Ishmael. Abraham’s devotion to God makes him a model of faith to Jews and Christians alike. ✥ “The bosom of Abraham” is a term used in the Gospel of Luke, and in poetry often refers to the peace of heaven.

Adam and Eve In the Bible, the first man and the first woman. The Book of Genesis tells that God created Adam by breathing life into “the dust of the ground.” Later, God created Eve from Adam’s rib. God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, telling them that they could eat the fruit of all the trees in the garden except the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. They lived happily until the serpent (Satan) tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. She ate, and gave the fruit to Adam, who also ate; they immediately became aware and ashamed of their nakedness. Because of Adam and Eve’s disobedience, God drove them from the garden into the world outside, where Eve would suffer in childbirth and Adam would have to earn his livelihood by the sweat of his brow. The direst consequence of Adam and Eve’s disobedience was death: “Dust thou art,” said God, “and unto dust shalt thou return.” After their expulsion, Eve gave birth to sons, first Cain and Abel and then Seth, and thus Adam and Eve became the parents of humankind. Adam and Eve’s sin and their consequent loss of God’s grace and the enjoyment of paradise are referred to as the Fall of Man or simply “the Fall.”

alpha and omega (al-fuh; oh-may-guh, oh-meg-uh, oh-mee-guh) The beginning and the end. In the Greek alphabet, in which the New Testament was written, alpha is the first letter and omega is the last. In the Book of Revelation, God says, $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last,” meaning that God remains from the beginning to the end of time.

angels Spirits who live in heaven with God; also the devils of hell, who are angels fallen from goodness. In the Bible, angels are often sent to Earth, sometimes with a human appearance, to bring the messages of God to people, to guide and protect them, or to execute God’s punishments. (See Abraham and Isaac, Annunciation, cherubim, Daniel in the lions’ den, Gabriel, Jacob’s ladder, Lot’s wife, Lucifer,

Abraham and Isaac. An engraving of an angel stopping Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, by Julius Schnoor von Karolsfeld.

Adam and Eve. The Fall of Man, an engraving by Albrecht Dürer.

Michael, Passover, plagues of Egypt, Satan, and Sodom and Gomorrah.)

Annunciation An announcement made by the angel Gabriel to Mary, the mother of Jesus, that she was going to bear a son, even though she was a virgin. Her son was to be called Jesus.

Antichrist A person mentioned in the New Testament as an enemy of Jesus, who will appear before the Second Coming and win over many of Jesus’ followers. The Antichrist is often identified with a beast described in the Book of Revelation, whom God destroys just before the final defeat of Satan.

✥ Since the New Testament was written, people have frequently tried to prove that an individual human being was the Antichrist. Some of the candidates have been the Roman emperors Nero and Caligula and the modern dictators Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.

Apocalypse (uh-pok-uh-lips) Another name for the New Testament Book of Revelation; from the Greek word for “revelation.”

✥ An “apocalypse” is a final catastrophe. ✥ The Apocalypse is supposed to come at the end of the world or of time.

Apocrypha (uh-pok-ruh-fuh) Religious writings that have been accepted as books of the Bible by some groups but not by others. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, includes seven books, such as Judith, I and II Maccabees, and Ecclesiasticus, in the Old Testament that Jews and Protestants do not consider part of the Bible. Some churches may read the Apocrypha for inspiration but not to establish religious doctrine.

$\clubsuit$ By extension, an “apocryphal” story is one that is probably false but nevertheless has some value.

Apostles, the Twelve The twelve men chosen by Jesus to follow him and to spread the gospel after his death. They included Peter, James, John, Thomas, Matthew, and Judas Iscariot (who was later replaced). Paul, even though he was not one of the Twelve, is generally considered an apostle because of his crucial role in the spread of Christianity.

✥ In general usage, an apostle is someone who preaches or promotes a cause, particularly a religious one. The term also connotes a disciple.

Ararat (ar-uh-rat) The mountain upon which Noah’s ark came to rest as the waters of the great flood receded. (See Noah and the Flood.)

Armageddon (ahr-muh-ged-n) In the Book of Revelation, the site of the final and conclusive battle between good and evil, involving “the kings of the Earth and the whole world,” on the “great day of God Almighty.”

✥ Figuratively, “Armageddon” is any great battle or destructive confrontation.

Ask, and it shall be given you A teaching of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount. He continues, “Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”

✥ This passage suggests that God will give whatever is needed to those who have the faith to ask for it.

Babel, Tower of (bay-buhl, bab-uhl) In the Book of Genesis, a tower that the descendants of Noah built. They intended that the tower would reach up to heaven itself, increase their reputation, and make them like God. God prevented them from completing the tower by confusing their language so that they could no longer understand one another’s speech. From that time forward, according to the Bible, the peoples of the Earth would be scattered, speaking different languages.

✥ “Babel” is confusion and noise.

Babylon (bab-uh-luhn, bab-uh-lon) The capital of the ancient empire of Babylonia, which conquered Israel in the sixth century b.c. The Jews were exiled to Babylon, which they found luxurious and corrupt. The prophet Daniel became a counselor to the king of Babylon (see the handwriting on the wall), and eventually the Israelites were allowed to return to their homeland. (See also Daniel in the lions’ den.)

✥ A “Babylon” is any place of sin and corruption.

Bathsheba (bath-shee-buh) A beautiful woman who attracted King David. To marry her, he sent her husband Uriah to his death in battle. Solomon was her second son by David.

Beatitudes (bee-at-uh-toohdz, bee-at-uh-tyoohdz) Eight sayings of Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount. The word is from the Latin beatus, meaning “blessed,” and each of the Beatitudes begins with the word blessed. They include “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth” and “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.”

Beelzebub (bee-el-zuh-bub) Another name for Satan. Originally a Philistine god, he is called the Prince of Devils in the New Testament.

✥ Beelzebub also appears in Milton’s Paradise Lost as one of the fallen angels, second only to Satan in power. ✥ By extension, a “Beelzebub” is any demon or evil spirit.

beginning, In the The first words of the Book of Genesis, which contains the biblical account of Creation: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth.” The Gospel of John begins, “In the beginning was the Word.”

Bethlehem The village near Jerusalem where Jesus was born. (See Nativity.)

Bible The book sacred to Christians, which they consider to be the inspired word of God. The Bible includes the Old Testament, which contains the sacred books of the Jews, and the New Testament, which begins with the birth of Jesus.

Thirty-nine books of the Old Testament are accepted as part of the Bible by Christians and Jews alike. Some Christians consider several books of the Old Testament, such as Judith, I and II Maccabees, and Ecclesiasticus, to be part of the Bible also, whereas other Christians, and Jews, call these the Old Testament Apocrypha. Christians are united in their acceptance of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament; Jews do not consider the writings of the New Testament inspired. The Bible is also called “the Book” (bible means “book”).

✥ By extension, any book considered an infallible or very reliable guide to some activity may be called a “bible.”

brother’s keeper, Am I my A saying from the Bible’s story of Cain and Abel. After Cain had murdered his brother Abel, God asked him where his brother was. Cain answered, “I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?”

✥ Cain’s words have come to symbolize people’s unwillingness to accept responsibility for the welfare of their fellows — their “brothers” in the extended sense of the term. The tradition of Judaism and Christianity is that people do have this responsibility. (See Good Samaritan, Love thy neighbor as thyself, and Love your enemies.)

burning bush A bush described in the Book of Exodus; God revealed himself to Moses, telling him that he must go to the pharaoh to free the Israelites from slavery, and that Moses must also lead them to the Promised Land. This was a miraculous appearance of God, for “the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.” God told Moses, speaking out of the bush, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” When Moses asked God for his name, “God said unto Moses, ‘I Am That I Am.’”

Cain and Abel The first children of Adam and Eve, born after the Fall of Man. Once, when they were grown men, both Cain and Abel offered sacrifices to God. When Cain saw that Abel’s pleased God whereas his did not, Cain murdered his brother out of jealousy. For his crime, Cain was exiled by God to a life of wandering in a distant land.

✥ God “set a mark upon Cain” to protect him in his wanderings. The “mark of Cain” now refers to an individual’s or humankind’s sinful nature.

Calvary The hill near Jerusalem on which Jesus was crucified. The name is Latin for “Place of the Skull”; it is also called Golgotha. (See Crucifixion.)

Cast thy bread upon the waters An expression from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament: “Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.”

✥ This saying calls on people to believe that their good deeds will ultimately benefit them.

chapter and verse The means of locating passages in the Bible. Thus Matthew : means chapter , verse , of the Book of Matthew.

✥ In general use, giving “chapter and verse” means giving precise evidence for a proposition.

cherubim (chair-uh-bim, chair-yuh-bim) sing.   
cherub One of the groups of the angels.

✥ God is often described in the Old Testament as sitting on a throne supported by cherubim. ✥ In the art of the Renaissance, cherubim (or cherubs) are depicted as chubby babies with wings. Hence, a person with a chubby, childlike face may be called “cherubic.”

Chosen People A term applied to the Jews. According to the Old Testament, God chose the descendants of Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob — the ancestors of today’s Jews — as the people through whom he would reveal himself to the world. God therefore freed them from slavery in Egypt and led them into the Promised Land.

Christ A title for Jesus meaning “Messiah” or “anointed one.”

Christian A follower or disciple of Jesus; someone who believes Jesus is the Christ or Messiah. The New Testament mentions that the followers of Jesus were first called Christians within a few years after his death.

coat of many colors The special coat that Jacob gave to his son Joseph; the coat made his other sons jealous and resentful. (See Jacob and Esau and Joseph and his brothers.)

covenant Literally, a contract. In the Bible, an agreement between God and his people, in which God makes promises to his people and, usually, requires certain conduct from them. In the Old Testament, God made agreements with Noah, Abraham, and Moses. To Noah, he promised that he would never again destroy the Earth with a flood. He promised Abraham that he would become the ancestor of a great nation, provided Abraham went to the place God showed him and sealed the covenant by circumcision of all the males of the nation. To Moses, God said that the Israelites would reach the Promised Land but must obey the Mosaic law. In the New Testament, God promised salvation to those who believe in Jesus.

Creation God’s creation of the world as described in the Book of Genesis, commencing in this way: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, ‘Let there be light’: and there was light.” According to this account, the Creation took six days, with God creating Adam and Eve on the sixth day and resting on the seventh day. Genesis also gives another account of the Creation, in which God makes Adam out of clay, prepares the Garden of Eden for him, and then fashions Eve out of Adam’s rib.

crown of thorns A mock crown, made from thorn branches, that Roman soldiers put on the head of Jesus before the Crucifixion. The soldiers also “bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’”

$\clubsuit$ In common usage, a “crown of thorns” may be anything that causes intense suffering: “The jailed political leader bears her afflictions like a crown of thorns.” Similar to the expression “cross to bear.” (See Crucifixion.)

Crucifixion The death of Jesus on the cross. After he had been betrayed by Judas Iscariot and arrested, Jesus was condemned by his fellow Jews as a false Messiah and turned over to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to be crucified. Pilate found no reason to condemn Jesus; he tried to convince the people that it was absurd to regard Jesus as “King of the Jews” and offered to release him. But when the people insisted that Jesus be put to death, Pilate washed his hands to indicate that Jesus’ fate was no longer his responsibility and turned Jesus over to be crucified. Roman soldiers then placed a crown of thorns on the head of Jesus and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews.” He was made to carry a wooden cross up the hill of Calvary near Jerusalem, where he was nailed to the cross and was placed between two thieves, who were also crucified. Shortly before his death, he said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” After his death, the followers of Jesus placed his body in a tomb.

✥ Jesus had told his disciples that he would sacrifice his life so that believers’ sins might be forgiven. Christians believe that his death on the cross and his Resurrection three days later make salvation possi

# Crucifixion

ble. ✥ Having a “cross to bear” means any painful responsibility that is forced upon one. ✥ To “wash one’s hands of it” means to refuse to take responsibility for an action or event.

Damascus An ancient city in Syria (and still its capital today). The Apostle Paul, then an official called Saul, was on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus to arrest Christians. He underwent a dramatic conversion on the road, in which he fell from his horse, saw a dazzling light, and “heard a voice saying unto him, ‘Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? . . . I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.’”

✥ The “road to Damascus” is an image for a sudden turning point in a person’s life.

Daniel in the lions’ den During the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, in the sixth century b.c., the prophet Daniel continued to pray to his God against the express command of the king. As a result, Daniel was thrown into a lions’ den to be devoured. But God sent an angel to protect him, and he emerged miraculously unharmed the next day.

✥ Daniel’s situation is an image for an impossibly hostile environment.

David A great king of the Israelites in the Old Testament. David was a shepherd in his boyhood. As a youth, he asked for King Saul’s permission to fight Goliath, the giant Philistine warrior whom all the other Israelites were afraid to face. Despite his small size, David managed to kill Goliath by hitting him in the forehead with a stone flung from a sling. King Saul then gave David command of his army, but he grew jealous of him and tried to kill him; David spent many years fleeing from Saul. After Saul’s death, David was made king of the Israelites and served nobly, despite occasional lapses, such as an affair with Bathsheba; he had Bathsheba’s husband killed so that he could marry her. Many of the Psalms are attributed to David, who was famed as a harpist. His descendants, the House of David, included Solomon and the subsequent kings of Israel and Judah; according to the Gospels, Jesus was descended from David.

✥ A “David and Goliath” contest is an unequal one in which one side is far bigger or more numerous than the other.

dead bury their dead, Let the A reply of Jesus when a new disciple of his asked for time to bury his father. Jesus said, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.”

✥ The expression often connotes an impatience to move ahead, without pausing over details or ceremonies.

Dead Sea Scrolls A large collection of written scrolls, containing nearly all of the Old Testament, found in a cave near the Dead Sea in the late s. The scrolls were part of a library collected by the Essenes, a religious community of Jews that flourished for a few centuries around the time of Jesus. The scrolls are highly valued for the information they give about the Bible and about Judaism in the period.

disciples The followers of Jesus, who adhered to his teaching and transmitted it to others. The Twelve Apostles were the disciples closest to Jesus.

David. The hero, as Michelangelo envisioned him, moments before slaying Goliath.

✥ In general, a disciple is an active follower of a leader or movement, religious or otherwise.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you A command based on words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount: “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” The Mosaic law contains a parallel commandment: “Whatever is hurtful to you, do not do to any other person.”

✥ “Do unto others . . .” is a central ethical teaching of Jesus, often referred to as the Golden Rule.

Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return In the Book of Genesis, words that God spoke to Adam in casting him and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. In saying this, God reminded Adam that he had been made from “the dust of the ground” and confirmed that Adam and Eve had brought death upon themselves by disobeying him and eating the forbidden fruit. (See Fall of Man.)

Ecclesiastes (i-klee-zee-as-teez) A book in the Old Testament containing the reflections of a philosopher known as “the Preacher.” “Vanity of vanity saith the Preacher, . . . all is vanity,” where the word “vanity” indicates that striving is in vain, because death comes to all, and “there is no new thing under the sun.” He believes that our character and achievements do not affect our fate. “The race is not to the swift nor to the strong.” He concludes that one should enjoy the good things found in life until death brings oblivion. The argument and tone of this book are very unlike those of the other books of the Bible. (See nothing new under the sun, A time to be born and a time to die, and Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.)

Eden, Garden of The beautiful garden containing the tree of life, where God intended Adam and Eve to live in peaceful and contented innocence, effortlessly reaping the fruits of the Earth. The garden also contained the tree of knowledge of good and evil, from which Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat. When they disobeyed and ate the forbidden fruit, God drove them from the garden. Their sin and consequent loss of God’s grace and of their paradise is known as the Fall of Man.

✥ Figuratively, a “Garden of Eden” (sometimes simply “the Garden,” or “Eden”) is any state or place of complete peace and happiness.

Egypt An ancient empire in Africa that was centered on the Nile River. Ruled by a pharaoh, Egypt figures prominently in many events in the Bible, including the stories of Joseph and his brothers and of Moses and the Exodus. (See under “World Geography.” )

Elijah (i-leye-juh) A prophet of the Old Testament, who opposed the worship of idols and incurred the wrath of Jezebel, the queen of Israel, who tried to kill him. He was taken up to heaven in a chariot of fire.

Esther A book of the Old Testament that tells the story of a beautiful Jewish woman named Esther who is chosen by the king of Persia (now Iran; see Persian Empire) to be his queen. Esther, with the aid of her cousin Mordecai, stops a plot to massacre the Jews in Persia, and Mordecai becomes the king’s chief minister.

✥ This event is celebrated by Jews as the feast of Purim.

Eve In the Book of Genesis, the first woman. (See Adam and Eve and Creation.)

Exodus The second book of the Old Testament; it tells of the departure of the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, made possible by the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. Moses led them, and their destination was the Promised Land. God guided them by sending a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, to show them the way they should go. God also fed them with manna and gave them water out of a solid rock. Because of their frequent complaining and failure to trust him, however, God made them stay in the desert for forty years before entering the Promised Land. God gave them the Ten Commandments and the rest of the Mosaic law on Mount Sinai during the Exodus. Exodus is a Greek word meaning “departure.”

an eye for an eye The principle of justice that requires punishment equal in kind to the offense (not greater than the offense, as was frequently given in ancient times). Thus, if someone puts out another’s eye, one of the offender’s eyes should be put out. The principle is stated in the Book of Exodus as “Thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.”

✥ Jesus referred to this principle in the Sermon on the Mount, calling on his followers to turn the other cheek instead.

eye of a needle Part of a saying of Jesus: “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”

faith, hope, and charity The three great virtues that the New Testament calls for in Christians. Charity is often called love. According to the Apostle Paul, “Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.”

Fall of Man The disobedience of Adam and Eve and their consequent loss of God’s grace and the peace and happiness of the Garden of Eden. When they ate the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God punished them by driving them out of the garden and into the world, where they would be subject to sickness, pain, and eventual death. God told Eve that she would give birth in sorrow and pain; Adam’s curse was that he would have to work hard to earn his livelihood.

Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do A prayer that Jesus spoke on the cross, concerning those who put him to death. (See Crucifixion.)

fatted calf, kill the A phrase referring to a specially fed calf that was killed for the feast to celebrate the return of the Prodigal Son.

forbidden fruit The fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, often pictured as an apple, which God forbade Adam and Eve to eat. Their disobedience brought about the Fall of Man.

✥ “Forbidden fruit” is used commonly to refer to anything that is tempting but potentially dangerous. It is often associated with sexuality.

Four Horsemen Four figures in the Book of Revelation who symbolize the evils to come at the end of the world. The figure representing conquest rides a white horse; war, a red horse; famine, a black horse; and plague, a pale horse. They are often called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

fruits ye shall know them, By their A teaching of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount; it suggests that we are able to distinguish between false and genuine prophets by the things they do and say. In the same passage, Jesus calls false prophets wolves in sheep’s clothing.

Gabriel An angel in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim systems of belief. He is usually represented in the Bible as a messenger from God, bearing God’s word to the Israelites and appearing to Mary, the mother of Jesus, at the Annunciation. Gabriel also revealed the sacred laws of the Koran to Muhammad.

Genesis The first book of the Old Testament; its first words are “In the beginning” (genesis is a Greek word for “beginning”). It covers the time from the beginning of the world through the days of the patriarchs, including the stories of the Creation, Adam and Eve, the Fall of Man, Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood, God’s covenant with Abraham,

Abraham and Isaac, Jacob and Esau, and Joseph and his brothers.

Gentile Someone who is not a Jew. “The nations” is the common expression in the Old Testament for non-Jews as a group, and a Gentile is a person belong ing to “the nations.”

✥ Both the Old Testament and the New Testament tell of numerous conflicts between Jews and Gentiles. Figuratively, a “gentile” is any nonbeliever.

Get thee behind me, Satan The reply of Jesus when Satan offered him all the kingdoms of the world if Jesus would worship him. Jesus spoke these words on another occasion. He told his disciples that he would have to be killed and then raised from the dead, and Peter objected that this should not happen. Jesus saw Peter as a tempter, trying to talk him out of doing what he was put on Earth to do. He then spoke the same words, “Get thee behind me, Satan,” to Peter.

golden calf An idol that the Israelites made during the Exodus. While God was giving Moses the Ten Commandments and other provisions of the Mosaic law on Mount Sinai, the people whom Moses was leading to the Promised Land melted down their gold jewelry and ornaments and built a golden calf, which they began to worship. Moses came down from the mountain carrying two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written; when he saw the calf, he smashed the tablets and made the people destroy the idol.

✥ By extension, a “golden calf ” is any false god or anything worshiped undeservedly.

Golgotha (gol-guh-thuh, gol-goth-uh) The ancient name for Calvary.

Good Samaritan (suh-mar-uh-tuhn) In one of the parables of Jesus, the only one of several passersby to come to the aid of a Jew who had been robbed, beaten, and left to die on the roadside. The kindness of the Samaritan was particularly admirable because Jews and Samaritans (i.e., people of Samaria) were generally enemies. Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan to answer a man who had asked him, “Who is my neighbor?” He forced his questioner to admit that the Samaritan was the true neighbor of the man who had been robbed.

$\clubsuit$ Figuratively, “Good Samaritans” are persons who go out of their way to perform acts of kindness to others, especially strangers.

Good Shepherd. A fifth-century mosaic depicting Christ as the Good Shepherd.

Good Shepherd A title of Jesus, based on a passage in the Gospel of John, where he says, “I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep,” and “I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.” The metaphor of God as a shepherd is also found in the Old Testament. The Twenty-third Psalm begins, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want,” and a passage in the Book of Isaiah says that God “shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm.”

✥ The use of the title “pastor” (shepherd) for certain Christian clergymen carries on the idea.

gospel The “good news” of salvation (see Gospels). Certain styles of religious music are also called “gospel.” (See spirituals.)

Gospels The first four books of the New Testament, which tell the life story of Jesus and explain the significance of his message. Gospel means “good news” in this case, the news of the salvation made possible by the death and Resurrection of Jesus. The four Gospels are attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

✥ Figuratively, anything that is emphatically true is called the “gospel truth.”

Ham One of the three sons of Noah. According to the biblical account, Noah and his family were the only human survivors of the great Flood and were therefore the progenitors of all the peoples on Earth.

✥ Egypt was traditionally called “the Land of Ham,” and Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the Egyptians and of all African peoples south of Egypt. $\clubsuit$ The “curse of $\operatorname { H a m } ^ { \mathfrak { N } }$ refers to the biblical story in which Ham, seeing his father drunk and naked, refused to turn away as his two brothers did. When Noah awoke, he cursed Ham and his son Canaan, supposedly causing a darker pigmentation in their descendants. This so-called curse has often been wrongly used to justify racism.

the handwriting on the wall A phrase recalling an Old Testament story about Daniel. While a king was holding the Jews captive in the foreign land of Babylon, in the sixth century b.c., a mysterious hand appeared, writing on the wall of the king’s palace. The king called upon Daniel, who interpreted it to mean that God intended the king and his kingdom to fall. The king was slain that night.

✥ Figuratively, the expression means that some misfortune is impending: “His firing came as no surprise; he’d seen the handwriting on the wall months before.”

✥ Abraham was prepared to sacrifice Isaac at God’s request. (See Abraham and Isaac.)

Isaiah (eye-zay-uh) A major Israelite prophet who foretold the coming of the Messiah; the Book of Isaiah in the Old Testament is attributed to him. In the New Testament, his prophecies are treated as predictions of many of the details of the life and death of Jesus. (See Good Shepherd.)

Israelites The descendants of Jacob, who made up twelve tribes, including the tribes of Judah, Levi, Reuben, and Benjamin.

Jacob and Esau (ee-saw) The sons of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham. As the eldest son of Isaac, Esau should have inherited the covenant with God that Abraham had passed on to Isaac. But Esau traded his birthright (inheritance) to his younger brother, Jacob, for a “mess of pottage” (a meal of stew) when he was too hungry to consider what he was throwing away. Jacob also cheated Esau out of their blind father’s deathbed blessing by impersonating him, a deceit prompted by their mother, Rebecca. The feud between the brothers ended many years later in a joyful reconciliation. The night before his reunion with Esau, Jacob wrestled with God and forced God to bless him. God gave Jacob the new name of Israel, meaning “one who has been strong against God.” (See Jacob’s ladder.)

Jacob’s ladder A ladder that Jacob saw in a dream. After he had obtained his brother Esau’s birthright and received his father’s blessing, he had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending a ladder that extended from Earth to heaven. God, who stood at the top of the ladder, promised to bless Jacob and his offspring and to bring his descendants into the Promised Land. (See Jacob and Esau.)

Jehovah Another name for God; an approximation of the holiest name of God in Hebrew (the name was held so sacred that it was never written or spoken, and scholars are not sure exactly how it should be pronounced). It means “I am that ${ \mathrm { I } } { \mathrm { a m } } , { \mathrm { \Omega } } ^ { \mathrm { \ v } }$ or $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ am the one who is.” In the incident of the burning bush in the Book of Exodus, God, speaking out of the bush, tells Moses that this is his name.

Jesus A prophet of the first century of our era; to Christians, Jesus Christ, the son of God, a person who was both God and man, the Messiah sent by God to save the human race from the sin it inherited through the Fall of Man.

The story of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem is called the Nativity. He was conceived by the Virgin Mary (see Mary, the mother of Jesus) through the power of the Holy Spirit of God, laid in a manger after his birth in Bethlehem, and raised by Mary and her husband, Joseph (see Joseph, the husband of Mary), in Nazareth. As a boy of twelve, he went to the Temple in Jerusalem, where he astonished the teachers of the Mosaic law with his knowledge. As a man, he chose the Twelve Apostles, with whom he traveled throughout his native Palestine teaching the word of God (see Sermon on the Mount), healing the sick, and performing miracles (see loaves and fishes). He attracted many followers and also made many enemies for claiming to be the Messiah and for failing to observe all Jewish laws. He was eventually betrayed by Judas Iscariot, condemned by Pontius Pilate, and crucified by the Roman authorities who ruled his country. Christians believe that he rose again from the dead and that his Resurrection makes salvation possible. Christians also expect a Second Coming of Jesus. (See Crucifixion, gospel, and Gospels.)

Jews The Israelites, particularly after their return from captivity in Babylon about five hundred years before the birth of Jesus; at that time, the Israelites were established as a religious group, founded on the Mosaic law, not simply a national group.

✥ When the Jewish nation was destroyed by the Romans in the year a.d.  and the Jews were scattered throughout the world, their religious beliefs and customs allowed them to remain one people.

Jezebel (jez-uh-bel) In the Old Testament, an immoral, cruel queen of Israel who attempted to kill Elijah and other prophets of God.

✥ A “jezebel” is a scheming and shamelessly evil woman.

Job (johb) In the Old Testament, a man whose faith was severely tested by Satan, with God’s permission. Job was the most prosperous and happy of men, who faithfully praised God for God’s goodness. In order to get him to curse God, Satan destroyed all that Job owned, killed his children, and struck Job himself with vile sores from head to foot. False friends of Job’s suggested that he should abandon his beliefs (see Job’s comforters). But even in absolute misery, Job would not curse God, saying instead, “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord.” As a reward for his steadfast faith, God healed Job and “gave him twice as much as he had before.”

✥ Figuratively, any long-suffering person can be said to be “as patient as Job.”

Job’s comforters Three friends of Job who visited him in his affliction and offered him a way of making sense of his troubles: namely, that he was getting what he deserved. Job’s friends maintained that misfortunes were sent by God as punishments for sin, and thus despite Job’s apparent goodness, he must really be a terrible sinner. Job persistently disputed them, saying that God is supreme and mysterious — that God can send misfortunes to both good and wicked people and may not be second-guessed.

✥ A “Job’s comforter” is someone who apparently offers consolation to another person but actually makes the other person feel worse.

John the Baptist A hermit and preacher among the Jews of the time of Jesus and a relative of Jesus. According to the Gospels, John declared, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord.’” Christians interpret this to mean that John was sent to prepare for the coming of the Messiah. John was known as “the Baptist” because he called on his followers to go through a ceremony of baptism to demonstrate their repentance for their sins; Jesus began his public life by submitting himself to John’s baptism.

John was eventually imprisoned by Herod Antipas, the ruler of the province of Galilee, for objecting to Herod’s illicit marriage. At a banquet, Herod rashly promised his stepdaughter, Salome, anything she asked; she asked for the head of John on a platter.

John the Baptist. A painting entitled Baptism of Christ, by Andreas del Verrocchio.

Herod, not wanting to go back on his promise, had John beheaded.

John, the Gospel According to The last of the four Gospels in the New Testament; it is markedly different from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Many of the most famous events in the life of Jesus — including the Sermon on the Mount and the sharing of the bread and cup at the Last Supper — are not mentioned in the Gospel of John, which concentrates instead on the deepest implications of Jesus’ mission. John’s Gospel opens, “In the beginning was the Word.”

Jonah and the whale A story in the Old Testament; Jonah was an Israelite whom God had called to be a prophet but who refused to accept his divine mission and left on a sea voyage instead. God then raised a great storm as a sign of his anger with Jonah. The sailors, realizing that Jonah’s disobedience had caused the storm, threw him overboard in an attempt to save their ship. Jonah was saved from drowning when he was swallowed by a “great fish.” He lived for three days inside the creature, after which the fish “vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.” Thankful that his life had been spared, Jonah took up his prophetic mission.

Jordan River A river in Palestine that empties into the Dead Sea. John the Baptist baptized Jesus in the Jordan.

Joseph and his brothers The sons of Jacob. According to the Book of Genesis, Joseph was Jacob’s favorite son. To show his love for Joseph, Jacob gave him a coat of many colors, a splendid garment that aroused the jealousy of Joseph’s brothers, who began to plot against him. The brothers sold Joseph into slavery in Egypt and pretended that he had been killed by a wild beast. Years later, the Egyptian pharaoh called on Joseph to interpret his troubling dreams. The pharaoh rewarded Joseph’s skill in interpreting his dreams by making him second in command over the kingdom. Later, when the land of the Hebrews was beset by famine, Jacob was forced to send Joseph’s brothers into Egypt to buy grain. The official with whom they had to deal turned out to be Joseph himself. When he discovered that his brothers were truly sorry for their treachery, he forgave them.

Joseph, the husband of Mary In Christian belief, the foster father of Jesus, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit without a human father. According to the Gospels, Joseph, the husband of Mary, was a carpenter; people occasionally called Jesus “the carpenter’s son.” Jesus apparently learned that trade at Joseph’s side.

Joshua In the Old Testament, the leader who brought the Israelites into the Promised Land after the death of Moses. Joshua is best known for his destruction of the city of Jericho. When Joshua was besieging the city, God instructed him to have his priests blow their trumpets and all his troops give a great shout. At the sound of the shout, the walls of the city collapsed, and Joshua’s troops rushed in. (See “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.”)

Judas Iscariot (jooh-duhs i-skar-ee-uht) The Apostle who betrayed Jesus to the authorities for thirty pieces of silver. When soldiers came to arrest Jesus, Judas identified their victim by kissing him. The next day, driven by guilt, Judas hanged himself.

✥ Figuratively, a “Judas” is a betrayer, especially one who betrays a friend. ✥ A “Judas kiss” is an act of seeming friendship that conceals some treachery.

Judgment Day In the New Testament, the day at the end of time. According to the Gospels and the Book of Revelation, on this day the Earth and the sky will be in an uproar, the dead will rise from their graves, and Jesus will return to judge all the living and the dead. In judging their conduct, he will consider the deeds people do to each other, both good and bad, as if they had been done to him. (See Second Coming.)

land flowing with milk and honey In the Old Testament, a poetic name for the Promised Land.

$\clubsuit$ Figuratively, a “land of milk and honey” is any place of great abundance.

The last shall be first A saying of Jesus; in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus declares that in the world to come, “The last shall be first and the first last.”

$\clubsuit$ The teaching implies that those who have prospered through wickedness will fail, whereas the good who have suffered for the sake of God will win salvation.

The Last Supper The traditional Passover meal that Jesus ate with the Apostles the night before his death. At this supper, according to the Gospels, Jesus blessed bread and broke it, telling the disciples, “Take, eat; this is my body.” He then passed a cup of wine to them, saying, “This is my blood.” Jesus’ words refer to the Crucifixion he was about to suffer in order to atone for humankind’s sins. He told the Apostles, “Do this in remembrance of me.”

✥ The actions of Jesus at the Last Supper are the basis for the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion, or the Eucharist, in which the faithful partake of bread and wine. ✥ The Last Supper is the subject of a famous fresco by Leonardo da Vinci, which depicts Jesus Christ and his Apostles seated along one side of a long table.

Lazarus (laz-uhr-uhs) A man brought back to life by Jesus after being in the tomb for four days. The incident is recorded in the Gospel of John. The raising of Lazarus is considered the crowning miracle or sign revealing Jesus as the giver of life. It also is the act that caused the enemies of Jesus to begin the plan to put Jesus to death. (See Crucifixion.)

✥ Someone who makes a comeback from obscurity is sometimes called a “Lazarus rising from the dead.”

The Last Supper. Leonardo da Vinci’s famous fresco, in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan.

# Let him who is without sin cast the first stone

According to the Gospel of John, the Pharisees, in an attempt to discredit Jesus, brought a woman charged with adultery before him. Then they reminded Jesus that adultery was punishable by stoning under Mosaic law and challenged him to judge the woman so that they might then accuse him of disobeying the law. Jesus thought for a moment and then replied, $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { H e }$ that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.” The people crowded around him were so touched by their own consciences that they departed. When Jesus found himself alone with the woman, he asked her who were her accusers. She replied, “No man, lord.” Jesus then said, “Neither do I condemn thee: go and sin no more.”

Let there be light The words with which, according to the Book of Genesis, God called light into being on the first day of Creation. (See In the beginning.)

Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.”

loaves and fishes A miracle that Jesus performed; the Gospels record several instances of this miracle, with small differences in details. In the best known, Jesus was preaching to a crowd of thousands who grew hungry and needed to be fed, but only five loaves and two fishes could be found. He blessed the food and then commanded his disciples to distribute it among the people. After everyone had eaten and was satisfied, twelve baskets of food remained.

Lord’s Prayer The prayer Jesus taught his followers in the Sermon on the Mount: “Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done, in Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” Some versions of the Bible add words of praise at the end: “For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.”

✥ The same prayer, with slight variations, is still taught and recited in almost all Christian churches.

Lost Tribes of Israel Ten tribes that were relocated to Assyria after the conquest of Israel in  b.c. Although their ultimate fate is unknown, the tribes have been identified with various peoples of Arabia and other areas of the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Japan, and England.

✥ The expression is frequently used to point out that worldly goods are not enough for most people; they need spiritual fulfillment as well.

manna from heaven Food that God gave miraculously to the Israelites in the Exodus, after the food they had brought with them out of Egypt had run out. In the Book of Exodus, the Israelites found it one morning after the dew had evaporated: “Upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.”

Moses. Moses receiving the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments.

Moses The great leader, lawgiver, and prophet of the ancient Israelites (Hebrews). According to the Old Testament, Moses was born in Egypt, where the Hebrews were living as slaves. When Moses was an infant, the Egyptian ruler, or pharaoh, ordered all the male children of the Hebrews slain. Moses’ mother placed him in a small boat made of bulrushes and hid him in a marsh, where he was found by the daughter of the pharaoh, who adopted him.

When Moses was a grown man, he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew and had to flee Egypt to escape punishment. One day, while Moses was living in exile, God spoke to him from a burning bush, commanding him to return to Egypt and bring the Hebrews out of bondage. Moses went back to Egypt and told the pharaoh of God’s command; when the pharaoh refused to release the Hebrews from slavery, God sent the plagues of Egypt to afflict the Egyptians. The pharaoh finally relented, and Moses led his people out of Egypt across the Red Sea, on the journey that became known as the Exodus. Shortly afterward, Moses received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai. Moses and his people wandered in the wilderness for forty years; then, just as they came within sight of the Promised Land, Moses died.

Words beginning the Twenty-second Psalm. According to the Gospels, Jesus spoke these words during the Crucifixion, after he had suffered on the cross for three hours.

Nativity The birth of Jesus, described in two of the Gospels (Matthew and Luke). When Jesus’ parents, Mary and Joseph, traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem to be counted in a government census, they found that there was no room for them in the local inn. Mary gave birth to Jesus in a common stable and laid him in a manger (a feeding trough for livestock). Christians believe that Jesus’ birth fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies and was attended by miraculous events, such as a star above Bethlehem that drew local shepherds as well as the Wise Men, or Magi, from a distant land.

✥ The Nativity is celebrated at Christmas. We date our present historical era from the birth of Jesus, referring to the years before his birth as b.c. (before Christ) and the years after his birth as a.d. (anno Domini, a Latin phrase meaning “in the year of the Lord”).

Noah and the Flood The account in the Book of Genesis of how, several generations after the life of Adam, the wickedness of people made God regret that he had created them and made him resolve to send a flood that would destroy all the living creatures in the world. God decided to spare Noah and his family, who lived virtuously, and to allow them to repopulate the Earth. God commanded Noah to build an ark (a large, rudderless ship) and to take his wife, three sons, and three daughters-in-law into it, along with a pair of each of the Earth’s animals. When Noah had done so, God sent forty days and forty nights of rain, until the entire globe was flooded and all living creatures were drowned. When the rain ended, Noah released a dove from the ark. When it returned with an olive branch in its beak, Noah knew that the waters had receded and that he and his family could begin a new life. After the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, and Noah and the other people and animals left it, God set a rainbow in the heavens as a sign that he would never again destroy the world by flood.

nothing new under the sun A phrase adapted from the Book of Ecclesiastes; the author complains fre

Noah and the Flood. Noah, his family, and pairs of animals leaving the Ark after the flood.

festival kept afterward in memory of the event. Through Moses, God told the Israelites to prepare a special meal to be eaten in haste the evening before their escape from Egypt (see Exodus), with a whole roasted lamb as the main dish. The blood from the lamb was to be used to mark the Israelites’ houses. That night, God would send the angel of Death to kill the firstborn males of the Egyptians (this was the worst of the plagues of Egypt), but God would see the blood on the Israelites’ houses, and he would command his angel to “pass over” — to kill no one there. God told Moses that the Israelites were to repeat the meal each spring on the anniversary of their departure from Egypt. The Jews keep the festival of Passover to this day.

✥ The Last Supper of Jesus and his Apostles was a Passover meal. The Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus were explained by the Apostles as the new Passover of the New Testament.

patriarchs In the Old Testament, the “founding fathers” of the Israelites: Abraham and Isaac, Jacob, and the sons of Jacob. (See Joseph and his brothers.)

Paul Ancient Christian preacher and teacher; along with the Apostle Peter, one of the foremost leaders of the early Christian Church. Paul, originally called Saul, was at first an enemy and persecutor of the early Christians. As he rode to Damascus one day, seeking to suppress the Christians there, a strong light from heaven blinded him, and God spoke to him; after this experience, Saul became a Christian. Going by the Greek name Paul, he spent the rest of his life bringing the gospel to the peoples of the ancient world. The New Testament includes his many epistles (letters) to the early Christian communities.

pearl of great price A phrase from one of the parables of Jesus; he compares the journey to heaven to a search for fine pearls conducted by a merchant, “who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.”

✥ The expression has come to mean anything that is very valuable. For example, Hester Prynne, in The Scarlet Letter, who gave birth to a daughter following an act of adultery that destroyed her honor, named the child Pearl, because she had given up all that she had in bearing the child.

pearls before swine, Cast not An adaptation of a saying of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount. The entire passage reads, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.”

✥ The meaning of the passage is disputed, but seems generally to be that the followers of Jesus should pass his message on to those most likely to accept it. ✥ Generally, to “cast pearls before swine” is to share something of value with those who will not appreciate it.

Pentecost In the New Testament, the day that the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples of Jesus. Pentecost is the Greek name for Shavuot, the spring harvest festival of the Israelites, which was going on when the Holy Spirit came. The disciples were together in Jerusalem after Jesus’ Resurrection and return to heaven, fearful because he had left them. On that morning, however, “there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.” Because of the festival, crowds of visitors were in Jerusalem, speaking many languages, but the disciples of Jesus moved among them and spoke to them all, and “every man heard them speak in his own language” about “the wonderful works of God.” Peter then made a powerful speech to the crowds in the city, and many were baptized as new followers of Jesus.

Peter Chief among the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, he was a fisherman, originally named Simon (and often called Simon Peter). Jesus gave him the name Rock, of which “Peter” is a translation. Peter showed great faith but also exhibited great failings (see Get thee behind me, Satan). In the frightening hours before the Crucifixion, Peter three times denied being a follower of Jesus, just as Jesus had predicted he would. Nevertheless, Peter went on to become the leader of the early Christians (see Pentecost), thus fulfilling another prophecy of Jesus, who had said of Peter, “Upon this rock I will build my church. . . . And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.”

✥ Peter is often depicted holding keys. Roman Catholics maintain a number of traditions about Peter: that he was the first of the popes, for example, and that he was martyred at Rome by being crucified upside down, because he refused to be crucified as

Peter. A detail from Perugino’s fresco Christ Delivering the Keys of the Kingdom to Saint Peter. Found in the Sistine Chapel, Vatican City.

Jesus had been. ✥ The great church of the Vatican, Saint Peter’s Basilica, was later built on what was believed to be the site of his burial.

pharaoh (fair-oh, fay-roh) The title of the kings of ancient Egypt. In the story of Joseph and his brothers, a pharaoh puts Joseph in charge of his entire kingdom. In the Book of Exodus, a pharaoh repeatedly refuses the request of Moses to let the Israelites leave the country and does not give in until after the worst of the ten plagues of Egypt.

Pharisees (far-uh-seez) A group of teachers among the Jews at the time of Jesus; he frequently rebukes them in the Gospels for their hypocrisy. Jesus says they are like “the blind leading the blind,” or like “whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.”

Philistines (fil-uh-steenz, fi-lis-tinz, fi-lis-teenz) In the Old Testament, enemies of the Israelites in their settlement in the Promised Land. (See David and Samson.)

✥ A “philistine” has come to mean a person who is ignorant and uncultured.

Physician, heal thyself A biblical proverb meaning that people should take care of their own defects and not just correct the faults of others. According to the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, Jesus said he expected to hear this proverb from the people of his hometown of Nazareth, because they would want him to work miracles there, as he had in other towns nearby. But he “did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.”

Pilate, Pontius (pon-shus peye-luht) The governor of the Jews at the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus; he was an official of the Roman Empire, to which the Jewish nation belonged at that time. According to the Gospels, Pilate did not consider Jesus guilty and wanted to release him. Under pressure from the crowds in Jerusalem, however, Pilate sentenced Jesus to death on the cross, having first washed his hands to indicate his lack of responsibility for Jesus’ fate.

plagues of Egypt The traditional name for the set of disasters that God inflicted on Egypt before the pharaoh let Moses lead the Israelites out of Egypt to the Promised Land. The plagues, as recorded in the Book of Exodus, included swarms of locusts, hordes of frogs, and a scourge of boils. After the tenth and most horrible plague, in which the angel of Death killed every Egyptian firstborn male child, including the pharaoh’s son, the pharaoh finally freed the Israelites. (See Passover.)

Prodigal Son A character in a parable Jesus told to illustrate how generous God is in forgiving sinners who repent. The Prodigal Son was a young man who asked his father for his inheritance and then left home for “a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.” As his money ran out, a famine occurred, and he went to work tending pigs, but even then he could not get enough to eat. He returned home, knowing that he had given up his right to be treated as his father’s son, but hoping that his father would accept him as a hired servant on the farm. Seeing the Prodigal Son coming from a distance, the father rejoiced and ordered the fatted calf to be slaughtered for a feast to celebrate the son’s return.

The Prodigal Son’s elder brother returned from the fields while the feast was going on and was angry. He complained that he had never been treated to such a feast, though he had remained and worked diligently for his father while the Prodigal Son was away. The father reassured him, saying that the elder son would still get his inheritance, but it was right to celebrate the return of the Prodigal Son: “For this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.”

Promised Land The land that God promised he would give to the descendants of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob; the land flowing with milk and honey; the land of Canaan, or Palestine. The Israelites did not take it over until after the Exodus, when they conquered the people already living there.

✥ By extension, an idyllic place or state of being that a person hopes to reach, especially one that cannot be reached except by patience and determination, is called a “Promised Land.”

prophet Someone who brings a message from God to people. The best-known prophets are those of the Old Testament. Their most frequent themes were true worship of God, upright living, and the coming of the Messiah. They often met with bitter resistance when they spoke against the idol worship and immorality of their people. Among the prophets of the Old Testament were Daniel, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, and Moses.

Prophets also appear in the New Testament. Jesus called John the Baptist a prophet; Christians consider him a bridge between the prophets of the Old Testament and those of the New Testament. Jesus mentions “true prophets” and “false prophets” — those who present the true message of God and those who present a counterfeit (see By their fruits ye shall know them and wolves in sheep’s clothing). He himself was considered a prophet in his lifetime (see A prophet is not without honor save in his own country) and is still widely revered by non-Christians as a prophet, though not as the Messiah. The New Testament also mentions that some of the early Christians were prophets who spoke inspired messages to their communities.

✥ In general usage, a “prophet” is someone who can foretell the future. The prophets of the Bible often made predictions, which confirmed their authority when the predictions came true, but changing the lives of their people was a more central part of their mission.

A prophet is not without honor save in his own country Words spoken by Jesus to the people of Nazareth, the town where he grew up. They refused to believe in his teaching because they considered him one of themselves and therefore without authority to preach to them.

✥ The expression is now used of anyone whose talents and accomplishments are highly regarded by everyone except those at home.

Psalms, Book of An Old Testament book containing  prayerful songs and songs of praise, many of them ascribed to David. (See Twenty-third Psalm.)

Rachel The second wife of Jacob (see Jacob and Esau). She was sterile for many years, but eventually had two sons: Joseph (see Joseph and his brothers) and Benjamin.

Red Sea, parting of the An action of God at the time of the Exodus that rescued the Israelites from the pursuing forces of Egypt. According to the Book of Exodus, God divided the waters so that they could walk across the dry seabed. Once they were safely across, God closed the passage and drowned the Egyptians. Most scholars agree that the “Red Sea” spoken of in this account is not the deep-water Red Sea of today, but the marshy Sea of Reeds farther north, and that the opening and closing of the seabed took place through violent storms, as mentioned in the Book of Exodus.

Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s The response of Jesus when his enemies tried to trap him by asking whether it was right for the Jews, whose nation had been taken over by the Roman Empire, to pay tribute to the Roman emperor. He took a Roman coin that would be used to pay the tribute and asked whose picture was on it; his questioners answered, “Caesar’s.” The reply of Jesus implied that in using Roman coins, the Jews accepted the rule of the Romans, and so the Roman government had the right to tax them, as long as the Jews were not compromising their religious duties. Jesus’ more general point was, “Give to worldly authorities the things that belong to them, and to God what belongs to God.”

Resurrection The rising of Jesus from the tomb after his death; a central and distinctive belief of the Christian faith. The Gospels state that after Jesus was crucified and lay in a tomb between Friday evening and Sunday morning, he rose, in body as well as in spirit, and appeared alive to his followers. His resurrection is the basis for the Christian belief that not only Jesus but all Christians will triumph over death. Christians celebrate the Resurrection on Easter Sunday.

Revelation, Book of The last book of the New Testament, also called the Apocalypse. In this book, traditionally attributed to the Apostle John, the violent end of the world is foretold, and the truth of the last days is disclosed, or “revealed.” It describes Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, Judgment Day, and “a new heaven and a new Earth” that will be revealed at the end of time.

Ruth The great-grandmother of King David, known for her kindness and faithfulness. Not an Israelite herself, she married an Israelite who had come to her country with his family. Ruth’s husband died, and her mother-in-law, Naomi, set out to return to the country of the Israelites. Ruth insisted on accompanying Naomi, saying, “Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge.” In the country of the Israelites, Ruth married Boaz, a rich relative of her dead husband; Boaz had been attracted to Ruth by her generosity. Her story is told in the Book of Ruth in the Old Testament.

Sabbath The holy day of rest and reflection observed each Saturday among the Jews. This custom fulfills the third of the Ten Commandments (“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy”). The Sabbath commemorates the last of the seven days of Creation as described in the Book of Genesis, the day God rested from his labors of creating the heavens and the Earth.

✥ Christians have traditionally kept Sunday as a weekly day of rest in adaptation of the Jewish observance, and in commemoration of the Resurrection of Jesus. Some denominations, such as the SeventhDay Adventists, observe Saturday as the Sabbath.

Salome (suh-loh-mee, sal-uh-may) According to nonbiblical historians, the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, who arranged for the beheading of John the Baptist. Her name is not given in the Gospels.

salt of the Earth, Ye are the Words of Jesus to his disciples in the Sermon on the Mount. He continues, “If the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?” Jesus implies that if his followers lose their dedication to the Gospel, no one else can give it to them.

✥ In popular usage, “salt of the Earth” means a person of admirable character.

salvation Being “saved” among Christians; salvation is freedom from the effects of the Fall of Man. This freedom comes through faith in Jesus, who is called in the New Testament “the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” The Apostles taught that those who experience salvation in their lifetime on Earth and continue in their friendship with God will inherit eternal happiness in heaven.

Samson In the Old Testament, an Israelite servant of God who pitted his invincible strength and his wits against the Philistines on many occasions. He was eventually betrayed by his lover, the beautiful Delilah, who tricked Samson into telling her that the secret of his strength lay in his uncut hair. Delilah cut Samson’s hair while he slept, and then called for the Philistines, who captured and blinded him. During his captivity, Samson’s hair grew back, and he eventually pulled the Philistines’ banquet hall down on their heads.

Satan The devil. In the Bible, Satan is identified with the tempter who encourages the fall of Adam and Eve; he is the accuser who torments Job in the hope that he will curse God; the one who offers Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if Jesus will worship him (see Get thee behind me, Satan); and the evil one who puts betrayal in the heart of Judas. Satan will one day be confined in hell, but until then he is free to roam the Earth.

✥ Satan is the power of darkness opposed to the light of Christ; he is thus sometimes referred to as the Prince of Darkness. ✥ Satan has been depicted in many ways: as a man with horns, goat hooves, a pointed tail, a pointed beard, and a pitchfork; as a dragon; and sometimes as an angel with large batlike wings.

Saul The first king of Israel, who battled repeatedly with the Philistines. He often felt great despair, which was soothed by David playing his harp. Saul later became jealous of David and tried to have him killed in battle. After a prophesied defeat by the Philistines, Saul killed himself.

✥ Saul was also the Apostle Paul’s original name.

Second Coming The return of Jesus, prophesied in the New Testament, to judge the living and the dead and bring about the final triumph of good over evil. The writings of the Apostles in the New Testament express the belief that the Second Coming will happen soon and suggest that it may happen within a generation of their own time. (See Judgment Day.)

✥ Several Christian denominations, such as the Seventh-Day Adventists and the Jehovah’s Witnesses, are founded on a similar belief about the imminence of Jesus’ return.

Sermon on the Mount In the Gospel of Matthew, the first sermon of Jesus. It is a central expression of his teachings regarding the new age he has come to proclaim. Jesus tells his followers that he expects them to be even more generous than the Mosaic law requires: “Be ye perfect,” he says, “even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”

The Sermon on the Mount begins with the Beatitudes. It also contains the Lord’s Prayer; the Golden Rule (“Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them”); the commandments to turn the other cheek, go the extra mile, and cast not pearls before swine; the image of false prophets as wolves in sheep’s clothing; and many other well-known teachings, including: “Ye are the salt of the Earth,” “Love your enemies,” “Consider the lilies of the field,” “Judge not, that ye be not judged,” “Ask, and it shall be given you,” and “By their fruits ye shall know them.”

serpent The creature in the Book of Genesis that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, thus committing the first act of the Fall of Man. In the New Testament, the serpent of Genesis is identified with Satan.

Sheba, Queen of (shee-buh) A queen in biblical times who was famous for her beauty, splendor, and wealth. She traveled from afar to visit King Solomon.

shibboleth (shib-uh-luhth, shib-uh-leth) In the Old Testament, shibboleth was a password used by the Israelites. It was chosen because their enemies could not pronounce it.

✥ By extension, a shibboleth is an often-repeated slogan. It also means an arbitrary test to prove membership in a group.

Sinai, Mount (seye-neye) In the Book of Exodus, the mountain that Moses ascended to receive the tablets of the law (the Ten Commandments) from God. God shrouded the mountain in a cloud, and made thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts come forth from it. The Israelites were commanded to stay away from it while Moses went into God’s presence.

Sodom and Gomorrah (sod-uhm; guh-mawr-uh) In the Book of Genesis, the two evil cities that God destroyed with a rain of fire and brimstone (sulfur). Before the destruction, God sent two angels in the form of men to advise all good men to leave the evil towns. God’s messengers found only one good man, Lot, whom they transported from Sodom to the countryside with his wife and daughters, warning them not to look back. When Lot’s wife, not heeding the warning, looked back, she became a pillar of salt.

✥ sodomy was supposedly practiced in the wicked city of Sodom.

Solomon In the Old Testament, a Hebrew king, son and successor of David. The “wisdom of Solomon” is proverbial. Solomon is also known for his many wives, for his splendor and wealth, and for building the Temple at Jerusalem.

Song of Solomon A collection of poems or fragments about sexual love and courtship, attributed to Solomon. In Christianity, these poems have been interpreted as allegories of God’s love for Israel, the love of Jesus for his people, and so on.

Song of Songs Another name for the Song of Solomon.

Temple The central place of worship for the Israelites. The first Temple was built in Jerusalem by King Solomon. The stone tablets received by Moses on Mount Sinai — tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written — were kept in the central chamber of Solomon’s Temple. Solomon’s Temple was later destroyed, as were two succeeding temples built on the site.

✥ A wall remaining from the temples, known as the Western Wall, is one of the most sacred places for Jews today.

Ten Commandments The commandments engraved on stone tablets and given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai. These commandments are the heart of the divine law in the Old Testament. The usual enumeration is: (I) I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before me. (II) Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. (III) Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. (IV) Honor thy father and thy mother. (V) Thou shalt not kill. (VI) Thou shalt not commit adultery. (VII) Thou shalt not steal. (VIII) Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. (IX) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house. (X) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.

thief in the night, like a According to the epistle to the Thessalonians in the New Testament, the “day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.”

✥ By extension, “like a thief in the night” means to appear or arrive swiftly and stealthily: “This disease is like a thief in the night, stealing the thoughts and dreams of the elderly.”

thirty pieces of silver The money Judas Iscariot received for betraying Jesus to the authorities. He later threw the money into the Temple of Jerusalem, and the chief priests bought the “potter’s field” with it, to be used as a cemetery for foreigners.

✥ This money is referred to as “blood money” — money received for the life of another human being. ✥ “Thirty pieces of silver” is also used proverbially to refer to anything paid or given for a treacherous act.

Thomas, the doubting apostle An Apostle who first doubted the Resurrection of Jesus and then believed. He was not present when Jesus appeared alive to his disciples the evening after his Resurrection. Thomas rejected their story and insisted that he would not believe until he had seen Jesus with his own eyes and touched Jesus’ wounds with his own hands. A week later, Jesus appeared again when Thomas was with the group; he invited Thomas to touch his wounds and believe. Thomas then confessed his faith, saying, “My Lord and my God.” Jesus replied, “Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”

✥ A “doubting Thomas” is someone who demands evidence to be convinced of anything, especially when this demand is out of place.

through a glass darkly To see “through a glass” — a mirror — “darkly” is to have an obscure or imperfect vision of reality. The expression comes from the writings of the Apostle Paul; he explains that we do not now see clearly, but at the end of time, we will do so.

A time to be born and a time to die A phrase from the Old Testament Book of Ecclesiastes. The passage begins, “To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven” — that is, there is a right moment for all actions.

tithe A tenth part of one’s annual income contributed to support the clergy or a church. The Mosaic law required the Israelites to pay a tithe for the sup port of worship.

tree of knowledge of good and evil A tree in the Garden of Eden, the fruit of which God forbade Adam and Eve to eat.

✥ They did eat the forbidden fruit, and their disobedience brought about the Fall of Man.

Turn the other cheek An adaptation of a command of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount: “Ye have heard that it hath been said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth”; but I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.”

✥ To “turn the other cheek” is thus to accept injuries and not to seek revenge.

Twenty-third Psalm The best known of the Psalms of the Old Testament, often read at funerals as a profession of faith in God’s protection:

The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.   
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;   
He leadeth me beside the still waters.   
He restoreth my soul;   
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.   
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,   
I will fear no evil;   
For thou art with me;   
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.   
Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies;   
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.   
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:   
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

valley of the shadow of death An expression from the Twenty-third Psalm (“The Lord is my shepherd”).

$\clubsuit$ Figuratively, the “valley of the shadow of death” stands for the perils of life, from which God protects believers.

Vanity of vanities; all is vanity A statement at the beginning of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament. The pointlessness of human activity is the major theme of the book. The author, however, like Job, insists that God’s laws must be kept, whether keeping them results in happiness or sorrow.

The voice of one crying in the wilderness A phrase used in the Gospels to refer to John the Baptist. It is quoted from the Book of Isaiah; the full text reads: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.” The quotation is used to imply that John was preparing the way for Jesus, as foretold by the prophecy of Isaiah.

Vulgate Bible (vul-gayt) A Latin translation of the Bible made by the scholar Jerome, a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, in the fourth century. This translation was the standard Bible of the Western world until the Reformation. Vulgate comes from a Latin word meaning “common,” because Jerome’s translation used the Latin of everyday speech.

walking on water A miraculous act performed by Jesus, according to the Gospels. They record that Jesus walked on the Sea of Galilee to rejoin his disciples, who had departed ahead of him in a ship. When he reached the ship, the winds that had been blowing stopped, and the disciples worshiped him as the true son of God.

✥ Figuratively, to “walk on water” is to perform an impossible or godlike task: “When I told him the project had to be done by Tuesday, he made me feel as though I were asking him to walk on water.”

Whither thou goest, I will go Part of a longer promise of fidelity, spoken by Ruth to Naomi, her motherin-law. The longer text reads: “Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.”

Wise Men Gentile sages who visited Jesus, Mary, and Joseph in Bethlehem shortly after the birth of Jesus. According to the Gospel of Matthew, they were guided by a star and brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Because three gifts were given, the traditional story is that there were three wise men. (See Magi.)

The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb From the Book of Isaiah; this saying is part of a description of an Earthly paradise that will follow the restoration of Israel after its destruction in a series of wars. The full text reads: “The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.” The reference to a “little child” is sometimes thought to be a prophecy of Jesus’ birth.

wolves in sheep’s clothing A metaphor for false prophets, adapted from words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount: “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.”

Zion, Mount The mountain in Jerusalem on which the fortress of the city was built.

# Mythology and Folklore

Mr. Gradgrind in Hard Times, by Charles Dickens, thought that the chief staple of education should be facts, facts, facts. We take a different view. Although we think facts are important (see the scientific sections of this dictionary), we also think educated people must know myths, myths, myths. It isn’t clear whether the myth of George Washington and the Cherry Tree belongs in a course on history or one on mythology, but from the standpoint of literacy it doesn’t matter. For purposes of communication and solidarity in a culture, myths are just as important as history. And unless history achieves the vividness and memorableness of myth, it will not be very useful to shared culture. We should indeed try to discriminate between history and myth; but true or false, the stories that we share provide us with our values, goals, and traditions. The tales we tell our children define what kind of people we shall be.

The term myth itself implies community. In Greek, it means “what they say.” The origins of most myths are lost in obscurity; they belong to the community. The myths that are shared by literate Americans are worldwide in their origins and embrace both ancient and modern cultures. The Greek myth of Paris and the apple of discord belongs to us as much as the myth of Washington and the cherry tree. According to some modern philosophers, notably Nietzsche, all stories, even scientific theories and religious teachings, are myths. Nietzsche’s view is probably wrong, but it usefully emphasizes the importance of shared myths in forming our national community and providing us with irreplaceable common points of reference. If we did not inherit myths, we would have to invent them; since we have inherited them, we should learn to use those we have inherited. Our traditional myths are no more true or false, wise or foolish, than those of other cultures. But being ours, they are uniquely valuable to us.

— E.D.H.

Achilles (uh-kil-eez) In classical mythology, the greatest warrior on the Greek side in the Trojan War. When he was an infant, his mother tried to make him immortal by bathing him in a magical river, but the heel by which she held him remained vulnerable. During the Trojan War, he quarreled with the commander, Agamemnon, and in anger sulked in his tent. Eventually Achilles emerged to fight and killed the Trojan hero Hector, but he was wounded in the heel by an arrow and died shortly thereafter.

✥ People speak of an “Achilles’ heel” as the one weak or sore point in a person’s character. ✥ The Achilles tendon runs from the heel to the calf. ✥ Achilles is the hero of Homer’s Iliad. ✥ The phrase “wrath of Achilles” refers to the hero’s anger, which caused so much destruction that Homer refers to it as his main theme in the first line of the Iliad.

Achilles. Achilles wounded by an arrow in his heel, the only vulnerable part of his body.

Adonis In classical mythology, an extremely beautiful boy who was loved by Aphrodite, the goddess of love.

✥ By extension, an “Adonis” is any handsome young man.

Aeneas (i-nee-uhs) A famous warrior of classical mythology; a leader in the Trojan War on the Trojan side. After the fall of Troy, Aeneas fled with his father and son and was shipwrecked at Carthage in northern Africa. There Dido, the queen of Carthage, fell in love with him and ultimately committed suicide when she realized that Aeneas could not stay with her forever. After many trials, Aeneas arrived in what is now Italy. The ancient Romans believed that they were descended from the followers of Aeneas.

✥ Aeneas is the hero of the Aeneid of Virgil. ✥ Because he carried his elderly father out of the ruined Troy on his back, Aeneas represents filial devotion and duty. ✥ The doomed love of Aeneas and Dido has been a source for artistic creation since ancient times.

Agamemnon (ag-uh-mem-non) In classical mythology, the king who led the Greeks against Troy in the Trojan War. To obtain favorable winds for the Greek fleet sailing to Troy, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis and so came under a curse. After he returned home victorious, he was murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus.

Amazons In classical mythology, a nation of warrior women. The Amazons burned or cut off one of their breasts so that they could use a bow and arrow more efficiently in war.

✥ Figuratively, an “Amazon” is a large, strong, aggressive woman. ✥ The Amazon River of South America was so named because tribes of women warriors were believed to live along its banks.

ambrosia (am-broh-zhuh) The food of the gods in classical mythology. Those who ate it became immortal.

$\clubsuit$ Particularly delicious food is sometimes called “ambrosia.”

Many hands make light work, but at the same time, too many cooks spoil the broth. Which of these contradictory proverbs shall we believe? Both, because in different contexts, both are true to experience. If not, they probably would not have survived. If the job to be done requires lots of unskilled labor, uch as picking up trash, then many hands do make light work. But if the job requires intricate skill, uch as cooking or writing, or if it requires a single guiding hand, then too many cooks do spoil the broth.

Proverbs are short, pithy sayings that reflect the accumulated wisdom, prejudices, and superstitions of the human race. In general, the particular phrasing of the proverbs, not their ideas, is what belongs to the cultural literacy of each nation and language. The ideas they express are often common to many nations. For instance, in German it is said, “Viele Hände bringt’s gleich zu Ende” — literally, “many hands bring it quickly to a conclusion.” But the literal sense doesn’t capture the punch of the German version, which is a little rhyme:

Viele Hände (pronounced “hen-duh”) Bringt’s gleich zu Ende (pronounced “en-duh”).

In English, few would pay attention to the proverb “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” were it not for the rhyme. Indeed, it is hard to find the equivalent of this proverb in any other language, because it rhymes only in English. It sounds silly in French and ridiculous in Italian. The rhyme alone makes us remember it — and encourages us to believe it.

We have included these little poems and nuggets of wisdom, false and true, because they have become part of our cultural vocabulary. On many occasions when people invoke proverbs in speech and writing, they simply allude to them, rather than complete them. If someone offers you a fruit and says, “An apple a day,” the communication will fail if you don’t know the relevant proverb; you will be an outsider. We don’t wish to encourage ideas such as “Boys will be boys” or “Frailty, thy name is woman!”; in fact, we would prefer people question proverbial wisdom rather than accept it blindly. But we also want to give everybody the chance to be an insider in literate American culture.

# Idioms

![](img/38d3fe6d461bc132cd4b73d65a42356fa724e40a70a4e2f1ddbb9f176d94345a.jpg)

It isn’t always the nonnative speaker’s accent (which may be perfect) that enables people to recognize instantly an outsider who is learning their language — it’s the odd mistakes that no native speaker would make. The idiomatic use of words such as to, for, and with varies from language to language. Just as each person has a unique, characteristic signature, each language has unique idioms. In fact, the word idiom comes from the Greek root idio, meaning a unique signature. Thus, each language contains expressions that make no sense when translated literally into another tongue. The humorist Art Buchwald wrote a famous column, often reprinted, in which he translated some of our Thanksgiving (Mercidonnant) terms into literal French, with comic results. If a German or Spaniard or Italian literally translated birthday suit and get down to brass tacks, the terms would make no sense, or the wrong sense. Even a native speaker of English who is not used to hearing literate idioms such as fits and starts, cock-and-bull story, hue and cry, and touch and go will not be able to make sense of them. Our purpose in defining these idioms is to let the cat out of the bag for those who haven’t heard them often enough to catch their meanings.

Other idioms are really allusions or foreign-language terms that make no sense unless you know what the allusions or terms mean. Carry coals to Newcastle translates adequately into any language, but it makes no sense to a person who doesn’t know that Newcastle is a coal-mining city. Knowing the literal meaning of idioms won’t enable you to understand them unless you also know what they allude to. Such ignorance is an Achilles’ heel and an albatross around one’s neck. Moreover, just knowing a baker’s dozen of them is not enough; you have to know them en masse. Educators who complain about the illiteracy of the young but pay no attention to teaching idioms are just weeping crocodile tears. We have therefore decided to cut the Gordian knot by systematically defining some of the most widely used idioms in American literate culture.

# World Literature, Philosophy, and Religion

![](img/4a5bc33669dca3243e77f833ecf277b5223c3d53b491c5f8d45243863e1a6835.jpg)

Our decision to classify religious and philosophical writing under “World Literature” is a carefully considered one. During most of Western history, the term literature included all writing that was worthy to be known by educated people. Not only is that traditional conception theoretically justified, it is also a practical way of including important knowledge that would normally fall between the cracks in school courses. A narrow conception of literature that includes only fiction, poetry, and drama is a recent innovation that has disadvantages as well as advantages. Because world philosophy and religion have no clearly defined place in school courses, our classification of them as literature encourages their inclusion in the school curriculum.

World literature so conceived is an especially rich and interesting domain of knowledge. Its names are stars in the firmament of thought: Plato and Aristotle, Goethe and Cervantes, Buddha and Confucius. The writing represented covers the whole spectrum of literature. Plato wrote fictional dialogues, Aristotle technical treatises. Here are lyric poems, epic poems, tragedies, and comedies. Here are the most influential ideas about ethics, politics, and righteousness. Several of the writers have done work that is so rich and complex that it repays a lifetime of study. Indeed, every figure in this section has been the lifetime study of some devoted scholar.

The writings included in this section have an almost timeless character. The world of great literature, philosophy, and religion is unlike the world of science in this respect. In science, the latest thinking is usually the most advanced and most likely to be true, because the latest scientific theories are based on the most evidence and have withstood the severest tests. In the sphere of thought concerning the nature and meaning of human life, however, the latest theories are not necessarily the most advanced or the most likely to be true. Knowledge about the basic character and meaning of life is not inherently progressive, as science is. The ancients had just as much evidence as we do about the basic facts of human existence. In fact, truths understood by the ancients sometimes are forgotten and have to be rediscovered. Some say, for instance, that the ancient Greeks have more to tell us about modern life than more recent thinkers do. Even if we do not all agree with this proposition, we can agree that answers to the great questions about human existence are not the exclusive property of any single place, culture, or historical era.

Kant, Immanuel (kahnt, kant) An eighteenthcentury German philosopher; one of the leading philosophers of modern times. His views are called the Critical Philosophy, and his three best-known works are Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of Judgment.

Kant was troubled because metaphysics had not arrived at acceptable answers on important concerns, particularly God (whether there is one), the soul (whether it lives on after death), and the world as a whole (whether people can act freely in the world, or whether its laws determine all their actions). He maintained that the first step in getting any answers in these areas was to investigate the limits of human understanding and reasoning; this investigation was what he called a critique.

✥ Kant held that we cannot know a thing-in-itself as it is, but only as our mind constitutes it. He asserted that while no one can understand God, the soul, or the world in the way we understand things in nature, we must believe in God, in immortality, and in free will.

Luther, Martin A sixteenth-century German religious leader; the founder of Protestantism. Luther, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, began the Reformation by posting his Ninety-five Theses, which attacked the church for allowing the sale of indulgences. He soon became convinced that the Catholic Church was opposed to the Bible on the question of justification by grace, through faith, and that no accommodation of his beliefs on this point was possible within the church. Luther concluded that reform of the church had to happen through formation of a new body of Christians. He denied the authority of the pope and many other aspects of Catholic teaching, including the doctrine of transubstantiation.

✥ Luther’s most famous statement, made when he was called to account for his views before a meeting, was, “It is neither safe nor prudent to do anything against conscience. Here I stand; I can do no other.”

Marxism The doctrines of Karl Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels on economics, politics, and society. They include the notion of economic determinism — that political and social structures are determined by the economic conditions of people.

(See communism.)

Mass The common name in the Roman Catholic Church, and among some members of the Anglican Communion, for the sacrament of Communion.

Marxism, because it sees human culture as the product of economic forces, is a materialist system of beliefs.

matzo (maht-suh) A flat piece of unleavened bread, resembling a large cracker, used by Jews in place of yeast bread during Passover.

The larger group, the Sunnis, argued that the successor should be appointed by election and consensus, as tradition dictated. (Sunni comes from the Arabic word Sunna, meaning “tradition.”) The smaller group believed that Muhammad’s successors should come from his family, starting with Ali, his sonin-law. These, the partisans of Ali, were named from the word Shia, meaning “partisan” in Arabic.

# Literature in English

![](img/b86c9e65829d10033f4472fdfc3ecd3f3947bb28f5cb3c0adfc8724c5337a804.jpg)

From the standpoint of American cultural literacy, all commonly known literary works written in English are probably best placed in a single category. The separation of British from American literature is somewhat misleading, particularly in the case of older literature. William Shakespeare is an American author — not because he was an American, obviously, but because his writings formed a part of American culture from its beginnings. Every frontier town had Shakespeare productions and comic entertainments that alluded to details of Shakespearean plays. Geoffrey Chaucer and Milton are American writers in this sense too, having been part of educated discourse from the earliest days of our republic. In the nineteenth century Charles Dickens was as much an American as a British writer. (Certainly he thought himself so when he counted his American royalties and lecture fees.) It is uncertain whether Henry James and T. S. Eliot should be considered American or British writers, and it’s not particularly important.

Usual practice divides our literature into the following periods: the Middle Ages (e.g., Chaucer), the Renaissance (e.g., Shakespeare), the eighteenth century (e.g., Samuel Johnson), the Romantic period of the early nineteenth century (e.g., Wordsworth), the Victorian period of the later nineteenth century (e.g., Dickens), and the twentieth century (e.g., T. S. Eliot). The most self-consciously American literature belongs to the nineteenth century, when patriotic writers such as Emerson, Melville, and Whitman deliberately set out to reflect the distinctive character of American culture. In the twentieth century, literature written in English tended to be international as well as national in flavor, as in writers like Salman Rushdie.

Literature in English excels in every kind of writing. Its particular glory is its poetry. For historical reasons, the English language acquired a vocabulary that is unusually rich and nuanced, combining words of Germanic root (such as see and glimpse) with words of Latin root (such as perceive and envision). This variety in our vocabulary has allowed our poets a tremendous range of sounds and meanings and made poetry in English one of humanity’s great achievements.

Most young Americans will know most of the contents of this section fairly well. Our schools have done a good job in teaching the technical components of the language arts. Our elementary and secondary textbooks are replete with discussions of abbreviations, dictionary use, punctuation, and parts of speech. Yet these textbooks are not always consistent among themselves in the matter of nomenclature. Should a noun be called a substantive, a nominative, a type-one word, a thing-word, or just a noun? Although there isn’t a clear answer to this question, there is a clear need for consistency in our textbooks and schools. It is pointless to confuse a student who comes into a new school district with a whole new set of descriptive terms about language. Language terms are, of course, essential for teaching language arts, but there is no excuse for making the terms difficult and confusing. Linguistic scholars and theorists agree that grammatical terms and categories are inherently arbitrary; there is no one right way to analyze language. The chief reason to analyze it at all is to create a shared vocabulary for talking about language in teaching the language arts.

One of our purposes in including this section of our dictionary is to help students by encouraging standardization of the vocabulary we use in teaching about language. Because we are convinced that there is little to choose in pedagogical usefulness between substantive and thing-word, we have chosen to adopt only the most widely shared, and hence most traditional, terms. Thus, in this section a noun is a noun is a noun — not because traditional grammatical terms are best, but because standardized terms are best. The traditional grammatical vocabulary is completely adequate to the task of teaching reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the highest level of excellence. The notion that novel terms from modern linguistics can advance the teaching of these arts is a superstition that no profound scholar of the subject would be willing to argue.

The abbreviation may appear before the date (a.d. ), or it may appear after the date $\left( 1 9 8 8 \ \mathrm { \bf ~ A . D . } \right)$ . It stands for anno Domini, a Latin phrase meaning “in the year of our Lord.” (Compare b.c.)

adjective A part of speech that describes a noun or pronoun. Adjectives are usually placed just before the words they qualify: shy child, blue notebook, rotten apple, four horses, another table.

adverb A part of speech that modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs usually answer such questions as “How?” “Where?” “When?” or “To what degree?” The following italicized words are adverbs: “He ran well”; “She ran very well”; “The mayor is highly capable.”

✥ Adverbs are often formed by adding -ly to an adjective, as in truly or deeply.

agreement A requirement for parts of a sentence in standard written English; the parts must agree, for example, in number and person.

The subject and verb of a clause or simple sentence must agree in person, as in $^ { \mathfrak { c } } H e$ is a boy.” The subject, he, and the verb, is, are both in the third person. The subject and verb also must agree in number, as in “We are girls.” The subject, we, and the verb, are, are both plural.

Nouns and pronouns must also agree in number, person, and gender as in “Every boy must mind his manners.” The noun boy and the pronoun his are both singular, both in the third person, and both masculine.

aka (ay-kay-ay) An abbreviation meaning “also known as.” It is primarily used by law enforcement officials to specify an alias: “John Smith, aka Jonathan Jones.”

allegory (al-uh-gawr-ee) A story that has a deeper or more general meaning in addition to its surface meaning. Allegories are composed of several symbols or metaphors. For example, in The Pilgrim’s Progress, by John Bunyan, the character named Christian struggles to escape from a bog or swamp. The story of his difficulty is a symbol of the difficulty of leading a good life in the “bog” of this world. The “bog” is a metaphor or symbol of life’s hardships and distractions. Similarly, when Christian loses a heavy pack that he has been carrying on his back, this symbolizes his freedom from the weight of sin that he has been carrying.

alliteration (uh-lit-uh-ray-shuhn) The repetition of the beginning sounds of words, as in “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,” “long-lived,” “short shrift,” and “the fickle finger of fate.”

ampersand (am-puhr-sand) A symbol for and (&), as in Dun & Bradstreet.

analogy (uh-nal-uh-jee) A comparison of two different things that are alike in some way (see metaphor and simile). An analogy attributed to Samuel Johnson is: “Dictionaries are like watches; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true.”

auxiliary verb A “helping” verb that modifies the main verb, as in “Gail can win,” “Gail did win,” “Gail could have won.” A question often begins with an auxiliary verb: “Did Gail win?” “Could Gail lose?” The various forms of the verbs can, have, is, and does frequently act as auxiliaries.

ballad A simple narrative song, or a narrative poem suitable for singing. The ballad usually has a short stanza, such as:

There are twelve months in all the year, As I hear many men say, But the merriest month in all the year Is the merry month of May.

biography The story of someone’s life. The Life of Samuel Johnson, by James Boswell, and Abraham Lincoln, by Carl Sandburg, are two noted biographies. The story of the writer’s own life is an autobiography.

blank verse Verse written in iambic pentameter, without rhyme. Many of the speeches in the plays of William Shakespeare are written in blank verse; this example is from Macbeth:

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.

bowdlerizing (bohd-luh-reye-zing, bowd-luh-reyezing) Amending a book by removing passages and words deemed obscene or objectionable (see obscenity). The name comes from Thomas Bowdler’s  edition of the plays of William Shakespeare, which was amended so that it could “be read aloud in a family

brackets Marks — [ ] — resembling parentheses with square corners. Brackets are often used within quotations to distinguish between the quoter’s own words and those of the writer being quoted: “He [the president] made a memorable speech at Gettysburg.”

capital letters One of the two kinds of letters. Capital letters, also called upper-case letters, are larger than, and often formed differently from, lower-case letters. Capital letters are used at the beginning of a sentence or a proper name and may be used to show respect. Some examples are: “The dog barked,” Daniel, the Lord, and Queen Elizabeth.

case A grammatical category indicating whether nouns and pronouns are functioning as the subject of a sentence (nominative case) or the object of a sentence (objective case), or are indicating possession (possessive case). He is in the nominative case, him is in the objective case, and his is in the possessive case. In a language such as English, nouns do not change their form in the nominative or objective case. Only pronouns do. Thus, ball stays the same in both “the ball is thrown,” where it is the subject, and in “Harry threw the ball,” where it is the object.

cf. An abbreviation meaning “compare.” It is short for the Latin word confer and instructs the reader to compare one thing with another.

character A person in a literary work. For example, Ebenezer Scrooge is a character in A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens.

circumlocution (sur-kuhm-loh-kyooh-shuhn) Roundabout speech or writing: “The driveway was not unlike that military training device known as an obstacle course” is a circumlocution for “The driveway resembled an obstacle course.” Circumlocution comes from Latin words meaning “speaking around.”

classicism An approach to aesthetics that favors restraint, rationality, and the use of strict forms in literature, painting, architecture, and other arts. It flourished in ancient Greece and Rome, and throughout Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Classicists often derived their models from the ancient Greeks and Romans.

✥ Classicism is sometimes considered the opposite of romanticism.

comedy A work — play, story, novel, or film — that ends happily for the main character (or protagonist) and contains humor to some degree. A comedy may involve unhappy outcomes for some of the characters. Shylock, for example, in The Merchant of Venice, a comedy by William Shakespeare, is disgraced in the play. The ancient Greeks and Romans produced comedies, and great numbers have been written in modern times.

comma A punctuation mark (,) used to indicate pauses and to separate elements within a sentence. “The forest abounds with oak, elm, and beech trees”; “The bassoon player was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on December , .”

compound sentence A sentence that contains at least two independent clauses, often joined by conjunctions: “Dr. Watson explained his theory, and Sherlock Holmes listened quietly.” (Compare complex sentence, compound-complex sentence, and simple sentence.)

compound-complex sentence A sentence that contains at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause: “Queen Elizabeth I was called a redhead (independent clause), but no one knew her hair color for sure (independent clause) because she always wore a wig (dependent clause).” “Because she always wore a wig” is a dependent clause starting with the subordinating conjunction (see subordination) because. (Compare complex sentence, compound sentence, and simple sentence.)

conciseness Economy in writing or speaking. “Bill loves to go to the movies because watching films is a real pleasure to $\mathrm { h i m } ^ { \mathrm { \infty } }$ is not as concise as “Bill loves to watch movies.” (Compare circumlocution.)

conjunction A word that joins words or groups of words. There are three kinds of conjunctions: coordinating, correlative, and subordinating. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, not, yet, for, and so. Correlative conjunctions include the words in the pairs either/or, both/and, and neither/nor. Subordinating conjunctions begin subordinate clauses (see subordination) and join them to the rest of the sentence: “She didn’t learn the real reason until she left the valley.”

connotation The meaning that a word suggests or implies. A connotation includes the emotions or associations that surround a word. For example, the word modern strictly means “belonging to recent times,” but the word’s connotations can include such notions as “new, up to date, experimental.”

consonants Letters of the alphabet that stand for sounds often made with a closed or partially closed mouth: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Z, and sometimes Y (as in yellow). (Compare vowels.)

contraction A word produced by running two or more words together and leaving out some of the letters or sounds. For example, isn’t is a contraction of is not.

✥ An apostrophe is generally used in contractions to show where letters or sounds have been left out.

coordination The use of grammatical structures to give equal emphasis to, or to “coordinate,” two or more words, groups of words, or ideas: “I like eggs and toast.” In the following sentences, each clause receives equal emphasis: “Mr. Jones teaches French, and Ms. Williams teaches English”; “Mr. Jones teaches French, but Ms. Williams teaches English.” (Compare subordination.)

copyright The legal protection given to published works, forbidding anyone but the author from publishing or selling them. An author can transfer the copyright to another person or corporation, such as a publishing company.

✥ The symbol for copyright is $^ { © }$ couplet A pair of lines of verse that rhyme. Some poems, such as “The Night Before Christmas,” are written entirely in couplets:

‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

dash A punctuation mark (—) used to indicate a sudden break in thought, to set off parenthetical material, or to take the place of such expressions as that is and namely: “He’s running for reelection — if he lives until then”; “Very few people in this class — three, to be exact — have completed their projects”; “She joined the chorus for only one reason — she loves to sing.” In the last example, where the parenthetical material comes at the end of the sentence rather than in the middle, a colon could be used instead of the dash.

dead languages Languages that are no longer spoken.

✥ Some dead languages, such as Latin, ancient Greek, and Sanskrit, may nevertheless be studied by large numbers of people because of their literary or historical importance.

declarative sentence In grammar, the kind of sen tence that makes a statement or “declares” something: “He eats yogurt.”

definite article The word the; the article that pre cedes names of specific items: “the dog,” “the boats,” “the heavy anchor.” (Compare indefinite article.)

demonstrative pronouns Pronouns that point to specific things: this, that, these, and those, as in “This is an apple,” “Those are boys,” or “Take these to the clerk.” The same words are used as demonstrative adjectives when they modify nouns or pronouns: “this apple,” “those boys.”

diction The choice of words. Diction is effective when words are appropriate to an audience. A man might refer to his car as his “wheels” in casual conversation with a friend, but if he were writing an essay for a group of economists, he would write, “People base their decision to buy an automobile on the following considerations,” not “People base their decision to buy wheels on the following considerations.”

direct object A noun, pronoun, or group of words serving as the receiving end of an action, such as the ball in “Tabitha hit the ball.” A direct object can be a word, phrase, or clause: “Sam chose Rusty to play shortstop”; “I will never understand why he came home.” (Compare indirect object.)

double-entendre (dub-uhl-ahn-tahn-druh; doohblahnn-tahnn-druh) A word or expression that has two different meanings (in French, double-entendre means “double meaning”), one of which is often bawdy or indelicate.

epic A long narrative poem written in elevated style, in which heroes of great historical or legendary importance perform valorous deeds. The setting is vast in scope, covering great nations, the world, or the universe, and the action is important to the history of a nation or people. The Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Aeneid are some great epics from world literature, and two great epics in English are Beowulf and Paradise Lost.

✥ Figuratively, any task of great magnitude may be called “epic,” as in an “epic feat” or an “epic undertaking.”

epigram Any pithy, witty saying or short poem. An aphorism can serve as an epigram, if it is brief.

✥ Several authors are noted for their epigrams, including Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. One of Wilde’s epigrams is $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ can resist everything except temptation.” ✥ Two other words are similar: an epigraph is usually an inscription, as on a statue; an epitaph can be such an inscription or it can be a brief literary note commemorating a dead person.

I t wéa/rie∪ s mé;/yo∪ u sáy/i∪ t wéa/rie∪ s yóu. . .

ibid. An abbreviation for ibidem, a Latin word meaning “in the same place.” It is used in footnotes and bibliographies to refer to a source cited in a previous entry.

inflection A change in the form of a word to reflect different grammatical functions of the word in a sentence. English has lost most of its inflections. Those that remain are chiefly possessive (’s), as in “the boy’s hat”; plural (-s), as in “the three girls”; and past tense (-d or -ed), as in cared. Other inflections are found in pronouns — as in he, him, his — and in irregular words such as think/thought, child/children, and mouse/mice.

irregular verb A verb in which the past tense is not formed by adding the usual -ed ending. Examples of irregular verbs are sing (past tense sang); feel (felt); and go (went). (Compare regular verb.)

italics Slanted letters that look like this: We the people. Italics are most often used to emphasize certain words, to indicate that they are in a foreign language, or to set off the title of a literary or artistic work.

jargon A special language belonging exclusively to a group, often a profession. Engineers, lawyers, doctors, tax analysts, and the like all use jargon to exchange complex information efficiently.

meter The highly organized rhythm characteristic of verse; the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line. (See iambic pentameter.)

modifier A word or group of words that describes or limits a verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Modifiers applied to nouns are adjectives. Modifiers applied to verbs or adjectives are adverbs. Those that are applied to adverbs themselves are also called adverbs.

motif (moh-teef) In literature, art, or music, a recurring set of words, shapes, colors, or notes. In the poem “The Raven,” by Edgar Allan Poe, for example, the word nevermore is a motif appearing at the end of each stanza.

Ms. A title used before a woman’s name, pronounced “Miz” and corresponding to $M r$ . before a man’s.

✥ Feminists have urged the use of Ms. because, unlike Miss or Mrs., it does not identify a woman by her marital status. (See feminism.)

mythology The body of myths belonging to a culture. Myths are traditional stories about gods and heroes.

paradox A statement that seems contradictory or absurd but is actually valid or true. According to one proverbial paradox, we must sometimes be cruel in order to be kind. Another form of paradox is a statement that truly is contradictory and yet follows logically from other statements that do not seem open to objection. If someone says, $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ am lying,” for example, and we assume that his statement is true, it must be false. The paradox is that the statement “I am lying” is false if it is true.

paragraph A basic unit of prose. It is usually com posed of several sentences that together develop one central idea. The main sentence in a paragraph is called the topic sentence.

paraphrase A restatement of speech or writing that retains the basic meaning while changing the words. A paraphrase often clarifies the original statement by putting it into words that are more easily understood.

parentheses Punctuation marks — ( ) — used to separate elements in a sentence. Parentheses subordinate (see subordination) the material within them so that readers save most of their attention for the rest of the sentence: “Aunt Sarah (who is really my mother’s cousin) will be visiting next week.”

parody In art, music, or literature, a satire that mimics the style of its object.

participle (pahr-tuh-sip-uhl) The verb form that combines with an auxiliary verb to indicate certain tenses.

The present participle is formed by adding -ing to the infinitive; it indicates present action: “The girl is swimming”; “I am thinking.” (Compare gerund.)

The past participle usually ends in -ed; it indicates completed or past action: “The gas station has closed”; “The mayor had spoken.”

Participles may also function as adjectives: “Your mother is a charming person”; “This is a talking parrot”; “Spoken words cannot be revoked.”

✥ A “dangling” participle is one that is not clearly connected to the word it modifies: “Standing at the corner, two children walked past me.” A better version of this example would be, “While I was standing at the corner, two children walked past me.”

parts of a sentence Classifications of words, phrases, and clauses according to the way they figure in sentences. (See auxiliary verb, conjunction, dependent clause, direct object, independent clause, indirect object, modifier, predicate, and subject.)

parts of speech Classifications of words according to their relations to each other and to the things they represent. Different parts of speech name actions, name the performers of actions, describe the performers or actions, and so on. The common parts of speech are adjectives, adverbs, articles, conjunctions, interjections, nouns, prepositions, pronouns, and verbs.

passim (pas-im) A word used in footnotes and similar material to indicate that a word or subject occurs frequently. For example, an entry in an index reading “coal: – passim” means that coal is mentioned throughout pages  to . Passim is Latin for “throughout” or “here and there.”

passive voice One of the two “voices” of verbs (see also active voice). A verb is in the passive voice when the subject of the sentence is acted on by the verb. For example, in “The ball was thrown by the pitcher,” the ball (the subject) receives the action of the verb, and was thrown is in the passive voice. The same sentence cast in the active voice would be, “The pitcher threw the ball.”

✥ It is usually preferable to use the active voice wherever possible, because it gives a sense of immediacy to the sentence.

pastoral A work of art that celebrates the cultivated enjoyment of the countryside. The poem “The Passionate Shepherd to His Love,” by Christopher Marlowe, is a pastoral. Its first stanza reads:

Come live with me, and be my love; And we will all the pleasures prove That hills and valleys, dales and fields, Woods or steepy mountain yields.

period A punctuation mark (.) that ends a declarative sentence. A period is also used in abbreviations such as Mr. and $D r$ .

person An inflectional form (see inflection) of pronouns and verbs that distinguishes between the person who speaks (first person), the person who is spoken to (second person), and the person who is spoken about (third person). The pronoun or verb may be singular or plural. For example:

first person singular: I walk.   
second person singular: you walk.   
third person singular: he/she/it walks.   
first person plural: we walk.   
second person plural: you walk.   
third person plural: they walk.

personal pronoun A pronoun that represents a person in a sentence. Personal pronouns have different forms depending on their case, gender, and number, as follows:

Singular Plural nominative: I, you, he, she, it we, you, they objective: me, you, him, her, it us, you, them possessive: my, mine, your, our, ours, your, yours, yours, his, her, hers, its their, theirs

phrase A group of grammatically connected words within a sentence: “One council member left in a huff”; “She got much satisfaction from planting daffodil bulbs.” Unlike clauses, phrases do not have both a subject and a predicate.

plagiarism Literary theft. Plagiarism occurs when a writer duplicates another writer’s language or ideas and then calls the work his or her own. Copyright laws protect writers’ words as their legal property. To avoid the charge of plagiarism, writers take care to credit those from whom they borrow and quote.

✥ Similar theft in music or other arts is also called plagiarism.

plot The organization of events in a work of fiction.

plural The grammatical category in nouns, pronouns, and verbs that refers to more than one thing. Most nouns become plural with the addition of $- s$ or -es: hats, chairs, dishes, countries, and so on. Some nouns form the plural in other ways, as in children, feet, geese, and women. (Compare singular; see agreement.)

possessive The case of a noun or pronoun that shows possession. Nouns are usually made possessive by adding an apostrophe and s: “The bicycle is Sue’s, not Mark’s.” Possessive pronouns can take the place of possessive nouns: “The bicycle is hers, not his.” (See nominative case and objective case.)

predicate (pred-i-kuht) The part of a sentence that shows what is being said about the subject. The predicate includes the main verb and all its modifiers. In the following sentence, the italicized portion is the predicate: “Olga’s dog was the ugliest creature on four prefix Letters placed in front of a word to form a new word: “trimonthly,” “semimonthly,” “bilingual,” “multilingual,” “address,” “redress,” “predate,” “postdate.” (Compare suffix.)

preposition A part of speech that indicates the relationship, often spatial, of one word to another. For example, “She paused at the gate”; “This tomato is ripe for picking”; and “They talked the matter over head to head.” Some common prepositions are at, by, for, from, in, into, on, to, and with.

pronoun A word that takes the place of a noun. She, herself, it, and this are examples of pronouns. If we substituted pronouns for the nouns in the sentence “Please give the present to Karen,” it would read “Please give it to her.”

protagonist (proh-tag-uh-nist) The principal character in a literary work. Hamlet, for example, is the protagonist of the play by William Shakespeare that bears his name.

proverb A brief, memorable saying that expresses a truth or belief, such as “A friend in need is a friend indeed.” (See examples under “Proverbs.”)

pun A humorous substitution of words that are alike in sound but different in meaning (see double-entendre), as in this passage from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll:

“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. “Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle, “nine the next, and so on.” “What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice. “That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”

purple prose Writing full of ornate or flowery language. Ornate, flowery speech can also be referred to as purple prose.

question mark A punctuation mark (?) that follows a direct question: “Is Ralph really seven feet tall?”

quotation marks Punctuation marks ${ \binom { \alpha \gg 5 } { 5 } }$ that set off dialogue, quoted material, titles of short works, and definitions. When something must be quoted inside a quotation, single quotation marks are used: “‘Religion,’ according to Karl Marx, ‘is the opiate of the masses.’”

realism An attempt to make art and literature resemble life. Realist painters and writers take their subjects from the world around them (instead of from idealized subjects, such as figures in mythology or folklore) and try to represent them in a lifelike manner.

rebuttal A reply intended to show fault in an opponent’s argument.

redundancy Unnecessary repetition in speech or writing. The expression freedom and liberty is redundant.

reference works Books and other works that contain useful facts and information, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and bibliographies.

refrain In some pieces of verse, a set of words repeated at the end of each stanza.

regular verb A verb that follows standard patterns in its inflection. The past tense of a regular verb is formed by adding an -ed ending: walk, walked; shout, shouted. (Compare irregular verb.)

rhetorical question A question posed without expectation of an answer but merely as a way of making a point: “You don’t expect me to go along with that crazy scheme, do you?”

rhyme A similarity of sound between words, such as moon, spoon, croon, tune, and June. Rhyme is often employed in verse.

roman à clef (roh-mahn ah klay) A novel in which actual people and places are disguised as fictional characters. Roman à clef is French for “novel with a key.”

Roman numerals Letters of the alphabet used in ancient Rome to represent numbers: $\mathrm { I } = \mathbf { 1 }$ ; $\mathrm { V } = 5$ ; $\mathrm { X = }$ ; $\mathrm { L } = 5 0$ ; $\mathrm { C } = 1 0 0$ ; $\mathrm { D } = 5 0 0$ ; $\mathrm { M } = 1 0 0 0$ . The numbers one through ten are written I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X. Roman numerals are often used to signify divisions of a long work, or of a work with many parts. They are also used to lend significance to something, as in Super Bowl VII. Formal designation of years may also be in Roman numerals: a.d. MCMLXXXIX $= \mathbf { A . D }$ . .

romance In traditional literary terms, a narration of the extraordinary exploits of heroes, often in exotic or mysterious settings. Most of the stories of King Arthur and his knights are romances.

The term romance has also been used for stories of mysterious adventures, not necessarily of heroes. Like the heroic kind of romance, however, these adventure romances usually are set in distant places. William Shakespeare’s play The Tempest is this kind of romance.

Today, a novel concerned mainly with love is often called a romance. Romances are frequently published in paperback series.

romanticism A movement that shaped all the arts in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Romanticism generally stressed the essential goodness of human beings (see Jean-Jacques Rousseau), celebrated nature rather than civilization, and valued emotion and imagination over reason. (Compare classicism.)

run-on sentence A grammatically faulty sentence in which two or more main or independent clauses are joined without a word to connect them or a punctuation mark to separate them: “The fog was thick he could not find his way home.” The error can be corrected by adding a conjunction with a comma (“The fog was thick, and he could not find his way home”) or by separating the two clauses with a semicolon (“The fog was thick; he could not find his way home”).

sarcasm A form of irony in which apparent praise conceals another, scornful meaning. For example, a sarcastic remark directed at a person who consistently arrives fifteen minutes late for appointments might be, “Oh, you’ve arrived exactly on time!”

satire A work of literature that mocks social conventions, another work of art, or anything its author thinks ridiculous. Gulliver’s Travels, by Jonathan Swift, is a satire of eighteenth-century British society.

science fiction Works of fiction that use scientific discoveries or advanced technology — either actual or imaginary — as part of their plot. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells were early writers of science fiction. More recent ones are Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury.

semicolon A punctuation mark (;) used to join two independent clauses in a sentence. The semicolon shows that the ideas in the two clauses are related: “Jack really didn’t mind being left without a car; he had the house to himself.”

sequel A narrative or dramatic work complete in itself but designed to follow an earlier one. Through the Looking-Glass is a sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

sic A Latin word for “thus,” used to indicate that an apparent error is part of quoted material and not an editorial mistake: “The learned geographer asserts that ‘the capital of the United States is Washingtown [sic].’”

simile (sim-uh-lee) A common figure of speech that explicitly compares two things usually considered different. Most similes are introduced by like or as: “The realization hit me like a bucket of cold water.” (Compare metaphor.)

$\clubsuit$ Some similes, such as “sleeping like a log,” have become clichés.

simple sentence A sentence containing only one independent clause and no dependent clauses: “He went home after class.” (Compare complex sentence, compound sentence, and compound-complex sentence.)

singular In nouns, pronouns, and verbs, the grammatical form that refers to only one thing. In the following sentence, the singular words are italicized: “The police officer stops anyone who crosses before the light changes.” (Compare plural; see agreement.)

slang Expressions that do not belong to standard written English. For example, “flipping out” is slang for “losing one’s mind” or “losing one’s temper.” Slang expressions are usually inappropriate in formal speech or writing. (See jargon.)

sonnet A lyric poem of fourteen lines, often about love, that follows one of several strict conventional patterns of rhyme. Elizabeth Barrett Browning, John Keats, and William Shakespeare are poets known for their sonnets.

split infinitive An infinitive is the “to” form of a verb, as in “to play.” A split infinitive is a phrase in which to is separated from the verb. The sentence “I decided to quickly and directly go home” contains a split infinitive. Some people consider it poor style, or even incorrect style, to split an infinitive.

spoonerism A reversal of sounds in two words, with humorous effect. Spoonerisms were named after William Spooner, an English clergyman and scholar of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In one spoonerism attributed to him, he meant “May I show you to another seat?” but said, “May I sew you to another sheet?”

stage direction Part of the script of a play that tells the actors how they are to move or to speak their lines. Enter, exit, and exeunt are stage directions.

stanza A group of lines of verse, usually set off from other groups by a space. The stanzas of a poem often have the same internal pattern of rhymes.

stereotype A too-simple and therefore distorted image of a group, such as “Football players are stupid” or “The English are cold and unfriendly people.”

stream of consciousness A kind of writing that presents the thoughts of a person or character as they occur. Stream-of-consciousness writing uses devices such as characters speaking to themselves, free association, and lists of words. William Faulkner, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf wrote stream-of-consciousness novels.

subject A part of every sentence. The subject tells what the sentence is about; it contains the main noun or noun phrase: “The car crashed into the railing”; “Judy and two of her friends were elected to the National Honor Society.” In some cases the subject is implied: you is the implied subject in “Get me some orange juice.” (Compare predicate.)

subjunctive A grammatical form of verbs implying hypothetical action or condition. Subjunctives are italicized in these sentences: “If Mr. Stafford were [not “was”] fluent in French, he could communicate with his employees more effectively”; “If Sheila had been here, she would have helped us with our math.”

subordination The use of expressions that make one element of a sentence dependent on another. In the following sentence, the first (italicized) clause (also called a subordinate clause) is subordinate to the second clause: “Despite all efforts toward a peaceful settlement of the dispute, war finally broke out.” (Compare coordination, dependent clause, and independent clause.)

suffix A letter or a group of letters added to the end of a word to change its meaning. For example, adding the suffix -ter to the adjective hot turns it into the comparative adjective hotter, and adding the suffix -ly to the adjective quick turns it into the adverb quickly. Other examples of words with suffixes are: “willing,”

“management,” “serviceable,” “harmonize,” and “joyful.” (Compare prefix.)

superlative The form of an adjective indicating the greatest degree of the quality that the adjective describes. Best is the superlative form of good; fastest is the superlative form of fast; most charming is the superlative form of charming. The usual superlative takes the ending -est. (Compare comparative.)

syllable A basic unit of speech generally containing only one vowel sound. The word basic contains two syllables (ba-sic). The word generally contains four (gen-er-al-ly). (See hyphen.)

symbol An object or name that stands for something else, especially a material thing that stands for something that is not material. The bald eagle is a symbol of the United States of America. The cross is a symbol of Christianity. The Star of David is a symbol of Judaism.

synonyms Words that mean roughly the same thing. Container and receptacle are synonyms.

syntax The sequence in which words are put together to form sentences. In English, the usual sequence is subject, verb, and object.

✥ Syntactic languages, such as English, use word order to indicate word relationships. Inflected languages (see inflection), such as Greek and Latin, use word endings and other inflections to indicate relationships.

tense An inflectional (see inflection) form of verbs; it expresses the time at which the action described by the verb takes place. The major tenses are past, present, and future. The verb in “I sing” is in the present tense; in $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ sang,” past tense; in $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ will sing,” future tense. Other tenses are the present perfect (“I have sung”), the past perfect (“I had sung”), and the future perfect (“I will have sung”).

theme A central idea in a piece of writing or other work of art: “The theme of desperation is found throughout his novels.” Also a short composition assigned to a student as a writing exercise.

thesis The central idea in a piece of writing, sometimes contained in a topic sentence.

thriller A suspenseful, sensational story or film: “Ken Follett writes best-selling spy thrillers.”

✥ In Great Britain, the word thriller is sometimes used for all mystery novels: “Martha Grimes, an American, writes British-style thrillers.”

topic sentence The main sentence in a paragraph, often the first sentence. It briefly conveys the essential idea of the paragraph.

tragedy A serious drama in which a central character, the protagonist — usually an important, heroic person — meets with disaster either through some personal fault or through unavoidable circumstances. In most cases, the protagonist’s downfall conveys a sense of human dignity in the face of great conflict. Tragedy originated in ancient Greece in the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In modern times, it achieved excellence with William Shakespeare in such works as Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and Othello. Twentieth-century tragedies include Death of a Salesman, by Arthur Miller, and Murder in the Cathedral, by T. S. Eliot.

✥ Aristotle argued that the proper effect of tragedy is catharsis — the purging of the emotions. ✥ In common usage, disasters of many kinds are called tragedies.

transitive verb A verb that needs a direct object to complete its meaning. Bring, enjoy, and prefer are transitive verbs. (Compare intransitive verb.)

$\clubsuit$ Some verbs can be transitive in one sentence and intransitive in another: turned is transitive in “Brenda turned the wheel sharply” but intransitive in “Fred turned when I called.”

understatement A form of irony in which something is intentionally represented as less than it is: “Hank Aaron was a pretty good ball player.”

upper-case letters Capital letters. (Compare lower-case letters.)

verb A word that represents an action or a state of being. Go, strike, travel, and exist are examples of verbs. A verb is the essential part of the predicate of a sentence. The grammatical forms of verbs include number, person, and tense. (See auxiliary verb, infinitive, intransitive verb, irregular verb, participle, regular verb, and transitive verb.)

verse A kind of language made intentionally different from ordinary speech or prose. It usually employs devices such as meter and rhyme, though not always. Free verse, for example, has neither meter nor rhyme. Verse is usually considered a broader category than poetry, with the latter being reserved to mean verse that is serious and genuinely artistic.

vowels Letters of the alphabet that generally stand for sounds made with an open or partially open mouth: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y (as in style). (Compare consonants.)

# Fine Arts

![](img/fc632fc213457b33a0f6ae6fce9080d96874e6af568cb939ffa449ed1f74c341.jpg)

The term fine arts is equivalent to the older French term beaux arts, meaning “beautiful arts.” In ancient Greece, the fine arts were presided over by the Muses, whence the word museum — a place where fine arts are displayed. Because museums of fine arts have tended to display mainly painting and sculpture, these are the arts we first think of as belonging to the fine arts. But in fact they comprise all artistic works, including literature, architecture, drama, music, dance, opera, and even up-to-date forms such as television and movies. In fact, any work that is exceptionally well crafted may be so described, as in the oft-heard statement that somebody has raised furniture making or penmanship or bookbinding “to the level of a fine art.” Thomas de Quincey, an English writer of the early nineteenth century, entitled an essay “On Murder as One of the Fine Arts.”

When people hear the term cultural literacy, they sometimes associate it with artistic culture — with opera, ballet, painting, poetry, sculpture, architecture, and classical music. These fine arts are, of course, only part of cultural literacy, but they do make up an important domain of experience that people must be aware of to communicate with other literate people in our society. For many people, the appreciation of the fine arts helps bring satisfaction, joy, and meaning to life; and every person deserves to be exposed to good art, whether popular or classical. But an old and true proverb tells us there is no disputing about taste. People who dislike ballet or Bach are not therefore unworthy or insensitive people. Nor is the art of our tradition inherently superior to that of other traditions. Yet every citizen does need an acquaintance with the enduring artistic works and artists of our tradition, if only because they are indispensable reference points for our shared lives.

Not all of these enduring works of our tradition are permanent reference points — unchanging monuments that will never be replaced by new works of art. New classics sometimes displace older ones, just as new buildings rise upon old ruins. But our cities wisely discriminate among the buildings that they permit to be torn down. Some buildings, such as the White House, the Empire State Building, and the Taj Mahal, deserve to be preserved both because of their artistic excellence and because of their symbolic and communal associations.

This section of our dictionary contains both the old and the new in the fine arts. Our principle for inclusion is not personal opinion about the merits of particular art or artists but our judgment of their established status as enduring points of reference in our culture. Everything that is included here is a classic — not because it is old or new, but because it has achieved broad currency. People refer to these works and artists without explanation, assuming that we will understand their reference. The arts are not just occasions for private appreciation and enrichment. Many of the images and songs and poems in our shared life are not only fine art but also indispensable symbols of our national existence. Indeed, much fine art of the past was not just something to be admired for its beauty but also something to be understood as part of public life. Bach’s religious music, the Egyptian pyramids, the Washington Monument, the American flag, and patriotic songs were and are living parts of communal life. The image of the cross and of the Star of David are more than formal designs. At their most reverberant, the fine arts are not just objects for private pleasure and contemplation but essential symbols that have helped define what we collectively are.

Anderson, Marian A twentieth-century AfricanAmerican contralto, known for her roles in opera and also for her performances of spirituals.

✥ In , a planned concert by Anderson at Constitution Hall was blocked by the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), who owned the hall, because she was black. With the support of the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his wife, Eleanor, Anderson gave a free concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which was attended by more than , people. ✥ Anderson was the first black person to sing with the Metropolitan Opera of New York City.

arch In architecture, a curved or pointed opening that spans a doorway, window, or other space.

✥ The form of arch used in building often serves to distinguish styles of architecture from one another. For example, Romanesque architecture usually employs a round arch, and Gothic architecture, a pointed arch.

aria (ahr-ee-uh) A piece of music for one voice (or occasionally two voices) in an opera, oratorio, or cantata. In contrast with recitative singing, arias are melodious; in contrast with ordinary songs, arias are usually elaborate.

$\clubsuit$ Some composers, such as Richard Wagner, have felt that arias interrupt the action of opera too much and hence have written operas without them.

Armstrong, Louis A twentieth-century AfricanAmerican jazz trumpet player and singer. His nickname, “Satchmo,” was short for “Satchel Mouth.” Armstrong, whose career spanned five decades, was celebrated for his trumpet solos and the gravelly voice in which he sang songs such as “Hello, Dolly” and “It’s a Wonderful World.”

art for art’s sake A slogan meaning that the beauty of the fine arts is reason enough for pursuing them that art does not have to serve purposes taken from politics, religion, economics, and so on.

Bach, Johann Sebastian (bahkh, bahk) An eighteenth-century German composer, organist, and choirmaster, commonly considered the greatest composer of the baroque era. His output was enormous and includes cantatas, concertos, oratorios, organ pieces, sonatas for solo instruments, and suites for both solo instruments and orchestra; all of it is marked by elaborate counterpoint. Some of Bach’s best-known works are the six Brandenburg Concertos; the Toccata and Fugue in D-minor for organ; and an arrangement of a hymn, “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring,” for chorus and orchestra.

Johann Sebastian Bach

barbershop singing A style of singing in parts for small groups, usually four singers of the same sex (“barbershop quartets”). The notes sung by the voices are usually close to each other in pitch, resulting in “tight” chords, or “close” harmony.

✥ Barbershop singing flourished in the early twentieth century in the United States, and barbershop groups today often prefer the songs from that period, including “Sweet Adeline” and “The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi.”

baritone A range of the male singing voice higher than bass and lower than tenor.

Barnum, Phineas T. A nineteenth-century American showman known for his circus, “The Greatest Show on Earth.” His sideshows were particularly notable, even though many of the “freaks” he advertised were hoaxes. After Barnum’s death, his circus was absorbed into the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

✥ According to a famous story, when someone pointed out that his customers had reason to be angry because freaks in his show were fakes, Barnum replied, “There’s a sucker born every minute.”

“Yankee Doodle” A popular American song, dating from the eighteenth century. The early settlers of New York were Dutch, and the Dutch name for Johnny is Janke, pronounced “Yankee.” This is the most likely origin of the term Yankee. Doodle meant “simpleton” in seventeenth-century English. First sung during the American Revolutionary War by the British troops to poke fun at the strange ways of the Americans (Yankees), the song was soon adopted by American troops themselves. Since then, the song has been considered an expression of American patriotism. The popular version of the first stanza is:

Yankee Doodle came to town Riding on a pony; He stuck a feather in his hat And called it macaroni. Yankee Doodle, keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy; Mind the music and the step, And with the girls be handy.

“Yankee Doodle Dandy” A song by George M. Cohan. The refrain begins, “I’m a Yankee Doodle dandy, / A Yankee Doodle, do or die. . .

# World History to 

This section covers the period from the beginnings of civilization in the Stone Age through the rise and fall of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations, to the Dark Ages, the Middle Ages, and the beginnings of the Renaissance and the Reformation. The Stone Age ended roughly around  b.c. with the beginning of the Bronze Age, which encompassed the years from about  b.c. to  b.c., at which point the Iron Age began. The great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome developed during the Iron Age. Egyptian civilization flourished in the second millennium b.c. and then declined. Ancient Greece reached the pinnacle of its influence in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c. and then saw its influence wane after the death of Alexander the Great in  b.c. The importance of Rome increased dramatically in the century before the birth of Jesus, in large measure because of the military conquests of Julius Caesar. Rome consolidated its rule over much of Europe, Asia Minor, and North Africa in the reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus Caesar, who died in a.d. .

The period from the Fall of Rome in the fifth century a.d. to roughly the tenth century is often called the Dark Ages. In the Medieval period, which is sometimes referred to as the age of chivalry, modern nation-states emerged. That period peaked between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries and then waned with the rise of the Renaissance in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Renaissance, a cultural rebirth during which many of the literary and artistic treasures of the ancient world were rediscovered, lasted into the seventeenth century. Starting in the fifteenth century, the religious rift of the Reformation divided Europe between Protestants and Roman Catholics.

Although American schools and colleges still use these divisions of history, we should be mindful that a growing number of Muslim, African, Asian, and Latino immigrants to the United States carry a different set of historical markers in their heads. To Muslims, for example, the Dark Ages, which Europeans associate with ignorance and barbarism, coincided with a glorious time, the rise and spread of Islam, whereas South Americans recognize that the civilization of the Mayas flourished during

Europe’s Dark Ages. To Asians, the period that Europeans call the Middle Ages coincided with the empire established by Genghis Khan, the largest land empire in history; to Africans, the Middle Ages paralleled the Mali empire.

Alexander the Great A ruler of Greece in the fourth century b.c. As a general, he conquered most of the ancient world, extending the civilization of Greece east to India. Alexander is said to have wept because there were no worlds left to conquer. In Alexander’s youth, the philosopher Aristotle was his tutor.

✥ Before beginning his conquests, Alexander allegedly unloosed the Gordian knot by cutting through it. It was believed that the person who unfastened the Gordian knot would rule a vast territory in Asia. Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, which became a great center of learning in Egypt.

Augustus Caesar The first emperor of Rome; the adopted son of Julius Caesar. In his reign, from  b.c. to a.d. , Rome enjoyed peace (see Pax Romana), and the arts flourished. The time of Augustus is considered a golden age for literature in Rome.

✥ Jesus was born during Augustus’s reign. ✥ The month of August is named for Augustus. ✥ A time when literature and the arts in a nation are at their height is sometimes called an “Augustan age.” The eighteenth century in England, when many excellent authors were at work, is called the Augustan Age of English literature.

✥ The killing of Becket is dramatized in plays by T. S. Eliot (Murder in the Cathedral) and the French playwright Jean Anouilh (Becket). ✥ Soon after Becket’s death, people from all over England began to go to his burial place in Canterbury to pray, especially sick persons, who prayed for healing.

For several years after Caesar was assassinated, she lived in Egypt with the Roman politician Mark Antony. Antony killed himself on hearing a false report that she was dead. After Antony’s death, Cleopatra committed suicide by allowing an asp, a poisonous snake, to bite her.

✥ The play Antony and Cleopatra, by William Shakespeare, dramatizes Cleopatra’s affair with Antony and her suicide.

✥ Ericson, rather than Christopher Columbus, is sometimes called the European discoverer of America. His discovery, however, is not indisputably documented, as the discovery of Columbus is. Also, Ericson’s voyages, unlike the voyages of Columbus, did not result in continuous colonization.

Fall of Rome The collapse of the Roman Empire in the fifth century. Two of the main events of the Fall of Rome were the plundering of the city of Rome by an invading tribe, the Vandals, in the middle years of the century and the abdication of the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in .

Then, about  b.c., the Roman Republic was established, with two annually elected consuls at its head, guided by a senate. The republic eventually weakened, and Rome passed to rule by one man — first Julius Caesar, who was assassinated in $4 4 \ \mathrm { B . C }$ . His successor was Augustus, who assumed the title of emperor. Over the next few centuries, he was followed by a succession of emperors. The whole Western world eventually became subject to Rome and was at peace for roughly the first four centuries after the birth of Jesus (see Pax Romana). The empire was known for its strongly centralized government and for massive public works, such as roads and aqueducts, which helped maintain its power and efficiency. As the years passed, the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western portions (see Byzantine Empire and Constantine the Great), developed internal weaknesses, was invaded by outside tribes, and eventually ceased to exist (see Fall of Rome).

![](img/9eca13b2c07b12203c15b0016efd619aeb16730df913975991b0c442ea6c2c81.jpg)

Historians often call the period from the middle of the sixteenth century to the outbreak of the French Revolution in  the early modern era. This era includes the Renaissance and the Reformation, both of which extended from the fifteenth through the seventeenth centuries, and the Enlightenment, which extended through the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The American and French Revolutions mark the beginning of modern history. The French Revolution introduced a period of political upheaval in Europe that included the wars fought between the s and  by Napoleon Bonaparte, the Napoleonic wars. The Congress of Vienna in  brought peace to Europe but did not extinguish the flames of democracy and nationalism that had flared up during the French Revolution. The twin forces of democracy and nationalism exploded again in the so-called Revolutions of . Between  and , both Italy and Germany emerged as modern nation-states.

The period between  and  witnessed intensifying nationalistic and imperial rivalries in Europe, culminating with the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and the outbreak of World War I in . During the war, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Russia opposed Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. The United States entered the war in  and contributed to the victory of Great Britain and France in . Before the conclusion of the war, the Russian monarchy collapsed, and the Bolsheviks came to power in the Russian Revolution.

During the s and s, Joseph Stalin consolidated the power of communism in the Soviet Union, while nationalistic and militaristic governments arose in Germany (the Nazis under Adolf Hitler), Italy (the fascists under Mussolini), and Japan. World War II commenced with Hitler’s invasion of Poland in . In , Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, and Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor. By , the Axis powers had surrendered; Japan capitulated after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

New tensions developed after World War II between the United States and the Soviet Union. This conflict, which embraced political and economic competition but not direct military confrontation, is known as the cold war. During the late s and s, Europe divided into armed camps: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), led by the United States, and the Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviet Union. Inevitably, the cold war affected Asia as well as Europe. Communists backed by the Soviet Union gained power in China in  but soon broke with the Soviet Union in a great power rivalry. Communist and anticommunist forces clashed in the Korean War (–) and again in the Vietnam War (s–). Despite these conflicts, the shared fear of nuclear war led the United States and Soviet Union to seek compromise and mutual understanding, called détente, during the s and s.

At the end of the s, communism began to disintegrate, first in eastern Europe and then in the Soviet Union. Although ending the cold war, the collapse of communism created new sources of international instability by bringing long-suppressed nationalism to the surface in the former countries of the Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia. The s also saw the intensification of militant Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Middle East and in parts of Asia. To a degree, conflicting religious ideals and the antagonism between religious fervor and secular values began to replace the older political ideologies as the basis of international strife.

Roosevelt of the United States and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union in opposition to Germany. Stuncollapse of communism A stunning series of events between  and  that led to the fall of communist regimes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Faced with massive popular opposition and the unwillingness of President Mikhail Gorbachev to send Soviet troops to their rescue, communist governments lost power, first in Poland, where the communists agreed to free elections that swept into power candidates endorsed by Solidarity in June . Demands for reform spread across East Germany in the fall of  and led to the end of the Berlin Wall and the unification of East and West Germany. In November  the communist government of Czechoslovakia resigned, and in December a violent revolution led to the overthrow and execution of Romania’s communist boss, Nicolae Ceausescu. The Bulgarian parliament revoked the Communist party’s monopoly on power in , and in  popular opposition forced the resignation of the communist cabinet in Albania. The failure of a communistled coup d’état against Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union in August  ended the party’s control of the military and government.

fascism (fash-iz-uhm) A system of government that flourished in Europe from the s to the end of World War II. Germany under Adolf Hitler, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco were all fascist states. As a rule, fascist governments are dominated by a dictator, who usually possesses a magnetic personality, wears a showy uniform, and rallies his followers by mass parades; appeals to strident nationalism; and promotes suspicion or hatred of both foreigners and “impure” people within his own nation, such as the Jews in Germany. Although both communism and fascism are forms of totalitarianism, fascism does not demand state ownership of the means of production, nor is fascism committed to the achievement of economic equality. In theory, communism opposes the identification of government with a single charismatic leader (the “cult of personality”), which is the cornerstone of fascism. Whereas communists are considered left-wing, fascists are usually described as right-wing.

✥ Today, the term fascist is used loosely to refer to military dictatorships, as well as governments or individuals that profess racism and that act in an arbitrary, high-handed manner.

French Revolution The event at the end of the eighteenth century that ended the thousand-year rule of kings in France and established the nation as a republic. The revolution began in , after King Louis xvi had convened the French parliament to deal with an enormous national debt. The common people’s division of the parliament declared itself the true legislature of France, and when the king seemed to resist the move, a crowd destroyed the royal prison (the Bastille). A constitutional monarchy was set up, but after King Louis and his queen, Marie Antoinette, tried to flee the country, they were arrested, tried for treason, and executed on the guillotine. Control of the government passed to Robespierre and other radicals — the extreme Jacobins — and the Reign of Terror followed (–), when thousands of French nobles and others considered enemies of the revolution were executed. After the Terror, Robespierre himself was executed, and a new ruling body, the Directory, came into power. Its incompetence and corruption allowed Napoleon Bonaparte to emerge in  as dictator and, eventually, to become emperor. Napoleon’s ascent to power is considered the official end of the revolution. (See Georges Danton and JeanPaul Marat.)

A leader of the Liberal party and a political opponent of Benjamin Disraeli, he served as prime minister several times during the reign of Queen Victoria. One of Gladstone’s strongest interests, not satisfied in his lifetime, was providing Ireland with a government of its own. He served in the British parliament for sixty years.

Glorious Revolution A revolution in Britain in  in which the parliament deposed King James II, a Roman Catholic who had asserted royal rights over the rights of Parliament. Parliament gave the crown to the Protestant King William III, a Dutch prince, and his British wife, Queen Mary II (daughter of James II), as joint rulers.

The Glorious Revolution was the last genuine revolution in Britain. Because there was little armed resistance in England to William and Mary, the revolution is also called the Bloodless Revolution. Battles did take place in Scotland and Ireland, however, between supporters of the new king and queen and the supporters of King James.

✥ When the crown was offered to William and Mary, they agreed to a Bill of Rights that severely limited the king or queen’s power. The British Bill of Rights is often regarded as a forerunner to the United States Bill of Rights.

Gorbachev, Mikhail (mi-khah-eel gawr-buh-chawf, gawr-buh-chawf) The last president of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev came to power in . Although a committed communist, he sought to revive the ailing Soviet economy by introducing some elements of capitalist competition (a policy he called perestroika, or “restructuring”) and to encourage free expression by a policy of glasnost. Perestroika failed to stimulate the economy, while glasnost spurred popular criticism of communism itself and the surfacing of long-repressed nationalism in the republics that composed the Soviet Union. In  hard-line communists, many of them Gorbachev’s appointees, staged a coup d’état against him. Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic, rallied opposition against the coup, which also faced international criticism and aroused only lukewarm support in the Soviet military. The coup quickly collapsed and Gorbachev returned to the presidency, but with such weakened prestige that he was unable to prevent the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism.

They established an English branch of their family that still rules Britain. George III, Queen Victoria, and Queen Elizabeth II have been Hanoverians, although Victoria and her descendants have not used the family name Hanover. The control of the government of Britain by parliament has been greatly strengthened under Hanoverian rule, and the governmental role of the king or queen much reduced.

✥ The first two Hanoverian kings, George I and George II, took little interest in their new country. George I spent most of his time in Germany and never bothered to learn the English language.

Hapsburgs Austrian-based dynasty that ruled much of central and parts of western Europe from the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries. The family’s head long held the title of Holy Roman Emperor (see Holy Roman Empire). By  the Hapsburg-ruled AustroHungarian Empire included all or part of territories that later became independent nations, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

The latter invasion provoked a military response from the United Nations, led by the United States, which drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait in . (See Persian Gulf War.)

✥ Hussein’s cruelty and deviousness have become legendary. He has ruthlessly suppressed both Shi’ite Muslims and Kurds within Iraq; in  and  he authorized poison gas attacks on Kurdish villages. ✥ Although widely loathed outside the Arab world and feared by most Arab governments, Hussein retains some of his appeal to the Arab masses because of his resolute defiance of the United States and western Europe.

Nazis (naht-seez, nat-seez) A German political party of the twentieth century, led by Adolf Hitler. The Nazis controlled Germany from the early s until the end of World War II. The party’s full name in English is National Socialist German Workers’ party; Nazi is short for its German name. Despite the word socialist in its name, it was a fascist party, requiring from its members supreme devotion to the German government — the Third Reich (see fascism and socialism). The Nazis rose to power by promising the people that Germany, which had been humiliated after World War I, would become powerful again.

The Nazis opposed communism and free intellectual inquiry. Desiring to form a master race that would rule the world, they fought the influence in Germany of peoples not of “pure” descent. Their power was particularly directed at controlling Jews in Germany and in the countries that Germany conquered in war. After depriving Jews of their property and confining them in concentration camps, the Nazis employed the Final Solution of killing them in large numbers; an estimated six million Jews lost their lives (see Holocaust). Also marked for extermination were the mentally and physically handicapped and “enemies of the Reich” such as Slavs, communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, Christians who resisted the government, and defenders of intellectual freedom. The Nazis fought World War II to spread their principles worldwide but were defeated. Twenty-two of their leaders were convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.

A great number of symbols, images, and names are associated with the reign of the Nazis, including the swastika emblem; the stiff-armed salute; the greeting “heil Hitler”; the goose-step march; mass political rallies; concentration camps, such as Auschwitz and Dachau; and Hitler’s aides Adolf Eichmann, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering, and Heinrich Himmler.

A loose federation, known as the Commonwealth of Independent States and made up of some former Soviet republics, succeeded it, but the Commonwealth is not recognized as a nation. Russia took the former Soviet Union’s seat on the Security Council of the United Nations.

Spanish Civil War A war fought in the late s in Spain. On one side were the Loyalists, Spaniards loyal to a recently elected government in the form of a republic; on the other side were fascists (see fascism), led by General Francisco Franco. The Soviet Union sent aid to the Loyalists, some of whom were communists; the German and Italian fascist dictators, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, supported Franco. The Spanish fascists won the war and set up Franco’s long rule of Spain as a dictator.

✥ Many Americans favored one side or the other in the Spanish Civil War, particularly people of leftwing sympathies, who supported the Loyalists. The Abraham Lincoln Brigade included Americans who traveled to Spain to fight in the Loyalist cause.

SS An elite corps of combat troops (SS is short for Schutzstaffel, which is German for “protective shield”) formed originally within the German Nazi party as a bodyguard for Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders and led by Heinrich Himmler. During the s, Hitler steadily expanded the responsibilities of the SS to include the suppression of his political opponents within Germany and the persecution of the Jews. The SS supervised the concentration camps.

Stalin, Joseph (stah-lin, stal-in) A Soviet political leader of the twentieth century. Stalin ruled the Soviet Union, often with extreme brutality, from the death of Lenin in the early s until his own death in the early s. His policies of collectivization, which abolished private ownership, were followed by political purges in which thousands of Communist party officials were killed, usually on trumped-up charges of treason. (See Stalin’s purge trials.) Stalin led the Soviet Union in its costly victory in World War II; the country again

Suez Canal crisis A major international incident that arose in  from the decision by Gamal A. Nasser of Egypt to nationalize the Suez Canal, which long had been controlled by Great Britain. After Nasser took over the canal, Britain and France induced Israel to provoke a conflict with Egypt that would serve as a pretext for an Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. The United States, which had been excluded from the planned invasion, denounced it. The incident severely damaged Anglo-American relations.

Suharto (suh-hahr-toh) A soldier and statesman in Indonesia in the twentieth century. An abortive coup by communists in  led to the gradual devolution of power from Sukarno to the army, with Suharto assuming power in .

Thirty Years’ War A war waged in the early seventeenth century that involved France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, and numerous states of Germany. The causes of the war were rooted in national rivalries and in conflict between Roman Catholics and Protestants. For all the bloodshed, there was no decisive winner or loser. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the war in , did affirm, however, that the German states could be Catholic or Protestant at the choice of their rulers.

The treaty also created the League of Nations.

Vichy government (vish-ee, vee-shee) The government of France after Germany defeated and occupied it at the beginning of World War II (see fall of France); Vichy, the capital, is a small city in central France. The Vichy government was essentially a puppet of the Germans.

Victoria, Queen A British queen of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During her reign, Britain reached new heights in industrial and colonial power and diplomatic influence. Victoria became queen at the age of eighteen and soon married Prince Albert, who proved an enormous support to her; after his early death, she remained in official mourning until her own death forty years later. Victoria was known for her impartiality toward the two leading political parties of Britain, the Liberals and the Conservatives, which both produced extraordinary leaders during her reign (see Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone). She was also known for establishing strict standards of personal morality. (See Victorian period.)

✥ Queen Victoria’s children and grandchildren married into many of the other royal families of Europe. Tragically, many of them passed on the disease hemophilia. Victoria carried the disease in her genes, and one of her sons died from it. The hemophiliac son of Nicholas II, the czar of Russia, was descended from Victoria. (See Grigori Rasputin.) ✥ The term Victorian today sometimes recalls Queen Victoria’s stands on personal moral issues and may suggest prudery or a moral self-satisfaction.

Victorian period The period of British history when Queen Victoria ruled; it includes the entire second half of the nineteenth century, a time when Britain was the most powerful nation in the world. The Victorian period was known for a rather stern morality. It was also marked by a general earnestness about life and by a confidence that Britain’s domestic prosperity (see Industrial Revolution) and vast holdings overseas (see British Empire) were signs of the country’s overall righteousness (see white man’s burden). As the Victorian period continued, however, such easy beliefs were increasingly challenged.

✥ The Victorian period produced a great number of diverse writers and thinkers. (See Robert Browning; Charles Darwin; Charles Dickens; Rudyard Kipling; John Stuart Mill; Robert Louis Stevenson; and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.)

Vienna, Congress of A conference of European nations held in , after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte. It redrew the boundaries of Europe and sought to lay the groundwork for peace.

✥ Waterloo has become a general term for a decisive, final defeat.

Weimar Republic (veye-mahr, weye-mahr) A common name for the democratic government of Ger

Battle of Waterloo. The defeat of Napoleon.

many between the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II and the assumption of power by Adolf Hitler in ; Weimar, Germany, was where its constitution was drawn up. The constitution abolished the several constitutional monarchies that had previously formed the German Empire. The Weimar government was unpopular because of its acceptance of the harsh provisions of the Treaty of Versailles; the large penalties Germany had to pay caused economic chaos in the country, with German money declining daily in value. Germany’s Weimar years, however, were a period of political freedom and cultural creativity, both of which were snuffed out by Hitler.

Wellington, duke of Arthur Wellesley, a British general of the nineteenth century, revered in his country as the victor over the emperor Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo.

✥ Wellington is known for allegedly saying “the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.” Eton is a famous English boarding school for boys. Wellington’s statement emphasizes the effect of people’s moral training and breeding on their later life.

West Germany Popular name for the Federal Republic of Germany before the reunification of Germany in . Bonn was the seat of its government.

✥ West Germany was a member of NATO. ✥ Established in , after dissension between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the division of Germany into East Germany and West Germany, it was formed out of the states included in the American,

French, and British occupation zones. ✥ The Bonn Convention in  essentially granted West Germany national sovereignty. In , West Germany was recognized as an independent country. ✥ It made a swift recovery, called the “economic miracle” from the devastation of World War II. ✥ With the collapse of communism, West Germany absorbed East Germany. Berlin became the capital of the united Germany.

white man’s burden A phrase used to justify European imperialism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; it is the title of a poem by Rudyard Kipling. The phrase implies that imperialism was motivated by a high-minded desire of whites to uplift people of color.

Wilhelm II (vil-helm, wil-helm) A German emperor, or kaiser, of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After disagreements with Kaiser Wilhelm in the late nineteenth century, Otto von Bismarck resigned as head of the German government.

He lived the rest of his life in obscurity in The Netherlands.

William and Mary King William III and Queen Mary II of England, who ruled jointly after the Glorious Revolution of  had expelled Mary’s father, King James II.

Windsor, duke of An English nobleman of the twentieth century who ruled Britain as King Edward VIII in . He gave up the throne after less than a year to marry an American divorcée, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson, because British law did not permit a divorced woman to become queen.

✥ In a famous speech to the British people announcing his abdication, the duke said that he could not carry on as king “without the help and support of the woman I love.”

World War I A war fought from  to  between the Allies, notably Britain, France, Russia, and Italy (which entered in ), and the Central

Powers: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. The war was sparked by the assassination in  of the heir to the throne of Austria (see Sarajevo). Prolonged stalemates, trench warfare, and immense casualties on both sides marked the fighting. The United States sought to remain neutral but was outraged by the sinking of the Lusitania by a German submarine in  and by Germany’s decision in  to start unrestricted submarine warfare. In , the United States entered the war on the side of the Allies and helped to tip the balance in their favor. In full retreat on its western front, Germany asked for an armistice, or truce, which was granted on November , . By the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, signed in , Germany had to make extensive concessions to the Allies and pay large penalties. The government leaders of World War I included Georges Clemenceau of France, David Lloyd George of Britain, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and Woodrow Wilson of the United States. World War I was known as the Great War, or the World War, until World War II broke out. (See map, next page.)

✥ German discontent over the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and over the Weimar Republic that had accepted its provisions, led to the rise of the Nazis and Adolf Hitler, who pursued warlike policies not adequately opposed by the rest of Europe. Thus, barely twenty years after World War I was over, World War II began. ✥ A huge number of books, songs, and poems have been written about World War I. (See All Quiet on the Western Front; A Farewell to Arms; and “In Flanders Fields”.) ✥ “Over There” was among the popular songs produced in the United States during the war. ✥ American foot soldiers in World War I were popularly called doughboys. ✥ November , the day the fighting ended, is observed in the United States as Veterans’ Day.

World War II A war fought from  to  between the Axis powers — Germany, Italy, and Ja pan — and the Allies, including France and Britain, and later the Soviet Union and the United States. The war began when the Germans, governed by the Nazi party, invaded Poland in September  (see invasion of Poland). Germany then conquered France, using blitzkrieg tactics, and forced a desperate British withdrawal at Dunkirk. The Germans tried to wear down the British by heavy bombing, but the

British withstood the attacks (see Battle of Britain). The Soviet Union signed a treaty with Adolf Hitler but entered the war on the side of the Allies after Germany invaded Russia in . The United States was drawn into the war in , when the Japanese suddenly attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. Japan made extensive conquests in east Asia but was checked by American victories at the Battle of Midway Island and elsewhere. The German invasion of Russia was halted at the Battle of Stalingrad. Allied forces took much of Italy in , forcing its surrender. Beginning with the invasion of Normandy in  (see D-Day), the Allies liberated France from German occupation and pressed on in Europe, defeating the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge and elsewhere. Germany surrendered in May  (see V-E Day). The war in the Pacific ended in September  (see V-J Day), after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the aftermath of World War II, more constructive and less punitive measures were applied to the defeated countries than after World War I (see Marshall Plan, Nuremberg trials, and United Nations).

✥ The political leaders of the war included Winston Churchill of Britain, Adolf Hitler of Germany, Benito Mussolini of Italy, Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. The military leaders included Charles De Gaulle of France; Bernard Montgomery of Britain; Hermann Goering and Erwin Rommel of Germany; Tito of Yugoslavia; and Omar Bradley, Dwight Eisenhower, William Halsey, Douglas MacArthur, Chester Nimitz, and George Patton of the United States.

Yalta agreement (yawl-tuh) An agreement reached near the end of World War II between President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain, and Premier Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union. The three met in Yalta, in the southern Soviet Union, in February , and discussed issues such as the occupation of Germany, free elections in the liberated countries of eastern Europe, the postwar boundaries of Poland and Russia, and a common strategy against Japan. Stalin aided the United States against Japan, as he had promised; but he expanded Soviet influence rapidly into eastern Europe after the war, and the elections he agreed to were never held.

Boris Yeltsin. The Russian president gives a speech to the Russian legislature in Moscow, .

Yeltsin, Boris President of the Russian republic who criticized the slow pace of Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms. In , he successfully led the opposition to an attempted coup by communist hard-liners and became the most powerful person in the former Soviet Union. As president, Yeltsin led the Russian republic in its difficult and often chaotic struggle to move away from centralized economic planning, but he was plagued by poor health, conservative opposition, and a lagging economy. He was succeeded by Vladimir Putin.

Zapata, Emiliano (ay-meel-yah-noh sah-pah-tuh) A Mexican revolutionary leader of the twentieth century. He overran plantations in the Mexican Revolution of , dividing the land among peasants. He did not accept the new government’s promises of reform in  and lived as an outlaw until he was killed in .

Zhou En-lai (Chou En-lai) (joh en-leye) A Chinese political leader of the twentieth century. Zhou was a founder of the Chinese Communist party and an ally of Mao Zedong. As China’s premier, he helped establish closer relations between his country and Western nations in the s.

The era between the first permanent English settlements in North America in the early s and the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  is called the Colonial period. America’s desire for independence from Britain led to the Revolutionary War (or American Revolution). The fighting phase of the war lasted from  to the Battle of Yorktown in . The Treaty of Paris () concluded the war, with British recognition of American independence. During the $1 7 8 0 s$ , the new nation struggled to develop suitable political institutions. In $1 7 8 7$ , a convention met in Philadelphia and framed the Constitution, a document designed to provide a stronger central government than that provided by the Articles of Confederation. The states ratified the Constitution in $1 7 8 8$ .

Political divisions arose during the presidency of George Washington (–) between the followers of Alexander Hamilton, called the Federalist party, and those of Thomas Jefferson, known as the Democratic-Republican party. These divisions continued during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson (–), whose achievements included the Louisiana Purchase (), and that of James Madison (–). The War of 1812 between Britain and the United States severely damaged the Federalist party, which collapsed as a force in national politics. The years  to , called the Era of Good Feeling, were marked by diminishing political divisions.

During the late s and s, political conflict resurfaced as new parties, the Whigs and the Democratic party, clashed over a variety of issues. Although both parties developed national followings during the presidency of Andrew Jackson (–), each was vulnerable to disruption between its northern and southern wings over the issue of slavery in the South. Already evident in the struggle over the Missouri Compromise (), sectional conflict between the North and the South was sparked anew by the Mexican War (–) and exploded in the s. During the s, the Whig party collapsed in the North and was replaced by the Republican party, a purely sectional party. The Democratic party split into northern and southern wings in . The election of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, in  provoked the secession of the southern states and led to the outbreak of the Civil War (–). The war resulted in a victory for the North and in the destruction of slavery as an institution.

abolitionism The belief that slavery should be abolished. In the early nineteenth century, increasing numbers of people in the northern United States held that the nation’s slaves should be freed immediately, without compensation to slave owners. John Brown, Frederick W. Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman were well-known abolitionists.

$\clubsuit$ Abolitionism in the United States was an important factor leading to the Civil War.

Adams, John A political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; one of the Founding Fathers. Adams was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was the second president, from  to , after George Washington. Washington and Adams were the only presidents from the Federalist party. Adams’s presidency was marked by diplomatic challenges, in which he avoided war with France. The Alien and Sedition Acts were passed while he was president.

Adams, John Quincy A political leader of the early nineteenth century. John Quincy Adams was the son of John Adams and was president of the United States from  to , between James Monroe and Andrew Jackson. The defeat of the scholarly Adams by the uneducated Jackson in the presidential election of  is considered a turning point in the journey toward democracy in American politics.

Adams, Samuel A political leader at the time of the American Revolutionary War. From the time of the Stamp Act to the Declaration of Independence, he was the most effective organizer in Massachusetts of opposition to British rule.

✥ Adams was a brewer and a cousin of John Adams.

✥ Rallying under the cry “Remember the Alamo!”, Texans later forced the Mexicans to recognize the independent republic of Texas.

Alien and Sedition Acts A series of laws, passed during the presidency of John Adams at the end of the eighteenth century, that sought to restrict the public activities of political radicals who sympathized with the French Revolution and criticized Adams’s Federalist policies. In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson wrote the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, which asserted states’ rights.

The American Crisis A series of pamphlets written by Thomas Paine during the Revolutionary War, in which Paine discussed issues of the revolution. The first pamphlet begins with a memorable statement: “These are the times that try men’s souls.”

Appomattox Court House. A detail from a painting by Mathieu Didier Guillaume, depicting the surrender of General Lee to General Grant.

Arnold, Benedict An American general of the Revolutionary War. He performed notably in the early days of the war but became bitter over several setbacks to his career. After receiving command of the American fort at West Point, New York, Arnold plotted to betray it to the British. The plan was revealed when the American forces captured Major John André of the British army, who was carrying messages between Arnold and the British. Arnold escaped to England and continued a military career, but he was widely scorned by the English.

✥ Calling someone a “Benedict Arnold” is to label the person a traitor.

Articles of Confederation An agreement among the thirteen original states, approved in $1 7 8 1$ , that provided a loose federal government before the present Constitution went into effect in $1 7 8 9$ . There was no chief executive or judiciary, and the legislature of the Confederation had no authority to collect taxes.

Bill of Rights The first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Among other provisions, they protect the freedoms of speech, religion, assembly, and the press (see First Amendment); restrict governmental rights of search and seizure; and list several rights of persons accused of crimes (see Fifth Amendment).

✥ After the new Constitution was submitted to the states in $1 7 8 7$ , several approved it only after being assured that it would have a bill of rights attached to it. Accordingly, these amendments were passed by the first Congress under the Constitution and were ratified by the states in .

Cornered later in a barn, he died of gunshot wounds, possibly inflicted by himself.

Boston Massacre. A lithograph by W. Champney. Crispus Attucks (center) was one of five killed at the scene of the massacre.

Boston Massacre A clash between British troops and townspeople in Boston in , before the Revolutionary War. The British fired into a crowd that was threatening them, killing five, including Crispus Attucks. The soldiers had been sent to help the government maintain order and were resented even before this incident. The killings increased the colonists’ inclination toward revolution.

Boston Tea Party An act of defiance toward the British government by American colonists; it took place in , before the Revolutionary War. The government in London had given a British company the right to sell tea directly to the colonies, thereby undercutting American merchants. A group of colonists found a ship in the harbor of Boston that was loaded with the company’s tea. They dressed as Native Americans, boarded the ship, and threw hundreds of chests of tea overboard. The British government then tried to punish the colonists by closing the port of Boston, but this move only intensified American resistance to the rule of the king.

Brown, John An abolitionist of the nineteenth century who sought to free the slaves by military force. After leading several attacks in Kansas, he planned to start an uprising among the slaves. In $^ { 1 8 5 9 }$ , he and a small band of followers took over a federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, in Virginia. A detachment of marines reclaimed the arsenal and captured Brown, who was tried for treason, convicted, and hanged.

✥ Robert E. Lee, soon to be commanding general of the main Confederate army, led the marines who captured Brown. ✥ In death, Brown became a martyr for abolitionists. “John Brown’s Body,” a popular song in the North during the Civil War, had this refrain: “John Brown’s body lies a-mold’ring in the grave; His soul goes marching on.”

Bull Run, Battle of The first battle of the American Civil War, fought in Virginia near Washington, D.C. The surprising victory of the Confederate army humiliated the North and forced it to prepare for a long war. A year later the Confederacy won another victory near the same place. This battle is called the Second Battle of Bull Run. The South referred to these two encounters as the First and Second Battles of Manassas.

Bunker Hill, Battle of The first great battle of the Revolutionary War; it was fought near Boston in June . The British drove the Americans from their fort at Breed’s Hill to Bunker Hill, but only after the Americans had run out of gunpowder. Before retreating, the Americans killed many British troops.

✥ The Battle of Bunker Hill was an encouragement to the colonies; it proved that American forces, with sufficient supplies, could inflict heavy losses on the British. ✥ An American officer, William Prescott, is said to have ordered during the battle, “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.”

Burr, Aaron A political leader who served as vice president of the United States in the first term of Thomas Jefferson (–). After Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in the Burr-Hamilton duel, his career declined. He was later involved in a bizarre conspiracy to sever the western states and territories from the Union. Burr was tried for treason but was acquitted.

Burr-Hamilton duel A duel fought in  between Aaron Burr, vice president of the United States, and Alexander Hamilton, former secretary of the treasury. The two had been bitter political opponents for years. Burr shot and killed Hamilton.

Calhoun, John C. (kal-hoohn) The leading southern politician of the early nineteenth century; he served as vice president under both John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson and then was elected senator from South Carolina. Calhoun championed slavery and states’ rights. During the early s, he led the nullification movement, which maintained that when a state found a federal law unacceptable, the state had the right to declare the law null, or inoperative, within its borders. Nullification was aimed particularly at the high protective tariff of ; Calhoun opposed protective tariffs. A man of powerful intellect, Calhoun increasingly became obsessed with the South’s minority status and with finding ways to protect slavery. Although he died in $1 8 5 0$ , his influence helped point the South toward secession and the Civil War.

Carson, Kit A skilled frontier trapper and guide of the nineteenth century, who helped open the territory of California to settlement from the United States. A general on the Union side in the Civil War, he moved a great number of Navajos by force in the s; many died on the journey.

Chancellorsville, Battle of An important battle of the Civil War, fought in Virginia in . The South, led by Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, defeated a larger northern army, but Jackson was accidentally shot and killed by his own men after the battle.

Cherokees (cher-uh-keez) A Native American tribe who lived in the Southeast in the early nineteenth century; the Cherokees were known as one of the “civilized tribes” because they built schools and published a newspaper. In the s, the United States government forcibly removed most of the tribe to reservations west of the Mississippi River. (See Trail of Tears.)

Civil War The war fought in the United States between northern (Union) and southern (Confederate) states from  to , in which the Confederacy sought to establish itself as a separate nation. The Civil War is also known as the War for Southern Independence and as the War between the States. The war grew out of deep-seated differences between the social structure and economy of North and South, most notably over slavery; generations of political maneuvers had been unable to overcome these differences (see Missouri Compromise and Compromise of ). The secession of the southern states began in late , after Abraham Lincoln was elected president.

The Confederacy was formed in early . The fighting began with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. Most of the battles took place in the South, but one extremely crucial episode, the Battle of Gettysburg, was fought in the North. The war ended with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House. (See Battle of Bull Run, Battle of Chancellorsville, Emancipation Proclamation, and Sherman’s march to the sea; also see map, next page.)

✥ The Civil War has been the most serious test yet of the ability of the United States to remain one nation.

Clay, Henry A Whig political leader of the early nineteenth century known for his efforts to keep the United States one nation despite sharp controversy among Americans over slavery. Clay represented Kentucky, first in the House of Representatives and then in the Senate. He was known as the “Great Pacificator” because of his prominent role in producing the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of $1 8 5 0$ .

✥ Clay ran unsuccessfully for president three times. He once said in a speech, “I would rather be right than be president.”

Common Sense () A pamphlet written by Thomas Paine that called for the United States to declare independence from Britain immediately. Written in a brisk and pungent style, Common Sense had a tremendous impact and helped to persuade many Americans that they could successfully wage a war for their independence.

Compromise of  A set of laws, passed in the midst of fierce wrangling between groups favoring slavery and groups opposing it, that attempted to give something to both sides. The compromise admitted California to the United States as a “free” (no slavery) state but allowed some newly acquired territories to decide on slavery for themselves. Part of the Compromise included the Fugitive Slave Act, which proved highly unpopular in the North. Senator Henry Clay was a force behind the passage of the compro mise.

✥ The Compromise of $1 8 5 0$ shows how difficult it was to accommodate the two sides of the slavery question. It failed to prevent the Civil War, which broke out just over ten years later.

Confederacy The Confederate States of America; the government formed in  by southern states that proclaimed their secession from the United States. Jefferson Davis was its president. The Confederacy was dissolved after the Civil War. (Compare Union.)

Confederate A descriptive term for the institutions and people of the Confederacy.

Constitution The fundamental law of the United States, drafted in Philadelphia in  (see Constitutional Convention), ratified in $1 7 8 8$ , and put into effect in . It established a strong central government in place of the Articles of Confederation. (See Preamble to the Constitution.)

Constitutional Convention The gathering that drafted the Constitution of the United States in $1 7 8 7$ ; all states were invited to send delegates. The convention, meeting in Philadelphia, designed a government with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It established Congress as a lawmaking body with two houses: each state is given two representatives in the Senate, whereas representation in the House of Representatives is based on population.

Continental Congress An assembly of delegates from the thirteen colonies (soon to become the thirteen states). It governed during the Revolutionary War and under the Articles of Confederation. The Continental Congress first met in , before the revolution. When it reconvened in , it organized for war against B and eventually passed the Declaration of Independence.

Cornwallis, Charles (kawrn-wah-lis, kawrn-waw-lis) A British nobleman and general who commanded British forces in the Revolutionary War. The surrender of Lord Cornwallis to George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown in  ended the hostilities of the revolution.

Coronado, Francisco (kawr-uh-nah-doh) A Spanish explorer of the sixteenth century. Coronado traveled through much of what is now the southwestern United States searching for the legendary “seven gold cities of Cibola,” but found no treasure. One of his men was the first European to discover the Grand Canyon.

covered wagon A typical conveyance for settlers moving west with their belongings. It was drawn by horses or oxen and equipped with a canvas cover, often supported by hoops, to keep off rain.

Crockett, Davy A frontier settler and political leader of the nineteenth century. Crockett was born in Tennessee and was killed at the Alamo by Mexican troops in . Although he cultivated the image of a rough man of the bush, Crockett was politically ambitious and served in Congress.

✥ Crockett’s trademark was a coonskin cap. ✥ Crockett served in the army under Andrew Jackson. He opposed Jackson’s policies, however, when Jackson was president and Crockett was in Congress.

Damn the torpedoes An exclamation by David Farragut, an officer in the Union navy in the Civil War. Warned of mines, called torpedoes, in the water ahead, Farragut said, “Damn the torpedoes! Captain Drayton, go ahead! Jouett, full speed!”

Davis, Jefferson A political leader of the nineteenth century. He was a powerful cabinet officer in the s. When his home state of Mississippi seceded from the Union (see secession), Davis left the Senate to join the government of the Confederacy. He served as president of the Confederacy throughout its existence.

Declaration of Independence The fundamental document establishing the United States as a nation, adopted on July , . The declaration was ordered and approved by the Continental Congress and written largely by Thomas Jefferson. It declared the thirteen colonies represented in the Continental Congress independent from Britain, offered reasons for the separation, and laid out the principles for which the Revolutionary War was fought. The signers included John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, and Jefferson. The declaration begins (capitalization and punctuation are modernized): “When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to

Declaration of Independence. From a stone engraving made by printer William J. Stone for the Department of State on July , .

be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new govenment, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.”

✥ The day of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence is now commemorated as the Fourth of July, or Independence Day.

Democratic party A political party that arose in the s from a split in the Democratic-Republican party. Andrew Jackson was the first president elected from the Democratic party. The other Democratic presidents elected before the Civil War were Martin

Van Buren, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan. The party generally opposed the national bank, high protective tariffs, interference with slavery, and federal aid for internal improvements in the nation — all measures that the Whigs came to favor. The Democrats’ greatest strength was with farmers, laborers, and people of the frontier.

Dix, Dorothea Nineteenth-century reformer who protested the practice of confining the mentally ill in prisons and whose labors led to the expansion and improvement of mental hospitals.

# Dorothea Dix

Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes A famous command attributed to William Prescott, an American officer, at the Battle of Bunker Hill in the Revolutionary War. Prescott may have said “color” rather than “whites.”

✥ Prescott’s command has become a proverb, meaning “Don’t act before you have some chance of success.”

Douglas, Stephen A. A political leader of the nineteenth century, known for twice running against Abraham Lincoln — for a seat in the Senate from Illinois in , which he won, and for the presidency in , which he lost. The two engaged in the LincolnDouglas debates over slavery and other issues in $1 8 5 8$ .

Douglass, Frederick W. An abolitionist (see abolitionism) of the nineteenth century. Douglass, an escaped slave, was an especially captivating speaker. His autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, tells of the violence he suffered because of his beliefs. Late in his life, he attacked Jim Crow laws.

Dred Scott decision A controversial ruling made by the Supreme Court in $1 8 5 7$ , shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War. Dred Scott, a slave, sought to be declared a free man on the basis that he had lived for a time in a “free” territory with his master. The Court decided that, under the Constitution, Scott was his master’s property and was not a citizen of the United States. The Court also declared that the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited slavery in certain areas, unconstitutionally deprived people of property — their slaves. The Dred Scott decision was a serious blow to abolitionists (see abolitionism).

Edwards, Jonathan An American clergyman of the eighteenth century; a leader in the religious revivals of the s and s known as the Great Awakening. Edwards, an emotional preacher, emphasized the absolute power of God. His most famous sermon, the harrowing “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” compares sinners to spiders dangled over a flame.

Emancipation Proclamation A proclamation made by President Abraham Lincoln in  that all slaves under the Confederacy were from then on “forever free.”

✥ In itself, the Emancipation Proclamation did not free any slaves, because it applied only to rebellious areas that the federal government did not then control. It did not affect the four slave states that stayed in the Union: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. Yet when people say that Lincoln “freed the slaves,” they are referring to the Emancipation Proclamation.

entangling alliances with none A phrase President Thomas Jefferson used in his first inaugural address in , calling for a cautious, isolationist foreign policy. (See isolationism.)

✥ George Washington had given similar isolationist advice four years earlier in his Farewell Address: “It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.”

Erie Canal An artificial waterway built across New York state in the early nineteenth century, linking Lake Erie and the Hudson River. The canal opened trade between New York and the midwestern states and aided in the growth of New York City as a port.

Farewell Address, Washington’s The final address by George Washington to his fellow citizens as he was leaving the presidency. He wrote the address in  but never delivered it. Washington discussed the dangers of divisive party politics and warned strongly against permanent alliances between the United States and other countries.

Farragut, David (far-uh-guht) An admiral in the Union navy in the Civil War who helped secure the Mississippi River for the Union. Once, when warned of mines, called torpedoes, in the water ahead, Farragut replied, “Damn the torpedoes!”

father of his country A title given to George Washington in recognition of his military leadership in the Revolutionary War and his service as first president under the Constitution.

The Federalist Papers A series of eighty-five essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in the late s to persuade the voters of New York to adopt the Constitution. The essays are considered a classic defense of the American system of government, as well as a classic practical application of political principles.

Federalist party The first American political party. The Federalist party developed during the presidency of George Washington and was led by Alexander Hamilton and John Adams. Federalists believed in a strong federal government and advocated economic policies that would strengthen the federal government, such as the creation of a national bank. The opposition to the Federalists was led by Thomas Jefferson.

First Amendment The first article of the Bill of Rights. It forbids Congress from tampering with the freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and the press.

First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen Words from a eulogy for George Washington adopted by Congress immediately after Washington’s death. The eulogy was written by Henry Lee, a soldier and political leader from Washington’s home state of Virginia.

forty-niners Those who flocked to California in  in search of gold, which had been discovered there in . Reportedly, there were about eighty thousand of them.

Founding Fathers A general name for male American patriots during the Revolutionary War, especially the signers of the Declaration of Independence and those who drafted the Constitution. John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington were all Founding Fathers.

Fourth of July The day on which the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress in ; Independence Day.

Franklin, Benjamin A patriot, diplomat, author, printer, scientist, and inventor in the eighteenth century; one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an important early researcher in electricity and proposed the modern model of electrical current. He also demonstrated that lightning was electricity by flying a kite in a thunderstorm and allowing it to be struck by lightning. Franklin used this discovery to invent the lightning rod. He produced other inventions as well, such as bifocal eyeglasses and the efficient Franklin stove. Particularly notable among his writings are The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and Poor Richard’s Almanack. He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and negotiated with France and Britain on behalf of the newly formed government of the United States. Toward the end of his life, he took part in the Constitutional Convention.

✥ At the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Franklin warned his fellow patriots that their venture, if unsuccessful, could lead to their execution for treason: “We must all hang together, or we shall surely all hang separately.”

French and Indian War A series of military engagements between Britain and France in North

Benjamin Franklin

America between  and . The French and Indian War was the American phase of the Seven Years’ War, which was then underway in Europe. In a battle between British and French forces near Quebec City in Canada, the British gained control of all of Canada.

✥ At the start of the war, several thousand Frenchspeaking residents of Acadia (Nova Scotia and adjacent areas) who refused to swear allegiance to Britain were exiled. Many eventually made their way to southern Louisiana, where they developed the distinctive language and culture known as Cajun.

Fugitive Slave Act A law passed as part of the Compromise of , which provided southern slaveholders with legal weapons to capture slaves who had escaped to the free states. The law was highly unpopular in the North and helped to convert many previously indifferent northerners to antislavery.

Garrison, William Lloyd A prominent abolitionist of the nineteenth century (see abolitionism). In his newspaper, The Liberator, he called for immediate freedom for the slaves and for the end of all political ties between the northern and southern states.

Gettysburg, Battle of The greatest battle of the Civil War, fought in south-central Pennsylvania in . It ended in a major victory for the North and is usually considered the turning point of the war.

Gettysburg Address A speech delivered by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Lincoln was speaking at the dedication of a soldiers’ cemetery at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg. The opening and closing lines are particularly memorable: “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. . . . [We must] be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”

✥ Lincoln surprised his audience at Gettysburg with the brevity of his speech. He delivered the Gettysburg Address, which lasted about three minutes, after a twohour speech by Edward Everett, one of the leading orators of the day.

Give me liberty or give me death Words from a speech by Patrick Henry urging the American colonies to revolt against England. Henry spoke only a few weeks before the Revolutionary War began: “Gentlemen may cry Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms. Our brethren are already in the field. . . . Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”

Go west, young man A favorite saying of the nineteenth-century journalist Horace Greeley, referring to opportunities on the frontier. Another writer, John Soule, apparently originated it.

gold rush, California The movement of great numbers of people to California after gold was discovered there in . (See forty-niners.)

government of the people, by the people, and for the people Words from the Gettysburg Address of Abraham Lincoln, often quoted as a definition of democracy.

Ulysses S. Grant

Grant, Ulysses S. A general and political leader of the nineteenth century. Grant became commanding general of the Union army during the Civil War. He accepted the unconditional surrender of the commanding general of the main Confederate army, Robert E. Lee, at Appomattox Court House. A Republican, he later became president.

Greeley, Horace A journalist and political leader of the nineteenth century, known for his strong opinions. He ran unsuccessfully for president just before his death. A favorite phrase of his was “Go west, young man.”

Hale, Nathan An American soldier and spy of the eighteenth century, captured and hanged by the British during the Revolutionary War. He is said to have declared at his execution in , “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.”

Hamilton, Alexander A soldier and political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Hamilton advised George Washington in the Revolutionary War, wrote most of the essays in The Federalist Papers, and was a leader in the drafting of the Constitution. He later served under Washington as the first secretary of the treasury in the new government. A Federalist, he was opposed politically by

Thomas Jefferson and both politically and personally by Aaron Burr (see Jeffersonianism versus Hamiltonianism). Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, in which Burr killed him (see Burr-Hamilton duel).

Hancock, John A political leader of the eighteenth century. He was president of the Continental Congress when the Declaration of Independence was signed, and was the first to sign it, which he did with a large, flamboyant signature.

✥ A “John Hancock” is a signature.

Harpers Ferry The place now in West Virginia where the militant abolitionist John Brown was captured in $^ { 1 8 5 9 }$ , after he seized a federal arsenal there.

Hemings, Sally A slave who was owned by Thomas Jefferson. Based on recent evidence from DNA and from the timing of Jefferson’s visits to Monticello, most scholars now think it probable that Jefferson, a widower, was the father of one and possibly more of her four surviving children.

✥ The allegation that Jefferson had a slave mistress circulated among his political opponents during his life and has long been voiced by many African-Americans. Until recently, most historians dismissed it because there was no corroborating evidence.

Henry, Patrick A political leader of the eighteenth century, known for his fiery oratory. He is especially remembered for saying, “Give me liberty or give me death.”

Homestead Act A law passed in the s that offered up to  acres of public land to any head of a family who paid a registration fee, lived on the land for five years, and cultivated it or built on it.

“House Divided” speech A speech made by Abraham Lincoln to the Illinois Republican convention in . In the speech, Lincoln noted that conflict between North and South over slavery was intensifying. He asserted that the conflict would not stop until a crisis was reached and passed, for, in a biblical phrase Lincoln used, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” He continued: “I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.”

Houston, Sam (hyooh-stuhn) A soldier and political leader of the nineteenth century. Houston led the Texans in their struggle to win independence from Mexico. Later he served as president of the republic of Texas. After Texas became a state, he represented it in the United States Senate. He was elected governor of Texas just before the Civil War, but when he opposed the state’s decision for secession, he was removed from office.

Hudson, Henry An English explorer of the early seventeenth century. He discovered the Hudson River while in the service of The Netherlands.

I cannot tell a lie Words George Washington spoke as a boy, according to a biographer of Washington. (See Washington and the cherry tree.)

I have not yet begun to fight Words attributed to the eighteenth-century naval hero John Paul Jones. He was doing battle with a British ship when his own ship was badly damaged, and the British commander called over to ask whether Jones had surrendered. He answered, “I have not yet begun to fight.” He and his crew then captured the British ship. His own ship later sank.

I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country Words spoken by the patriot Nathan Hale, who was executed as a spy by the British in .

indentured servant A person under contract to work for another person for a definite period of time, usually without pay but in exchange for free passage to a new country. During the seventeenth century most of the white laborers in Maryland and Virginia came from England as indentured servants.

Independence Day The primary national holiday in the United States, celebrated every July 4; the anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Customary festivities include picnics; parades; band concerts; decorations in red, white, and blue; and nighttime fireworks displays.

Intolerable Acts Also known as the Coercive Acts; a series of British measures passed in  and designed to punish the Massachusetts colonists for the Boston Tea Party. For example, one of the laws closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the tea that they had destroyed. Although the acts were intended to check colonial opposition to Britain, they only inflamed it.

Iroquois League (ir-uh-kwoy) A confederacy of Native American tribes in upper New York state, dating to the sixteenth century.

Jackson, Andrew A general and political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As a general in the War of , he defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans. He was called “Old Hickory.” Jackson was elected president after John Quincy Adams as a candidate of the common man, and his style of government came to be known as Jacksonian democracy. He rewarded his political supporters with positions once he became president (see spoils system). A Democrat, Jackson was widely criticized for expanding the power of the presidency beyond what was customary before his time.

✥ In the poem “Barbara Frietchie,” by John Greenleaf Whittier, Stonewall Jackson orders his men not to harm Barbara Frietchie or the Union flags she is holding (see Shoot, if you must, this old gray head). ✥ Jackson’s dying words, “Let us cross the river and rest in the shade of the trees,” are much remembered.

Jacksonian democracy (jak-soh-nee-uhn) A movement for more democracy in American government in the s. Led by President Andrew Jackson, this movement championed greater rights for the common man and was opposed to any signs of aristocracy in the nation. Jacksonian democracy was aided by the strong spirit of equality among the people of the newer settlements in the South and West. It was also aided by the extension of the vote in eastern states to men without property; in the early days of the United States, many places had allowed only male property owners to vote. (Compare Jeffersonian democracy.)

Jamestown The first permanent English settlement in North America, founded in  in Virginia. Jamestown was named for King James I of England. It was destroyed later in the seventeenth century in an uprising of Virginians against the governor.

Jefferson, Thomas A political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; one of the Founding Fathers; the leader of the DemocraticRepublican party. Jefferson was principal author of the Declaration of Independence and served as president from  to , between John Adams and James Madison. He arranged for the Louisiana Purchase, founded the University of Virginia, and built the mansion Monticello. Jefferson is famed as a champion of political and religious freedom, but he was also a slaveholder. (See Jeffersonian democracy; Sally Hemings.)

# Andrew Jackson

Jackson, “Stonewall” Thomas J. Jackson, a general in the Confederate army during the Civil War. He got his nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run, where he and his men “stood like a stone wall.” He and General Robert E. Lee led the South to victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville. In the evening after the battle was won, however, Jackson was fatally shot by Confederate troops who mistook him and his staff for Union officers.

Jeffersonian democracy (jef-uhr-soh-nee-uhn) A movement for more democracy in American government in the first decade of the nineteenth century. The movement was led by President Thomas Jefferson. Jeffersonian democracy was less radical than the later Jacksonian democracy. For example, where Jacksonian democracy held that the common citizen was the best judge of measures, Jeffersonian democracy stressed the need for leadership by those of greatest ability, who would be chosen by the people.

Jeffersonianism versus Hamiltonianism (jef-uhrsoh-nee-uh-niz-uhm; ham-uhl-toh-nee-uh-niz-uhm) Rival ideals of American government that have persisted long after the deaths of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, after whom they were named. Jeffersonians have preferred a weak federal government and strong state and local governments, on the grounds that lower-level governments will be more responsive than the national government to the popular will. Jeffersonians have also held that the American economy should rely more on agriculture than on industry and have seen big business as a threat to democracy. In contrast, Hamiltonians have insisted that a strong national government is needed to guide the economic development of the nation, especially its industrial development, and to restrain the excesses of the people.

Jones, John Paul A naval leader of the Revolutionary War, known for his attacks on British ships off the coast of England. When a British commander asked him to surrender his badly crippled ship during a battle, he allegedly replied, “I have not yet begun to fight” — and compelled the British ship to surrender. Two days later, his own ship sank.

Kansas-Nebraska Act A law passed by Congress in $1 8 5 4$ that divided the territory west of the states of Missouri and Iowa and the territory of Minnesota into two new territories, Kansas and Nebraska. The law was extremely controversial because it did not exclude slavery from either territory, despite the fact that the Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery in these territories. By effectively repealing the Missouri Compromise, the law outraged many northerners, led to the collapse of the Whig party and the rise of the Republican party, and moved the nation closer to civil war.

Know-Nothings A party opposed to the holding of public office by immigrants or Roman Catholics. The Know-Nothings, also known as “nativists,” insisted that only true, “native” Americans should serve in the government. The party was quite successful in the s but split over the slavery question. Its official name was the American party. It picked up the “KnowNothing” tag because its members, maintaining secrecy about the party’s activities, customarily answered questions with, $^ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathrm { I }$ know nothing.”

✥ Today, the term know-nothing is usually applied to bigots.

Lafayette, Marquis de (lah-fee-et, laf-ee-et) A French nobleman, political leader, and general of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Enthusiastic for the ideals of the American Revolutionary War, Lafayette served as a general in the American army during the Revolutionary War, fighting alongside his friend George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown and elsewhere. On returning to France, he was active in the early stages of the French Revolution.

✥ A United States Army officer, speaking at the tomb of Lafayette after United States forces had arrived in support of France in World War I, said, “Lafayette, we are here.” He meant that the United States, in aiding France in the war, was returning the favor that Lafayette and the French had done for the United States in the Revolutionary War. The officer is sometimes identified as General John Pershing.

Lafitte, Jean (luh-feet, lah-feet) A French pirate of the early nineteenth century, active around New Orleans, Louisiana. He volunteered to aid General Andrew Jackson against the British in the War of  and fought in the Battle of New Orleans. Many legends have grown up around Lafitte.

Lee, Robert E. A general of the nineteenth century; the commander of Confederate troops during the Civil War. Before the war, he led the marines who put down the insurrection by John Brown at Harpers Ferry and took Brown captive. In the war, he led the Army of Northern Virginia and won the Battle of Chancellorsville but lost the Battle of Gettysburg. He surrendered to the Union army, under the command of Ulysses S. Grant, at Appomattox Court House in .

✥ Lee’s excellence of character and brilliance as a general won him the respect of people on both sides of the war.

Lewis and Clark expedition A journey made by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, to explore the American Northwest, newly purchased from France, and some territories beyond. The expedition started from St. Louis, Missouri, and moved up the Missouri River and down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. The information that Lewis and Clark gathered was of a time splitting wood into fence rails, was a lawyer by profession and largely self-taught; there is a familiar image of him studying by firelight in the log cabin in Kentucky in which he was born and raised. First a Whig, he joined the Republican party and was its nominee for the Senate from Illinois in . Lincoln rose to national prominence in a famous series of debates with his opponent in the $1 8 5 8$ election, Stephen A. Douglas (see Lincoln-Douglas debates). He was elected president in . Lincoln was an exceptionally active commander in chief of the army and navy in the Civil War, which broke out the month after his inauguration. During the war, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, delivered the Gettysburg Address, and approved the Homestead Act. In his second inaugural address (see Lincoln’s second inaugural address), delivered in  as the war was ending, he pleaded for restraint and “charity for all” in the aftermath of the war. He never was able to carry out his program of Reconstruction, however, because a supporter of the Confederacy, the actor John Wilkes Booth, assassinated him a few days after the southern states surrendered.

Lexington and Concord, Battle of (kong-kuhrd) The first battle of the Revolutionary War, fought in Massachusetts on April , . British troops had moved from Boston toward Lexington and Concord to seize the colonists’ military supplies and arrest revolutionaries. In Concord, advancing British troops met resistance from the Minutemen, and American volunteers harassed the retreating British troops along the Concord-Lexington Road. Paul Revere, on his famous ride, had first alerted the Americans to the British movement.

✥ During the battle there was a skirmish at Concord’s North Bridge, later commemorated in a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson:

By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world.

Lincoln, Abraham A political leader of the nineteenth century; the leader of the Union during the Civil War, and one of the most revered presidents, who served from  to . Lincoln, who worked for

✥ Lincoln has been referred to in a variety of ways, such as “honest Abe,” “the rail splitter,” and “the Great Emancipator.” ✥ Lincoln is much admired for the political moderation that enabled him to preserve the nation, and he has joined George Washington as a symbol of American democracy. His portrait appears on the five-dollar bill and the one-cent piece. ✥ Lincoln’s birthday was February . A holiday in February, Presidents’ Day, commemorates his birthday and the birthday of George Washington.

Lincoln-Douglas debates A series of debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in , when both were campaigning for election to the United States Senate from Illinois. Much of the debating concerned slavery and its extension into territories such as Kansas. The debates transformed Lincoln into a national figure and led to his election to the presidency in .

Lincoln’s second inaugural address A speech given by Abraham Lincoln at his inauguration for a second term as president, a few weeks before the Union victory in the Civil War. It concludes with this appeal for reconciliation: “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.”

Louisiana Purchase The purchase by the United States from France of the huge Louisiana Territory in . President Thomas Jefferson ordered the purchase negotiations, fearing that the French, then led by Napoleon, wanted to establish an empire in North America. The French had no such ambitions but were happy to exchange their vast landholdings for cash. The area that they sold, extending from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, more than doubled the size of the United States.

Madison, Dolley or Dolly The wife of President James Madison. Dolley Madison was known for her wit and her grace as a hostess. She is also remembered for her calmness in the face of the British invasion of Washington, D.C., in the War of . She saved many documents stored in the White House, along with a portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart.

Madison, James A political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; one of the Founding Fathers. Madison was a member of the

Continental Congress. A leader in the drafting of the Constitution, he worked tirelessly for its adoption by the states, contributing several essays to $T _ { H E }$ Federalist Papers. He served as president from  to , after Thomas Jefferson. The United States fought the War of  during his presidency. He was married to one of the most celebrated of presidents’ wives, Dolley Madison.

manifest destiny A popular slogan of the s. It was used by people who believed that the United States was destined — by God, some said — to expand across North America to the Pacific Ocean. The idea of manifest destiny was used to justify the acquisition of Oregon and large parts of the Southwest, including California. (See Mexican War.)

Mann, Horace A legislator and educational reformer of the nineteenth century. In his home state of Massachusetts, Mann worked to increase the availability and quality of free, nondenominational public schools. Mann has been called the father of the American public school.

Marbury versus Madison A case decided by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall in . The Court declared unanimously that a certain law passed by Congress should not be enforced, because the law was opposed to the Constitution. Marbury versus Madison established the principle of “judicial review” — that the Supreme Court has the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional.

Marion, Francis An American general and guerrilla leader of the Revolutionary War. Marion fought a series of small, fierce, and successful battles against the British in South Carolina and became known as the “Swamp Fox.”

Marshall, John A public official of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Marshall served as chief justice of the Supreme Court from  to . His interpretations of the Constitution in cases such as Marbury versus Madison served to strengthen the power of the Court and the power of the federal government generally.

Mason-Dixon line A boundary line between Pennsylvania and Maryland, laid out by two English surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, in the s. Before and during the Civil War, the line was symbolic of the division between slaveholding and free states. After the war, it remained symbolic of the division between states that required racial segregation and those that did not.

Mather, Cotton (mathh-uhr) A scholar and religious leader of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Mather, a prominent Massachusetts Puritan, urged the suppression of witchcraft and supported the Salem witch trials.

Mayflower The ship that carried the Pilgrims to America. It made a permanent landing near Plymouth Rock in , after the Pilgrims had agreed to the Mayflower Compact.

Mayflower. A detail from Mayflower in Plymouth Harbor, circa , by William Formby Halsall.

Mayflower Compact An agreement reached by the Pilgrims on the ship the Mayflower in , just before they landed at Plymouth Rock. The Mayflower Compact bound them to live in a civil society according to their own laws. It remained the fundamental law of their colony of Plymouth until the colony was absorbed into Massachusetts in the late seventeenth century.

✥ The Mayflower Compact was the first written constitution in North America.

McGuffey’s Readers A series of books prepared principally by William H. McGuffey, a midwestern teacher, and designed to teach reading to schoolchildren. The series began to appear in the s. It was widely used in the nineteenth century and is still used by some schools today.

Mexican War A war fought between the United States and Mexico from  to $1 8 4 8$ . The United States won the war, encouraged by the feelings of many Americans that the country was accomplishing its manifest destiny of expansion. Mexico renounced all claims to Texas north of the Rio Grande and yielded a vast territory that embraces the present states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

✥ Many generals of the Civil War, including Ulys ses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, gained experience in battle during the Mexican War. The Mexican War was opposed by many Americans, notably by the author Henry David Thoreau, who was put in jail for refusing to pay a tax to support the war. His essay “Civil Disobedience” explains the principles of his action.

Minutemen Armed American civilians who were active in the Revolutionary War and in the period just preceding the war. They were named Minutemen because they were ready to fight alongside regular soldiers at a moment’s notice. The Minutemen of Massachusetts were especially well known. (See Battle of Lexington and Concord.)

✥ During the cold war, the name “Minuteman” was given to a United States missile held ready for launching in the event of a nuclear attack.

Missouri Compromise A settlement of a dispute between slave and free states, contained in several laws passed during  and . Northern legislators had tried to prohibit slavery in Missouri, which was then applying for statehood. The Missouri Compromise admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, and prohibited slavery in territory that later became Kansas and Nebraska. In , in the Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court declared the compromise unconstitutional.

Monitor versus Merrimack A naval engagement of the Civil War, fought in  off the coast of Virginia between two ironclad ships, the Union Monitor and the Confederate Virginia (which had been built on the hull of the U.S.S. Merrimack). The incident demonstrated that wooden warships were obsolete.

Monroe, James A political leader of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries; a leader of the Democratic-Republican party. He was president from  to , between James Madison and John

Quincy Adams. He issued the Monroe Doctrine in , supporting the independence of Spain’s colonies in America. The Missouri Compromise was reached in his presidency.

✥ Compared to other presidencies of that time, Monroe’s administration was relatively free of quarrels between Americans. His time in office has been called the Era of Good Feeling.

Monroe Doctrine A statement of foreign policy issued by President James Monroe in , declaring that the United States would not tolerate intervention by European nations in the affairs of nations in the Americas. Monroe also promised that the United States would not interfere with European colonies already established or with governments in Europe.

✥ The Navajos were forced to move by United States troops under Kit Carson in . They call the march, on which many died, the Long Walk. ✥ Today, they are known for their houses, called hogans, made of logs and earth; for their work as ranchers and shepherds; and for their skill in weaving distinctive blankets and fashioning turquoise and silver jewelry.

New Amsterdam A city founded by Dutch settlers in the seventeenth century on the present site of New York City.

✥ An early governor of the Dutch colony surrounding New Amsterdam bought Manhattan Island, the present center of New York City, from the Native Americans for twenty-four dollars’ worth of jewelry.

Northwest Ordinance A law passed in $1 7 8 7$ to regulate the settlement of the Northwest Territory, which eventually was divided into several states of the Middle West. The United States was governed under the Articles of Confederation at the time. The Northwest Ordinance organized the territory into townships of thirty-six square miles each and provided for selfgovernment and religious toleration in the territory. Slavery was prohibited.

Northwest Passage A sea route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through northwestern America, often sought by early explorers. There is an actual Northwest Passage, but it requires sailing through far northern waters that are icebound much of the year.

nullification The doctrine that states can set aside federal laws. Urged in the late s by John C. Calhoun, nullification precipitated a crisis between Calhoun and President Andrew Jackson. The doctrine was foreshadowed by Thomas Jefferson’s draft of the Kentucky Resolutions. (See Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions.)

One if by land, and two if by sea The words used by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his poem “Paul Revere’s Ride” to describe the signal used to guide the “midnight ride of Paul Revere” at the start of the Revolutionary War. Revere had ordered two lanterns to be placed in a Boston church tower to warn his confederates that the British were on the move. Longfellow embellished the story a little.

Many Quakers, who were persecuted in England, settled in Pennsylvania. Penn was known for his friendly relations with the Native American tribes in his colony.

Pennsylvania Dutch The German and Swiss settlers of Pennsylvania in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and their descendants. “Dutch” is a version of the German Deutsch, meaning “German.” The Pennsylvania Dutch are known for their tidy farms and their distinctive crafts and customs. A considerable number of them belong to strict religious denominations, such as the Amish.

Pilgrims A group of English Puritans, persecuted in their own country, who emigrated to America. The first group arrived on the Mayflower in . They landed at Plymouth Rock, in what is now Massachusetts, and established the Plymouth Colony, with the Mayflower Compact as their constitution. William Bradford and Miles Standish were noted leaders of the colony.

Plymouth Colony The colony established in what is now eastern Massachusetts by the Pilgrims in .

Plymouth Rock The rock, in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, near which the Mayflower, carrying the Pilgrims, landed in .

Pocahontas (poh-kuh-hon-tuhs) A Native American princess of the seventeenth century who befriended Captain John Smith of Virginia.

Polk, James K. A political leader of the nineteenth century; Polk, a Democrat, was president from  to . An ardent believer in manifest destiny, he led the United States into the Mexican War. In his presidency, the United States acquired Texas and California and large territories in between.

Pony Express A system of mail service by relays of riders on horses, established in  between Missouri and California, through the Rocky Mountains. It operated for only a year and a half, until a telegraph line eliminated the need for it.

✥ An early advertisement for Pony Express riders is well known: “Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred.” ✥ Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickok were Pony Express riders in their youth.

Preamble to the Constitution (pree-am-buhl, pree am-buhl) A statement attached to the beginning of the Constitution by the Constitutional Convention, declaring the purpose of the document. It reads: “We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”

Pueblos (pweb-lohz) Native American people, now found in Arizona and New Mexico, whose distant ancesters often lived in multilevel dwellings on the sheer sides of canyons. Some of these dwellings, which resembled apartment houses, can be seen in Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. The Spanish explorers discovered these people in the sixteenth century living in villages and named both the villages and the people “pueblos” (Spanish for town).

Remember the Alamo! (al-uh-moh) A battle cry in the Texans’ struggle for independence from Mexico, later used by Americans in the Mexican War. It recalled the desperate fight of the Texan defenders in the Alamo, a besieged fort, where they died to the last man.

Republican party A political party that began in $1 8 5 4$ and is today one of the two major political parties in the United States. Originally, it was composed mainly of northerners from both major parties of the time, the Democrats and the Whigs, with some former Know-Nothings as well. The first Republicans were united by their opposition to the expansion of slavery. Their first winning presidential candidate was Abraham Lincoln in .

Revere, Paul A hero of the Revolutionary War. On the night before the Battle of Lexington and Concord in , Revere, a silversmith by trade, rode across the Massachusetts countryside warning the other colonists that British troops were moving toward them to seize military supplies and arrest revolutionaries. Revere got his information about the British through signal lights placed in a church tower by a friend (see One if by land, and two if by sea). Those whom he warned were ready to fight the British the next day. (See illustration, next page.)

Paul Revere. Paul Revere warning of the impending attack by the British.

✥ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow told the story of the “midnight ride,” though not with complete accuracy, in his poem “Paul Revere’s Ride.”

Revolutionary War The war for American independence from Britain. The fighting began with the Battle of Lexington and Concord in , and lasted through the Battle of Yorktown in . General George Washington commanded the American forces, assisted by Ethan Allen, Benedict Arnold, Horatio Gates, John Paul Jones, and others. The leaders of the British included Charles Cornwallis, John Burgoyne, Thomas Gage, and William Howe, among others. The American cause was greatly aided by French ships and troops and by the presence of the French nobleman and soldier the Marquis de Lafayette. The Treaty of Paris in $1 7 8 3$ officially ended the war. (See Battle of Bunker Hill and Battle of Saratoga.)

Ross, Betsy A seamstress of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries who made flags in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. A widely accepted, but undocumented, story holds that she sewed the first American flag in the form of the Stars and Stripes.

Sacajawea (sak-uh-juh-wee-uh) A young Native American woman who guided Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their expedition to explore territory gained through the Louisiana Purchase. (See Lewis and Clark expedition.)

✥ Her portrait is stamped on the golden dollar.

Salem witch trials Trials held in Salem, Massachusetts, in  that led to the execution of twenty people for allegedly practicing witchcraft. The trials are noted for the hysterical atmosphere in which they were conducted; many townspeople were widely suspected of witchcraft on flimsy evidence.

✥ When people are quick to accuse one another of serious misdeeds on inadequate evidence, the situation is often compared to the Salem witch trials. ✥ A “witch hunt” is a political campaign launched under the pretext of investigating activities considered subversive by the state.

Saratoga, Battle of A major battle of the Revolutionary War, fought in  in northern New York state. Benedict Arnold, who had not yet turned traitor, was a leader of the American offensive, which forced the surrender of British troops under General John Burgoyne.

✥ The Battle of Saratoga is often called the turning point of the war, because it increased the confidence of the French government in the American forces; France began sending aid the next year.

secession The withdrawal from the United States of eleven southern states in  and . The seceding states formed a government, the Confederacy, in early . Hostilities against the remaining United States, the Union, began in April  (see Fort Sumter), and the Civil War followed.

Seminoles (sem-uh-nohlz) A tribe of Native Americans who inhabited Florida in the early nineteenth century. After fighting a war against the United States to keep their land, they were forcibly removed to reservations west of the Mississippi River in the s.

Seneca Falls Convention The first convention in America devoted to women’s rights. It met in Seneca Falls, New York, in , and passed several resolutions, including a demand that women be given the right to vote.

 The year in which the Declaration of Independence was written.

Shakers A religious group that rose in America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Shakers derived their name from a dance that was part of their religious ceremony. They lived in small, tightly knit communities and observed celibacy.

✥ Shaker furniture is renowned for its simplicity, strength, and beauty.

Shawnees (shaw-neez) A tribe of Native Americans who inhabited Ohio, Indiana, and other parts of the Middle West during the early nineteenth century. The most famous Shawnee leader was Tecumseh, who joined with the British against the Americans during the War of .

Shays’s Rebellion An uprising led by a former militia officer, Daniel Shays, which broke out in western Massachusetts in . Shays’s followers protested the foreclosures of farms for debt and briefly succeeded in shutting down the court system. Although the rebellion was easily overcome, it persuaded conservatives of the need for a strong national government and contributed to the movement to draft the Constitution.

Sherman, William Tecumseh (tuh-kum-suh) A general of the nineteenth century; one of the leading generals in the Union army in the Civil War (see Sherman’s march to the sea). He is known for saying “War is hell.”

Sherman’s march to the sea A movement of the Union army troops of General William Tecumseh Sherman from Atlanta, Georgia, to the Georgia seacoast, with the object of destroying Confederate supplies. The march began after Sherman captured, evacuated, and burned Atlanta in the fall of . His men, numbering about sixty thousand, destroyed railroads, factories, cotton gins, houses, livestock, and anything else that might be useful to the South in the war.

✥ Northerners celebrated Sherman’s march with the song “Marching through Georgia.” Southerners remembered it bitterly.

shot heard round the world A phrase from a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson about the Battle of Lexington and Concord. Emerson’s words read, “Here once the embattled farmers stood / And fired the shot heard round the world.” In other words, the determination of the colonists at Concord led to the establishment of a new nation on Earth and encouraged worldwide movements toward democracy.

slave trade The transportation of slaves from Africa to North and South America between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. Congress banned the importing of slaves into the United States in .

Smith, Captain John An English adventurer and explorer of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Smith was one of the original settlers of Jamestown in . He was taken prisoner by the braves of the Native American chief Powhatan. By his own account, he was rescued through the intervention of Pocahontas, Powhatan’s daughter.

Stamp Act A law passed by the British government in  that required the payment of a tax to Britain on a great variety of papers and documents, including newspapers, that were produced in the American colonies. Special stamps were to be attached to the papers and documents as proof that the tax had been paid. The stamp tax was the first direct tax ever levied by Britain on the Americans, who rioted in opposition. The American colonists petitioned King George III to repeal the act, which he did in .

Stuyvesant, Peter (steye-vi-sent) A notoriously hottempered governor of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. In $1 6 6 4$ , he surrendered it to the English, who renamed it New York.

✥ Stuyvesant’s most familiar feature was his artificial right leg, fitted with silver ornaments.

Sumter, Fort A fort at the entrance to the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina; the location of the first military engagement of the Civil War. In April , several months after South Carolina had declared its secession from the United States, the militia of South Carolina demanded that the commander of the fort surrender. He refused, and the South Carolinians fired on the fort. There were no deaths in the incident. In response, however, President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers to put down the “insurrection,” and the American Civil War began.

Taxation without representation is tyranny A slogan of the Revolutionary War and the years before. The colonists were not allowed to choose representatives to parliament in London, which passed the laws under which they were taxed. To be taxed only with the consent of one’s representatives in Parliament was a particularly cherished right of the people under

English law, a right dating back to Magna Carta in the thirteenth century. Each additional tax caused fresh resentment among the colonists. Taxation without representation is one of the principal offenses of Britain listed in the Declaration of Independence.

Tecumseh (tuh-kum-suh) A Shawnee chief of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He took arms against American settlers moving into the Middle West, and supported the British in the War of , in which he was killed.

These are the times that try men’s souls The opening words of the series of pamphlets The American Crisis, by Thomas Paine, begun in late $1 7 7 6$ . Paine, seeking to stir up revolutionary spirit in the colonies, continues, “The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot may, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.”

✥ Paine’s words are still quoted occasionally in troublesome situations.

thirteen colonies The colonies that composed the original United States in : Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

Tippecanoe and Tyler too (tip-ee-kuh-nooh) A slogan from the presidential election of . “Tippecanoe” was the Whig presidential candidate William Henry Harrison, a hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe in . John Tyler was the vice presidential candidate.

# Harriet Tubman

Turner, Nat A black slave of the early nineteenth century, who led the only effective and sustained slave revolt in American history. He and his supporters killed several dozen white people in Virginia before he was captured; he was hanged in . Although Turner’s rebellion led to a severe reaction among the slaveholders, it demonstrated that not all slaves were willing to accept their condition passively.

Underground Railroad A network of houses and other places that abolitionists used to help slaves escape to freedom in the northern states or in Canada before the Civil War. The escaped slaves traveled from one “station” of the railroad to the next under cover of night. Harriet Tubman was the most prominent “conductor” on the Underground Railroad.

Union The United States; especially the northern states during the Civil War, which remained with the original United States government. (Compare Confederacy.)

Valley Forge A valley in eastern Pennsylvania that served as quarters for the American army in one winter (–) of the Revolutionary War. George Washington, who was commanding the army, had been forced to leave Philadelphia, and his troops suffered from the cold and from lack of supplies. Though many deserted, Washington managed to maintain the morale of the rest. He was aided by Baron von Steuben, a German officer on his staff, who trained the men in the soldiering practices of Europe.

Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions Statements of principle adopted by two state legislatures in the s; they affirmed states’ rights in response to the federal Alien and Sedition Acts. James Madison wrote the Virginia Resolutions, and Thomas Jefferson wrote the Kentucky Resolutions. Jefferson’s draft of the Kentucky Resolutions included the statement that nullification was an appropriate course of action for a state in the face of a dangerous increase in the strength of the federal government. Although the Kentucky legislature approved most of his draft, it did not adopt this statement.

Virginia dynasty A phrase from the nineteenth century; it points out that four of the first five presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe) were from Virginia.

wampum (wahm-puhm) Beads made from polished shells that some Native Americans once used as money and jewelry.

War of  A war between Britain and the United States, fought between  and . The War of  has also been called the second American war for independence. It began over alleged British violations of American shipping rights, such as the impressment of seamen — the forcing of American merchant sailors to serve on British ships. American soldiers attacked Canada unsuccessfully in the war, and the British retaliated by burning the White House and other buildings in Washington, D.C. American warships frequently prevailed over British vessels (see “We have met the enemy, and they are ours”). The greatest victory for the Americans came in the Battle of New Orleans, in which Andrew Jackson was the commanding general — a battle fought, ironically, two weeks after the peace treaty ending the war had been signed, but before the armies could be informed. (See also “The Star-Spangled Banner.”)

Washington, George The first president of the United States, and the commanding general of the victorious American army in the Revolutionary War. The best known of the Founding Fathers, Washington is called the father of his country. He was born in  in Virginia and showed early talent as a surveyor and farmer. He served as an army officer in the French and Indian War, as a member of the Virginia legislature, and as a delegate to the Continental Congress. In the summer of , a few weeks after the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he took command of the American army. He and his men won early victories over the British in New Jersey at Trenton and Princeton, despite a great lack of training and supplies. Washington is particularly remembered for keeping up morale during the hardships of winter encampment at Valley Forge. His victory at the Battle of Yorktown ended the fighting.

Washington presided at the Constitutional Convention of $1 7 8 7$ , and in  he was unanimously elected the first president under the new Constitution. As president, he pursued a careful foreign policy, endorsed the financial program of Alexander Hamilton, and put down the Whisky Rebellion. Refusing to seek a third term as president, he retired from the office in , issuing a Farewell Address that advised against party politics at home and against permanent alliances abroad. After he died in , he was praised by Congress as “first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”

✥ The qualities of Washington that have stood out over the centuries are his courage, his impartiality, and his good judgment. ✥ The capital of the United States is named after George Washington, as is a northwestern state. Over thirty states have a Washington County, and his name has been given to numerous mountains, lakes, streets, and buildings. ✥ The painting of Washington Crossing the Delaware, which shows him leading his army toward a surprise attack on the Brit

ish, is well known. His portrait is on the one-dollar bill, and his profile appears on the twenty-five-cent piece. ✥ Washington is the subject of many legends, which often celebrate his honesty (such as the story of Washington and the cherry tree) or his strength (such as the tale that he threw a rock, or a silver dollar, across the Rappahannock River).

Webster, Daniel A Whig political leader and diplomat of the nineteenth century. Webster is remembered for his speaking ability and for his service as a senator from Massachusetts through most of the s and s. Webster defended national unity in the Senate against advocates of states’ rights such as John C. Calhoun. In one debate, he spoke the famous words, “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!” He opposed the Mexican War and the admission of Texas as a slave state but supported the Compromise of $1 8 5 0$ , including the Fugitive Slave Act. A member of the Whig party, he ran for president three times but was never nominated.

Webster, Noah An educator and author of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, best known for his American Dictionary of the English Language and Blue-Backed Speller. He worked for the establishment of a distinctive American version of the English language; for example, he insisted on spellings such as wagon, center, and honor in place of the standard British waggon, centre, and honour.

✥ A number of widely used dictionaries still bear Webster’s name.

We have met the enemy, and they are ours A message sent from the naval Battle of Lake Erie in the War of , announcing a victory for the United States. The naval commander, Oliver Hazard Perry, addressed the words to the American land armies.

Whig party An American political party formed in the s to oppose President Andrew Jackson and the Democrats. Whigs stood for protective tariffs, national banking, and federal aid for internal improvements. Senators Henry Clay and Daniel Webster were prominent Whigs, as were four presidents (William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Millard Fillmore). The party fell into disunity in the s over slavery; some former Whigs, including Abraham Lincoln, then joined the new Republican party.

Whisky Rebellion An insurrection that broke out in the early s in western Pennsylvania. Hundreds of residents took arms against federal officials charged with collecting a tax on liquor distilled at home. Federal troops then put the rebellion down. Occurring only a few years after the adoption of the Constitution, the Whisky Rebellion was an important test of the power of the new federal government to enforce its laws.

Williams, Roger A Puritan religious leader of the seventeenth century, born in England. After he was expelled from Massachusetts for his tolerant religious views, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island as a place of complete religious toleration.

# American History since 

![](img/7c16b5caee6628703c3bb88c41d7dcc80b5fe124b04e023bb7535cefb494a474.jpg)

The period from  to  is known as Reconstruction. Victorious in the Civil War, the North attempted, often hesitantly, to “reconstruct” the South by securing civil rights for blacks freed from slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and Fifteenth Amendment sought to secure

those basic rights.

Industrial growth was dramatic in the period from  to , but the expansion of industry did not benefit everyone. The newly rich robber barons amassed enormous wealth, which they often displayed crassly. Particularly in the late s and s, corruption riddled American politics. Meanwhile, many factory workers suffered in misery, and farmers bitterly resented their domination by the railroads and by eastern financiers. The resentments of farmers exploded in the Populist party of the s.

Populism soon went into eclipse, but new efforts to bring social justice and economic order to the United States took shape in the Progressive movement. Progressives attacked abuses such as child labor and corporate pillaging, and they worked successfully for women’s suffrage, which was gained with the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment in . Progressives and others also supported Prohibition, which became law after the adoption in  of the Eighteenth Amendment.

Progressivism coincided with the emergence of the United States as a world power. After its victory over Spain in the Spanish-American War (), the United States steadily raised its profile in international affairs during the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt (–) and Woodrow Wilson (–). Under Wilson, the United States entered World War I in  and played a key role at the Versailles peace conference after the war.

Postwar prosperity came to a shuddering halt with the onset of the Great Depression in . Elected president in , Franklin D. Roosevelt inspired a series of government programs known as the New Deal. In foreign policy, Roosevelt opposed the aggression of Nazi Germany. With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December , the United States formally entered World War II.

The United States was the only nation to emerge from World War II stronger than at its start. It took the lead in establishing the United Nations, and with the onset of the cold war in the late s it became the leading anti-communist power and head of NATO. Its confrontation with communism led it into the Korean War and the Vietnam War and into proxy wars from Afghanistan to Central America. With the collapse of communism and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States emerged as the sole superpower. To many it appeared that the twentieth century had been the American Century.

At the start of the twenty-first century, American hegemony increasingly appears a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the United States possesses enormous economic, political, and military power and cultural influence. Its seven-trillion-dollar economy is by far the world’s largest. It has overcome the deep internal divisions of the late s and s that were occasioned by the Vietnam War and conflict over civil rights. Despite periodic eruptions, such as the Watergate scandal and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, its politics are basically stable, if usually noisy. It demonstrated its awesome military power in the Persian Gulf War, and its popular culture continues to attract fascination and imitation abroad, even in nations marked by strong anti-Americanism. Its population, now over  million, contains a rich mosaic of national origins and cultures. Its Latino population grew by more than ten million in the s. It is not unlikely that by  Latino Americans will form the largest minority group in the United States. The number of Americans of Asian descent has also risen in recent decades, as has the number of American Muslims.

Yet, as the September 11 attacks indicate, the United States is hated in some parts of the world and widely resented in others. At times, opposition to the United States reflects disagreement with specific American policies, such as support for Israel, but often it rests on a perception of the United States as a symbol of materialism and secular values. To many Americans, these criticisms seem to be just another way to say that America is wealthy and free.

Aaron, Henry (Hank Aaron) (air-uhn) A baseball player of the twentieth century; he hit a record  home runs in his major league career, which ran from  to . The previous record holder was Babe Ruth, who hit .

Addams, Jane A social reformer of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. She founded a settlement house, Hull House, in Chicago, and also worked for peace and for women’s rights. In , she won the Nobel Prize for peace.

Agnew, Spiro (speer-oh ag-nooh, ag-nyooh) A political leader of the twentieth century. Agnew was elected vice president in  and  as the running mate of Richard Nixon. He attacked opponents of the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, calling them “an effete corps of impudent snobs” and “nattering nabobs of negativism.” In  Agnew pleaded nolo contendere to charges of income tax evasion and resigned from office.

Albright, Madeleine The first woman to become secretary of state. The daughter of a Czech diplomat, she was born in Czechoslovakia but fled to England with her family when the Nazis invaded in . (Three of her grandparents, all Jews, died in Nazi concentration camps.) She returned to Czechoslovakia with her family after the war but fled again when the communists took power. Coming to America, she held various government posts and taught international relations before her appointment as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in . President Bill Clinton appointed her to head the State Department in .

Ali, Muhammad (ah-lee) An African-American boxer of the twentieth century, who was world champion in the heavyweight class for several years between  and . He was known in his boxing career for his flamboyant personality and aggressive self-promotion, as well as for his superior boxing ability and style. His boxing strategy, he said, was to “float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.” A Black Muslim, Ali was originally named Cassius Clay. After he refused for reasons of conscience to serve in the armed forces in the s, several boxing associations revoked his title as world champion, but he regained it later. During his boxing career he was extremely popular in Africa, and after his retirement he traveled there as a goodwill ambassador.

Anthony, Susan B. A reformer of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, known especially for her advocacy of women’s suffrage. She was also active in the cause of abolitionism before the Civil War.

Susan B. Anthony

Apaches (uh-pach-eez) A tribe of Native Americans who live in the southwestern United States. Geronimo was an Apache.

Apollo  The space vehicle that carried three American astronauts to the moon and back in July . The vehicle consisted of a command module, which stayed in lunar orbit, and a lunar module, which carried two of the three crewmen to a safe landing on the moon.

✥ On becoming the first person to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong declared: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” ✥ The other members of the crew were Buzz Aldrin, the second person to walk on the moon, and Michael Collins.

Ashe, Arthur An African-American tennis player who rose to fame in a sport previously dominated by whites. Ashe won many championships, including the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. He died in  of AIDS, which he contracted from a blood transfusion. He is honored by a statue on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia.

Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country Words from the inaugural address of President John F. Kennedy, delivered in .

Bakke decision (bak-ee) An important ruling on affirmative action given by the Supreme Court in . Allan Bakke, a white man, was denied admission to a medical school that had admitted black candidates with weaker academic credentials. Bakke contended that he was a victim of racial discrimination. The Court ruled that Bakke had been illegally denied admission to the medical school, but also that medical schools were entitled to consider race as a factor in admissions. The Court thus upheld the general principle of affirmative action.

Barton, Clara A reformer and nurse of the nineteenth century, who founded the American Red Cross in the s. She had organized nursing care for Union soldiers during the Civil War.

Bay of Pigs The location of a failed attempt by Cu ban exiles to invade Cuba in . The invaders, numbering about fourteen hundred, had left after the Cuban Revolution and returned to overthrow the new Cuban leader, Fidel Castro; they were trained and equipped by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. The operation was a disaster for the invaders, most of whom were killed or taken prisoner. The Bay of Pigs incident is generally considered the most humiliating episode in the presidency of John F. Kennedy, who had approved the invasion.

Bethune, Mary McLeod (muh-klowd; buh-thyoohn, buh-thoohn) An African-American educator and civil rights leader who in  founded a school for girls that later became part of Bethune-Cookman College. In the late s and early s she held an administrative position under the New Deal. In  she founded the National Council of Negro Women, which opposed the poll tax and racial discrimination and which promoted the teaching of black history in the public schools.

big stick diplomacy International negotiations backed by the threat of force. The phrase comes from a proverb quoted by Theodore Roosevelt, who said that the United States should “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”

Big Ten A group of prominent midwestern universities known for high academic standards and keen athletic competition. Nine of the ten are state universities: the universities of Illinois (at Urbana), Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin (at Madison); Michigan State University; Ohio State University; Indiana University; and Purdue University. Northwestern University is the sole private school.

Billy the Kid An outlaw of the late nineteenth century in New Mexico, who claimed to have killed over twenty people; he was gunned down himself at age twenty-one. His real name is uncertain.

Black, Hugo A judge of the twentieth century; he served on the Supreme Court from  to . Black was a strong defender of the civil liberties of the individual against intrusion by the state.

Black Muslims A radical movement for Black Power that reached a peak of influence in the United States during the s, partly under the leadership of Malcolm X. Members rejected Christianity as a religion of white people and embraced Islam. Like many other Black Muslims who took new names, the boxer Cassius Clay changed his name to Muhammad Ali to join the movement.

Black Panthers A militant Black Power organization founded in the s by Huey Newton and others. Newton proclaimed: “We make the statement, quoting from Chairman Mao, that Political Power comes through the Barrel of a Gun.”

Black Power A movement that grew out of the civil rights movement in the s. Black Power calls for independent development of political and social institutions for black people and emphasizes pride in black culture. In varying degrees, Black Power advocates called for the exclusion of whites from black civil rights organizations. Stokely Carmichael, one of the leaders of the movement and the head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), stated: “I am not going to beg the white man for anything I deserve. I’m going to take it.”

Bonnie and Clyde Two outlaws, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, who went on a two-year spree of murder and bank robbery in the s in Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas before being killed in an ambush.

Borden, Lizzie A woman charged with the ax murder of her father and stepmother in the s in Fall River, Massachusetts. A jury found her not guilty. The crime has never been solved.

Bradley, Omar A general of the twentieth century. Bradley commanded the United States ground forces in the liberation of France and the invasion of Germany in World War II.

brain trust A group of intellectuals and planners who act as advisers, especially to a government. The phrase is particularly associated with the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Brandeis, Louis D. (bran-deyes, bran-deyez) A judge of the twentieth century, he served on the Supreme Court from  to . Brandeis believed that economic and social facts had to take precedence over legal theory. He was the first Jew to serve on the Supreme Court.

Brown versus Board of Education (Brown decision) A case regarding school desegregation, decided by the Supreme Court in . The Court ruled that segregation in public schools is prohibited by the Constitution. The decision ruled out “separate but equal” educational systems for blacks and whites, which many localities said they were providing. The Court departed from tradition by using arguments from sociology to show that separate educational systems were unequal by their very nature.

✥ The Brown decision had an enormous effect on education throughout the country, not only in places where segregated schools were established by law, but also on school systems in which there was de facto segregation. The federal government, in the years that followed, required many city school systems to readjust school boundaries so that individual schools would have a mixed racial population.

Bryan, William Jennings A political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Bryan, claiming to be the candidate of the ordinary American, lost three presidential elections as the nominee of the Democratic party, although he gathered substantial votes in the South and West. At the  Democratic national convention, he delivered the much-remembered “Cross of Gold” speech in favor of unlimited coinage of silver and against the gold standard. A fundamentalist in religion, Bryan opposed the teaching of the theory of evolution in schools and assisted in the prosecution at the Scopes trial.

Buffalo Bill William F. Cody, a frontier settler, scout, and soldier of the nineteenth century. He was involved in several military actions against Native Americans and later turned to entertainment, founding the celebrated “Wild West Show.” (See also under “Fine Arts.”)

Bunche, Ralph (bunch) An African-American diplomat and prominent official of the United Nations, Bunche won the Nobel Prize for peace in  for negotiating an armistice between Israelis and Arabs.

Bush, George H. W. An American political leader of the late twentieth century; elected president as a Republican in  after he pledged: “Read my lips; no new taxes.” Once in office, however, he reached an agreement with Congress to raise taxes. Despite this, Bush’s popularity rose in the wake of American success in the Persian Gulf War, but then declined as the United States slipped into economic recession in . He was defeated for reelection in  by Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Bush, George W. The son of former president George H. W. Bush, he was elected governor of Texas in . In , he secured the Republican nomination for the presidency and narrowly defeated Al Gore, the Democratic party nominee, in an election marred by charges of irregularities in the counting of votes, especially in Florida. Although Gore won more popular votes, Bush prevailed in the Electoral College after a Supreme Court decision resolved the Florida controversy in his favor.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks (), the Bush adminstration identified Osama bin Laden as the mastermind behind the terror. With support from U.S. allies, Bush ordered a deployment of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and in nations adjoining Afghanistan, where bin Laden apparently ran training camps for terrorists with the backing of the Taliban. Air strikes led to the rout of the Taliban in November, though operations continued and bin Laden appeared to have evaded capture. On the domestic front, Bush oversaw successive reduction of interest rates to stimulate the sluggish U.S. economy.

The business of America is business A statement made by President Calvin Coolidge in the s.

✥ Coolidge’s words are often mentioned as typical of the overconfidence in the American economy that preceded the Great Depression.

Byrd, Richard E. An explorer of the twentieth century; he was navigator on the first flight over the North Pole. He also made one of the first flights over the South Pole and went on several extended expeditions to Antarctica.

Capone, Al (kuh-pohn) A leader of organized crime in Chicago in the late s, involved in gambling, the illegal sale of alcohol, and prostitution. He was sent to prison in the s for income tax evasion.

carpetbaggers Northerners who went to the South after the Civil War to take part in Reconstruction governments, when persons who had supported the Confederacy were not allowed to hold public office (see Fourteenth Amendment). Some of them arrived, according to legend, carrying only one carpetbag, which symbolized their lack of permanent interest in the place they pretended to serve.

✥ Carpetbagger is still a general term for nonresident politicians who exploit their districts.

Carter, James Earl (Jimmy Carter) A political leader of the twentieth century; the president from  to . In , Carter was a peanut farmer who had been a naval officer and the governor of Georgia; he stood outside the main power groups of the Democratic party. He gained the party’s nomination, however, and defeated President Gerald Ford in the election of . As president, Carter brought the heads of government of Israel and Egypt together to sign a historic peace treaty in , reestablishing diplomatic relations between their two countries (see Arab-Israeli conflict). He responded to an invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union in  by putting an embargo on grain sales to the invader and by keeping the United States out of the  summer Olympic Games, which were held in the Soviet Union. Many Americans found Carter’s leadership too cautious, however, and blamed him for a lack of improvement in the economy. His most striking loss of popularity came when revolutionaries in Iran stormed the United States embassy there in  and held several dozen Americans as hostages for over a year (see Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini). The Iranians agreed to release the hostages only in the last minutes of Carter’s presidency in early , after Carter had lost the election of  to Ronald Reagan. After leaving the presidency, he visited several nations, including Haiti and North Korea, as a peacemaker. He also participated in projects to refurbish housing for the poor.

✥ Personally, Carter was known for his informality.

Carver, George Washington An African-American scientist and agricultural innovator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Carver aided the economy of the South by developing hundreds of industrial uses for crops such as the peanut and the sweet potato.

✥ Carver, who was born to slave parents, was the first black scientist to gain nationwide prominence.

Chappaquiddick incident (chap-uh-kwid-ik) An automobile accident in  that greatly affected the career of Senator Edward (Ted) Kennedy of Massachusetts. A woman on Kennedy’s staff drowned at Chappaquiddick Island, off the Massachusetts coast, after a car that Kennedy had been driving, and in which she had been riding, went off a bridge. Kennedy survived, but delayed informing the police, and has never provided a full explanation of the incident. Afterward, many voters lost confidence in Kennedy, who had been considered a strong possibility to be nominated by the Democratic party for president.

Chief Joseph Chief of Oregon’s Nez Perce Indians who led his people in the s on a desperate attempt to reach Canada rather than submit to forcible settlement on a reservation. Forced to surrender to U.S. troops just south of the border, he reportedly stated: “Hear me my chiefs, I am tired: My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more.”

child labor laws Laws passed over many decades, beginning in the s, by state and federal governments, forbidding the employment of children and young teenagers, except at certain carefully specified jobs. Child labor was regularly condemned in the nineteenth century by reformers and authors (see David Copperfield and Oliver Twist), but many businesses insisted that the Constitution protected their liberty to hire workers of any age. In several cases in the early twentieth century, the Supreme Court agreed, declaring federal child labor laws unconstitutional. Eventually, in the late s, the federal Fair Labor Standards Act was upheld by the Court. This law greatly restricts the employment of children under eighteen in manufacturing jobs.

Chinese Exclusion Act of  A federal law passed in response to complaints by workers on the West Coast that competition from Chinese immigrants was driving down their wages and threatening white “racial purity.” It suspended Chinese immigration for ten years and declared Chinese immigrants ineligible for naturalization as American citizens. The law was renewed in  for another ten years, and in  Chinese immigration was permanently banned. Chinese immigrants did not become eligible for citizenship until .

Civil Rights Act of  A federal law that authorized federal action against segregation in public accommodations, public facilities, and employment. The law was passed during a period of great strength for the civil rights movement, and President Lyndon

Johnson persuaded many reluctant members of Congress to support the law.

civil rights movement The national effort made by black people and their supporters in the s and s to eliminate segregation and gain equal rights. The first large episode in the movement, a boycott of the city buses in Montgomery, Alabama, was touched off by the refusal of one black woman, Rosa Parks, to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. A number of sit-ins and similar demonstrations followed. A high point of the civil rights movement was a rally by hundreds of thousands in Washington, D.C., in , at which a leader of the movement, Martin Luther King, Jr., gave his “I have a dream” speech. The federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized federal action against segregation in public accommodations, public facilities, and employment. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed after large demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, which drew some violent responses. The Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination by race in housing, was passed in .

After such legislative victories, the civil rights movement shifted emphasis toward education and changing the attitudes of white people. Some civil rights supporters turned toward militant movements (see Black Power), and several riots erupted in the late s over racial questions (see Watts riots). The Bakke decision of  guardedly endorsed affirmative action.

Cleveland, Grover A Democratic party political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who was president from $1 8 8 5$ to  and again from  to  — the only president ever to serve nonconsecutive terms. Cleveland’s presidencies were marked by his fight against corruption in the federal government and by his efforts to solve national financial problems.

Clinton, Hillary Rodham A lawyer and the wife of William Jefferson Clinton. She attended law school with her future husband, and after their marriage she was his indispensable ally during his rise in Arkansas politics. After Bill Clinton became president, he appointed her to head a national task force on health reform. She publicly stood by him amid various allegations of marital infidelities, including the Monica Lewinsky affair, and she actively supported candidates of the Democratic party during elections. In  she was elected U.S. senator from New York.

✥ Hillary Rodham Clinton has aroused strong emotions of both support and hostility. She is generally considered more left-wing than her husband.

Clinton, William Jefferson (Bill) An American political leader of the late twentieth century. A Democrat, he handily defeated President George H. W. Bush’s bid for reelection in . Clinton, a former Rhodes scholar, had served as governor of Arkansas. Although harried by questions about his character during his presidential campaign, Clinton proved adept at reconciling the conservative and liberal wings of the Democratic party and establishing himself as the candidate of change. He was elected to a second term in . His second term was plagued by charges of sexual misconduct, which led to the Clinton impeachment. Nevertheless, he retained great popularity, partly because of a booming economy.

Clinton impeachment During his second term, President William Jefferson Clinton was accused of having perjured himself when he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, an intern with the federal government, and of having attempted to suborn the testimony of a witness. The House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton, despite charges that the impeachment proceedings were politically motivated. In , Clinton was tried and acquitted by the Senate. (See also impeachment.)

Cobb, Ty A baseball player of the early twentieth century. Cobb long held the world record for runs batted in and stolen bases in a career in the major leagues. He still holds the record for lifetime batting average.

Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) A leading organization in the civil rights movement. CORE launched the Freedom Riders and came under the influence of the Black Power philosophy.

containment A policy aimed at controlling the spread of communism around the world, developed in the administration of President Harry S. Truman. The formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in  was an important step in the development of containment.

Coolidge, Calvin A political leader of the early twentieth century. A Republican, he rose to prominence as governor of Massachusetts when he broke a strike by policemen in Boston, saying, “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.” He was elected vice president under Warren Harding and became president in  when Harding died. In , he was elected on his own, but he declined to seek reelection in ; Herbert Hoover succeeded him in . Coolidge worked to restrain the growth of government and especially to keep it from interfering with private enterprise; he once declared that “the business of America is business.”

✥ Coolidge was renowned for using few words; he announced his retirement from the presidency in one sentence: “I do not choose to run for president in .”

Crash of , stock market An enormous decrease in stock prices on the stock exchanges of Wall Street in late October . This crash began the Great Depression.

Crazy Horse A Sioux chief of the nineteenth century. Crazy Horse was one of the leaders of the Native American forces at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in . (See Custer’s last stand.)

Cross of Gold speech An address by the presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan to the national convention of the Democratic party in . Bryan criticized the gold standard and advocated inflating the currency by the free coinage of silver, a measure popular among the debt-ridden farmers whom Bryan championed. “You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns,” said Bryan; “You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” The speech stirred the convention, and Bryan was nominated for president.

Cuban missile crisis A confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in  over the presence of missile sites in Cuba; one of the “hottest” periods of the cold war. The Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, placed Soviet military missiles in Cuba, which had come under Soviet influence after the success of the Cuban Revolution three years earlier. President John F. Kennedy of the United States set up a naval blockade of Cuba and insisted that Khrushchev remove the missiles. Khrushchev did so.

Custer’s last stand The defeat of Colonel George A. Custer and his cavalry detachment by a large force of Native Americans at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in . Custer had been pursuing a group of Sioux, led by Sitting Bull, who had risen in arms against settlement of the country. Custer foolishly underestimated the size and ability of the Sioux forces, who were supported by Cheyenne warriors. Custer and all of the soldiers in his column were killed.

Daley, Richard A mayor of Chicago in the s, s, and s. One of the last and toughest of the big-city political “bosses,” he ran a powerful political machine, repeatedly and easily gaining reelection. He was also given much of the credit for the victory of John F. Kennedy in the close presidential election of ; Kennedy won by only a few thousand votes in Illinois. In , when demonstrators against involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War threatened to disrupt the Democratic national convention, meeting in Chicago, the Chicago police, with Daley’s approval, responded with violence. An official investigation later described the response as a “police riot.” Daley died in .

✥ Daley’s organization also gave Chicago’s government a reputation for quick responses to problems; Chicago was called a “city that works.”

Darrow, Clarence A lawyer and author of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was known for his defense of unpopular causes and persons, including Eugene V. Debs. Darrow was defense attorney in the Scopes trial.

A date which will live in infamy A description by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor — December , . Roosevelt was addressing Congress, asking it to declare war on Japan.

Dawes Act of  A federal law intended to turn Native Americans into farmers and landowners by providing cooperating families with  acres of reservation land for farming or  acres for grazing. In the eyes of supporters, this law would “civilize” the Indians by weaning them from their nomadic life, by treating them as individuals rather than as members of their tribes, and by readying them for citizenship. Although generally well intentioned, the law undermined Indian culture, in part by restricting their hunting rights on former reservation lands. Much of the best reservation land eventually passed into the hands of whites.

Debs, Eugene V. A political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Debs was five times the presidential candidate of the Socialist party. He was imprisoned in the s for illegally encouraging a railway strike; Clarence Darrow was his defense attorney. During World War I, he was imprisoned again, this time for his criticism of the war.

Democratic party One of the two major political parties in the United States; the Democrats. The origins of the Democrats are in the Democratic-Republican party, organized by Thomas Jefferson in the late eighteenth century; the first president elected simply as a Democrat was Andrew Jackson. Always strong in the South, the party was severely damaged by secession, the Civil War, and Reconstruction, and did not produce a winning presidential candidate between  and , when Grover Cleveland was elected. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in contrast to the Republicans, the Democrats tended to be the party of the South and West, opposed to the interests of business and the Northeast. Woodrow Wilson, the next Democratic president, was part of the Progressive movement. In the period of the New Deal, in the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic party reached enormous strength among labor union members, minority groups, and middleincome people. The Democratic presidents since Roosevelt have been Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, James Earl Carter, and William Jefferson Clinton.

✥ Since the New Deal, Democrats have emphasized the role of the federal government in promoting social, economic, and political opportunities for all citizens. They generally support a tax system that places a greater burden on the rich and large corporations, and they prefer spending on social programs to spending on defense. Today most blacks, along with Jews, liberals, and labor unions, support the party, which since the s has been strong in major cities. The Democrats’ strength in the white South, its strongest base before , has slipped significantly, and in the s and s many blue-collar workers shifted to the Republican party. ✥ Under President Clinton, the Democratic Party shed some of its New Deal legacies in order to win back white working-class and middle-class voters lost to the Republicans. ✥ The Democrats’ party symbol is the donkey.

Depression, Great The great slowdown in the American economy, the worst in the country’s history, which began in  and lasted until the early s. Many banks and businesses failed, and millions of people lost their jobs. (See Dust Bowl; fireside chats; Hoovervilles; New Deal; Okies; Franklin D. Roosevelt; and stock market Crash of 1929.)

Dewey, John A philosopher and educational reformer of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As a philosopher, Dewey followed pragmatism, and its practical orientation carried over into his educational ideas, which became the basis of progressive education.

Dillinger, John (dil-uhn-juhr) A notorious bank robber of the early twentieth century, who escaped from prison twice. Dillinger was finally gunned down by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in , outside a movie theater in Chicago.

doughboys United States infantry soldiers who served in World War I.

Douglas, William O. A justice of the Supreme Court from  to . Douglas was a committed liberal, who urged that the Court take bold steps in the application of the Constitution.

$\clubsuit$ Douglas served for thirty-six years, longer than any other justice in the history of the Court.

DuBois, W. E. B. (dooh boys) A black author and teacher of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A radical thinker on racial questions, he helped to found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). DuBois criticized the position of Booker T. Washington that blacks should accept their inferior status in American society and “accommodate” to white people. Later in his life, DuBois joined the American Communist party. His best-known book is The Souls of Black Folk, a collection of essays.

Dulles, John Foster (dul-uhs) Secretary of state under President Eisenhower, he was known for his moralism and militant anti-communism.

Korean War A war, also called the Korean conflict, fought in the early s between the United Nations, supported by the United States, and the communist Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). The war began in , when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations declared North Korea the aggressor and sent military aid to the South Korean army. President Harry S. Truman declared the war a “police action” because he never asked Congress to pass an official declaration of war. He thereby established a precedent for President Lyndon Johnson, who committed troops to the Vietnam War without ever seeking a congressional mandate for his action.

General Douglas MacArthur commanded the United Nations troops, who were mostly from the United States. The tide turned against North Korea with the landings at Inchon, and its troops were pushed back into the north; but reinforcements from the People’s Republic of China soon allowed the North Koreans to regain lost territory.

Some have identified the person who first said “Lafayette, we are here” as General John Pershing.

“Letter from Birmingham Jail” () A letter that Martin Luther King, Jr., addressed to his fellow clergymen while he was in jail in Birmingham, Alabama, in , after a nonviolent protest against racial segregation (see also sit-ins).

King upheld the general use of nonviolent civil disobedience against unjust laws, saying that human rights must take precedence over such laws. He claimed that “one who breaks an unjust law must do it openly, lovingly”; such a person, King said, is actually showing respect for law, by insisting that laws be just.

He led an effort to identify communists who, he said, had infiltrated the federal government by the hundreds, although he never supplied any of their names. One of McCarthy’s tactics was to establish guilt by association: to brand as communists people who merely had known a communist or who had agreed with the communists on some issue such as racial equality. His critics called him a demagogue who exploited people’s concerns about communism. He was also feared, however, because of the mass of information he had put together on people in the government. The Senate censured him in , saying that his actions were “contrary to senatorial traditions.”

✥ McKinley’s presidency is often remembered as a time of rising American jingoism and imperialism.

Midway Island, Battle of A naval and air battle fought in World War II in which planes from American aircraft carriers blunted the Japanese naval threat in the Pacific Ocean after Pearl Harbor.

militia movement of the s A secretive rightwing movement composed of self-styled militia men who established encampments in sparsely populated areas, primarily in the western states, and whose philosophy mixed racism and anti-Semitism with conspiracy theories and hostility to the American government.

muckrakers (muk-ray-kuhrz) Authors who specialize in exposing corruption in business, government, and elsewhere, especially those who were active at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Some famous muckrakers were Ida M. Tarbell, Lincoln Steffens, and Upton Sinclair. President Theodore Roosevelt is credited with giving them their name.

Murrow, Edward R. A highly respected radio and television commentator who, during World War II, reported from London on German air raids against that city and who attacked Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in the s as a threat to civil liberties. Murrow also created a show that first brought television cameras into the homes of celebrities for interviews.

My Lai massacre (mee leye) A mass killing of helpless inhabitants of a village in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, carried out in  by United States troops under the command of Lieutenant William Calley. Calley was court-martialed and sentenced to life imprisonment, but he only served a few years before parole. The massacre, horrible in itself, became a symbol for those opposed to the war in Vietnam.

Nation, Carry A social reformer of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who argued forcefully for abstinence from alcohol. Known for taking direct action, she and her followers often used hatchets to smash beer kegs and liquor bottles in saloons. (See Prohibition.)

National Origins Act of  A law that severely restricted immigration by establishing a system of national quotas that blatantly discriminated against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and virtually excluded Asians. The policy stayed in effect until the s.

New Deal A group of government programs and policies established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the s; the New Deal was designed to improve conditions for persons suffering in the Great Depression. The projects of the New Deal included the Social Security System, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Works Progress Administration.

✥ The New Deal remains controversial. Some have criticized it as too expensive and have called it an inadvisable expansion of federal control over the American economy. Others have insisted that the New Deal was an appropriate response to desperate conditions and produced programs of continuing value.

New Frontier A slogan used by President John F. Kennedy to describe his goals and policies. Kennedy maintained that, like the Americans of the frontier in the nineteenth century, Americans of the twentieth century had to rise to new challenges, such as achieving equality of opportunity for all.

New Left A radical movement of the s and s. New Leftists opposed the military-industrial complex and involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War; they urged more public attention to conditions of black people and the poor. New Leftists were less theoretical than communists and generally did not admire the Soviet Union. But many of them were interested in Maoism, and they spoke strongly for “participatory democracy.” (See sit-ins.)

Nimitz, Admiral Chester (nim-its) The commander of the United States Pacific Fleet during World War II.

# - See September 11 attacks.

Nisei (nee-say, nee-say) Persons whose parents were born in Japan but who were themselves born outside Japan. Many Nisei were moved by force in the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II.

Nixon, Richard A political leader of the twentieth century. A member of Congress in the late s, Nixon came to national attention through his strong support for the investigation of the alleged communist Alger Hiss. He was elected vice president twice under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but narrowly lost the presidential election of  to John F. Kennedy. He ran for governor of California two years later, was defeated again, and left politics for several years to practice law in New York City. Nixon reemerged as the Republican presidential candidate in  and defeated Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace in the election. The best-remembered events of his presidency were his visits to the People’s Republic of China and to the Soviet Union; a ceasefire in Vietnam and withdrawal of United States forces from that country; and the Watergate scandal, which led to his downfall. In , under immediate threat of impeachment, he became the first president to resign from office.

✥ Nixon received the nickname “Tricky Dick” for his early reputation for deviousness. ✥ Nixon was later pardoned by President Gerald Ford and after some years reemerged as a commentator on foreign policy.

normalcy A word used by President Warren Harding to describe the calm political and social order to which he wished to return the United States after the idealism and commotion of the presidency of Woodrow Wilson.

✥ Normalcy has been used as a general term for the political climate in the United States in the early s.

Oakley, Annie A performer in Wild West shows around the turn of the twentieth century, famous for her marksmanship. In one of her acts, she would flip a playing card into the air and then perforate it with bullets before it hit the ground. The musical Annie Get Your Gun is loosely based on her experiences.

O’Connor, Sandra Day The first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in .

Oklahoma City Bombing The destruction of a federal office building in Oklahoma City in  by a truck loaded with explosives; the blast killed  people. Timothy McVeigh, a former U.S. soldier, and two conspirators were convicted of the crime; McVeigh was executed.

✥ Many Americans initially assumed that this act of terrorism was the work of Arabs in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel and were shocked to learn that the perpetrators were Americans. McVeigh and his conspirators had vague ties to the militia movement of the 1990s.

Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy The wife of President John F. Kennedy, popularly known as Jackie Kennedy, and later as “Jackie O.” The public admired her as an elegant first lady whose beauty, sense of style, and interest in the arts set her apart from other first ladies. Her stoic demeanor at the time of her husband’s assassination enhanced her standing with the public. In , she stunned the nation by marrying Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who was many years her senior.

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself A statement from the first inaugural address of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in . Roosevelt was speaking at one of the worst points of the Great Depression.

Oswald, Lee Harvey The presumed assassin of President John F. Kennedy. Oswald allegedly shot Kennedy from a high window of a building in Dallas on November , , as Kennedy rode down the street in an open car. Oswald was captured the day of the assassination but was never tried; two days after Kennedy’s death, as Oswald was being moved by police, a nightclub owner from Dallas, Jack Ruby, shot and killed him. A government commission led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded later that Oswald, though active in communist causes, was not part of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Many have questioned the findings of the commission.

Owens, Jesse An African-American athlete of the twentieth century. He won four gold medals in track and field events at the Olympic Games of , held in Germany when Adolf Hitler was leader. His victories were a source of pride to the United States and also —

Jesse Owens. Running in a heat for the - meter dash at the Olympics in Germany in .

because Owens was black — a blow to the Nazi notions of a master race.

Parks, Rosa A black seamstress from Montgomery, Alabama, who, in , refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery city bus to a white person, as she was legally required to do. Her mistreatment after refusing to give up her seat led to a boycott of the Montgomery buses by supporters of equal rights for black people. This incident was the first major confrontation in the civil rights movement.

Patton, George (pat-n) A general in World War II, known for his expertise at warfare using tanks and other vehicles. He led operations in north Africa and in the Battle of the Bulge. A few months after the end of the war, he was fatally injured in a car accident in Germany.

✥ Patton was called “Old Blood and Guts”; his stern, demanding, and effective leadership was legendary.

Paul, Alice An American feminist and suffragist of the early twentieth century; she founded the National Woman’s Party in  and led protests at the White House and before Congress on behalf of women’s rights. Her tactics led to her imprisonment but also contributed to President Woodrow Wilson’s decision to make an amendment giving women the right to vote a priority. In  she proposed an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution but encountered opposition from various groups, including women’s organizations, which feared the loss of protective legislations if the amendment were ratified. Although the ERA has continued to be proposed, it has never been ratified.

Pearl Harbor A major United States naval base in Hawaii that was attacked without warning by the Japa nese air force on December , , with great loss of American lives and ships. In asking Congress to declare war on Japan the next day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt described the day of the attack as “a date which will live in infamy.”

Peary, Robert E. (peer-ee) An explorer of the Arctic in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The claim that he and his team were the first people to reach the North Pole, in , is now doubted.

Pearl Harbor. Wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor.

Pentagon Papers A classified study of the Vietnam War that was carried out by the Department of Defense. An official of the department, Daniel Ellsberg, gave copies of the study in  to the New York Times and Washington Post. The Supreme Court upheld the right of the newspapers to publish the documents. In response, President Richard Nixon ordered some members of his staff, afterward called the “plumbers,” to stop such “leaks” of information. The “plumbers,” among other activities, broke into the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist, looking for damaging information on him.

Perkins, Frances A political leader and reformer of the twentieth century. After briefly serving at Jane Addams’s Hull House, she worked in various reform activities and government positions. In  President Franklin D. Roosevelt made her the first woman to hold a cabinet position when he appointed her secretary of labor. She assisted in drafting much of the New Deal legislation, including that which created the Social Security System.

Perot, H. Ross (puh-rohe) A twentieth-century businessman and politician. Perot founded the Electronic Data Systems Corporation in Dallas in , became extremely wealthy, and in  ran for president of the United States as an independent. He ran again in  as the candidate of the Reform party, although his strongest showing was in , when he received nineteen percent of the popular vote.

✥ Perot’s stunning rise in  is widely attributed to voter dissatisfaction with “politics as usual.”

Pershing, John (pur-shing, pur-zhing) A military leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In , General Pershing commanded the United States troops that pursued the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa into Mexico. In , he was made commander of the United States troops sent to Europe to fight in World War I.

✥ Pershing was known as “Black Jack.”

Plessy versus Ferguson (ples-ee, fur-guh-suhn) A case decided by the Supreme Court in the s. The Court held that a state could require racial segregation in public facilities if the facilities offered the two races were equal. The Court’s requirement became known as the “separate but equal” doctrine. It was overturned by the Court in  in Brown versus Board of Education.

Populist party A third-party movement that sprang up in the s and drew support especially from disgruntled farmers. The Populists were particularly known for advocating the unlimited coinage of silver. The party endorsed William Jennings Bryan, a champion of free silver, in the presidential election of .

Powell, Colin An American military leader and statesman. After serving with distinction in the Vietnam War, Powell rose through the military to become the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and played a key role in the Persian Gulf War. In  he was appointed secretary of state, the first African-American to hold that position.

progressive education A broad movement for educational reform in the twentieth century. Progressive education is principally associated with John Dewey, but it contains many different and often conflicting ideas. In general, progressive educators view existing schools as too rigid, formal, and detached from real life. They prefer informal classroom arrangements and informal relations between pupils and teachers. They also prefer that schools teach useful subjects (including occupations) and emphasize “learning by doing” rather than instruction purely from textbooks. Some place the developing personality of the child at the center of educational thinking and insist, “teach the child, not the subject.”

Progressive movement A movement for reform that occurred roughly between  and . Progressives typically held that irresponsible actions by the rich were corrupting both public and private life. They called for measures such as trust busting, the regulation of railroads, provisions for the people to vote on laws themselves through referendum, the election of the Senate by the people rather than by state legislatures, and a graduated income tax (one in which higher tax rates are applied to higher incomes). The Progressives were able to get much of their program passed into law. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were associated with the movement.

Prohibition (proh-uh-bish-uhn) The outlawing of alcoholic beverages nationwide from  to , under an amendment to the Constitution. The amendment, enforced by the Volstead Act, was repealed by another amendment to the Constitution in .

Prohibition. Federal agents destroying confiscated kegs of beer.

✥ Prohibition is often mentioned in discussions of how much social change can be brought about through law, because alcohol was widely, though illegally, produced and sold during Prohibition; it was served privately in the White House under President Warren Harding, for example. ✥ Many use the example of Prohibition to argue that more harm than good comes from the enactment of laws that are sure to be widely disobeyed. ✥ Some states and localities (called “dry”) had outlawed the production and sale of alcohol before the Prohibition amendment was adopted. The repealing amendment allowed individual states and localities to remain “dry,” and some did for many years.

The public be damned Words attributed to William H. Vanderbilt, a railroad executive of the late nineteenth century. They were supposedly spoken to a newspaper reporter.

✥ “The public be damned” has often been recalled when business leaders have been accused of shirking responsibility toward the public.

Rankin, Jeanette A suffragist and pacifist (see pacifism), Rankin in  became the first woman to serve in Congress. She has the distinction of being the only member of Congress to vote against American entry into both World Wars.

Reagan, Ronald (ray-guhn) A political leader of the twentieth century, elected president in  and . Reagan went into politics after a career as a film actor. He served as governor of California from  to  and became a leading spokesman for conservatism in the United States. As the nominee of the Republican party, promising to work toward a balanced federal budget, he won a large victory over President James Earl Carter in  and an even larger one over Walter Mondale in . Early in his presidency, Reagan persuaded a Congress controlled by Democrats to increase spending on defense and to reduce taxes. The federal budget was to be balanced by reductions in spending outside of defense, but Reagan and the Congress were never able to agree on these. Accordingly, the federal government went deeper into debt throughout Reagan’s presidency. Reagan nevertheless was able to reduce the size and activities of the federal government outside of defense.

✥ His foreign policy was heavily affected by his opposition to communism; for example, he sent troops to the Caribbean island of Grenada to help put down a revolution in  and aided the opponents of the Marxist government of Nicaragua. The Strategic Defense Initiative, or “Star Wars,” was his favored approach to the problem of nuclear weapons. A scandal arose in his administration in the late s, when it was learned that Reagan’s subordinates had arranged a secret sale of weapons to Iran and an illegal transfer of the profits to rebels in Nicaragua, but investigators did not charge that Reagan himself was part of the arrangement (see Iran-Contra Affair). He met with the premier of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in , , and , and reached agreements on reduction of nuclear weapons. Reagan survived an attempted assassination in . ✥ In , at age seventy-three, Reagan became the oldest person ever to be elected president. ✥ Reagan, a highly popular president, was called the “Great Communicator” for his efforts to explain government problems and projects on a level that could be widely understood.

Reconstruction The period after the Civil War in which the states formerly part of the Confederacy were brought back into the United States. During Reconstruction, the South was divided into military districts for the supervision of elections to set up new state governments. These governments often included carpetbaggers, as former officials of the Confederacy were not allowed to serve in them. The new state governments approved three amendments to the Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, which had a provision keeping some former supporters of the Confederacy out of public office until Congress allowed them to serve; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights for black men. Once a state approved the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, it was to be readmitted to the United States and again represented in Congress. The official end of Reconstruction came in $1 8 7 7$ , when the last troops were withdrawn from the South.

$\clubsuit$ The program established for Reconstruction, largely the work of Republicans in the North, was far more severe than what President Abraham Lincoln had proposed before his assassination. Large numbers of white southerners resented being kept out of the “healing” of the nation that Lincoln had called for and were unwilling to give up their former authority. Ill feeling by former Confederates during Reconstruction led to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan and a long-standing hatred among southerners for the Republican party.

Red Scare The rounding up and deportation of several hundred immigrants of radical political views by the federal government in  and . This “scare” was caused by fears of subversion by communists in the United States after the Russian Revolution.

Religious Right A coalition of right-wing Protestant fundamentalist (see fundamentalism) leaders who have become increasingly active in politics since the Supreme Court’s  decision in Roe versus Wade. Among its leaders are Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. The Religious Right sponsors a network of Christian bookstores, radio stations, and television evangelists. Opposed to abortion, pornography, and what it views as the marginalizing of religion in American public life, the Religious Right has also championed prayer in the public schools. In the s it gave strong support to President Ronald Reagan.

Remember the Maine A slogan of the SpanishAmerican War. The United States battleship Maine mysteriously exploded and sank in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, in . Stirred up by the yellow press (see yellow journalism), the American public blamed the sinking on Spain, which then owned Cuba. President William McKinley, who had opposed war, yielded to public pressure and asked Congress to declare war.

Republican party One of the two major political parties in the United States. The party began in  (see under “American History to $ { 1 8 6 5 ^ { \circ } }$ ); Abraham Lincoln, elected in , was the first Republican president. During Reconstruction, many Republicans were eager to punish the South for its former slaveholding and for its secession from the United States. The northern Republicans, for example, supported carpetbaggers in southern governments. After Reconstruction, the Republicans favored a high protective tariff and were generally considered the defenders of northeastern and business interests. The party supported the Spanish-American War and the expansion of United States territory overseas. Some Republicans were part of the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. In the s, the party reestablished its reputation for supporting business and as being wary of any expansion of the place of government in national life. This characterization is still a reasonably accurate, if simplistic, description of basic Republican views. Since Lincoln, the Republican presidents have been Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush.

✥ The party is often called the GOP, which stands for “Grand Old Party.” ✥ The party’s symbol is an elephant.

Roaring Twenties The s in the United States, called “roaring” because of the exuberant, freewheeling popular culture of the decade. The Roaring Twenties was a time when many people defied Prohibition, indulged in new styles of dancing and dressing, and rejected many traditional moral standards. (See flappers and Jazz Age.)

Robinson, Jackie An African-American athlete of the twentieth century. In , he became the first black person to play baseball in the major leagues.

Rockefeller, Nelson A political leader of the twentieth century, and a grandson of John D. Rockefeller. He was governor of New York from  to  and sought the Republican nomination for president several times. Rockefeller was known as a moderate or liberal Republican. He served as vice president under President Gerald Ford.

Roe versus Wade An extremely controversial Supreme Court decision in  that, on the basis of the right to privacy, gave women an unrestricted right to abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. Pro-choice forces have hailed the decision, whereas those associated with the “right-to-life” (pro-life) movement have opposed it.

Roosevelt, Eleanor (roh-zuh-vuhlt, roh-zuh-velt) The wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her humanitarian and diplomatic efforts were known and respected all over the world. She represented the United States in the General Assembly of the United Nations from  to .

Roosevelt, Franklin D. (FDR) (roh-zuh-vuhlt, rohzuh-velt) A political leader of the twentieth century. Roosevelt was president from  to , longer than anyone else in American history; he was elected four times. Roosevelt, a Democrat who had been governor of New York, defeated President Herbert Hoover in the election of . He took office at one of the worst points in the Great Depression but told the American public, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” The early part of his presidency is remembered for the New Deal, a group of government programs designed to reverse the devastating effects of the Depression. He used fireside chats over the radio to build public support for his policies. In the later years of his presidency, he attempted to support the Allies in World War II without bringing the United States into the war. At this time, he made his speech announcing the Four Freedoms. After the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States entered the war. Roosevelt began the Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, a weapon that after his death brought a quick but highly controversial end to the war. Near the war’s end, Roosevelt negotiated the Yalta agreement with Britain and the Soviet Union. He died a few weeks before Germany surrendered and before the end of the war with Japan.

✥ Roosevelt’s appearance seemed designed to produce confidence in a nation discouraged by economic trials. He was frequently portrayed as sticking out his chin, grinning, and smoking a cigarette in a holder. He had suffered an attack of poliomyelitis when he was in his thirties, and for the rest of his life he could not walk unassisted. Photographers were therefore careful not to show him below the waist.

Roosevelt, Theodore (roh-zuh-vuhlt, roh-zuh-velt) A political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Roosevelt was president from  to . He became governor of New York in , soon after leading a group of volunteer cavalrymen, the Rough Riders, in the Spanish-American War. A Republican, Roosevelt was elected vice president in  under President William McKinley and became president when McKinley was assassinated; he was reelected on his own in . As president, he upheld many of the interests of the Progressive movement. His accomplishments include the breaking up of large monopolies (see trust busting), better federal inspection of food, closer federal regulation of railroads, and more conservation of natural resources. Roosevelt summarized his foreign policy as “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” He received the Nobel Prize for peace in , after he brought the opponents in the Russo-Japanese War to an agreement. Construction of the Panama Canal was begun during his presidency. He did not seek reelection in , but ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in  as the candidate of the Progressive party.

✥ “Teddy” Roosevelt was a man of hearty enthusiasms, devoted to physical fitness (“the strenuous life”) and big-game hunting. He supposedly exclaimed “Bully!” when he was pleased. ✥ Roosevelt once said that he was “as strong as a bull moose.” Accordingly, the Progressive party of , which nominated him for president, was commonly called the Bull Moose party.

Roosevelt’s Court packing plan A move by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to increase the size of the Supreme Court and then bring in several new justices who would change the balance of opinion on the Court. Roosevelt proposed to pack the Court in the s, when several conservative justices were inclined to declare parts of his program, the New Deal, unconstitutional. Congress would not allow the number of justices to be increased, and Roosevelt was

Franklin D. Roosevelt

criticized for trying to undermine the independence of the Court.

Rose Bowl The oldest and most famous of the “bowl games” — college football games held after the regular college football season between teams that are invited on the basis of their record in the regular season. The Rose Bowl game is played in Pasadena, California, on New Year’s Day, and is preceded by the Tournament of Roses Parade of floats adorned with roses.

Rosenberg case (roh-zuhn-burg) A court case involving Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, an American couple who were executed in  as spies for the Soviet Union. Some have argued that the Rosenbergs were innocent victims of McCarthy-era hysteria against communists or of anti-Semitism (they were Jewish). Others contend that they were indeed Soviet spies.

Rough Riders. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt (center, wearing glasses) and the Rough Riders on San Juan Hill, Cuba, .

Rough Riders The nickname of a volunteer group of cavalry led by Colonel Theodore Roosevelt in the Spanish-American War. They were famous for a victorious charge at the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba.

Ruth, Babe A baseball player of the early twentieth century, known for hitting home runs. He hit sixty home runs in , a record for a -game season that stood until the late twentieth century. Ruth supposedly once pointed to a spot in the seats where he would hit his next home run, and then proceeded to hit the ball there. His real name was George Herman Ruth.

Sacco and Vanzetti (sak-oh; van-zet-ee) Two anarchists (see anarchism), Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were convicted of a robbery and two murders in Massachusetts in the early s and sentenced to death. Sacco and Vanzetti were born in Italy but had been living in the United States for years when they were tried. Several faulty procedures took place in the trial. Many people have thought that Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted because of their po litical views and not because of the evidence against them. Their supporters obtained several delays of their execution, but a special committee appointed by the governor of Massachusetts upheld the original jury’s verdict, and they were put to death in . Liberals and radicals all over the world were outraged by the execution.

Sanger, Margaret (sang-uhr) The founder in the s and s of the birth control movement (she coined the term). Sanger overcame the initial hostility of the medical profession and combated laws that in most states prohibited contraception. She later headed the Planned Parenthood Federation.

Margaret Sanger. Photographed in the s making an appeal to a Senate committee for legislation relating to birth control.

Scopes trial The trial of John Scopes, a high school teacher in Tennessee, for teaching the theory of evolution in violation of state law. The trial was held in , with eminent lawyers on both sides — William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense. Although Scopes was convicted, he was given a nominal fine, and the outcome was widely seen as a victory for Darrow.

✥ At the time, many saw the Scopes trial as a sign of deep conflict between science and religion.

September  attacks The most destructive attack of terrorism ever launched against the United States. On September , , a group of Islamic terrorists, widely believed to be part of the Al Qaeda network, hijacked three commercial airliners in midair, took over the controls, and deliberately crashed them into the Pentagon and the twin towers of the World Trade Center (WTC). A total of  people who worked at the Pentagon, which suffered severe damage, were killed, and another sixty-four died on the airliner. Fire caused by the initial crash into the WTC led to the collapse of each tower, but not before hundreds of New York City firefighters and police had entered the towers to rescue victims. When the towers collapsed, many of them were killed, along with thousands of workers who had been trapped after the initial crashes on the towers’ upper floors.

Counting firefighters, police, tower workers, and passengers on the doomed airliners, the death toll at the WTC ran to over three thousand people. Another forty-four people died on a fourth hijacked airliner, which crashed in a field near Pittsburgh. The attacks provoked outrage not only in the United States, but also abroad, both because of their savagery and because roughly ten percent of those killed in the collapse of the twin towers were foreign nationals.

In response, President George W. Bush assembled an international coalition against terrorism. He received strong support from America’s traditional European allies — NATO, for example, officially declared the attacks an assault against all of its members and from the Russian Federation, which had been battling Islamic separatists in Chechnya. Even China, which feared Islamic separatist movements in its far western provinces, gave verbal support to the campaign against terrorism. The Islamic world, in contrast, was much cooler. Nevertheless, Bush was able to secure from Pakistan’s government the right to use Pakistan as a base from which to attack Afghanistan, whose Taliban, it was believed, harbored Al Qaeda members and Osama bin Laden. American air strikes against the Taliban commenced three weeks after the September  attacks.

✥ In addition to the human carnage, the attacks severely crippled both the U.S. and foreign economies. For example, in the wake of the attacks, air travel plummeted and insurance companies faced enormous costs for the damage. ✥ Many Americans compared the attacks to Pearl Harbor, because they took an unprepared America by surprise.

settlement houses Social and cultural centers established by reformers in slum areas of American cities during the s and the early s. Jane Addams founded the most famous settlement house, in Chicago. (See Progressive movement.)

✥ Settlement houses attracted idealistic college graduates eager to learn how the poor lived and to improve the condition of the poor.

Seward, William H. (sooh-uhrd) A political leader of the nineteenth century. Seward was secretary of state under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. He is best known for arranging the purchase of Alaska from Russia in  for seven million dollars.

$\clubsuit$ Alaska was long called “Seward’s Folly” and “Seward’s Icebox” by people who thought that the place would show little return on the American investment in it.

sharecropping A system of farming that developed in the South after the Civil War, when landowners, many of whom had formerly held slaves, lacked the cash to pay wages to farm laborers, many of whom were former slaves. The system called for dividing the crop into three shares — one for the landowner, one for the worker, and one for whoever provided seeds, fertilizer, and farm equipment.

Sherman Antitrust Act A federal law passed in  that committed the American government to opposing monopolies. The law prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies “in the restraint of trade or commerce.” Under the authority of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the federal government initiated suits against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company. (See trust busting.)

silent majority A term used by President Richard Nixon to indicate his belief that the great body of Americans supported his policies and that those who demonstrated against the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War amounted to only a noisy minority.

Sioux (sooh) A common name for the Dakota people, a tribe of Native Americans inhabiting the northern Great Plains in the nineteenth century. They were famed as warriors and frequently took up arms in the late nineteenth century to oppose the settlement of their hunting grounds and sacred places. In , Sioux warriors, led by Chief Sitting Bull, and commanded in the field by Chief Crazy Horse, overwhelmed the United States cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. (See Custer’s last stand.) A group of Sioux under Chief Big Foot were massacred by United States troops at Wounded Knee in .

sit-ins A form of nonviolent protest, employed during the s in the civil rights movement and later in the movement against the Vietnam War. In a sit-in, demonstrators occupy a place open to the public, such as a racially segregated (see segregation) lunch counter or bus station, and then refuse to leave. Sit-ins were designed to provoke arrest and thereby gain attention for the demonstrators’ cause.

✥ The civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., defended such tactics as sit-ins in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”

Sitting Bull A Native American leader of the Sioux tribe in the late nineteenth century. He was a chief and medicine man when the Sioux took up arms against settlers in the northern Great Plains and against United States army troops. He was present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in , when the Sioux decisively defeated the cavalry led by Colonel George Custer. (See Custer’s last stand.)

Social Gospel A religious movement that arose in the United States in the late nineteenth century with the goal of making the Christian churches more responsive to social problems, such as poverty and prostitution. Leaders of the movement argued that Jesus’

message was as much about social reform as about individual approaches to salvation.

Spanish-American War A war between Spain and the United States, fought in . The war began as an intervention by the United States on behalf of Cuba. Accounts of Spanish mistreatment of Cuban natives had aroused much resentment in the United States, a resentment encouraged by the yellow press (see yellow journalism). The incident that led most directly to the war was the explosion of the United States battleship Maine in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, an incident for which many Americans blamed Spain (see Remember the Maine). The United States won the war easily. The best-remembered incidents in the SpanishAmerican War were the charge of the Rough Riders, led by Theodore Roosevelt, in the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba, and the Battle of Manila Bay in the Philippines, at which Admiral George Dewey said, “You may fire when you are ready, Gridley.” The United States acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines in the war and gained temporary control over Cuba.

✥ The victory of the United States in the SpanishAmerican War made the country a world power, with territories spread across the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Hawaii, which had been an independent kingdom, was annexed by the United States in the same period.

Speak softly and carry a big stick A proverb quoted by Theodore Roosevelt as a brief statement of his approach to foreign policy. (See big stick diplomacy.)

spoils system The practice of appointing applicants to public offices as a reward for their loyalty to the po litical party in power. The term comes from a statement by a senator in the s: “To the victor belong the spoils.” Reform of the system commenced in the s with the introduction of merit as the basis of appointment to office. (See James A. Garfield, machine politics, and patronage.)

Stanton, Elizabeth Cady A reformer and feminist who joined with Lucretia Mott in issuing the call for the first women’s rights convention in America, which was held at Seneca Falls, New York, in . Stanton later worked in close partnership with Susan B. Anthony for women’s suffrage. (See Seneca Falls Convention.)

Star Wars A popular name, taken from the title of a film, for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of President Ronald Reagan. “Star Wars” involves the development by the United States of a defense in outer space against intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Stevenson, Adlai E. (ad-lee, ad-lay) A political leader of the twentieth century, who served as governor of Illinois and as the United States ambassador to the United Nations. The Cuban missile crisis occurred during his ambassadorship. He was nominated for president twice by the Democratic party against Dwight D. Eisenhower, in  and , and lost both times.

✥ Stevenson was known for his wit and as a “thinking” rather than a crowd-pleasing candidate.

Stonewall Riot A disturbance that grew out of a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a popular hang-out for gays in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village in . Such raids long had been routine, but this one provoked a riot as the crowd fought back. The riot led to the formation of the Gay Liberation Front and to a new level of solidarity among homosexuals.

Super Bowl The championship game of the National Football League, held each year in January.

Taft, William Howard A political leader of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A Republican, Taft was president between  and . At the beginning of his presidency, he stayed close to the policies of Theodore Roosevelt, who had been president before him. Later, however, he turned to more conservative measures, such as a high protective tariff, and he lost popularity. In foreign policy, Taft advocated dollar diplomacy. He came in third in the election of , running as a Republican, behind Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. In the s, Taft served as chief justice of the Supreme Court.

Taft-Hartley Act A major law concerning labor, passed by Congress in . President Harry S. Truman vetoed Taft-Hartley (see veto), but it became law by a two-thirds vote of Congress. It marked a reversal of the pro-labor policies pursued under the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. For example, the law prohibited a list of “unfair” labor practices and restricted the political activities of labor unions.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) A corporation created by the federal government in the Great Depression to promote the economic development of the Tennessee River and adjoining areas. The TVA, known as a builder of dams, is responsible for flood control, the generation of electric power, soil conservation, and other areas of economic development. The TVA was part of the New Deal.

Tet offensive A series of major attacks by communist forces in the Vietnam War. Early in , Vietnamese communist troops seized and briefly held some major cities at the time of the lunar new year, or Tet. The Tet offensive, a turning point in the war, damaged the hopes of United States officials that the combined forces of the United States and South Vietnam could win.

Thorpe, Jim An athlete of the twentieth century, known for his ability in several sports. A Native American, he was a leading college football player and also the best performer in track and field events at the  Olympic Games.

Three Mile Island The location of an accident in  in a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The plant underwent a partial meltdown that resulted in some radiation leakage into the atmosphere, panic among nearby residents, losses of billions of dollars, and intense criticism of nuclear power programs in general.

transcontinental railroad A train route across the United States, finished in . It was the project of two railroad companies: the Union Pacific built from the east, and the Central Pacific built from the west. The two lines met in Utah. The Central Pacific laborers were predominantly Chinese, and the Union Pacific laborers predominantly Irish. Both groups often worked under harsh conditions.

Truman, Harry S. (trooh-muhn) A political leader of the twentieth century. A Democrat, Truman was president from  to . In , after representing Missouri in the Senate, Truman was elected vice president under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and became president when Roosevelt died. He led the nation in the final months of World War II and made the decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Truman enthusiastically supported the United Nations and put forward the Marshall Plan to aid the recovery of Europe after the war. He sent American troops to support the United Nations in the Korean War, and, in a controversial move, removed General Douglas MacArthur from his command in Korea. (See Truman-MacArthur controversy.)

✥ Truman’s homespun, often feisty style of leadership made him a symbol of no-nonsense Middle America. People often encouraged him, following his own preferences in vocabulary, with the words “Give ’em hell, Harry.” A sign on his desk read “The buck stops here.” He was also fond of the saying, “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” ✥ Truman gained a surprise victory in the presidential election of  over the Republican candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. On the day of the election, several commentators had confidently asserted that Truman could not win, and the Chicago Tribune had gone to press with a huge headline reading “Dewey Defeats

Truman.” Truman discussed these errors with great relish the next day.

Truman-MacArthur controversy A dispute between President Harry S. Truman and General Douglas MacArthur in , during the Korean War. MacArthur, who commanded the troops of the United Nations, wanted to use American air power to attack the People’s Republic of China. Truman refused, fearing that an American attack on China would bring the Soviet Union into the war. When MacArthur criticized Truman’s decision publicly, Truman declared MacArthur insubordinate and removed him as commanding general. MacArthur returned to the United States, received a hero’s welcome, and told Congress, “Old soldiers never die; they only fade away.”

Tweed, William Marcy A New York City political leader, known as Boss Tweed, who in the late s ran a network of corrupt city officials called the Tweed Ring. Under Tweed, city officials extorted kickbacks from contractors and others doing business with the city. His name is synonymous with municipal corruption.

Vietnam War (vee-et-nahm, vee-et-nam) A war in Southeast Asia, in which the United States fought in the s and s. The war was waged from  to  between communist North Vietnam and noncommunist South Vietnam, two parts of what was once the French colony of Indochina. Vietnamese communists attempted to take over the South, both by invasion from the North and by guerrilla warfare conducted within the South by the Viet Cong. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy sent increasing numbers of American military advisers to South Vietnam in the late s and early s. Kennedy’s successor, President Lyndon Johnson, increased American military support greatly, until half a million United States soldiers were in Vietnam.

American goals in Vietnam proved difficult to achieve, and the communists’ Tet offensive was a severe setback. Reports of atrocities committed by both sides in the war disturbed many Americans (see My Lai massacre). Eventually, President Richard Nixon decreased American troop strength and sent his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, to negotiate a cease-fire with North Vietnam. American troops were withdrawn in , and South Vietnam was completely taken over by communist forces in .

✥ The involvement of the United States in the war was extremely controversial. Some supported it wholeheartedly; others opposed it in mass demonstrations and by refusing to serve in the American armed forces (see draft). Still others seemed to rely on the government to decide the best course of action (see silent majority). ✥ A large memorial (see Vietnam Memorial) bearing the names of all members of the United States armed services who died in the Vietnam War is in Washington, D.C.

Voting Rights Act of  A law passed at the time of the civil rights movement. It eliminated various devices, such as literacy tests, that had traditionally been used to restrict voting by black people. It authorized the enrollment of voters by federal registrars in states where fewer than fifty percent of the eligible voters were registered or voted. All such states were in the South.

Wallace, George A political leader of the twentieth century. As governor of Alabama in the s, he resisted integration and promised to “stand at the schoolhouse door” to bar black people from admission to the University of Alabama. The National Guard eventually forced him to back down. In , he was nominated for president by a third party, the American Independent party, and came in third, behind Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. In , he ran for president again, but was shot and paralyzed by a would-be assassin during the campaign. Wallace presented himself as a populist (see populism), who championed poor and middle-income whites against blacks and wealthy, liberal whites. In a remarkable reversal of positions, he endorsed integration in the s and was again elected governor of Alabama for four years.

War is hell A statement attributed to General William Tecumseh Sherman, a leader of the Union army in the Civil War. Sherman supposedly said this several years after the war, in an address to a group of cadets.

War on Poverty A set of government programs, designed to help poor Americans, begun by President Lyndon Johnson in . The War on Poverty included measures for job training and improvement of housing.

Warren, Earl A political leader and judge of the twentieth century. Warren was governor of California before being named chief justice of the Supreme Court in , and he served on the Court until . His time as chief justice was marked by boldness in interpreting the Constitution; the “Warren Court” often brought the Constitution to the support of the disadvantaged. (See Brown versus Board of Education and Miranda decision). Warren also led a government commission investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (see Lee Harvey Oswald).

Washington, Booker T. An African-American educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who headed Tuskegee Institute, a college for African-Americans in Alabama. Washington urged African-Americans to concentrate on economic gains rather than on the pursuit of social and political equality with whites. The best known of his many books is Up from Slavery.

Watergate An incident in the presidency of Richard Nixon that led to his resignation. In June , burglars in the pay of Nixon’s campaign committee broke into offices of the Democratic party. In a complex chain of events, high officials on Nixon’s staff who had been connected to the burglary used illegal means to keep the burglary from being fully investigated; these actions by Nixon’s staff were known as the “cover-up.” Nixon arranged for secret tape-recording of many conversations in his office regarding the cover-up and then refused to hand the tapes over to investigators from Congress. After months of legal maneuvers, Nixon finally released the tapes, which showed that he had known about criminal activity by his staff. By this time, the House of Representatives was one step away from impeachment of Nixon. Leaders of Congress told him that if he were impeached and tried, he would very likely be removed from office. He resigned the presidency in August , complaining of a lack of support from Congress. Several of his assistants were convicted of various crimes connected with Watergate. Nixon himself was never indicted and was pardoned by his successor, President Gerald Ford.

✥ Many people became more scornful of government after the Watergate incident. Others were en

couraged that the investigation and convictions were finally carried out.

Watts riots A group of violent disturbances in Watts, a largely black section of Los Angeles, in . Over thirty people died in the Watts riots, which were the first of several serious clashes between black people and police in the late s. ✥ Los Angeles was the scene of another riot in , triggered by the acquittal of white police officers accused of beating an AfricanAmerican man named Rodney King.

“We Shall Overcome” The best-known song of the civil rights movement. It contains these words: “Deep in my heart I do believe / That we shall overcome some day.”

Wilson, Woodrow A political leader and educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A Democrat, he was elected president in  after serving as president of Princeton University (see Ivy League) and as governor of New Jersey. Wilson was president from  to . He tried to keep the United

States neutral after World War I broke out in ; his campaign slogan in  was “He kept us out of war.” After Germany had repeatedly violated the neutral status of the United States, the country finally did enter the war in , with Wilson maintaining that “the world must be made safe for democracy.” Wilson produced his aims for peace, Fourteen Points, soon afterward. At Wilson’s insistence, the treaty that ended the war provided for a new international organization, the League of Nations. Wilson was bitterly disappointed when the United States Senate later refused to permit the United States to join the League. He went on a strenuous speaking tour to convince the American public of the League’s importance. While on the tour, he suffered a stroke, from which he never fully recovered. In , Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.

women’s movement A movement to secure legal, economic, and social equality for women, also called the feminist movement. It has its roots in the nineteenth-century women’s movement, which sought, among other things, to secure property rights and suffrage for women. The modern feminist movement, often said to have been galvanized by the publication of Betty Friedan’s book The Feminine Mystique, began in the s and advocates equal pay for equal work, improved day care arrangements, and preservation of abortion rights. (See Equal Rights Amendment, feminism, and Gloria Steinem.)

Woods, Tiger Popular name of Eldrick Woods, a golfer who in  set three Masters tournament records: he won by the fewest strokes ever (-under-par  for four rounds), beat the runner-up by twelve strokes, and became at twenty-one the youngest man ever to win. He then went on to win many other titles in a sport traditionally dominated by whites.

Works Progress Administration (WPA) A program of the New Deal in the s. The WPA built sidewalks, government buildings, and similar public works throughout the United States. During the Great Depression, the WPA employed many people who could not find other work.

The world must be made safe for democracy Words used by President Woodrow Wilson in  to justify his call for a declaration of war on Germany. The

World Trade Center. The twin towers defined the New York City skyline until their destruction by terrorists in September .

words implied that Germany’s militarism threatened democracy everywhere.

World Series A series of baseball games held each October between the champions of the two major baseball leagues, the American League and the National League.

World Trade Center A complex of commercial buildings on the western side of lower Manhattan. The twin towers, more than one hundred stories high and a prominent part of the New York skyline, were destroyed when terrorist-hijacked planes crashed into them as part of the September 11 attacks (), with a staggering loss of lives. Other buildings in the complex suffered major damage when the towers collapsed.

Wounded Knee A creek in South Dakota where United States soldiers killed large numbers of Dakota Native Americans — Sioux — in . The Sioux, under Chief Big Foot, had been resisting settlement of the area and had fled to Montana, but United States troops brought them back to South Dakota for detention. As the soldiers were disarming the warriors in an army camp at Wounded Knee, a rifle shot alarmed the soldiers, and fighting broke out in which more than two hundred Sioux were killed, including women and children. The massacre was the last major military conflict between whites and Native Americans.

yellow journalism Inflammatory, irresponsible reporting by newspapers. The phrase arose during the s, when some American newspapers, particularly those run by William Randolph Hearst, worked to incite hatred of Spain, thereby contributing to the start of the Spanish-American War. Newspapers that practice yellow journalism are called yellow press.

Yellow Peril A supposed threat to the United States posed by Japan and China. The phrase arose in the late nineteenth century, at a time when Japanese and Chinese immigration to America was meeting resistance and when Japan was growing as a military power. (See internment of Japanese Americans.)

# World Politics

This section includes entries for the various types of government (for example, monarchy, republic, and despotism) and for ideologies (such as communism and socialism) that influence contemporary political movements. In general, abstract and philosophical terms, even if relevant to the United States, are included here rather than under “American Politics.” The “World Politics” section does not include political leaders — even those who currently hold office. We placed such entries in the various history sections.

— J.F.K.

ABM Treaty The popular name for part of the  Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) between the United States and the former Soviet Union; it restricts the number and locations of antiballistic missiles (ABM) that each nation can deploy. President George W. Bush has announced his intention to abandon the treaty so that the United States can deploy an ABM system, parts of which would be space-based. (See Star Wars.)

absolute monarchy Rule by one person — a monarch, usually a king or a queen — whose actions are restricted neither by written law nor by custom; a system different from a constitutional monarchy and from a republic. Absolute monarchy persisted in France until  and in Russia until .

Anti-Semitism. A German sign before World War II that reads, “Jews are not welcome in this town.”

apartheid (uh-pahr-teyet, uh-pahr-tayt) The racist policy (see racism) of South Africa that long denied blacks and other nonwhites civic, social, and economic equality with whites. It was dismantled during the s. (See Nelson Mandela.)

appeasement A political policy of conceding to aggression by a warlike nation.

✥ A classic example of appeasement is the Munich Pact of , negotiated between Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler. Chamberlain, the prime minister of Britain, allowed Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia to Germany.

Arab-Israeli conflict A conflict between the Israelis and the Arabs in the Middle East. The United Nations established Israel, a nation under control of Jews, in Palestine in the late s, in territory inhabited by Palestinian Arabs. Israel was placed in the midst of four Arab nations — Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt — and the presence of Israel has led to constant contention between Israel and the Arab world. Both the Israelis and the Arabs claim land in Palestine as theirs by ancestral rights, and war has periodically broken out between them. (See also Yasir Arafat; Gamal Abdel Nasser; intifada; Oslo Accord; Palestine Liberation Organization; Yitzhak Rabin; Anwar Sadat; and Six-Day War.)

aristocracy A privileged, primarily hereditary ruling class, or a form of government controlled by such an elite.

✥ Traditionally, the disproportionate concentration of wealth, social status, and political influence in the aristocracy has been resented by the middle class and lower class.

✥ Some nations disguise spies as attachés.

autocracy (aw-tok-ruh-see) A system of government in which supreme political power is held by one person. (Compare constitutional monarchy, democracy, and oligarchy.)

✥ Iraq under Saddam Hussein is an autocracy.

balance of power A state of peace that results when rival nations are equally powerful and therefore have no good reason to wage war.

balance of terror The balance of power between nations that are equipped with nuclear weapons, stemming from their fear of mutual annihilation in a nuclear war.

balkanization (bawl-kuh-nuh-zay-shuhn) Division of a place or country into several small political units, often unfriendly to one another. The term balkanization comes from the name of the Balkan Peninsula, which was divided into several small nations in the early twentieth century.

banana republics A term describing any of several small nations in Latin America that have economies based on a few agricultural crops.

✥ The term banana republic is often used in a disparaging sense; it suggests an unstable government.

Berlin wall A wall that separated West Berlin, Germany, from East Germany, which surrounded it until . At the end of World War II, the victorious Allies divided Berlin, the German capital, into four sectors. The eastern, or Russian, sector became the capital of communist East Germany. The French, British, and American sectors continued as a prosperous Western “island” city surrounded by East Germany. From then until , many East Germans, sometimes two thousand a day, fled to West Berlin, often with nothing more than the clothes they had on their backs.

In the summer of , the wall was built, and East Germany forbade its citizens to cross the wall, at the risk of being shot immediately by border guards. In November , the East German government reopened the border and issued visas to East Berliners. The Berliners celebrated by breaking off pieces of the wall at a mass demonstration, which lasted into the next day. The wall has since been demolished.

✥ The Berlin wall was one of the most visible signs of the cold war and has become a symbol of the Iron Curtain and totalitarianism.

bicameral legislature (beye-kam-uhr-uhl) A legislature with two houses, or chambers. The British parliament is a bicameral legislature, made up of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Likewise, the United States Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

bilateralism (beye-lat-uhr-uh-liz-uhm) Trade or diplomatic relations between two countries. (See diplomacy and recognition; compare multilateralism and unilateralism.)

capital punishment The death penalty for a crime.

capitalism An economic and political system characterized by a free market for goods and services and private control of production and consumption. (Compare socialism and communism.)

chauvinism Exaggerated belief in the supremacy of one’s nation, class, caste, or group. Chauvinism usually involves xenophobia.

✥ The word chauvinism is often used as shorthand for “male chauvinism,” a term describing the attitudes of men who believe that women are inferior and should not be given equal status with men. (See also feminism.)

civil disobedience The refusal to obey a law out of a belief that the law is morally wrong.

✥ In the nineteenth century, the American author Henry David Thoreau wrote “Civil Disobedience,” an important essay justifying such action. ✥ In the twentieth century, civil disobedience was exercised by Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for independence in India. Civil disobedience, sometimes called nonviolent resistance or passive resistance, was also practiced by some members of the civil rights movement in the United States, notably Martin Luther King, Jr., to challenge segregation of public facilities; a common tactic of these civil rights supporters was the sit-in. King defended the use of civil disobedience in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”

Civil disobedience. A nonviolent protest against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Washington, .

civil service The nonmilitary personnel who work for a government, applying its laws and regulations.

coalition An alliance of political groups formed to oppose a common foe or pursue a common goal.

✥ In countries with many political parties, none of which can get a majority of the citizens’ votes, the only way an effective government can be formed is by a coalition of parties. Such coalitions are often unstable.

cold war A constant nonviolent state of hostility between the Soviet Union and the United States. The cold war began shortly after World War II, with the rapid extension of Soviet influence over eastern Europe and North Korea. With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the cold war ended. (See Berlin airlift, Berlin wall, and Iron Curtain.)

colonialism The control of one nation by “transplanted” people of another nation — often a geographically distant nation that has a different culture and dominant racial or ethnic group. (See ethnicity.)

✥ A classic example of colonialism is the control of India by Britain from the eighteenth century to . $\clubsuit$ Control that is economic and cultural, rather than political, is often called neocolonialism.

✥ Commissioned officers are contrasted with enlisted men and women, such as privates, corporals, and sergeants, or ordinary seamen and petty officers.

common law Law developed in the course of time from the rulings of judges, as opposed to law embodied in statutes passed by legislatures (statutory law) or law embodied in a written constitution (constitutional law). (See stare decisis.)

✥ The importance of common law is particularly stressed in the legal system of Britain, on which the legal system of the United States is based.

communism An economic and social system envisioned by the nineteenth-century German scholar Karl Marx. In theory, under communism, all means of production are owned in common, rather than by individuals (see Marxism and Marxism-Leninism). In practice, a single authoritarian party controls both the political and economic systems. In the twentieth century, communism was associated with the economic and political systems of China and the Soviet Union and of the satellites of the Soviet Union. (Compare capitalism and socialism.)

communist A supporter of communism.

confederation A group of nations or states, or a government encompassing several states or political divisions, in which the component states retain considerable independence. The members of a confederation often delegate only a few powers to the central authority.

✥ The United States was governed as a confederation in the first few years of its independence (see Articles of Confederation). ✥ Canada is officially a confederation of provinces.

consent of the governed A condition urged by many as a requirement for legitimate government: that the authority of a government should depend on the consent of the people, as expressed by votes in elections. (See Declaration of Independence, democracy, and John Locke.)

conservatism A general preference for the existing order of society, and an opposition to efforts to bring about sharp change. (Compare liberalism.)

conservative A descriptive term for persons, policies, and beliefs associated with conservatism.

constitution A nation or state’s fundamental set of laws. Most nations with constitutions have them in written form, such as the United States Constitution. The constitution of Britain, by contrast, is an informal set of traditions, based on several different laws.

constitutional monarchy A form of national government in which the power of the monarch (the king or queen) is restrained by a parliament, by law, or by custom. Several nations, especially in modern times, have passed from absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, including Belgium, Britain, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.

counterinsurgency Military power applied in guerrilla warfare in support of the established government.

coup (kooh) In politics, an abbreviation for coup d’état.

coup d’état (kooh day-tah) A quick and decisive seizure of governmental power by a strong military or political group. In contrast to a revolution, a coup d’état, or coup, does not involve a mass uprising. Rather, in the typical coup, a small group of politicians or generals arrests the incumbent leaders, seizes the national radio and television services, and proclaims itself in power. Coup d’état is French for “stroke of the state” or “blow to the government.”

Court of St. James’s The royal court of Britain, including the queen or king and a group of officials who aid in ruling the country.

✥ Ambassadors to Britain are officially ambassadors to the Court of St. James’s.

cultural imperialism The imposition of a foreign viewpoint or civilization on a people.

✥ Democratic institutions, such as parliaments, may exist in a monarchy. Such constitutional monarchies as Britain, Canada, and Sweden are generally counted as democracies in practice.

despotism (des-puh-tiz-uhm) Unlimited political rule by one person.

✥ The term usually suggests unscrupulous rule, or tyranny.

détente (day-tahnt) A period of lessening tension between two major national powers, or a policy designed to lessen that tension. Détente presupposes that the two powers will continue to disagree but seeks to reduce the occasions of conflict.

deterrence A military capability sufficiently strong to discourage any would-be aggressor from starting a war because of the fear of retaliation. (See balance of terror.)

developing nation A nation where the average income is much lower than in industrial nations, where the economy relies on a few export crops, and where farming is conducted by primitive methods. In many developing nations, rapid population growth threatens the supply of food. Developing nations have also been called underdeveloped nations. Most of them are in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. (See also Third World.)

dictatorship Government by a single person or by a junta or other group that is not responsible to the people or their elected representatives.

✥ Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin were dictators.

diplomatic immunity Exemption of diplomats — ambassadors and other representatives of a foreign nation — from the laws of the nation to which they are assigned.

✥ Foreign representatives have sometimes gone unpunished for serious crimes after claiming diplomatic immunity. The main purpose of diplomatic immunity, however, is to protect diplomats from harassment or arrest by their host government.

disfranchisement (dis-fran-cheyez-muhnt) Removal of the franchise, or right to vote.

dissidents Persons who refuse to conform to prevailing political and social values.

European Union A political union, often called the EU, to which the member states of the EEC are evolving. Based on the Maastrict Treaty, it envisions the eventual establishment of common economic, foreign, security, and justice policies. The extent to which this goal will be achieved is still in doubt and occasions deep divisions in some member states, especially Great Britain. The members of the EU are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. Several nations, including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Turkey, are seeking membership.

Gypsies A nomadic people who originated in the region between India and Iran and who migrated to Europe in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Most now live in Europe and the United States. Their language is called Romany. Thousands were murdered in the holocaust.

✥ One who lives a footloose, carefree life is sometimes called a gypsy.

In a controversial move, Yasir Arafat has brought members of Hamas into positions of authority within the Palestinian Authority. Hamas sponsors terrorism directed at Israel, especially in the form of suicide bombers in crowded places.

Hezbollah A radical Arabic organization that arose after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The Hezbollah has often been accused of terrorism.

After the division of Ireland in the early twentieth century into Northern Ireland, which remained united with Britain, and the Irish Free State, now called the Republic of Ireland, the IRA took as its goal the uniting of the entire island under the Republic. The IRA continues to pursue this goal; membership, however, is illegal in the Republic, and the IRA’s Provisional Wing has practiced terrorism. (See Sinn Fein.)

Islamic fundamentalism A movement that has gained momentum in recent decades within several Muslim nations. Islamic fundamentalists oppose the infiltration of secular and Westernizing influences and seek to institute Islamic law, including strict codes of behavior. They also target political corruption in Muslim nations. Severely repressed by the governments of their own nations, such as Algeria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, they nevertheless target the United States as the “Great Satan,” chant “Death to America,” and provide ready recruits for terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda. (See terrorism.)

In , Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic sent Serbian troops to take back areas of Kosovo controlled by ethnic Albanian guerrillas, triggering a NATO air campaign in . The war ended when Serbia agreed to a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations.

✥ The Kosovo War was NATO’s first military engagement. It was controversial in part because NATO was not repelling an attack on member states but intervening in what was arguably an internal affair.

Kremlin A fortress in central Moscow that contains the central offices of the government of Russia and, formerly, the offices of the Soviet Union.

✥ The term Kremlin was also used figuratively to mean the former Soviet government.

Kurds (kurdz, koordz) A linguistically and culturally distinct people who inhabit parts of Syria, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and the former Soviet Union. Once part of the Ottoman Empire, they long have sought an independent nation-state, but without success. After his defeat in the Persian Gulf War, Saddam Hussein brutally repressed rebellious Kurds in northern Iraq.

Kyoto Protocol (kee-oh-toh) An agreement on global warming reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Kyoto, Japan, in . The major industrial nations pledged to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases between  and . (See greenhouse effect.) Although the American delegation signed the protocol, the United States Senate has refused to ratify the treaty, mainly because it believes that the targeted reductions are so steep that they will produce a severe economic slump.

✥ Attacking the U.S. position as selfish, European governments have been extremely critical of the U.S. refusal to ratify the protocol.

leftist One who holds a left-wing viewpoint; someone who seeks radical social and economic change in the direction of greater equality.

left-wing A descriptive term for liberal, radical, or revolutionary political views, particularly the view that there are unacceptable social inequalities in the present order of society. Communists and socialists, as well as moderate liberals, come under the term leftwing. Left-wing groups are sometimes known collectively as the Left. (Compare right-wing.)

Marxism The doctrines of Karl Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels on economics, politics, and society. They include the notion of economic determinism — that political and social structures are determined by the economic conditions of people. Marxism calls for a classless society in which all means of production are commonly owned (communism), a system to be reached as an inevitable result of the struggle between the leaders of capitalism and the workers.

Marxism-Leninism (len-uh-niz-uhm) The doctrines of Marxism as applied by Lenin, a founder of the Soviet Union, to the building of Marxist nations. With Karl Marx, Lenin called for a classless society in which all means of production would be commonly owned (communism). Unlike some Marxists, however, Lenin stressed bold, revolutionary action and insisted that a strong Communist party would be needed in a Marxist nation to direct the efforts of the workers. Lenin also argued that capitalist nations resort to aggressive imperialist moves as they decline and that Marxist nations must therefore be prepared for war. Eventually, according to Marxism-Leninism, the rigid governmental structures that have characterized the former Soviet Union and other Marxist nations will not be necessary; the “withering away of the state” will occur. A major problem for Marxism-Leninism has been the difficulty of abandoning these governmental structures. (Compare capitalism and imperialism.)

minister A title used in many countries for members of cabinets and similar public officials, who are roughly equivalent to the officials in the United States cabinet. For example, a minister of foreign affairs will have duties similar to those of the secretary of state of the United States.

Molotov cocktail (mol-uh-tawf, mol-uh-tawv) An incendiary bomb made from a breakable container, such as a bottle, filled with flammable liquid and provided with a rag wick.

(See absolute monarchy and constitutional monarchy.)

moratorium (mawr-uh-tawr-ee-uhm) A period of delay agreed to by parties to a dispute or parties who are negotiating. A moratorium may also be an authorized delay in the repayment of a loan, especially by a nation (as in a moratorium on war debts).

The prizes were founded by a Swedish munitions maker, Alfred Nobel, and are considered a mark of worldwide leadership in the fields in which they are given. Nobel winners, called Nobel laureates, receive their prizes in ceremonies in Stockholm, Sweden, except for the peace prize, which is presented in Oslo, Norway.

nonaligned nations Nations of the Third World that as a group rejected alliance with either the United States or the former Soviet Union.

nonperson A former political leader whom a government wants the people to ignore, because the former leader’s views or actions are considered unacceptable by the current government. This unusual practice is most commonly used in totalitarian states (see totalitarianism), where past leaders often disappear from the official histories of one regime and reappear in the histories of another. The creation of nonpersons was particularly striking in the former Soviet Union, where leaders such as Trotsky and Khrushchev became nonpersons even while they were alive. (See rehabilitation.)

Nonproliferation Treaty An agreement made in  to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. It has been ratified by ninety-two countries, but not by all countries with the potential to develop nuclear weapons. Neither India nor Pakistan, each of which subsequently developed nuclear weapons, ratified it.

nonviolent resistance Refusal to obey a law considered unjust; civil disobedience.

✥ Mahatma Gandhi urged and practiced nonviolent resistance during the efforts to win independence for India from Britain in the early twentieth century. ✥ African-Americans in the civil rights movement often practiced nonviolent resistance in the South in the s — for example, by sitting-in at segregated lunch counters to provoke arrest and draw attention to their cause. (See segregation and sit-ins.)

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (naytoh) An international organization, begun in . The members have pledged to settle disputes among themselves peacefully and to defend one another against outside aggressors. The founding members of NATO are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Britain, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States. Greece, Spain, Turkey, and Germany became members later. France was a founding member, but withdrew from NATO’s military command in . The Warsaw Pact was signed by the Soviet Union and its allies largely in response to the formation of NATO. Since the end of the cold war, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have joined.

Nuclear Test Ban Treaty An agreement made in  by Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States not to test nuclear weapons in the air, in outer space, or under the sea. Underground testing was permitted under the treaty.

Organization of American States (OAS) An international organization that includes the United States and over thirty nations in Latin America. It was founded in the s to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes and economic cooperation among members.

Oslo Accord An agreement brokered by Norway after months of secret negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in . By its terms, Israel and the PLO recognized each other. The PLO renounced terrorism, and Israel agreed to withdraw its military and civil authorities from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, granting self-rule to Palestinians in these areas and a lesser degree of self-rule to other parts of the Occupied Territories. Although the accord put off consideration of the thorny issues of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem, it set  as a deadline for a final agreement. Subsequent negotiations to resolve these issues failed, however.

✥ Though favored by moderates in both camps, the Oslo Accord was rejected by Hamas and Syria’s president Hafez al-Assad. Yitzhak Rabin, Israel’s premier when the accord was reached, was assassinated by an Israeli law student in .

pacifism The view that war is morally unacceptable and never justified (see conscientious objector). The term is sometimes applied to the belief that international disputes should be settled peacefully.

Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) A government that is recognized by the United Nations as the body that represents the people of Palestine displaced by the establishment of Israel (see ArabIsraeli conflict). The PLO has long been led by Yasir Arafat and, at least officially, is committed to a compromise by which Israel would exchange portions of the Occupied Territories, areas including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank that Israel took from the Arabs in the Six-Day War. Arafat currently heads the Palestinian Authority, which has gained limited self-government over parts of the Occupied Territories. He has been opposed by radical Arabs, especially by Hamas, an organization opposed to compromise with Israel. Israeli opinion on whether the PLO can be trusted to discharge its side of any compromise settlement is deeply divided.

Palestinian Authority (PA) A legal entity, established in , by which Palestinians govern the parts of the

Palestine Liberation Organization. Yasir Arafat (right), Yitzhak Rabin (left), and Bill Clinton (center) at the signing of the Israeli–PLO peace accord at the White House, September .

Gaza Strip and West Bank that are not attached to Israel. Although divided on several issues, the leadership of the Palestinian Authority is committed to the establishment of a Palestinian state, which, it expects, will grow out of the Palestinian Authority. (See Yasir Arafat, Oslo Accord.)

parliament (pahr-luh-muhnt) An assembly of representatives, usually of an entire nation, that makes laws. Parliaments began in the Middle Ages in struggles for power between kings and their people. Today, parliaments differ from other kinds of legislatures in one important way: some of the representatives in the parliament serve as government ministers, in charge of carrying out the laws that the parliament passes. Generally, a parliament is divided by political parties, and the representative who leads the strongest political party in the parliament becomes the nation’s head of government. This leader is usually called the prime minister or premier. Typically, a different person — usually a king, queen, or president — is head of state, and this person’s duties are usually more ceremonial than governmental.

✥ The number of nations governed by parliaments has greatly increased in modern times.

parliamentary system (pahr-luh-men-tree, pahr-luhmen-tuh-ree) A system of government in which the power to make and execute laws is held by a parliament. Britain has a parliamentary system of government, one of the oldest in the world. The United States does not; its legislature, the Congress, passes the laws, and a separate part of government, the executive branch, carries them out.

partition A division of a nation or territory into two or more nations. Cyprus, Germany, India, Ireland, Korea, Palestine, and Vietnam are notable examples of countries that have undergone partition.

It is particularly associated with Mahatma Gandhi, who opposed violent revolution in his own country’s fight for independence. (Compare civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance.)

People’s Republic of China The government of China set up in  after the victory of the communist forces of Mao Zedong. The People’s Republic ruled the mainland of China, forcing the government of Nationalist China into exile on the island of Taiwan. For years, many Western nations, especially the United States, refused to recognize the People’s Republic as the government of mainland China; instead, they exchanged ambassadors only with Nationalist China. The United States recognized the People’s Republic as the government of China in .

plebiscite (pleb-uh-seyet, pleb-uh-suht) A vote of an entire nation or other large political unit on an issue of great importance. A plebiscite is not an election, for there are no candidates. Rather, people vote yes or no on a proposition.

political science The systematic study of government and politics. Political science is a social science that makes generalizations and analyses about political systems and political behavior and uses these results to predict future behavior. Political science includes the study of political philosophy, ethics, international relations and foreign policy, public administration, and the dynamic relations between different parts of governments.

population control In reaction to the prediction by Thomas Malthus that the world’s population would soon outgrow its food supply, a movement began in the early twentieth century to limit the number of births and therefore limit the growth of the world’s population. The movement is supported by groups such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation. A number of countries have made population control a national policy. To varying extents, the methods of population control include family planning, birth control, contraception, and abortion. These policies are opposed by many groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, and are controversial.

Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely An observation that a person’s sense of morality lessens as his or her power increases. The statement was made by Lord Acton, a British historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

preemptive strike A first-strike attack with nuclear weapons carried out to destroy an enemy’s capacity to respond. A preemptive strike is based on the assumption that the enemy is planning an imminent attack.

Realpolitik is German for “the politics of reality” and is often applied to the policies of nations that consider only their own interests in dealing with other countries.

recognition In diplomacy, the act by which one nation acknowledges that a foreign government is a legitimate government and exchanges diplomats with it. The withholding of recognition is a way for one government to show its disapproval of another.

Red Cross, International An international organization, founded under the terms of the first Geneva Convention. Its original duty was to care for those who were wounded, sick, or homeless in wartime. Today, it also attends to victims of natural disasters.

reprisal An act by which a nation seeks, short of war, to redress a wrong committed against it by another nation. Boycotts and blockades are common forms of reprisal.

republic A form of government in which power is explicitly vested in the people, who in turn exercise their power through elected representatives. Today, the terms republic and democracy are virtually interchangeable, but historically the two differed. Democracy implied direct rule by the people, all of whom were equal, whereas republic implied a system of government in which the will of the people was mediated by representatives, who might be wiser and better educated than the average person. In the early American republic, for example, the requirement that voters own property and the establishment of institutions such as the Electoral College were intended to cushion the government from the direct expression of the popular will.

Rhodes scholarship (rohdz) A scholarship for study at Oxford University. Cecil Rhodes, an English financier of the late nineteenth century, established the scholarships to train potential leaders. They are designed for students from Germany and from nations formerly part of the British Empire, including the United States. Rhodes scholars are chosen for ability, moral character, and success in sports.

Some socialists tolerate capitalism, as long as the government maintains the dominant influence over the economy; others insist on an abolition of private enterprise. All communists are socialists, but not all socialists are communists.

Solidarity A labor union in Poland, independent of the government and of the Polish Communist party, that grew to a membership of several million in the early s.

Soviet Bloc The communist nations closely allied with the Soviet Union, including Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania, whose foreign policies depended on those of the former Soviet Union. It did not include communist nations with independent foreign policies, such as China, Yugoslavia, and Albania. The Soviet Union used its military force several times in the Soviet Bloc to ensure that the countries’ governments followed Soviet preferences: in East Germany in , in Hungary and Poland in , and in Czechoslovakia in , for example. (See Warsaw Pact.)

statutory law (stach-uh-tawr-ee) A law or group of laws passed by a legislature or other official governing bodies. (Compare common law.)

Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) Negotiations started in Helsinki, Finland, in  between the United States and the Soviet Union to limit the countries’ stock of nuclear weapons. The treaties resulting from these negotiations are called SALT I and SALT II. These treaties have led to START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks). START I (a  agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union) and START II (a  agreement between the United States and Russia) placed specific caps on each side’s stock of nuclear weapons.

strategy/tactics Two levels of problem solving. Strategy is a broad plan of action; tactics are the means for carrying out strategy.

summit meeting Direct personal negotiations between heads of governments, especially meetings that took place between the leaders of the United States and the former Soviet Union.

Taliban movement A body of Islamic fundamentalist students who rose to power in  in Afghanistan. By , the Taliban controlled about ninety percent of the country and imposed harsh Islamic law, including strict codes of behavior. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the United States attacked the Taliban, which was believed to be harboring terrorists, in particular, Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. (See terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism.)

terrorism Acts of violence committed by groups that view themselves as victimized by some notable historical wrong. Although these groups have no formal connection with governments, they usually have the financial and moral backing of sympathetic governments. Typically, they stage unexpected attacks on civilian targets, including embassies and airliners, with the aim of sowing fear and confusion. Israel has been a frequent target of terrorism, but the United States has increasingly become its main target. (See also September 11 attacks, Osama bin Laden, Hezbollah, and Basque region.)

theocracy (thee-ok-ruh-see) A nation or state in which the clergy exercise political power and in which religious law is dominant over civil law. Iran led by the Ayatollah Khomeini was a theocracy under the Islamic clergy. (See Islam.)

Third World The nonaligned nations — which are often developing nations — of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They are in a “third” group of nations because they were allied neither with the United States nor with the former Soviet Union.

throw-weight The size of the nuclear warhead or set of warheads that a missile, such as a ballistic missile, can carry. A nation might make up for the inaccuracy of its missiles by increasing their throw-weight.

Tories A political party in Britain, also called the Conservative party. In the late eighteenth century, the Tories took form as defenders of the king and stability and of established interests in Britain; they advised caution in making political and social change. Winston Churchill, Benjamin Disraeli, and Margaret Thatcher belonged to the party.

totalitarianism (toh-tal-uh-tair-ee-uh-niz-uhm) Domination by a government of all political, social, and economic activities in a nation. Totalitarianism is a phenomenon of the twentieth century: earlier forms of despotism and autocracy lacked the technical capacity to control every aspect of life. The term is applied both to fascist governments (see fascism) and to many forms of communism.

Trotskyism (trot-skee-iz-uhm) The doctrines of the twentieth-century Russian political leader Leon Trotsky, who believed that communism should depend on the cooperation of the proletariats of all nations rather than on domination by the Soviet Union. Trotsky’s ideas were opposed by Joseph Stalin, the Soviet premier, who sent Trotsky into exile, made him a nonperson, and eventually had him assassinated.

ultimatum (ul-tuh-may-tuhm) A formal message delivered from one government to another threatening war if the receiving government fails to comply with conditions set forth in the message. For example, after the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand in , the government of Austria sent an ultimatum to Serbia, which Austria held responsible for the assassination.

unilateralism (yooh-nuh-lat-uhr-uh-liz-uhm) Action initiated or taken by a single nation rather than by two nations (see bilateralism) or several (see multilateralism). For example, a nation might choose to disarm unilaterally in the hope that others will follow. (See recognition.)

United Kingdom Part of the official name of the British nation; the full name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It includes England, Scotland, Wales, and six counties of Ireland, ruled by the king or queen of England, and represented in the nation’s parliament.

United Nations An organization that includes vir tually all countries in the world, with nearly  member nations. Its General Assembly, in which each member nation has one vote, guides policies and finances generally. Another important division of the United Nations is the Security Council, in which five powerful nations have a majority; the Security Council is charged with solving crises and keeping peace. The United Nations also includes an Economic and Social Council; a Secretariat, or administrative division; and the International Court of Justice, or World Court. It also is allied with several agencies that operate independently, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

✥ The United Nations was formed after World War II as a successor to the League of Nations and has served as a forum for many international disputes, notably the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Cuban missile crisis. It also engages in peacekeeping operations by sending lightly armed detachments of soldiers from neutral nations to supervise cease-fires between combatants. Through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), it provides aid for those uprooted by war or famine. ✥ The Korean War was officially fought by the United Nations against North Korea. ✥ A twenty-eight nation coalition of United Nations member states opposed Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in . (See Persian Gulf War.) $\clubsuit$ The headquarters of the U.N. are in Manhattan. Some of its affiliates, however, are centered elsewhere. The International Court of Justice sits in The Hague. UNHCR is headquartered in Geneva, and UNESCO in Paris.

United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) A controversial agency allied with the United Nations. UNESCO was founded to enhance cooperation among members of the United Nations in education, science, and culture. In the s, several countries withdrew, complaining that UNESCO had become too political.

veto A vote that blocks a decision. In the United Nations, for example, each of the five permanent members of the Security Council has the power of veto.

walk-out The action of leaving a meeting, place of work, or organization as an expression of disapproval or grievance: “During Grimm’s speech, the radical students staged a walk-out.”

welfare state A state or government that promotes public welfare through programs of public health, pensions, unemployment compensation, public housing, and the like. The expression welfare state is often used by those hostile to government intervention in these areas.

zero-sum game A game in which the winnings of some players must equal the losses of the others. Zerosum games are mentioned in a political context when it is believed that resources are limited, and every decision will produce both winners and losers. In such situations, political decisions will be made on the basis of trade-offs between competing interests.

Zionism The belief that Jews should have their own nation; Jewish nationalism. Zionism gained much support among Jews and others in the early twentieth century, and the hoped-for nation was established in the late s in Palestine, as the state of Israel. Zionism is opposed by most Arabs. (See Arab-Israeli conflict.)

# American Politics

American politics includes the formal institutions of our government, such as Congress, the Supreme Court, and the various departments that compose the executive branch, and also the process by which various bodies of citizens (often called interest groups) compete for influence or control over these institutions. This competition gives rise to many terms that routinely appear in the mass media, usually without definitions. Examples include lobby, pork-barrel legislation, and machine politics.

The principal vehicles by which Americans traditionally have sought to influence their government are political parties, notably the Republican and Democratic parties. These two parties, which have long dominated American politics, are themselves loose coalitions of interest groups. These interest groups are bound together by their desire to win elections, an objective that induces them to formulate platforms that will appeal to as many voters as possible.

The goals of interest groups within a particular party often come into conflict. Try as they will, party platforms cannot always minimize the differences. As a result, interest groups sometimes shift allegiance from one party to another. For example, from  until the s, African-Americans overwhelmingly voted Republican, whereas southern whites gave such unflinching support to the Democratic party that their region was known as the Solid South. Today, these allegiances have been reversed. African-Americans overwhelmingly vote Democratic, whereas southern whites increasingly vote Republican. No matter how disenchanted an interest group becomes with a particular party, however, it nearly always prefers transferring to the rival party rather than forming a third party. Most interest groups recognize that their only chance for enduring influence lies in riding one of the major parties to victory.

The two-party system helps to distinguish American politics from the politics of some European democracies, which have a large number of parties. Another distinguishing feature of American politics is federalism, not only in the sense that power is divided between the federal government and the states, but also in the sense that the system of checks and balances ensures a division of power within the federal government itself. Federalism plays all sorts of tricks on the two-party system. For example, Republican presidents have often been forced to cut deals with Democratic congressional majorities. Regardless of the platform of the victorious candidate in a presidential election, the actual laws passed usually reflect compromises between the two parties.

Compared to other nations, the United States is also distinguished by the large role its courts play in its political system. Americans almost universally agree that the Constitution is a document to be venerated. As interpreters of the Constitution, federal courts have often defined and redefined social and civil relations that in other nations are set by custom and tradition. Within the last thirty years, for example, the federal courts played a critical role in breaking down racial segregation. Our list of entries necessarily includes a large number of terms related to the legal interpretation of civil rights.

Entries under “American Politics” include only terms current today. In contrast, the two “American History” sections generally cover terms that, although once of great political significance, lack current relevance. Most items pertaining to American foreign policy, including the language of the arms race, can be found in the “World Politics” section. The latter also includes philosophical movements that have affected both American and foreign political movements.

— J.F.K.

academic freedom The right of teachers and students to express their ideas in the classroom or in writing, free from political, religious, or institutional restrictions, even if these ideas are unpopular.

affirmative action A term referring to various government policies that aim to increase the proportion of African-Americans, women, and other minorities in jobs and educational institutions historically dominated by white men. The policies usually require employers and institutions to set goals for hiring or admitting minorities.

✥ Affirmative action has been extremely controversial. Supporters maintain that it is the only way to overcome the effects of past discrimination and promote integration. Critics dismiss it as “reverse discrimination,” denying opportunities to qualified whites and men. (See Bakke decision).

AFL-CIO Abbreviation for the American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations, two groups that merged in  to become the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. Member unions, including a variety of workers from machinists to musicians, make up over seventy percent of the unionized labor force in the United States.

✥ Though officially nonpartisan, the AFL-CIO has strong traditional ties with the Democratic party.

Alaskan pipeline An oil pipeline that runs eight hundred miles from oil reserves in Prudhoe Bay, on the northern coast of Alaska, to the port of Valdez, on Alaska’s southern coast, from which the oil can be shipped to markets. Also called the Trans-Alaska pipeline.

✥ After oil was discovered in Prudhoe Bay in , construction of the pipeline was delayed for several years, as conservationists warned against the effects of the pipeline on the ecosystems through which it would run. ✥ In  an environmental disaster occurred when an oil tanker, the Exxon Valdez, ran aground and leaked millions of gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, causing the largest oil spill in U.S. history.

alderman (awl-duhr-muhn) A member of a city council. Aldermen usually represent city districts, called wards, and work with the mayor to run the city government. Jockeying among aldermen for political influence is often associated with machine politics.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) An organization founded in  in the wake of the red scare to defend civil liberties. The ACLU has often defended the rights of individuals aligned with unpopular causes, including American communists and Nazis.

American Dream A phrase connoting hope for prosperity and happiness, symbolized particularly by having a house of one’s own. Possibly applied at first to the hopes of immigrants, the phrase now applies to all except the very rich and suggests a confident hope that one’s children’s economic and social condition will be better than one’s own.

American Legion The largest organization of American veterans, open to those who participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and subsequent conflicts, such as America’s war on terrorism. The American Legion has established an influential political position, gaining support in Congress and the federal executive branch for veterans’ interests; its efforts contributed to the creation of the Veterans Administration, now the Department of Veterans Affairs, which provides medical services and other benefits to veterans and their families. Traditionally conservative, the American Legion promotes patriotism and a strong military defense. (See also Veterans of Foreign Wars.)

amicus curiae (uh-mee-kuhs kyoor-ee-eye) See friend of the court.

antitrust legislation Laws passed in the United States, especially between  and , to prevent large business corporations, called trusts, from combining into monopolies to restrict competition. The laws were instituted to encourage free enterprise. (See also trust busting.)

✥ The enforcement of antitrust laws has been inconsistent. ✥ Although the Bell Telephone system was declared a monopoly and forced to break up, huge corporations continue to merge.

apportionment The allocation of seats in a legislature or of taxes according to a plan. In the United States Congress, for example, the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives is based on the relative population of each state, whereas the apportionment in the Senate is based on equal representation for every state. (See also gerrymander.)

appropriation The grant of money by a legislature for some specific purpose. The authority to grant appropriations, popularly known as the power of the purse, gives legislatures a powerful check over executive branches and judicial branches, for no public money can be spent without legislative approval. Congress, for example, can approve or reject the annual budget requests of the executive branch for its agencies and programs, thereby influencing both domestic and foreign policy. (See also checks and balances and pork-barrel legislation.)

arbitration The settling of disputes (especially labor disputes) between two parties by an impartial third party, whose decision the contending parties agree to accept. Arbitration is often used to resolve conflict dip lomatically to prevent a more serious confrontation.

Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) An agency of the United States government from  to  that was charged with controlling and developing the use of atomic energy for civilian and military purposes. In , the AEC was abolished, and its duties were divided between two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration (now a part of the Department of Energy) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

attorney general of the United States The head of the United States Department of Justice and a member of the president’s cabinet. The attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States government.

block grant A financial aid package that grants federal money to state and local governments for use in social welfare programs, such as law enforcement, community development, and health services. Block grants provide money for general areas of social welfare, rather than for specific programs. This arrangement not only reduces bureaucratic red tape, but also allows grant recipients more freedom to choose how to use the funds. A product of Republican administrations in the s and s, block grants reduce federal responsibility for social welfare. (See federalism.)

blue laws Laws that prohibit certain businesses from opening on Sunday or from selling certain items on that day. Blue laws often apply to bars and to alcohol sales. Originally enacted to allow observation of Sunday as a Sabbath, blue laws have come under attack as violating the separation of church and state. The courts, however, have upheld most blue laws, on the basis that their observance has become secular and promotes Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation.

branches of government The division of government into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. In the case of the federal government, the three branches were established by the Constitution. The executive branch consists of the president, the cabinet, and the various departments and executive agencies. The legislative branch consists of the two houses of Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and their staff. The judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court and the other federal courts.

broad construction A theory of interpretation of the Constitution that holds that the spirit of the times, the values of the justices, and the needs of the nation may legitimately influence the decisions of a court, particularly the Supreme Court. Sometimes called judicial activism. (See Earl Warren.)

busing The movement of students from one neighborhood to a school in another neighborhood, usually by bus and usually to break down de facto segregation of public schools.

✥ A Supreme Court decision in  ruling that busing was an appropriate means of achieving integrated schools (see integration) was received with widespread, sometimes violent, resistance, particularly among whites into whose neighborhoods and schools black children were to be bused. In , the Court ruled that school districts could end busing if they had done everything “practicable” to eliminate the traces of past discrimination.

cabinet A group of presidential advisers, composed of the heads of the fourteen government departments (the secretaries of the Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Interior, Department of Labor, Department of State, Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the attorney general (head of the Department of Justice) — all of whom are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate) and a few other select government officials. Theoretically, the cabinet is charged with debating major policy issues and recommending action by the executive branch; the actual influence of the cabinet, however, is limited by competition from other advisory staffs.

campaign finance reform A movement, fueled in recent decades by political candidates’ increasing dependence on expensive television advertisements, to restrict the amount of money that individuals and interest groups can contribute to political campaigns. Although limits have been placed on individual contributions, a loophole has been left for political action committees. Both parties pay lip service to the principle of campaign finance reform, but neither fully supports it. Some liberals see it as the best way to secure the independence of politicians from moneyed interests; some conservatives view it as a threat to freedom of speech.

capital offense A crime, such as murder or betrayal of one’s country, that is treated so seriously that death may be considered an appropriate punishment.

capital punishment The infliction of the death penalty as punishment for certain crimes. (See capital offense.)

✥ In the United States, capital punishment has been an extremely controversial issue on legal, moral, and ethical grounds. In , the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was not, in principle, cruel and unusual punishment (and not, therefore, unconstitutional), but that its implementation through existing state laws was unconstitutional. In , the Supreme Court again ruled that the death penalty was not unconstitutional, though a mandatory death penalty for any crime was. Thirty-nine states now practice the death penalty.

Capitol Hill A hill in Washington, D.C., on which the United States Capitol building sits. (See photo, next page.) The House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the Capitol. (See on the Hill.)

caucus (kaw-kuhs) A meeting of members of a political party to nominate candidates, choose convention delegates, plan campaign tactics, determine party policy, or select leaders for a legislature.

Capitol Hill

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) An agency of the United States government, responsible for coordinating information-gathering activities outside the United States in the interest of national security. The CIA works with the Department of State and a variety of civilian and military organizations to protect American interests abroad and recommend directions for American foreign policy.

✥ The extreme secrecy of many of the CIA’s operations has enhanced its reputation as an organization of espionage and intrigue. ✥ The operations of the CIA are directed by the National Security Council.

checks and balances A fundamental principle of American government, guaranteed by the Constitution, whereby each branch of the government (executive, judicial, and legislative) has some measure of influence over the other branches and may choose to block procedures of the other branches. Checks and balances prevent any one branch from accumulating too much power and encourage cooperation between branches as well as comprehensive debate on controversial policy issues. For example, to enact a federal law, the Senate and the House of Representatives must each vote to pass the law. In this sense, each house of Congress can check the other.

Furthermore, even if the two houses do agree, the president must sign the law. If he chooses to veto the law, it can still be enacted if two-thirds of the members of both houses vote to override the veto. Under this arrangement, both Congress and the president can check each other. (See also appropriation, impeachment, judicial review, and separation of powers; also see chart, next page.)

civil liberties In general, the rights to freedom of thought, expression, and action, and the protection of these rights from government interference or restriction. Civil liberties are the hallmark of liberal, democratic “free” societies. In the United States, the Bill of Rights guarantees a variety of civil liberties, most notably freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, expressed in the First Amendment. (See civil rights.)

civil rights A broad range of privileges and rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution and subsequent amendments and laws that guarantee fundamental freedoms to all individuals. These freedoms include the rights of free expression and action (civil liberties); the right to enter into contracts, own property, and initiate lawsuits; the rights of due process and equal protection of the laws; opportunities in education and work; the freedom to live, travel, and use public facilities wherever one chooses; and the right to participate in the democratic political system.

✥ Efforts to redress the situation of inequality, such as the civil rights movement and the women’s movement, have resulted in legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of $1 9 6 4 ,$ in affirmative action, and in the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

clear and present danger The standard set by the Supreme Court for judging when freedom of speech may lawfully be limited. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., illustrated the point by arguing that no one has a constitutional right to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theater when no fire is present, for such action would pose a “clear and present danger” to public safety. (See First Amendment.)

closed primary A type of direct primary limited to registered party members, who must declare their party affiliation in order to vote. The closed primary serves to encourage party unity and prevent members of other parties from infiltrating and voting to nominate weak candidates. (Compare open primary.)

cloture (kloh-chuhr) A vote of a legislature used to stop debate on an issue and put the issue to a vote. (See filibuster.)

coattail effect The tendency for a popular political party leader to attract votes for other candidates of the same party in an election. For example, the party of a victorious presidential candidate will often win many seats in Congress as well; these congressmen are voted into office “on the coattails” of the president.

commander in chief The role of the United States president as highest ranking officer in the armed forces. The Constitution provides this power, but, through the system of checks and balances, gives Congress the authority to declare war. During periods of war, presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, George H. W. Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, and George W. Bush have taken active roles as commander in chief.

confirmation hearings Meetings held by the Senate to gather information about candidates for federal office nominated by the president of the United States. Under the Constitution, the president has the right to appoint whomever he wants to various government offices, including members of the cabinet and federal judges, but each appointment must be approved by the Senate as part of the separation of powers.

Congress The legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Popularly elected, senators and representatives are responsible for advocating the interests of the constituents they represent. Numerous congressional committees are organized to study issues of public policy, recommend action, and, ultimately, pass laws. Congress plays an important role in the system of checks and balances; in fact, the two-house (bicameral) organization of Congress acts as an internal check, for each house must separately vote to pass a bill for it to become a law. In addition to lawmaking, Congress has a variety of functions, including appropriation of funds for executive and judicial activities; instituting taxes and regulating commerce; declaring war and raising and supporting a military; setting up federal courts and conducting impeachment proceedings; and approving presidential appointments.

# Congressional Medal of Honor See Medal of Honor.

Congressional Record A published account of the votes, speeches, and debates of the United States Congress.

conscientious objector (CO) A person who refuses to render military service on the grounds of moral principle or religious belief. A CO must demonstrate a sincere, active, and long-standing objection in order to receive an exemption from armed service. The United States and some European governments officially recognize CO status; approved COs are usually required to perform social service or noncombat military service in place of armed duty. (See also draft, draft dodger, and Selective Service System.)

Constitution, United States A document that embodies the fundamental laws and principles by which the United States is governed. It was drafted by the

Constitutional Convention and later supplemented by the Bill of Rights and other amendments. (See Preamble to the Constitution.)

containment, policy of A United States foreign policy doctrine adopted by the Harry S. Truman administration in , operating on the principle that communist governments will eventually fall apart as long as they are prevented from expanding their influence.

✥ The policy of containment was used to justify American involvement in the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

contempt of Congress The deliberate obstruction of the workings of the federal legislative branch. For example, a witness under subpoena who refuses to testify before Congress can be cited for contempt of Congress.

contempt of court The deliberate obstruction of a court’s proceedings by refusing to obey a court order or by interfering with court procedures. Contempt of court can be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

court of appeals Courts, also called appellate courts, that are designed as part of the system of due process. Cases may be presented to these courts if a party is dissatisfied with the original court’s decision. An appeal must demonstrate that a new decision is warranted, usually in light of new evidence or a persuasive argument that the Constitution was improperly interpreted. A case may be appealed to successively higher state or federal appellate courts until it reaches the United States Supreme Court. There are twelve federal courts of appeal, each covering a group of states called a “circuit.”

cruel and unusual punishment Punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Cruel and unusual punishment includes torture, deliberately degrading punishment, or punishment that is too severe for the crime committed. This concept helps guarantee due process even to convicted criminals. Many people have argued that capital punishment should be considered cruel and unusual punishment.

dark horse An unexpected winner. In politics, a dark horse is a candidate for office considered unlikely to receive his or her party’s nomination, but who might be nominated if party leaders cannot agree on a better candidate.

de facto segregation (di fak-toh, day fak-toh) Racial segregation, especially in public schools, that happens “by fact” rather than by legal requirement. For example, often the concentration of African-Americans in certain neighborhoods produces neighborhood schools that are predominantly black, or segregated in fact (de facto), although not by law (de jure).

domino theory The idea that if one key nation in a region fell to control of communists, others would follow like toppling dominoes. The theory was used by many American leaders to justify American intervention in the Vietnam War. (See policy of containment.)

donkey A symbol of the Democratic party, introduced in a series of political cartoons by Thomas Nast during the congressional elections of $1 8 7 4$ . (Compare elephant.)

double jeopardy Trying a person twice in the same jurisdiction for the same crime, a practice prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. (See due process of law.)

draft A system for selecting young men for compulsory military service, administered in the United States by the Selective Service System. At present the

United States relies on a volunteer military and does not have a draft, though young men are required by law to register with the Selective Service. (See also conscientious objector and draft dodger.)

draft dodger Someone who illegally evades the draft, as opposed to a conscientious objector, who is granted official, legal exemption from military duty.

E pluribus unum. The Great Seal of the United States.

E pluribus unum (ee ploor-uh-buhs yooh-nuhm, ooh-nuhm) A motto of the United States; Latin for “Out of many, one.” It refers to the Union formed by the separate states. E pluribus unum was adopted as a national motto in  and is now found on the Great Seal of the United States and on United States currency.

Eastern Establishment The elite universities and financial institutions of major cities in the northeastern United States. These institutions, by virtue of their long-standing economic and social dominance, are often believed to exert an influence out of proportion to their size. In American politics, the Eastern Establishment often takes a liberal Republican stand. (See also Ivy League, Madison Avenue, power elite, and Wall Street.)

Electoral College (i-lek-tuhr-uhl) The presidential electors who meet after the citizens vote for president and cast ballots for the president and vice president. Each state is granted the same number of electors as it has senators (see United States Senate) and representatives combined. These electors, rather than the public, actually elect the president and the vice president. The Founding Fathers assumed that electors would exercise discretion and not necessarily be bound by the popular vote, but the rise of political parties undermined this assumption. Electors are now pledged in advance to vote for the candidate of their party, and nearly always do so. Thus, the vote of the Electoral College is largely a formality.

✥ There have been several attempts to abolish the Electoral College. In the  presidential election, the candidate with the plurality of popular votes lost the electoral vote, a situation that also occurred in the  and  elections.

elephant A symbol of the Republican party, introduced in a series of political cartoons by Thomas Nast during the congressional elections of $1 8 7 4 \cdot$ . (Compare donkey.)

entitlements Federal programs, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, that disburse money according to fixed formulas to citizens who fall into designated categories. Because entitlements do not require annual congressional appropriations, their cost tends to rise steadily and, in the view of some, out of control.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) An agency established by the United States government to coordinate federal programs aimed at combating pollution and protecting the environment.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) An agency established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to investigate racial and sexual discrimination. The National Organization for Women (NOW) was organized in the s when the EEOC failed to act upon the Civil Rights Act’s sexual discrimination clause.

equal opportunity The goal of giving all persons an equal chance to an education and employment, and to protect their civil rights, regardless of their race, religious beliefs, or gender. In the United States, various minority groups have been fighting for equal opportunity over the last  years. (See affirmative action, civil rights movement, equal protection of the laws, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Organization for Women, segregation, sexism, suffragist, and women’s movement.)

equal protection of the laws A phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requiring that states guarantee the same rights, privileges, and protections to all citizens. This doctrine reinforces that of due process of law and prevents states from passing or enforcing laws that arbitrarily discriminate against anyone.

Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) A twice-proposed but never ratified amendment to the Constitution that would prohibit denial or abridgement of rights on the basis of sex. First proposed in , the amendment was passed by Congress in  but failed ratification by the requisite number of states. It was a major rallying point of the women’s movement.

equal time A ruling of the United States government, administered by the Federal Communications Commission, requiring that all candidates for public office be given equal access to the free or paid use of radio and television.

ex post facto (eks pohst fak-toh) A descriptive term for an explanation or a law that is made up after an event and then applied to it: “The chairman’s description of his plan sounds like an ex post facto attempt to justify an impulsive action.” Ex post facto is Latin for “from after the deed.”

ex post facto law A law that makes illegal an act that was legal when committed, increases the penalties for an infraction after it has been committed, or changes the rules of evidence to make conviction easier. The Constitution prohibits the making of ex post facto law. (See ex post facto.)

executive branch The branch of federal and state government that is broadly responsible for implementing, supporting, and enforcing the laws made by the legislative branch and interpreted by the judicial branch. At the state level, the executive includes governors and their staffs. At the federal level, the executive includes the president, the vice president, staffs of appointed advisers (including the cabinet), and a variety of departments and agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Postal Service (see postmaster general). The executive branch also proposes a great deal of legislation to Congress and appoints federal judges, including justices of the Supreme Court. Although the executive branch guides the nation’s domestic and foreign policies, the system of checks and balances works to limit its power.

farm bloc A group of both Democratic and Republican members of Congress from the farming states of the Middle West that pressures the federal government to adopt policies favorable to farmers.

favorite son A political figure nominated for the presidency by his or her state’s delegation to the national nominating convention of a major party. Favorite sons are rarely serious candidates for the party’s nomination. By nominating a favorite son, the delegation honors its nominee while delaying its commitment until the more serious contenders for the nomination can be sorted out.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) An agency of the United States federal government, long headed by J. Edgar Hoover, which investigates violations of federal (rather than state or local) laws, including kidnaping, smuggling narcotics, and espionage.

✥ Established in  under the Department of Justice, the FBI earned its reputation in the s and s by apprehending notorious bank robbers and gangsters.

federalism A system of government in which power is divided between a national (federal) government and various regional governments. As defined by the United States Constitution, federalism is a fundamental aspect of American government, whereby the states are not merely regional representatives of the federal government, but are granted independent powers and responsibilities. With their own legislative branch, executive branch, and judicial branch, states are empowered to pass, enforce, and interpret laws, provided they do not violate the Constitution. This arrangement not only allows state governments to respond directly to the interests of their local populations, but also serves to check the power of the federal government. Whereas the federal government determines foreign policy, with exclusive power to make treaties, declare war, and control imports and exports, the states have exclusive power to ratify the Constitution. Most governmental responsibilities, however, are shared by state and federal governments: both levels are involved in such public policy issues as taxation, business regulation, environmental protection, and civil rights.

✥ The precise extent of state and federal responsibility has always been controversial. Republican administrations, for example, have tended to grant more authority to the states, thereby encouraging political and economic freedom but discouraging comprehensive social welfare. Until the middle of the twentieth century, the Supreme Court left the interpretation of many civil rights guarantees to the states, resulting in widespread discrimination against minorities.

fellow traveler One who supports the aims or philosophies of a political group without joining it. A “fellow traveler” is usually one who sympathizes with communist doctrines but is not a member of the Communist party. The term was used disparagingly in the s to describe people accused of being communists.

felony (fel-uh-nee) A grave crime, such as murder, rape, or burglary, that is punishable by death (see capital offense) or imprisonment in a state or federal facility.

Fifth Amendment One of the ten amendments to the United States Constitution that make up the Bill of Rights. The Fifth Amendment imposes restrictions on the government’s prosecution of persons accused of crimes. It prohibits self-incrimination and double jeopardy and mandates due process of law.

✥ To “take the Fifth” is to refuse to testify because the testimony could lead to self-incrimination.

filibuster (fil-uh-bus-tuhr) A strategy employed in the United States Senate, whereby a minority can delay a vote on proposed legislation by making long speeches or introducing irrelevant issues. A successful filibuster can force withdrawal of a bill. Filibusters can be ended only by cloture.

First Amendment An amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing the rights of free expression and action that are fundamental to democratic government. These rights include freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. The government is empowered, however, to restrict these freedoms if expression threatens to be destructive. Argument over the extent of First Amendment freedoms has often reached the Supreme Court. (See clear and present danger, libel, and obscenity.)

✥ The First Amendment begins the Bill of Rights.

Foggy Bottom A nickname for the United States Department of State, whose offices were built in a formerly swampy area of Washington, D.C., known as Foggy Bottom because of vapors rising from the swamp.

Foreign Relations Committee A committee of the Senate charged with overseeing the conduct of foreign policy.

Foreign Service The professional arm of the executive branch that supplies diplomats for the United States embassies and consulates around the world. Ambassadors, though officially members of the Foreign Service, are sometimes friends of the president of the United States appointed in gratitude for support given during elections.

Fourteenth Amendment An amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted in . It was primarily concerned with details of reintegrating the southern states after the Civil War and defining some of the rights of recently freed slaves. The first section of the amendment, however, was to revolutionize federalism. It stated that no state could “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Gradually, the Supreme Court interpreted the amendment to mean that the guarantees of the Bill of Rights apply to the states as well as to the national government.

franchise In politics, the right to vote. The Constitution left the determination of the qualifications of voters to the states. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, states usually restricted the franchise to white men who owned specified amounts of property. Gradually, poll taxes were substituted for property requirements. Before the Civil War, the voting rights of blacks were severely restricted, but the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, declared ratified in , prohibited states from abridging the right to vote on the basis of race. Nevertheless, southern states used a variety of legal ploys to restrict black voting until passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Women were not guaranteed the right to vote in federal elections until ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in . In  the Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. (See suffrage and suffragette.)

✥ Losing the right to vote, called disfranchisement, is most commonly caused by failing to reregis ter, a procedure that is required every time a person changes residence.

freedom of assembly The right to hold public meetings and form associations without interference by the government. Freedom of peaceful assembly is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.

✥ Segregation has been described as a violation of freedom of assembly.

freedom of association The right to form societies, clubs, and other groups of people, and to meet with people individually, without interference by the government.

freedom of religion The right to choose a religion (or no religion) without interference by the government. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. (See separation of church and state.)

freedom of speech The right to speak without censorship or restraint by the government. Freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. (See clear and present danger.)

freedom of the press The right to circulate opinions in print without censorship by the government. Americans enjoy freedom of the press under the First Amendment to the Constitution.

friend of the court An individual or group interested in influencing the outcome of a lawsuit but not an actual party to the suit. The statement presented to the court is an amicus curiae brief; amicus curiae is Latin for “friend of the court.”

gay rights The movement for civil rights for homosexuals. It originated after a police raid on a gay bar in New York City in , which triggered a riot and launched the grassroots reform movement seeking to end social and legal discrimination against gays. (See Stonewall Riot.)

gender gap A phrase marking the trend in recent U.S. presidential elections, whereby more female than male voters support the Democratic party candidate and more male than female voters support the Republican party candidate.

gerrymander (jer-ee-man-duhr) To change the boundaries of legislative districts to favor one party over another. Typically, the dominant party in a state legislature (which is responsible for drawing the boundaries of congressional districts) will try to concentrate the opposing party’s strength in as few districts as possible, while giving itself likely majorities in as many districts as possible.

Good Neighbor policy A United States foreign policy doctrine, adopted by Franklin D. Roosevelt in , designed to improve relations with Latin America. A reaction to the exploitative dollar diplomacy of the early s, the Good Neighbor policy encouraged interaction between the United States and Latin America as equals. In the post–World War II era, however, the United States has often reverted to dollar diplomacy and gunboat diplomacy to impose its will on the countries of Latin America.

grand jury A jury that decides whether the evidence warrants bringing an accused person to trial. Once indicted (see indictment) by a grand jury, a person must stand trial.

guilt by association The attribution of guilt to individuals because of the people or organizations with which they associate, rather than because of any crime that they have committed.

gunboat diplomacy A policy toward a foreign country that depends on the use, or threat of the use, of arms. (See big stick diplomacy.)

habeas corpus (hay-bee-uhs kawr-puhs) A legal term meaning that an accused person must be presented physically before the court with a statement demonstrating sufficient cause for arrest. Thus, no accuser may imprison someone indefinitely without bringing that person and the charges against him or her into a courtroom. In Latin, habeas corpus literally means “you shall have the body.”

hawks and doves Popularly, “hawks” are those who advocate an aggressive foreign policy based on strong military power. “Doves” try to resolve international conflicts without the threat of force.

GOP Abbreviation of Grand Old Party, a nickname for the Republican party in the United States.

Gerrymander. The boundaries of a gerrymandered Massachusetts election district.

hearsay Information heard by one person about another. Hearsay is generally inadmissible as evidence in a court of law because it is based on the reports of others rather than on the personal knowledge of a witness.

homicide (hom-uh-seyed) The killing of one person by another, whether intended (murder) or not (manslaughter). Not all homicide is unlawful; killing in self-defense, for example, is not a crime.

House of Representatives The lower house of the United States Congress. With  popularly elected officials, the House (as it is often called) is the most representative body in the federal government. House seats are apportioned (see apportionment) relative to each state’s population. Because of its larger size, the House tends to maintain a closer link to local constituent concerns than the Senate, though both houses of Congress participate in virtually all aspects of legislation and policymaking. The Speaker of the House is one of the most influential officials in Washington, D.C., and is second in succession to the presidency, after the vice president.

hung jury A jury that is unable to reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty. The result is a mistrial, and legal proceedings must be reinitiated to bring the case to trial again. Trying the case a second time does not constitute double jeopardy.

impeachment A formal accusation of wrongdoing against a public official. According to the United States Constitution, the House of Representatives can vote to impeach an official, but the Senate actually tries the case. Several presidencies have been blemished by impeachment or the threat of impeachment: President Andrew Johnson was impeached after the Civil War but was acquitted. President Richard Nixon resigned from office as the House of Representatives prepared to initiate impeachment proceedings. President William Jefferson Clinton was impeached in  but was acquitted by the Senate the following year.

incumbent (in-kum-buhnt) One who holds a public office. By virtue of their experience in office, their exposure to the public, and their ability to raise campaign funds, incumbents usually have a significant advantage over opponents if they choose to run for reelection.

indictment (in-deyet-muhnt) A formal accusation of a crime, presented to the accused party after the charges have been considered by a grand jury.

injunction A court order that either compels or restrains an act by an individual, organization, or government official. In labor–management relations, injunctions have been used to prevent workers from going on strike.

integration The free association of people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds (see ethnicity); a goal of the civil rights movement to overcome policies of segregation that have been practiced in the United States.

✥ Those favoring integration of schools by such forceful means as busing or affirmative action have frequently argued that integration of schools will lead to integration of society as a whole. (See separate but equal.)

interest group An organized group that tries to influence the government to adopt certain policies or measures. Also called pressure group. (See lobby.)

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Part of the United States Department of the Treasury. The IRS is responsible for the collection of all federal taxes, except customs duties.

✥ The ICC was established in  as the first federal agency.

isolationism The doctrine that a nation should stay out of the disputes and affairs of other nations. The United States practiced a policy of isolationism until World War I and did not pursue an active international policy until after World War II. (See “entangling alliances with none.”)

Joint Chiefs of Staff A high-level military advisory board in the Department of Defense, composed of high-ranking representatives of the army, navy, air force, and marines. The Joint Chiefs are responsible for formulating military policy and recommending action regarding issues of national security and international relations.

joint resolution A measure approved by both houses of the United States Congress and signed by the president. Similar to an act of Congress, the joint resolution is used to approve or initiate foreign policy actions, to grant a single appropriations proposal, and to propose amendments to the Constitution.

# judicial activism See broad construction.

judicial branch The court systems of local, state, and federal governments, responsible for interpreting the laws passed by the legislative branch and enforced by the executive branch. These courts try criminal cases (in which a law may have been violated) or civil cases (disputes between parties over rights or responsibilities). The courts attempt to resolve conflicts impartially in order to protect the individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution, within the bounds of justice, as defined by the entire body of U.S. law. Some courts try only original cases, whereas others act as courts of appeals. The ultimate court of appeals is the Supreme Court. On the federal level, the system of checks and balances empowers Congress to create federal courts, and all federal judges must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The courts may exercise the powers of judicial review and injunction.

judicial restraint A view, associated with Felix Frankfurter among others, that judges should be reluctant to declare legislative enactments unconstitutional unless the conflict between the enactment and the Constitution is obvious. The doctrine is akin to, but not identical with, narrow construction, and it is the opposite of judicial activism.

judicial review The principle by which courts can declare acts of either the executive branch or the legislative branch unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has exercised this power, for example, to revoke state laws that denied civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution. (See also checks and balances.)

jurisprudence (joor-is-proohd-ns) The philosophy of law. Jurisprudence implies creating a body of law and methods for interpreting the law, studying the relationships between law and society, and predicting the effects of legal decisions. In the United States, lawmakers, attorneys, scholars, and courts all take an active role in guiding jurisprudence.

justice of the peace A local officer of the judicial branch empowered to try minor cases, recommend cases for trial, and perform civil ceremonies, such as marriages and oath taking. Justices of the peace are usually elected locally and are paid fees for their services.

kangaroo court A court that ignores principles of justice; a court characterized by incompetence and dishonesty.

lame duck A public official or administration serving out a term in office after having been defeated for reelection or when not seeking reelection.

larceny (lahr-suh-nee) Theft; taking another person’s property with the intent of permanently depriv ing the owner.

left-wing A descriptive term for an individual or a political faction that advocates liberal, radical, or even revolutionary policies, usually in favor of overcoming social inequalities. In the United States, leftwing groups generally support federal social welfare programs designed to open opportunities to all citizens. (Compare right-wing.)

✥ Although both major political parties in the United States have left-wing factions, left-wing policies are usually associated with the Democratic party.

legislative branch (lej-i-slay-tiv) The branch of the federal and state government empowered to make the laws that are then enforced by the executive branch and interpreted by the judicial branch. The legislative branch consists of Congress and the fifty state legislatures. At both state and federal levels, legislatures are made up of popularly elected representatives, who propose laws that are sensitive to the needs and interests of their local constituents. After a law is proposed as a bill, it is sent to appropriate committees for several stages of discussion, research, and modification. It is then debated in both legislative houses — except in Nebraska, which has a single-house legislature — and put to a vote. If the law is passed, it is still subject to further modification and final vote by both houses. Under the system of checks and balances, the president can refuse to sign the bill into law (through the veto power). The legislature can then vote to override the veto. Other checks and balances include legislative powers to impeach public officials (see impeachment), confirm appointments to the executive and judicial branches, and vote on appropriations.

libel A written, printed, or pictorial statement that unjustly defames someone publicly. Prosecution of libel as a punishable offense puts some measure of restriction on freedom of the press under the First Amendment.

Library of Congress The largest library in the United States, located in Washington, D.C., and maintained largely by federal appropriations. Its original purpose was to provide research facilities for members of Congress; today it serves the public as well. Most copyrighted publications are catalogued by the Library of Congress, whose classification system is used by major libraries around the country.

line-item veto The authority of an executive to veto a specific appropriation in a budget passed by a legislature. Viewing the line-item veto as an effective tactic against pork-barrel legislation, presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush unsuccessfully sought this authority, which many state governors possess, from Congress. Under current law the president must choose between signing or vetoing the entire budget rather than parts (items on budget lines) of it.

lobby A group whose members share certain goals and work to bring about the passage, modification, or defeat of laws that affect these goals. Lobbies (also called interest groups or pressure groups) can be long-standing (such as minority groups struggling to have their civil rights guaranteed) or ad hoc (such as a community threatened by proposed construction of a nuclear power plant). Lobbies may use grassroots methods, such as local rallies and campaigns, to build support for their cause and often employ professional lobbyists, who testify before congressional committees and approach policymakers in all government branches. Powerful lobbies, such as the AFL-CIO and the American Legion, with millions of members, have succeeded in establishing influence in Washington, D.C.

logrolling In politics, advance agreement by legislators to vote for one another’s bills. Logrolling is most common when legislators are trying to secure votes for bills that will benefit their home districts. For example, a group of congressmen from the Middle West pushing for higher dairy prices and a group of southern congressmen supporting higher tobacco prices might make a logrolling agreement in order to get both bills passed.

machine, political An administration of elected public officials who use their influential positions to solidify and perpetuate the power of their political party, often through dubious means. Machine politicians make free use of the spoils system and patronage, rewarding loyal party supporters with appointed government jobs. Other machine methods include gerrymandering election districts; planting party representatives in neighborhoods; making deals with judges, lawyers, and other professionals; and “buying” votes by offering social services to potential voters. When machine politics was especially strong in the United States, during the latter half of the nineteenth century, politicians would go so far as to offer beer for votes and would embezzle large amounts of public money. Machines also dominated party caucuses and conventions, thereby affecting politics at all levels of government.

✥ Machines are usually associated with big-city politics. ✥ The most impressive political machine of the twentieth century was that of Mayor Richard Daley, in Chicago.

machine politics Politics associated with political machines.

majority leader The leader of the party that holds a majority of seats in either house of Congress or of a state legislature. Selected by their own party caucuses, majority leaders act as chief spokespersons and strategists for their parties. In the House of Representatives, the majority leader is second in command of his party, after the Speaker of the House. (See also minority leader.)

A man’s home is his castle A proverbial expression that illustrates the principle of individual privacy, which is fundamental to the American system of government. In this regard, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution — part of the Bill of Rights — prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures.” (See also under “Proverbs.”)

✥ Disagreement over the extent of personal privacy and over interpretation of unreasonable has brought many cases before the Supreme Court.

manslaughter (man-slaw-tuhr) The unlawful killing of a person, without malice or premeditation. Involuntary manslaughter is accidental, such as running into someone with a car. Voluntary manslaughter is committed in the “heat of passion,” as in a spontaneous fight in which one person is killed by a strong blow. Manslaughter is usually considered less serious than murder. Both murder and manslaughter are types of homicide.

massive retaliation The doctrine that the best way to deter aggression is to threaten a potential aggressor with devastation by atomic bombs. (See hawks and doves.)

Medal of Honor The highest military decoration in the United States armed services, often called the Congressional Medal of Honor. It recognizes valor and bravery in action “above and beyond the call of duty.” There have been some , recipients of the medal, which was established by an act of Congress in .

Medicare (med-i-kair) A federal program providing medical care for the elderly. Established by a health insurance bill in , as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, the Medicare program made a significant step for social welfare legislation and helped establish the growing population of the elderly as a pressure group. (See entitlements.)

military-industrial complex A general term for the cooperative relationship between the military and the industrial producers of military equipment and supplies in lobbying for increased spending on military programs.

✥ In his farewell address, President Dwight Eisenhower warned that the growth of this relationship would increase the militarization of American society and endanger the principles of democracy.

minority leader The leader of the political party that holds a minority of seats in either house of Congress or of a state legislature. Selected by their own party caucuses, minority leaders act as chief spokespersons and strategists for their parties.

Miranda decision (muh-ran-duh) A decision by the United States Supreme Court concerning the rights of persons in police custody. In the case of $M i \cdot$ - randa versus Arizona, in , the Court ruled that, before questioning by the police, suspects must be informed that they have the right to remain silent and the right to consult an attorney, and that anything they say may be used against them in court. The Miranda ruling protects a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Miranda warning, a written statement of these rights, is normally recited by a police officer before interrogating the suspect in police custody.

misdemeanor (mis-di-mee-nuhr) A minor crime, punishable by a fine or a light jail term. Common misdemeanors, such as traffic violations, are usually dealt with informally, without a trial. (Compare felony.)

most-favored-nation Status in an international trading arrangement whereby agreements between two nations on tariffs are then extended to other nations. Every nation involved in such an arrangement will have most-favored-nation status. This policy is used, particularly by the United States, to lower tariffs, extend cooperative trading agreements, and protect nations from discriminatory treatment. Most-favorednation agreements can also be used to apply economic pressure on nations by deliberately excluding them from international trade.

narrow construction A theory of interpretation of the Constitution that holds that the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, should be bound by the exact words of the Constitution, or by the original in tent of the framers of the Constitution, or a combination of both. (Compare broad construction.)

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) An agency of the United States government, charged with directing civilian programs in aeronautics research and space exploration. NASA maintains several facilities, most notably the Johnson Space Center in Houston (which selects space crew personnel and is responsible for ground direction of space flights), and the launching pads at Cape Canaveral in Florida.

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) An organization that promotes the rights and welfare of black people. The NAACP is the oldest civil rights organization in the United States, founded in . Among the NAACP’s achievements was a lawsuit that resulted in the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown versus Board of Education, in , which declared the segregation of public schools unconstitutional. (See also W. E. B. DuBois and separate but equal.)

National Guard The volunteer military forces of each state, which the governor of a state can summon in times of civil disorder or natural disaster. Through congressional and presidential order, the National Guard can be called into service in the regular United States army.

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) An agency of the United States government, charged with mediating disputes between labor and management, and responsible for preventing unfair labor practices, such as the harassment of labor unions by business corporations. The NLRB attempts to maintain a position of neutrality, favoring neither labor nor management.

National Organization for Women (NOW) A major feminist organization, founded in the middle s, when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission failed to enforce a clause in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender. One of its founders was Betty Friedan. NOW has worked to promote occupational opportunities for women and has supported legislative proposals that would guarantee women equality with men.

National Rifle Association (NRA) An organization that acts as a powerful lobby against governmental restrictions on the private ownership of guns. NRA supporters argue that “guns don’t kill people; people kill people.” They often cite the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which states: “A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”

National Security Council (NSC) A committee in the executive branch that advises the president on matters relating to domestic, military, and foreign security. The NSC also directs the operation of the Central Intelligence Agency.

naturalization The process by which a foreign citizen becomes a citizen of a new country. Millions of immigrants to the United States have become American citizens. Requirements for naturalization in the United States include residency for several years, ability to communicate in English, demonstrated knowledge of American history and government, and a dedication to American values that includes no membership in subversive organizations, such as the Communist party.

nolo contendere (noh-loh kuhn-ten-duh-ree, kuhnten-duh-ray) A plea that can be entered in a criminal or civil case, by which an accused person neither admits guilt nor proclaims innocence of a charge. Nolo contendere is Latin for “I do not wish to contend.”

North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) An agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico to establish free trade. It took effect in  and is designed to eliminate trade barriers between the three nations by .

✥ Many American labor unions oppose NAFTA on the grounds that it takes away jobs from American workers as manufacturers relocate in Mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor. Others argue that free trade creates more jobs in the United States than it destroys.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) An agency of the United States government responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear power plants. Created in , along with the Energy Research and Development Administration, it replaced the Atomic Energy Commission.

Oak Ridge A city in Tennessee, where uranium for the atomic bomb was produced during World War II. Since that time, the government has maintained a variety of nuclear research facilities in Oak Ridge. (See also Manhattan Project.)

Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) A federal agency, founded in the s as part of the War on Poverty conducted by President Lyndon Johnson. The OEO distributed federal money to a variety of local programs designed to promote educational opportunities and job training among the poor and to provide legal services for the poor. The OEO was abolished in the middle s, and its programs have been curtailed or scattered among other federal agencies, particularly the Department of Health and Human Services.

on the Hill A phrase referring to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., where Congress meets: “They’re debating that nuclear waste issue on the Hill today.”

open primary A type of direct primary open to voters regardless of their party affiliation. Voters need not publicly declare their party affiliation but must vote for candidates of only one party. The opposite is a closed primary, in which only registered members of a party may vote.

Oval Office An oval-shaped room in the White House that serves as the official office of the president of the United States. Since the presidency of Richard Nixon, the term has been used to refer to the president himself: “The order came directly from the Oval Office.”

patronage (pay-truh-nij, pat-ruh-nij) The power of a government official or leader to make appointments and offer favors. Once in office, a politician can use patronage to build a loyal following. Though practiced at all levels of government, patronage is most often associated with the machine politics of big cities. (See spoils system.)

Peace Corps An agency of the United States government that sends American volunteers to developing nations to help improve living standards and provide training. Created by President John F. Kennedy in , under the auspices of the Department of State, the Peace Corps provides an opportunity to share American wealth, technology, and expertise. During the cold war it also served as a means for spreading American influence and values in the hope of preventing developing nations from allying themselves with the Soviet Union.

Pentagon An immense five-sided building in Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., that serves as headquarters for the Department of Defense.

✥ The term is often used to refer to the Department of Defense or the military: “The Pentagon agreed today to submit the modified weapons plan to the president.” ✥ The Pentagon was severely damaged by the September 11 attacks.

✥ The phrase under God, added in  (more than sixty years after the pledge was originally published), has inspired heated debate over the separation of church and state.

pocket veto An automatic veto of a bill that occurs if the president or governor neither signs nor vetoes a bill within ten days of receiving it — as long as the legislature adjourns during that period. If the legislature convenes during that period, the bill will automatically become law. A pocket veto cannot be overridden by the legislature, though the bill can be reintroduced at the next legislative session.

political action committees (PACs) Committees formed by interest groups to funnel donations to political candidates who are likely to support their position on various issues. Because of current campaign laws, PACs are allowed to make much larger donations than can individuals.

poll tax A tax required as a qualification for voting. After the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution extended the vote to blacks in , many southern states instituted poll taxes to prevent blacks from voting. The Twenty-fourth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in , prohibits poll taxes for federal elections.

populism The belief that greater popular participation in government and business is necessary to protect individuals from exploitation by inflexible bureaucracy and financial conglomerates. “Power to the people” is a famous populist slogan.

pork-barrel legislation Appropriations made by a legislature for projects that are not essential but are sought because they pump money and resources into the local districts of the legislators. Local projects, such as dams, military bases, highways, housing subsidies, and job training, are often funded by pork-barrel legislation, which can be accomplished through logrolling. Successful pork-barrel legislators are likely to be reelected by their constituents.

postmaster general The head of the United States Postal Service. Until , the postmaster general was head of the federal Post Office Department and a member of the president’s cabinet. In , the Postal Service was set up as an independent agency in place of the Post Office Department. The Postal Service is operated like a private corporation, although postal workers receive the benefits of federal employees.

power elite A term used by the American sociologist (see sociology) C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, loosely knit group of people who tend to dominate American policymaking. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.

power of the purse The influence that legislatures have over public policy because of their power to vote money for public purposes. The United States Congress must authorize the president’s budget requests to fund agencies and programs of the executive branch. (See appropriation.)

precedent (press-uh-duhnt) A previous ruling by a court that influences subsequent decisions in cases with similar issues.

pressure group An organized group that tries to influence the government to adopt certain policies or measures. Also called an interest group. (See lobby.)

primaries State elections of delegates to the nominating convention that chooses a major party’s presidential candidate. In some states, delegates are elected by popular vote; in other states, party caucuses or miniconventions choose delegates.

✥ Primaries occur at different times during the presidential election year, a situation that drags out the process by which parties nominate candidates but allows wide public exposure to candidates and issues.

privacy, right of The doctrine, advanced by the Supreme Court most notably in Roe versus Wade, that the Constitution implicitly guarantees protection against activities that invade citizens’ privacy. The Constitution does not explicitly mention a right of privacy, but the First Amendment’s protection of free speech, the Fourth Amendment’s guarantee against “unreasonable searches and seizures,” the Ninth Amendment’s reference to “other” rights, the Court has ruled, imply a right of privacy. This doctrine exemplifies broad construction. (See Griswold versus Connecticut.)

probate court (proh-bayt) A court that has jurisdiction over wills, estates, and guardianship of children.

proportional representation An electoral system in which seats in a legislature are awarded to each party on the basis of its share of the popular vote. The United States does not use a system of proportional representation. Membership in the Senate and the House of Representatives, for example, is based on individual candidates’ receiving a majority of votes. Such a system strongly encourages the formation of only two major political parties.

✥ In Israel and some nations in Europe, a system of proportional representation guarantees that small parties will have official recognition in the government, thus leading to a multiparty government. $\clubsuit$ Though proportional representation has been attempted in a few American cities, many American politicians argue that it tends to fragment the government, preventing quick and decisive action.

public defender An attorney who is appointed and paid by a court to defend poor persons who cannot afford a lawyer.

public works Public facilities and improvements financed by the government for the public good. Public works include hospitals, bridges, highways, and dams. These projects may be funded by local, state, or federal appropriations. (See also pork-barrel legislation.)

quorum (kwawr-uhm) The minimum number of members of a committee or legislative body who must be present before business can officially or legally be conducted. In the United States Congress, for example, either house must have a majority ( in the House of Representatives,  in the Senate) to have a quorum.

racism The belief that some races are inherently superior (physically, intellectually, or culturally) to others and therefore have a right to dominate them. In the United States, racism, particularly by whites against blacks, has created profound racial tension and conflict in virtually all aspects of American society. Until the breakthroughs achieved by the civil rights movement in the s and s, white domination over blacks was institutionalized and supported in all branches and levels of government, by denying blacks their civil rights and opportunities to participate in political, economic, and social communities.

ranking member A legislator on a committee who belongs to the majority party and, by virtue of seniority, ranks first after the committee chairman. The most senior member representing the minority party is the ranking minority member of the committee.

ratification The approval from the legislative branch required to validate government agreements. In the United States, amendments to the Constitution require the ratification of state legislatures, and international treaties require the ratification of the Senate.

referendum (ref-uh-ren-duhm) A direct popular vote on an issue of public policy, such as a proposed amendment to a state constitution or a proposed law. Referendums, which allow the general population to participate in policymaking, are not used at the national level, but are common at the state and local levels. A referendum is often used to gauge popular approval or rejection of laws recently passed or under consideration by a state legislature. A referendum can also be used to initiate legislative action.

representatives Popularly elected officials who serve in state legislatures and in the House of Representatives in Congress. Representing the local districts from which they are elected, representatives support the interests of their constituents by proposing bills and programs. Elected for two-year terms, representatives in Congress must be sensitive to their constituents’ concerns in order to be reelected.

Republican A member of the Republican party.

rider A provision, usually controversial and unlikely to pass on its own merits, that is attached to a popular bill in the hopes that it will “ride” to passage on the back of the popular bill.

right-wing A descriptive term for an individual or a political faction that advocates very conservative policies. Right-wing groups generally support free enterprise. In the United States, the right wing generally argues for a strong national defense program and opposes federal involvement in promoting social welfare. (Compare left-wing.)

✥ Although both major political parties in the United States have right-wing factions, right-wing policies are usually associated with the Republican party.

Robert’s Rules of Order A handbook for running meetings effectively and efficiently, based on the procedures used in the British parliament. The principles included in the handbook are applicable to any decision-making organization, from Congress to community club committees. The handbook sets the guidelines for such issues as leading debates; recognizing speakers; defining the role of the chair and other officers; proposing, seconding, and voting on motions; and writing and amending constitutions and bylaws.

rugged individualism The belief that all individuals, or nearly all individuals, can succeed on their own and that government help for people should be minimal. The phrase is often associated with policies of the Republican party and was widely used by the Republican president Herbert Hoover. The phrase was later used in scorn by the Democratic presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman to refer to the disasters of Hoover’s administration, during which the stock market Crash of 1929 occurred and the Great Depression began.

Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) A test that purportedly measures the aptitude of high-schoolers for college. Originally devised in , it was not widely employed by colleges to select students until the s and s.

✥ The SAT is controversial. College admissions officers have relied on it, but critics contend that it contains cultural biases that work against the admission of African-Americans and other minorities.

Secret Service A division of the United States Department of the Treasury, responsible for apprehending counterfeiters; investigating a variety of federal crimes; and protecting presidents and their families, presidential candidates, and foreign dignitaries visiting the United States.

secretary of defense The civilian head of the United States Department of Defense and a member of the cabinet, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The secretary of defense works with civilian and military advisers to formulate American military policies and make foreign policy recommendations to the president.

secretary of state The head of the United States Department of State and, as leading member of the cabinet, fourth in line of succession to the presidency. The secretary of state is charged with formulating American foreign policy and conducting relations with other nations.

segregation The policy and practice of imposing the separation of races. In the United States, the policy of segregation denied African-Americans their civil rights and provided inferior facilities and services for them, most noticeably in public schools (see Brown versus Board of Education), housing, and industry. (See integration, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and separate but equal.)

Selective Service System The system used in the United States to draft young people into armed service. Though the United States at present has no draft, young men are required by law to register with the Selective Service when they reach the age of eighteen.

self-incrimination Being forced or coerced to testify against oneself. Self-incrimination is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

✥ Under this principle, a person may choose (given certain restrictions) to “take the Fifth,” refusing to testify in court or before a legislative or executive committee. ✥ Prohibiting self-incrimination not only helps guarantee due process of law, but also maintains one of the basic principles of American law by putting the burden of proof on the prosecution. (See also Miranda decision.)

Senate, United States The upper house of the United States Congress. Two senators are elected from each state, regardless of state population, guaranteeing each state equal representation. Senators are elected for six-year terms. The Senate tends to respond more directly than the House of Representatives to issues of national, rather than local, concern, though both houses of Congress participate in all aspects of legislation and policymaking. The Senate has the exclusive right to try cases of impeachment, approve presidential appointments, confirm treaties, and elect a vice president if no candidate receives a majority from the Electoral College. The vice president serves as presiding officer of the Senate.

separate but equal The doctrine that racial segregation is constitutional as long as the facilities provided for blacks and whites are roughly equal. This doctrine was long used to support segregation in the public schools and a variety of public facilities, such as transportation and restaurants, where the facilities and services for blacks were often clearly inferior. For decades, the Supreme Court refused to rule the separate but equal doctrine unconstitutional, on the grounds that such civil rights issues were the responsibility of the states. In the decision of Brown versus Board of Education, in , the Supreme Court unanimously ruled separate but equal schools unconstitutional. This ruling was followed by several civil rights laws in the s. (See also Plessy versus Ferguson.)

separation of church and state The principle that government must maintain an attitude of neutrality toward religion. Many view separation of church and state as required by the First Amendment. The First Amendment not only allows citizens the freedom to practice any religion of their choice, but also prevents the government from officially recognizing or favoring any religion.

✥ The relationship between church and state has been extremely controversial since the first settlers arrived in America to escape religious persecution in Europe, and many cases involving the issue have reached the Supreme Court. ✥ Interpretation of the principle has been ambiguous: for instance, the Supreme Court has recently upheld laws prohibiting prayer in the schools but has permitted the construction of Nativity scenes on government property. (See also established church and freedom of religion.)

separation of powers A fundamental principle of the United States government, whereby powers and responsibilities are divided among the legislative branch, executive branch, and judicial branch. The officials of each branch are selected by different procedures and serve different terms of office; each branch may choose to block action of the other branches through the system of checks and balances. The framers of the Constitution designed this system to ensure that no one branch would accumulate too much power and that issues of public policy and welfare would be given comprehensive consideration before any action was taken.

sexism The belief that one sex (usually the male) is naturally superior to the other and should dominate most important areas of political, economic, and social life. Sexist discrimination in the United States in the past has denied opportunities to women in many spheres of activity. Many allege that it still does. (See also affirmative action, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, glass ceiling, and National Organization for Women.)

slush fund A collection of money by a political official or administration that is used to make payments for various services. Though slush funds may be used for legitimate purposes, such as paying state employees, the term is generally used to describe money that is not properly accounted for and is being used for personal expenses and political payoffs. Money raised for political campaigns has come under increasing public scrutiny to ensure that it is not misused.

Smithsonian Institution (smith-soh-nee-uhn) A group of over a dozen museums and research and publication facilities, such as the National Air and Space Museum, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of History and Technology, the National Zoo, and the National Gallery of Art. Many of the Smithsonian’s buildings are on the Washington Mall. The institution is named after James Smithson, an Englishman whose bequest enabled its founding in the nineteenth century.

smoke-filled room A popular expression used to describe a place where the political wheeling and dealing of machine bosses (see machine politics) is conducted. The image originated during the Republican presidential nominating convention of , in which Warren G. Harding emerged as a dark horse candidate.

Social Security Administration The American system for distributing old age and disability pensions from the federal government. Initiated through the Social Security Act of , Social Security pensions are financed by contributions from workers and employers. Benefits are also available to the survivors of workers covered under Social Security.

Speaker of the House The presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives. The Speaker, a member of the House, is elected by a majority party caucus. In addition to being chief spokesman for the majority party, the Speaker runs the proceedings of House debate and voting, appoints committee members, refers bills to committees for research and development, and has an influential voice in all stages of a bill’s consideration. One of the most visible and influential officials of the federal government, the Speaker is second in line, after the vice president, in succession to the presidency.

split ticket A vote for candidates of different political parties on the same ballot, instead of for candidates of only one party. In the presidential elections, for example, a voter may choose a Republican candidate for president, but a Democratic candidate for senator. Split-ticket voting is not allowed in primaries (see closed primary, direct primary, open primary). The increasing occurrence of split-ticket voting reflects support of individual candidates rather than unswerving party loyalty.

stare decisis (stair-ee duh-seye-sis) A Latin phrase that literally means “to stand on the decisions.” It expresses the common law doctrine that court decisions should be guided by precedent.

State Department A common name for the Department of State.

State of the Union address An annual message delivered to Congress by the president of the United States, in which he describes the condition of the country, outlines the nation’s most serious problems, and proposes his annual program of legislation.

✥ The name of the address comes from a provision in the Constitution that the president “shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”

states’ rights Rights guaranteed to the states under the principle of federalism. Under the Constitution, states have considerable autonomy to pass, enforce, and interpret their own laws and to pursue their own public policy programs. Proponents of states’ rights argue that the states should be governed with a minimum of interference from the federal government.

✥ The relationship between federal and state responsibilities has often been controversial. Until the middle of the twentieth century, for example, the Supreme Court left the interpretation of many civil rights guarantees to the states, resulting in hostile and widespread discrimination against minorities.

statute of limitations Any law that places a time restriction during which a lawsuit must be brought to court or a crime must be prosecuted.

straw poll Originally, a small, informal opinion survey. Today, a straw poll is generally a large-scale, scientifically determined public opinion survey based on a random sample of the population. Straw polls are commonly used to test public opinion of candidates running for office.

subpoena (suh-pee-nuh) An order of a court, a legislature, or a grand jury compelling a witness to be present at a trial or hearing, under penalty of fine or imprisonment. Subpoena is Latin for “under penalty.”

suffrage (suf-rij) The right to vote (see franchise). In the United States, the term is often associated with the women’s movement to win voting rights. (See suffragist.)

suffragette (suf-ruh-jet) A suffragist. Today, the term suffragette is often considered demeaning.

courts are all courts of appeals, primarily hearing cases that have already been tried. The federal Supreme Court (“the” Supreme Court) has the final word on interpretation of all laws and of the Constitution itself.

✥ Supreme Court decisions have a significant impact on public policy and are often extremely controversial. In interpreting the Constitution, the justices of the Supreme Court occasionally have deduced legal doctrines that are not clearly stated (or stated at all) in the Constitution. For example, in the famous case of McCulloch versus Maryland (), Chief Justice John Marshall advanced the opinion, accepted by the Court, that the Constitution implicitly gives the federal government the power to establish a national bank, even though such a power is not explicitly granted by the Constitution. Similarly, in Roe versus Wade (), the Court ruled that state laws restricting abortion violate the right of privacy. ✥ The McCulloch and Roe decisions illustrate the principle of broad construction (interpretation) of the Constitution. The opposite is narrow construction. Those who favor broad construction, or judicial activism, believe that the spirit of the times, the values of the justices, and the needs of the nation may legitimately influence the way justices decide cases. In contrast, narrow constructionists insist that the Court should be bound by the exact words of the Constitution or by the intentions of the framers of the Constitution or by some combination of both. This view is sometimes called judicial restraint.

suffragist (suf-ruh-jist) A participant in the women’s movement to win voting rights in the United States. The fight for women’s suffrage was organized in the middle of the nineteenth century. Wyoming, while not yet a state, granted women’s suffrage in , though the struggle for universal suffrage was to last another fifty years. In , the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, guaranteeing that no state could deny the right to vote on the basis of sex.

Suffragists. Three women, circa , demonstrating for the right to vote.

Supreme Court A federal court; the highest body in the judicial branch. The Supreme Court is composed of a chief justice and eight associate justices, all of whom are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. (See photo, next page.) They serve on the Court as long as they choose, subject only to impeachment. Each state also has a supreme court; these think tank An institution in which scholars pursue research in public policy. Largely funded by endowments and grants, think tanks work to improve public awareness of policy issues (through publications) and to influence the government to act upon issues of national importance. (See power elite.)

the Ugly American Pejorative term for Americans traveling or living abroad who remain ignorant of local culture and judge everything by American standards. The term is taken from the title of a book by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer.

un-American A term used, primarily by extreme conservatives, to attack principles or practices considered to be at odds with the values of most Americans. Many object to the use of the term on the grounds that it is vague, shortsighted, and intolerant.

U.S. Supreme Court. The nine-member court. Seated from left: Antonin Scalia, John Paul Stevens, William H. Rehnquist, Sandra Day O’Connor, and A. M. Kennedy. Standing from left: Ruth Bader-Ginsberg, David Hackett Souter, Clarence Thomas, and S. G. Breyer.

✥ The House of Representatives maintained a Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) for several years. It was especially known for investigation of alleged communists. (See Alger Hiss.)

Uncle Sam A figure who stands for the government of the United States and for the United States itself. Uncle Sam — whose initials are the abbreviation of United States — is portrayed as an old man with a gray goatee who sports a top hat and Stars and Stripes clothing. During World War I and World War II, posters of Uncle Sam exhorted young men to join the armed forces. (Compare John Bull.)

United States Information Agency (USIA) A federal agency responsible for spreading information favorable to the United States around the world.

Veterans Administration (VA) See Department of Veterans Affairs.

Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) An organization of American veterans who have taken part in a foreign military campaign or expedition of the United States.

Uncle Sam. From a World War I army recruiting poster.

Like the American Legion, it usually takes pro-defense stands on foreign policy issues.

veto The power of a president or governor to reject a bill proposed by a legislature by refusing to sign it into law. The president or governor actually writes the word veto (Latin for “I forbid”) on the bill and sends it back to the legislature with a statement of his or her objections. The legislature may choose to comply by withdrawing or revising the bill, or it can override the veto and pass the law, by a two-thirds vote in each house.

$\clubsuit$ Originally intended to prevent Congress from passing unconstitutional laws, the veto is now used by the president as a powerful bargaining tool, especially when his objectives conflict with majority sentiment in Congress. (See also checks and balances.)

victimless crime A term sometimes used for various acts that are considered crimes under the law but apparently have no victim. One such crime is prostitution, which is viewed by some as a commercial exchange between two consenting adults.

Ways and Means Committee A permanent committee of the House of Representatives, which makes recommendations to the House on all bills for raising revenue. The committee is the principal source of legislation concerning issues such as taxation, customs duties, and international trade agreements.

whip In the United States Congress or state legislatures, an assistant to the majority leader or minority leader responsible for stirring up party support on issues, keeping track of party members’ votes, and acting as a general liaison between the majority leader or minority leader and other party members.

write-in candidate A candidate for public office whose name does not appear on the ballot (usually because he or she has not secured the nomination of a political party) but whose name must be written on the ballot by voters.

Yankee Originally a nickname for people from New England, now applied to anyone from the United States. Even before the American Revolutionary War, the term Yankee was used by the British to refer, derisively, to the American colonists. Since the Civil War, American southerners have called all northerners Yankees. Since World War I, the rest of the world has used the term to refer to all Americans.

✥ The expression “Yankee, go home” reflects foreign resentment of American presence or involvement in other nations’ affairs.

Most of today’s nations did not exist as independent states a century ago. As late as , empires covered much of the world. Britain, France, and Germany held large parts of Africa as colonies. Britain also had colonies in Asia, including India. Vietnam and Cambodia were part of French-controlled Indochina.

Even small European nations such as Belgium, The Netherlands, and Portugal had African colonies. The Austro-Hungarian empire included the former Czechoslovakia and parts of the former Yugoslavia. The Ottoman Empire or Turkish empire spread across much of the Middle East, including Palestine. Extending from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, the Russian empire was colossal in size.

The defeat of the Central Powers (primarily Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey) in World War I led to a redrawing of the map of the world. For example, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia became independent nations; Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria were carved out of the Ottoman Empire. Poland, intermittently independent before , again became a nation-state. The aftermath of World War I, however, did not bring independence to the African and Asian colonies of the European powers. Nationalism swept the Third World after World War II. For example, Algeria, Tunisia, and Vietnam all gained independence from France in the s and s. In the early s, a score of nations in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly colonies and protectorates of Britain and France, achieved independence, including Kenya, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union between  and  led to new changes in the world’s map. East and West Germany were unified. The Soviet Union, which gradually had taken over the former Russian empire, disintegrated and left in its wake a host of former provinces (called republics) that are now independent, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Ukraine. The so-called Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — once part of the Russian empire, independent between the two world wars, and forcibly absorbed into the

Soviet Union in  — again are independent. No longer the center of a czarist or communist empire, Russia is now an independent nation. Most recently, the former Yugoslavia provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Slovenia have declared their independence.

The Soviets agreed to withdraw in  and completed their withdrawal in . ✥ In , various rebel groups entered Kabul and took over the government; however, they soon fell to warring. Between  and , Islamic students, called the Taliban, seized Kabul and imposed both order and strict and repressive Islamic law. By , the Taliban controlled ninety percent of the country. The most serious resistance to the Taliban came from the Northern Alliance, a body dominated by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks. In October , the United States launched attacks on the Taliban in response to the Taliban’s refusal to expel Osama bin Laden and his terrorist Al Qaeda network. ✥ Afghanistan is a poor nation with a history of warfare among its rival ethnic groups and of fierce resistance to outsiders.

Africa The second-largest continent, after Asia; located south of Europe and bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east by the Indian Ocean.

This historical region in the Middle East consists of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

✥ Strategically important because it is situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, Arabia has been coveted and controlled by many empires throughout history. The area’s importance is all the greater today because of its fabulous oil reserves.

# American Geography

Tests have revealed that many Americans are amazingly ignorant of the geography of their nation. In one widely cited example, a student in California identified Chicago as a city in Italy. Perhaps the word Chicago, with its vowel ending, sounded vaguely un-American to the student. Yet the apparent general ignorance of geography leaves unanswered the question of how much Americans have to know about geography to follow literate discourse. Many literate Americans, who have no difficulty reading the New York Times, are unable to name the capitals of all fifty states. Nor could they identify all of the states through which the Mississippi River flows. But they do know all of the states, major cities, and natural landmarks and have at least a general notion of their location. For example, they know that the Mississippi River originates in the upper Middle West and empties into the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. They also know that the Ohio River and Missouri River intersect the Mississippi, and that the confluence of these rivers shaped the economic development of the United States and determined the location of many of its cities. Following literate discourse also demands an ability to make the correct associations with terms such as Wall Street, Madison Avenue, Hollywood, and West Point. All of these are famous for some distinctive activity that occurs in, on, or near them.

As is true elsewhere in this dictionary, the entries under “American Geography” are based on an assessment of what Americans should know to follow literate discourse. Each state, the major state capitals, the largest cities, and the most important natural landmarks have separate entries. So do possessions of the United States, such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. For the sake of precision, the geographical borders of each state have been listed. These entries also include a large number of places known primarily or exclusively for their associations.

# Anthropology, Psychology, and Sociology

![](img/0f8945a37bf2e8defe521b5775490d9e6a9258c8d43c57a031a0d8017ba27d81.jpg)

Anthropology, sociology, and some subdivisions of psychology are numbered among the social sciences. As the belief that God directly controlled and influenced human behavior weakened during the nineteenth century, philosophers tried to construct a science of society, or social science. Social scientists reected the idea that human activities occur at random and affirmed instead that all human activities reveal observed regularities or patterns. Gradually, social scientists refined such concepts as social class and kinship to explain these patterns.

By the end of the nineteenth century, as knowledge became more technical and specialized, economists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists each pursued different avenues of inquiry into social experience. Although social scientists in one field borrowed ideas from other fields, each field tended to develop its own specialized language, or jargon, and distinctive concepts. What began as an all-encompassing effort to identify a single science of society became an enterprise marked by diversity, specialization, and often fragmentation. Today, the usual list of social sciences includes anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. In addition, some view history as a social science.

In this section, we have grouped together entries drawn from three social sciences: anthropology, psychology, and sociology. Sociology concerns itself with the behavior of humans in groups: with social relationships, social classes, social movements, and organizations. An economist might study a corporation to gauge its impact on production, and a political scientist might assess how corporations try to influence political campaigns. In contrast, a sociologist would explore the social relationships that develop among workers within a corporation.

Anthropologists also study social behavior, but with a difference. Where sociologists focus on groups in advanced societies of the present, anthropologists have traditionally paid more attention to social relationships among so-called primitive, preliterate peoples. In recent years, this distinction has broken down to a degree, for anthropologists now also study social behavior in advanced societies. Yet anthropologists are more likely to compare advanced societies with primitive societies. In this sense, anthropology encompasses a broader historical and geographical span than does sociology.

Psychology is basically the study of mental life. Some subdivisions of psychology have far more in common with natural sciences such as biology and chemistry than with the social sciences. For example, physiological psychologists study the role of the brain, glands, and other organs in mental processes and often experiment on animals, especially rats, rather than humans. Many other subdivisions of psychology, however, resemble the social sciences. For example, social psychologists investigate the role of the family and the peer group in the mental development of the individual. Both sociologists and anthropologists also concern themselves with mental processes, for all social relationships among humans have psychological dimensions. The difference is that psychologists start out with mental processes, whereas sociologists and anthropologists usually begin with social relationships and then speculate about mental processes.

aborigines (ab-uh-rij-uh-neez) The earliest known inhabitants of a region. The term is most often associated with the native hunting and gathering population of Australia, who preceded the arrival of white settlers. (See hunting and gathering societies.)

Aborigine. Cathy Freeman, the first Australian Aborigine to win an Olympic gold medal in track.

abortion The deliberate termination of a pregnancy, usually before the embryo or fetus is capable of independent life. In medical contexts, this procedure is called an induced abortion and is distinguished from a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or stillbirth.

✥ Abortion laws are extremely controversial. Those who describe themselves as “pro-choice” believe that the decision to have an abortion should be left to the mother. In contrast, the “pro-life” faction, arguing that abortion is killing, holds that the state should prohibit abortion in most cases. Feminists (see feminism) and liberals generally support the pro-choice side; Roman Catholics and Protestant fundamentalists generally back the pro-life side. (See Roe versus Wade.)

acculturation (uh-kul-chuh-ray-shuhn) The learning of the ideas, values, conventions, and behavior that characterize a social group. (See socialization.) Acculturation is also used to describe the results of contact between two or more different cultures; a new, composite culture emerges, in which some existing cultural features are combined, some are lost, and new features are generated. Usually one culture is dominant (as in the case of colonization).

acrophobia (ak-ruh-foh-bee-uh) An abnormal fear of heights.

alienation (ay-lee-uh-nay-shuhn) A feeling of separation or isolation. In social science, alienation is associated with the problems caused by rapid social change, such as industrialization and urbanization (see Industrial Revolution), which has broken down traditional relationships among individuals and groups and the goods and services they produce.

✥ Alienation is most often associated with minorities, the poor, the unemployed, and other groups who have limited power to bring about changes in society. ✥ Marxism holds that workers in capitalist nations are alienated because they have no claim to ownership of the products they make.

alter ego (awl-tuhr ee-goh) An intimate friend, considered another side of oneself: “He was my alter ego; we were always picking up each other’s thoughts.” Alter ego is Latin for “another I.”

anal personality (ayn-l) A popular term for “anal retentive personality,” a personality marked by excessive orderliness, extreme meticulousness, and often suspicion and reserve. According to psychoanalysis, an anal personality is formed in early childhood as a result of efforts to control bowel movements. (See anal stage, genital stage, and oral stage; compare oral personality.)

anal stage According to psychoanalysis, the second social and sexual stage of an infant’s development (after the oral stage), in which the infant learns to control bowel movements. Freudian psychology maintains that children gain pleasure from both passing and withholding their feces. Psychoanalysts believe that development of an anal personality is associated with frustration over toilet training. (See also genital stage and pleasure principle.)

angst (ahngkst) A kind of fear or anxiety; Angst is German for “fear.” It is usually applied to a deep and essentially philosophical anxiety about the world in general or personal freedom. (See existentialism.)

animism (an-uh-miz-uhm) The belief, common among so-called primitive people, that objects and natural phenomena, such as rivers, rocks, and wind, are alive and have feelings and intentions. Animistic beliefs form the basis of many cults. (See also fetish and totemism.)

anthropology The scientific study of the origin, development, and varieties of human beings and their societies, particularly so-called primitive societies.

anxiety Emotional distress, especially that brought on by fear of failure. (See also angst.)

aphrodisiac (af-ruh-dee-zee-ak, af-ruh-diz-ee-ak) A substance or quality that excites sexual desire.

✥ Aphrodisiacs are named after Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love.

archaeology (ahr-kee-ol-uh-jee) The recovery and study of material objects, such as graves, buildings, tools, artworks, and human remains, to investigate the structure and behavior of past cultures. Archaeologists rely on physical remains as clues to the emergence and development of human societies and civilizations. Anthropologists, by contrast, to interact with living people to study their cultures.

Archaeology. An archaeological excavation in Ife, Nigeria.

archetype (ahr-ki-teyep) An original model after which other similar things are patterned. In the psychology of Carl Jung, archetypes are the images, patterns, and symbols that rise out of the collective unconscious and appear in dreams, mythology, and fairy tales.

asexuality (ay-sek-shooh-al-i-tee) Having no sexual organs, or engaging in no sexual activity.

assimilation The process by which a person or persons acquire the social and psychological characteristics of a group: “Waves of immigrants have been assimilated into the American culture.”

autism (aw-tiz-uhm) A serious disorder appearing in childhood and characterized by the child’s refusal to relate to other people and severely limited use of language. The cause of autism in children is unknown, but researchers generally feel that it lies in a malfunction of the central nervous system, not in the way parents have treated them or in other aspects of their environment. The term is sometimes applied, more loosely, to adults who are extremely self-absorbed and who see things in terms of their hopes and fantasies rather than realistically.

beatniks Members of the “beat” movement in the United States in the s. Beatniks frequently rejected middle-class American values, customs, and tastes in favor of radical politics and exotic jazz, art, and literature. The movement was often classified as bohemian. The poet Allen Ginsberg and the novelist Jack Kerouac are examples of beatnik authors.

✥ “Daddy-O” (a term of address); “Cool, man, cool”; and “strictly dullsville” are examples of slang expressions used by beatniks or by people trying to sound like beatniks.

behavior modification The changing of a person’s reactions to certain situations or stimuli. Behavior therapy, a form of psychotherapy advocated in behaviorism, uses a variety of methods, such as assertiveness training, conditioned response, and hypnosis, to change unsatisfactory or deviant patterns of behavior.

behaviorism A theory that psychology is essentially a study of external human behavior rather than internal consciousness and desires. (See B. F. Skinner)

Benedict, Ruth An American anthropologist of the twentieth century. In her Patterns of Culture, she argued that each culture idealizes a particular type of temperament, so that someone who is a hero in one society might be pronounced a misfit in another. Her view is often called cultural relativism.

Bible Belt An area of the United States, including the South and parts of the Middle West, where fervent Protestant fundamentalism is strong. (See Scopes trial.)

bisexuality Sexual activity with, or sexual attraction to, members of both sexes.

blackball A rejection of an applicant’s membership in a private organization, such as a club or fraternity. The term is derived from the traditional practice of members voting anonymously on admitting new members, using either a white marble (acceptance) or a black marble (denial). Acceptance must be unanimous; therefore, one black marble in the ballot box is enough to keep the applicant out of the organization.

✥ The term is now applied generally to efforts — especially unreasonable or vengeful actions — to keep a people or groups out of organizations they wish to join.

blacklist Concerted action by employers to deny employment to someone suspected of unacceptable opinions or behavior. For example, individual workers suspected of favoring labor unions have often been blacklisted by all the employers in a region.

✥ During the McCarthy era (see Joseph P. McCarthy) in the s, the careers of many public figures suspected of communist activities were ruined by blacklisting.

Usually associated with military and political interrogation and religious conversion, brainwashing attempts, through prolonged stress, to break down an individual’s physical and mental defenses. Brainwashing techniques range from vocal persuasion and threats to punishment, physical deprivation, mind-altering drugs, and severe physical torture.

bureaucracy (byoo-rok-ruh-see) A formal, hierarchical organization with many levels in which tasks, responsibilities, and authority are delegated among individuals, offices, or departments, held together by a central administration. According to many sociologists and anthropologists, the development of bureaucratic organizations is necessary for the emergence of any modern civilization. (See Max Weber.)

✥ Today, the term bureaucracy suggests a lack of initiative, excessive adherence to rules and routine, red tape, inefficiency, or, even more serious, an impersonal force dominating the lives of individuals. (See Big Brother is watching you.)

bureaucrat (byoor-uh-krat) Someone who works in or controls a bureaucracy. The term is often used negatively to describe a petty, narrow-minded person. (See also conformity and organization man.)

caste (kast) One of the four hereditary social divisions in Hinduism. Members of any one caste are restricted in their choice of occupation and may have only limited association with members of other castes.

✥ Caste has come to mean a group of persons set apart by economic, social, religious, legal, or political criteria, such as occupation, status, religious denomination, legal privilege, skin color, or some other physical characteristic. Members of a caste tend to associate among themselves and rarely marry outside the caste. Castes are more socially separate from each other than are social classes. ✥ During the height of segregation in the United States, African-Americans were sometimes loosely referred to as a caste.

catharsis (kuh-thahr-suhs) An experience of emo tional release and purification, often inspired by or through art. In psychoanalysis, catharsis is the release of tension and anxiety that results from bringing repressed feelings and memories into consciousness.

charisma (kuh-riz-muh) Extraordinary power and appeal of personality; natural ability to inspire a large following.

✥ Political leaders such as John F. Kennedy, religious leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., and entertainment figures such as Greta Garbo have all been described as charismatic.

Chicanos (chi-kah-nohz) Mexican-Americans; short for the Spanish word mexicanos, which is sometimes pronounced mechicanos. In recent years, Latino and Latina have become more widely used to describe Hispanic-Americans in general.

class A group of people sharing the same social, economic, or occupational status. The term class usually implies a social and economic hierarchy, in which those of higher class standing have greater status, privilege, prestige, and authority. Western societies have traditionally been divided into three classes: the upper or leisure class, the middle class (bourgeoisie), and the lower or working class. For Marxists, the significant classes are the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

class consciousness Identification with other members of one’s own class and awareness of its relationship with other classes. According to Marxist theory, the proletariat will assume class consciousness when workers realize that they are being exploited by the bourgeoisie; then a proletarian revolution will be inevitable. Contrary to this theory, however, the American working class is primarily socially conservative.

class structure The hierarchical organization by which a society or community is divided into classes. The vast majority of the population of the United States considers itself as belonging to the middle class. In Marxism, class structure is organized into the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

class struggle The idea, associated with Karl Marx, that conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is inevitable and will result in the triumph of socialism over capitalism.

claustrophobia (klaw-struh-foh-bee-uh) An abnormal fear of being shut in or enclosed.

cognitive development (kog-nuh-tiv) The growth of a person’s ability to learn.

collective unconscious Memories of mental patterns that are shared by members of a single culture or, more broadly, by all human beings; originally proposed by the psychologist Carl Jung to explain psychological traits shared by all people. He theorized that the collective unconscious appears as archetypes: patterns and symbols that occur in dreams, mythology, and fairy tales.

Coming of Age in Samoa () A book written by Margaret Mead. Mead determined that the socialization of children in Samoa results in a generally happy adolescence and easy transition to sexual activity and adulthood. These findings challenged the widely held belief that biological changes occurring during adolescence were necessarily accompanied by social and psychological stress. Mead argued that adolescent stress is a cultural, not a biological, phenomenon. Coming of Age contributed to the popularization of anthropology and helped to establish the anthropology subfield of culture and personality. Her interpretation of Samoan society was later challenged by Derek Freeman, and a bitter controversy ensued.

common-law marriage A legal marriage brought about by the cohabitation of a man and a woman, or by their agreement to consider themselves married, rather than by a wedding. (See common law.)

compulsion In psychology, an internal force that leads persons to act against their will. A “compulsive” act cannot be controlled: “Smith was a compulsive gambler.”

conditioned response In psychology, the response made by a person or animal after learning to associate an experience with a neutral or arbitrary stimulus. Conditioned response experiments by Ivan Pavlov (see Pavlov’s dogs) paired a neutral stimulus (sounding a bell) with a natural response (salivating) by associating the bell with the presentation of food. Conditioned response experiments by B. F. Skinner and other behaviorists (see behaviorism) associated an arbitrary action (an animal’s pressing a lever) with a positive reward (presentation of food) or a negative reward (an electric shock).

✥ Response conditioning is used in behavior modification. Stop-smoking clinics, for example, may use an electric shock whenever a patient lights up. The patient will then associate smoking with the unpleasant experience of the shock.

conformity Agreement between an individual’s behavior and a group’s standards or expectations. A conformist is one who follows the majority’s desires or standards. (See also beatniks, bureaucrat, organization man, peer group, and peer pressure.)

conjugal (kon-juh-guhl) A descriptive term for the relationship between married persons. A conjugal family is the same as a nuclear family, composed of married parents and their children. Conjugal relatives (in-laws) trace their relations through the marriage of their respective blood relatives.

conspicuous consumption Buying unnecessary and expensive products and services as a way to show off wealth. The term was coined by U.S. economist Thorstein Veblen in The Theory of the Leisure Class.

cosmology (koz-mol-uh-jee) A system of beliefs that seeks to describe or explain the origin and structure of the universe. A cosmology attempts to establish an ordered, harmonious framework that integrates time, space, the planets, stars, and other celestial phenomena. In so-called primitive societies, cosmologies help explain the relationship of human beings to the rest of the universe and are therefore closely tied to religious beliefs and practices. In modern industrial societies, cosmologies seek to explain the universe through astronomy and mathematics. Metaphysics also plays a part in the formation of cosmologies. (See also under “Physical Sciences and Mathematics.”)

counterculture A protest movement by American youth that arose in the late s and faded during the late s. According to some, young people in the United States were forming a culture of their own, opposed to the culture of Middle America. (See hippies and Woodstock.)

Cro-Magnon (kroh-mag-nuhn, kroh-man-yuhn) The earliest form of modern humans. The Cro-Magnons developed about , years ago and physically resembled modern Europeans. (See Homo sapiens.)

✥ Cro-Magnon people painted the walls of their caves, producing some of the earliest known human art.

✥ The term cult often suggests extreme beliefs and bizarre behavior.

culture The sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another. Culture is transmitted, through language, material objects, ritual, institutions, and art, from one generation to the next.

✥ Anthropologists consider that the requirements for culture (language use, tool making, and conscious regulation of sex) are essential features that distinguish humans from other animals. ✥ Culture also refers to refined music, art, and literature; one who is well versed in these subjects is considered “cultured.”

defense mechanism In psychology, a Freudian term referring to an unconscious avoidance of something that produces anxiety or some other unpleasant emotion. For example, someone who blots out the memory of a terrible accident is using a defense mechanism. Regression and sublimation are common defense mechanisms.

delusion A false belief held despite strong evidence against it; self-deception. Delusions are common in some forms of psychosis. Because of his delusions, the literary character Don Quixote attacks a windmill, thinking it is a giant.

demography (di-mog-ruh-fee) The quantitative study of human populations. Demographers study subjects such as the geographical distribution of people, birth and death rates, socioeconomic status, and age and sex distributions in order to identify the influences on population growth, structure, and development.

Cro-Magnon. The cave paintings at Lascaux, France, represent some of the earliest artwork of humankind.

cult In anthropology, an organization for the conduct of ritual, magical, or other religious observances. Many so-called primitive tribes, for example, have ancestor cults, in which dead ancestors are considered divine and activities are organized to respect their memory and invoke their aid. A cult is also a religious group held together by a dominant, often charismatic individual, or by the worship of a divinity, an idol, or some other object. (See animism, fetish, and totemism.)

developmental psychology The branch of psychology that studies the psychological growth of individuals. It deals with the psychological responses and changes in behavior that characterize such stages of life as infancy, adolescence, and old age.

double standard of sexual behavior A moral code that permits sexual freedom and promiscuity for men but not for women. The double standard has long been associated with the traditional subordination of women.

dowry Money, property, or material goods that a bride’s family gives to the bridegroom or his family at the time of the wedding. In many cultures, the dowry not only helps to cement the relationship between the bride’s and groom’s families but also serves to reinforce traditional family roles and gender roles.

ectomorph, endomorph, and mesomorph (ek-tuhmawrf) A person whose body structure is dominated by the outer skin and the nervous system. Ectomorphs are thin and have a large skin surface relative to their weight. Endomorphs are heavy and flabby, and mesomorphs are sturdy and strong, with highly developed bones and muscles.

ego (ee-goh) The “I” or self of any person (ego is Latin for “I”). In psychological terms, the ego is the part of the psyche that experiences the outside world and reacts to it, coming between the primitive drives of the id and the demands of the social environment, represented by the superego.

✥ The term ego is often used to mean personal pride and self-absorption: “Losing at chess doesn’t do much for my ego.”

egocentric (ee-goh-sen-trik) Preoccupied with one’s own concerns.

egomania (ee-goh-may-nee-uh) An extreme egotism.

egotism (ee-guh-tiz-uhm) An excessive regard for one’s own talents or achievements; conceit, self-importance; acting with only one’s own interests in mind.

empathy (em-puh-thee) Identifying oneself completely with an object or person, sometimes even to the point of responding physically, as when, watching a baseball player swing at a pitch, one feels one’s own muscles flex.

empty nest The stage in a family’s cycle when the children have grown up and left home to begin their own adult lives.

✥ For parents, the empty nest sometimes results in midlife anxiety.

encounter group A method of psychotherapy developed in the s, in which a small group of people engages in intensive interactions to increase selfawareness and improve interpersonal relations. Group members are encouraged to be completely honest and open, reacting to one another with their immediate feelings, while exploring the entire range of emotions.

✥ Often associated with the radical social upheaval of the s, encounter groups have been criticized for their potentially damaging effects, because many groups are led by people not professionally trained in psychotherapy.

Eskimos A widely dispersed group of peoples in the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia, who have traditionally survived primarily by hunting and fishing. Despite the isolation of Eskimo communities, the Eskimos display a strong cultural, racial, and linguistic unity. Many Eskimos, especially those in Canada, prefer the name Inuit.

✥ Most people picture isolated Eskimos living in igloos and driving dogsleds; however, contact with outsiders has resulted in adoption of permanent housing settlements, snowmobiles and motorboats, and modern hunting equipment. ✥ Christianity has replaced many traditional religious beliefs. Efforts by federal governments to incorporate Eskimo societies have included establishment of schools in Eskimo communities and opportunities to participate in the larger government and economy.

ethnicity (eth-nis-uh-tee) Identity with or membership in a particular racial, national, or cultural group and observance of that group’s customs, beliefs, and language.

✥ Many minority groups in the United States maintain strong ethnic identity; especially in cities, immigrants are often attracted to ethnic communities established by people from their own country, communities in which many traditional cultural features are maintained. (See melting pot.)

ethnocentrism (eth-noh-sen-triz-uhm) The belief that one’s own culture is superior to all others and is the standard by which all other cultures should be measured.

✥ Early social scientists in the nineteenth century operated from an ethnocentric point of view. So-called primitive tribes, for example, were studied by anthropologists to illustrate how human civilization had progressed from “savage” customs toward the accomplishments of Western industrial society.

ethnology (eth-nol-uh-jee) The study of contemporary cultures, in order to develop a theoretical framework for analyzing human society. Cultural anthropologists generally study societies by living among the people, observing, interviewing, and participating in their activities. More than simply describing the customs of these societies, anthropologists attempt to uncover underlying patterns and structures of cultural characteristics, such as language, mythology, gender roles, symbols, and rituals.

euthanasia (yooh-thuh-nay-zhuh) Painlessly putting someone to death — usually someone with an incurable and painful disease; mercy killing.

✥ Proposals to make euthanasia legal in the United States have inspired heated debate.

expatriation (eks-pay-tree-ay-shuhn) Voluntarily leaving the nation of one’s birth for permanent or prolonged residence in another country.

extended family A type of family in which relatives in addition to parents and children (such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins) live in a single household. A nuclear family forms the core of an extended family.

extrasensory perception (ESP) Knowledge or perception without the use of any of the five senses. ESP includes clairvoyance (knowledge about some distant object or event, such as an unreported accident), telepathy (reading another’s thoughts or sending one’s own to another), and precognition (predicting the future). Although many people claim to have extrasensory powers, these powers have yet to be verified by scientific procedures. (See also parapsychology and psychic research.)

extrovert (ek-struh-vurt) A term introduced by the psychologist Carl Jung to describe a person whose motives and actions are directed outward. Extroverts are more prone to action than contemplation, make friends readily, adjust easily to social situations, and generally show warm interest in their surroundings. (Compare introvert.)

feminism A movement for granting women political, social, and economic equality with men. (See women’s movement.)

fetish An object believed to carry a magical or spiritual force. Some so-called primitive tribes practice cult worship of fetishes. (See animism and totemism.)

✥ Figuratively, a “fetish” is any object that arouses excessive devotion: “Lucille made a fetish of her Porsche.”

Freud, Sigmund A physician in Vienna, Austria, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who founded psychoanalysis and developed the theory of the Oedipus complex. He believed that psychological problems could be traced to repressed childhood experiences, particularly to repressed sexual desires. He also argued that dreams provide clues to the nature of psychological problems. His theories introduced concepts such as those of the id and superego into the language of psychiatry.

# Sigmund Freud

Freudian Pertaining to or agreeing with the theories of Sigmund Freud.

Freudian slip An error in speech that reveals repressed thoughts or feelings; for example, accidentally calling one’s wife “Mom.”

future shock A sense of insecurity and disorientation often felt by people whose societies are undergo ing rapid change.

Gallup polls (gal-uhp) Surveys of public opinion as conducted by George Gallup, an American who developed a quantitative method of polling public opinion.

gay Descriptive term for homosexuals.

geisha (gay-shuh, gee-shuh) A Japanese woman who is trained and paid to provide entertainment and amusing company for men.

generation gap The differences in customs, attitudes, and beliefs between any two generations, but especially between youths and adults.

genital stage According to psychoanalysis, the third social and sexual stage of a young child’s development (after the oral stage and the anal stage). In the genital stage, interest in the child’s own sex organs and in other people’s replaces the earlier focusing on satisfaction of hunger and control of bowel movements. A genital personality is mature and no longer dominated by early drives for pleasure.

✥ The Oedipus complex is most often observed during the genital stage.

gerontocracy (jer-uhn-tok-ruh-see) A society ruled by elders.

gestalt psychology (guh-shtahlt, guh-shtawlt, guhstahlt, guh-stawlt) A type of psychology based on the study of a subject’s responses to integrated wholes, rather than to separate experiences. Gestalt (a German word meaning “form”) also refers to any structure or pattern in which the whole has properties different from those of its parts; for example, the beauty of a musical melody does not depend on individual notes as such, but rather on the whole continuous tune.

ghettos Originally, areas of medieval cities in which Jews were compelled to live. Today the term usually refers to sections of American cities inhabited by the poor. (See inner city.)

Girl Scouts of the United States of America An organization for girls from the ages of five to seventeen. Its aim is to increase values of citizenship and develop the interests and abilities of the members. The organization has five levels, divided by age: Daisy, Brownie, Junior, Cadette, and Senior Girl Scout. Several million girls and adults participate.

great man theory An approach to history associated with the nineteenth-century Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle, who declared, “The history of the world is but the biography of great men.” Carlyle argued that heroes shape history through the vision of their intellect, the beauty of their art, the prowess of their leadership, and, most important, their divine inspiration.

✥ Carlyle’s theories have generally fallen out of fashion.

group therapy Any form of psychotherapy involving a group of patients, rather than a one-on-one session between a patient and a therapist. (See encounter group).

✥ Group therapy is often used to explore interpersonal relations.

Haley, Alex (hay-lee) An African-American author who became famous for his book Roots: The Saga of an American Family. Haley combined fact and fiction in tracing his family’s history to his ancestor Kunta Kinte, who was kidnaped in Africa in the eighteenth century and taken as a slave to America.

✥ The great popularity of Roots, which also became a television series, was part of the growing interest in the s and s in multiculturalism.

hallucination A false perception that appears to be real, as when, for example, a man dying of thirst in a desert thinks that he sees a lake. (See also delusion.)

heterogeneity (het-uh-roh-juh-nee-uh-tee) Cultural, social, biological, or other differences within a group. (Compare homogeneity.)

heterosexuality Sexual attraction between a male and a female. (Compare bisexuality and homosexuality.)

hippies Members of a movement of cultural protest that began in the United States in the s and affected Europe before fading in the s. Hippies were bound together by rejection of many standard American customs and social and political views (see counterculture). The hippies often cultivated an unkempt image in their dress and grooming and were known for practices such as communal living, free love, and the use of marijuana and other drugs. Although hippies were usually opposed to involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War, their movement was fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest. (See Woodstock; compare beatniks.)

Homo erectus (hoh-moh i-rek-tuhs) An early ancestor of the human species that lived from about . million to , years ago. Homo erectus remains have been found in Africa, China, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Archaeological excavations have revealed that Homo erectus developed a cooperative hunting organization and the use of fire and may have had a spoken language.

Homo sapiens (hoh-moh say-pee-uhnz) The biological classification of modern humans. Homo sapiens is Latin for “the wise human” or “the clever human.” The earliest Homo sapiens was Neanderthal, who developed about , years ago. Sometimes modern humans are further classified into the subspecies of Homo sapiens neanderthalis (Neanderthals) and Homo sapiens sapiens (Cro-Magnons and present-day humans). (See Linnean classification.)

homogeneity (hoh-muh-juh-nee-uh-tee, hoh-muhjuh-nay-uh-tee) Cultural, social, biological, or other similarities within a group. (Compare heterogeneity.)

homosexuality A sexual attraction between persons of the same sex. (See gay and lesbian; compare heterosexuality.)

hunting and gathering societies Societies that rely primarily or exclusively on hunting wild animals, fishing, and gathering wild fruits, berries, nuts, and vegetables to support their diet. Until humans began to domesticate plants and animals about ten thousand years ago, all human societies were hunter-gatherers. Today, only a tiny fraction of the world’s populations support themselves in this manner, and they survive only in isolated, inhospitable areas, such as deserts, the frozen tundra, and dense rain forests. Given the close relationship between hunter-gatherers and their natural environment, hunting and gathering tribes such as the Bushmen and the Pygmies may provide valuable information for anthropologists seeking to understand the development of human social structures.

hypnosis Placing persons in a drowsy, sleeplike state in which they allegedly become vulnerable to the suggestions made by the hypnotist. Hypnosis may also be used to tap into the unconscious and is often characterized by vivid recall of memories and fantasies. These properties make hypnosis a useful tool in psychotherapy. Hypnosis also has sinister implications, for subjects may be manipulated to perform embarrassing actions or be susceptible to carrying out the hypnotist’s commands after the hypnosis session (posthypnotic suggestion).

hysteria A complex neurosis in which psychological conflict is turned into physical symptoms, such as amnesia, blindness, and paralysis, that have no underlying physical cause. Early in his career, Sigmund Freud worked on hysteria.

id In Freudian theory, the part of the psyche associated with instinctual, repressed, or antisocial desires, usually sexual or aggressive. In its efforts to satisfy these desires, the id comes into conflict with the social and practical constraints enforced by the ego and superego. (See also pleasure principle.)

illegitimacy The condition of being born to unmarried parents. It was once considered a mark of disgrace but is generally more accepted now.

incest Sexual relations between relatives who are forbidden by law to marry; for example, between father and daughter or mother and son.

✥ Though each society has its own system for determining the range of people who fall into this category, every society has an incest taboo of some sort.

inhibition A personal hindrance to activity or ex pression. For example, fear of contracting cancer might serve as an inhibition against smoking.

inner city A general term for impoverished areas of large cities. The inner city is characterized by minimal educational opportunities, high unemployment and crime rates, broken families, and inadequate housing. (See ghettos.)

intellectual A person who engages in academic study or critical evaluation of ideas and issues. (See intelligentsia.)

intelligence quotient (IQ) A number meant to measure intelligence. Once the standard measure of human mental capacity; now widely considered to be neither accurate nor fair. Controversy exists today over the effect of race and class on scores and whether IQ tests really measure intelligence. Tests of special aptitudes and personality factors are now favored over the pure intelligence test.

✥ The IQ was originally calculated using the ratio of a person’s “mental age” (as measured by a standardized test) and chronological age. An IQ between  and  is considered average; over , superior. (See Stanford-Binet scale.) Few tests still include the controversial notion of mental age.

intelligentsia (in-tel-uh-jent-see-uh) Intellectuals who form an artistic, social, or political vanguard or elite.

introvert (in-truh-vurt) A term introduced by the psychologist Carl Jung to describe a person whose motives and actions are directed inward. Introverts tend to be preoccupied with their own thoughts and feelings and minimize their contact with other people. (Compare extrovert.)

James, William An American philosopher and psychologist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He was one of the first theorists to suggest that humans, like other animals, possess instincts. He also opposed then-dominant views by arguing that human identity is grounded not in metaphysics but in behavior.

✥ Novelist Henry James was William James’s brother.

Jung, Carl (yoong) A Swiss psychologist of the twentieth century, who broke with his teacher Sigmund Freud and developed his own theories. Jung denied that sexuality is the basic driving urge for people. He classified people as extroverts and introverts, put forth a theory of the feminine principle in men (the anima) and the masculine principle in women (the animus), and argued that people share a collective unconscious, made up of symbols called archetypes.

Kinsey, Alfred (kin-zee) An American scientist of the twentieth century who investigated the sexual behavior of men and women. In  and , he published books on his findings — Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female — popularly known as the Kinsey Reports, which shattered existing conceptions of the nature and extent of American sexual practices.

✥ Kinsey was the first scientific investigator of sexual behavior to have a wide popular impact. By documenting the great variety of human sexual experiences, Kinsey’s work led many Americans to revise their views of “normal” sexual behavior, and in this way he contributed to the sexual revolution.

kinship A relation between two or more persons that is based on common ancestry (descent) or marriage (affinity).

kleptomania (klep-tuh-may-nee-uh) A compulsion to steal, usually without either economic need or personal desire.

latency period (layt-n-see) According to psychoanalysis, the period in a child’s development, from about age four to about age twelve, during which sexual drives are sublimated (see sublimation). Psychoanalytic theory holds that all other stages of a child’s development (the anal stage, the oral stage, the genital stage or the Oedipus complex stage, and puberty) are dominated by the gratification of primarily sexual drives. During the latency period, children generally identify with the parent of the same sex and play with other children of the same sex.

Leakey A family of anthropologists whose work at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and elsewhere revealed that humans probably first evolved in Africa. Louis

Carl Jung

Leakey and his wife, Mary, discovered fossils of hu man ancestors dating back over . million years. Their son, Richard Leakey, continued to make discoveries in Kenya and Tanzania.

lesbian A homosexual woman. (See also gay.)

libido (luh-bee-doh) In Freudian psychology, the energy associated with the desires that come from the id.

✥ Libido is loosely used to mean sexual desire.

Lucy Nickname for one of the most complete skeletons of an early ancestor of humans ever found. Discovered in Ethiopia by Don Johanson, Tim White, and Tom Gray, Lucy lived approximately three million years ago. She walked upright, and anthropologists estimate that she was about twenty years old when she died. Lucy is considered one of the great finds of anthropology.

mainstream The prevailing current or direction of a movement or influence: “The candidate’s speech represented the mainstream thinking on economic policy.”

maladjustment Inability to react successfully and satisfactorily to the demands of one’s environment. Though the term applies to a wide range of biological and social conditions, it often implies an individual’s failure to meet social or cultural expectations. In psychology, the term generally refers to unsatisfactory behavior patterns that cause anxiety and require psychotherapy.

malpractice Mistakes or negligent conduct by a professional person, especially a physician, that results in damage to others, such as misdiagnosis of a serious illness. Damaged parties often seek compensation by bringing malpractice suits against the offending physician or other professional.

Malthusianism (mal-thooh-zhuh-niz-uhm, malthooh-zee-uh-niz-uhm) A pessimistic viewpoint on population and world resources, based on the doctrines of Thomas Malthus. Malthusianism holds that population tends to increase faster than the supply of food, thus preventing the steady progress of mankind. Malthus advocated premarital chastity, late marriage, and sexual abstinence as partial solutions.

mania (may-nee-uh) Violent, abnormal, or impulsive behavior. In psychological terms, mania is wild activity associated with manic depression.

✥ A “mania” in popular terms is an intense enthusiasm or craze.

masochism (mas-uh-kiz-uhm) Abnormal behavior characterized by deriving sexual gratification from being subjected to pain. More loosely, masochism refers to deriving any pleasure from experiencing pain. (Compare sadism.)

matriarchy (may-tree-ahr-kee) A family or society in which authority is held by females, through whom descent and inheritance are traced. More generally, a matriarchy is a society dominated by women. (See also matrilineal, patriarchy, and patrilineal.)

matrilineal (mat-ruh-lin-ee-uhl) Tracing kinship and descent through the female line. (Compare patrilineal.)

McLuhan, (Herbert) Marshall (muh-klooh-uhn) A twentieth-century Canadian writer and communications theorist who proposed that the mass media, particularly television, were creating a global village. He also maintained that the means of communication has a greater influence on people than the information it carries. (See The medium is the message.)

Mead, Margaret An American anthropologist of the twentieth century, who revolutionized the field of anthropology in  with her book Coming of Age in Samoa, which emphasized the role of social convention rather than biology in shaping human behavior. In later writings, she described how the behavior of

Margaret Mead. Photograph taken in Bali, .

men and women differed from one culture to another and thereby challenged the notion that all gender differences were innate.

The medium is the message A statement by Marshall McLuhan, meaning that the form of a message (print, visual, musical, etc.) determines the ways in which that message will be perceived. McLuhan argued that modern electronic communications (including radio, television, films, and computers) would have far-reaching sociological, aesthetic, and philosophical consequences, to the point of actually altering the ways in which we experience the world.

megalomania (meg-uh-loh-may-nee-uh) Delusions of grandeur; an extreme form of egotism. Adolf Hitler is generally considered to have been a megalomaniac.

megalopolis (meg-uh-lop-uh-lis) A vast stretch of developed industrial urban area, such as the East Coast of the United States from Boston to Washington, D.C., or the Ruhr Valley in Germany. Megalopolis is from Greek words meaning “great city.”

melting pot A term expressing the view that immigrants to the United States have been fused or melted into a single people.

meritocracy (mer-i-tok-ruh-see) A government or society in which citizens who display superior achievement are rewarded with positions of leadership. In a meritocracy, all citizens have the opportunity to be recognized and advanced in proportion to their abilities and accomplishments. The ideal of meritocracy has become controversial because of its association with the use of tests of intellectual ability, such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, to regulate admissions to elite colleges and universities. Many contend that an individual’s performance on these tests reflects his or her social class and family environment more than ability.

Middle America The interior regions of the United States, as distinguished from the East Coast and West Coast.

✥ Middle America is associated with conservative, traditional values in politics, religion, and culture.

middle class A social and economic class composed of those more prosperous than the poor, or lower class, and less wealthy than the upper class. Middle class is sometimes loosely used to refer to the bourgeoisie. In the United States and other industrial countries, the term is often applied to white-collar, as opposed to blue-collar, workers.

✥ Values commonly associated with the middle class include a desire for social respectability and material wealth and an emphasis on the family and education.

mixed marriage Marriage between two people who come from different cultural, national, racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds. Often, such marriages must withstand the scrutiny of both partners’ families and social communities.

monogamy (muh-nog-uh-mee) A form of marriage in which one man is united with one woman. (Compare polyandry and polygamy.)

mores (mawr-ayz, mawr-eez) The customs and manners of a social group or culture. Mores often serve as moral guidelines for acceptable behavior but are not necessarily religious or ethical.

motor development The growth of muscular coordination in a child.

multiculturalism The view that the various cultures in a society merit equal respect and scholarly interest. It became a significant force in American society in the s and s as African-Americans, Latinos, and other ethnic groups explored their own history.

narcissism (nahr-suh-siz-uhm) A consuming selfabsorption or self-love; a type of egotism. Narcissists constantly assess their appearance, desires, feelings, and abilities.

Native Americans The descendants of the original inhabitants of North America and South America before the arrival of white settlers from Europe, also called Indians or American Indians. The term Native American is sometimes preferred over Indian because the latter is a misnomer that originated with Columbus, who mistook the inhabitants of America for the people of India. Both terms, however, are accepted.

✥ In recent years, Native American activism has taken the form of calls for the protection of their tribal or ancestral shrines and artifacts.

Native Americans. Ojibwa and Choctaw Indians at a powwow.

nature-nurture controversy A traditional and longstanding disagreement over whether heredity or environment is more important in the development of living things, especially human beings.

Neanderthal (nee-an-duhr-thawl, nee-an-duhr-tawl) The ancient and now extinct relatives of modern humans. Neanderthals lived in Europe about , years ago and were the earliest form of the human species, Homo sapiens.

✥ The term Neanderthal is sometimes used to refer to a person who is thought to have primitive or unenlightened ideas: “I tried talking politics to Joe, but he’s a real Neanderthal.”

nepotism (nep-uh-tiz-uhm) Favoritism granted to relatives or close friends, without regard to their merit. Nepotism usually takes the form of employing relatives or appointing them to high office.

neurosis (noo-roh-sis, nyoo-roh-sis) A mental disorder marked by anxiety or fear. Neurosis is less severe than psychosis. (See also angst, hysteria, and phobia.)

✥ In popular usage, a “neurotic” is anyone who worries a lot.

nomadism (noh-mad-iz-uhm) A way of life in which a community has no permanent settlement but moves from place to place, usually seasonally and within a defined territory. For hunting and gathering societies, nomadism does not imply aimless wandering, but suggests an organized rotation of settlements to ensure maximum use of available natural resources.

nonverbal communication Communication without the use of spoken language. Nonverbal communication includes gestures, facial expressions, and body positions (known collectively as “body language”), as well as unspoken understandings and presuppositions, and cultural and environmental conditions that may affect any encounter between people.

nuclear family A type of family made up only of parents and their children. (Compare extended family.)

nymphomania (nim-fuh-may-nee-uh) The presence in women of abnormally powerful sexual desires.

obscenity Behavior, appearance, or expression (such as films and books) that violate accepted standards of sexual morality. American courts have long tried to define obscenity but without much success. Some believe, for example, that any depiction of nudity is obscene; others would argue that nudity in itself is not obscene. (See four-letter words and pornography.)

obsession A preoccupation with a feeling or idea. In psychology, an obsession is similar to a compulsion.

Oedipus complex (ed-uh-puhs, ee-duh-puhs) In Freudian theory, the unconscious desire of a young child for sexual intercourse with the parent of the opposite sex, especially between boys and their mothers (see genital stage). Followers of the psychologist Sigmund Freud long believed that the Oedipus complex was common to all cultures, although many psychiatrists now refute this belief. The Oedipus complex is named after the mythical Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother.

old boy network A set of relationships based on past friendship or acquaintance that sometimes replaces or undermines official organizations: “He didn’t deserve that promotion; he got it because of his connections to the old boy network.”

Olduvai Gorge (ohl-duh-veye, awl-duh-veye) A deep ravine in Tanzania famous for the fossils of ancestors of humans found there by Louis and Mary Leakey.

oral personality According to the original theo ries of psychoanalysis, a personality fixed emotionally in the oral stage of development, whose sexual and aggressive drives are satisfied by putting things in his or her mouth. Depending on when the fixation occurs, oral personalities tend to be either optimistic, generous, and gregarious or aggressive, ambitious, and selfish. More recently, the term has come to refer to anyone who seeks pleasure through eating or sucking: “I didn’t realize he was an oral personality until I saw him smoking and chewing gum at the same time.” (Compare anal personality.)

oral stage According to psychoanalysis, the first social and sexual stage of an infant’s development, during which the infant focuses on satisfying hunger. Psychoanalysts believe that during this stage, the mouth is the focus of the libido; eating, sexual, and aggressive drives are satisfied by chewing, suckling, and biting. (See also anal stage, genital stage, and pleasure principle.)

organization man Someone who represses individual desires and molds behavior to conform to the demands of the organization he or she works for. (See also bureaucracy, bureaucrat, and conformity; see also under “Business and Economics.”)

paranoia (par-uh-noy-uh) A form of psychosis marked by delusions of persecution and of grandeur. One who suffers from paranoia is paranoid.

✥ In popular terminology, a “paranoid” personality is characterized by suspicion and distrust of others; a tendency to look for hidden meaning behind other people’s actions; argumentativeness; complaining; low tolerance for criticism; and a constant display of one’s own talents, accomplishments, independence, and rationality.

paranoid schizophrenia (skit-suh-free-nee-uh, skitsuh-fren-ee-uh) A type of schizophrenia characterized by delusions of grandeur, paranoia, hallucinations, jealousy, hostility, aggressiveness, unfocused anxiety, argumentativeness, and, in severe cases, detachment from reality to the point of autism.

parapsychology (par-uh-seye-kol-uh-jee) The study of extrasensory perception (ESP), communications with the dead, telekinesis (using mental energy to cause distant objects to move), and other mental phenomena that have not been explained or accepted by scientists. (See psychic research.)

pariah (puh-reye-uh) An outcast; a member of a low caste or class.

✥ The word originally stems from the caste system of India, which put pariahs in a very low place in society. In the United States, it refers to those of low social class or social status.

Pavlov’s dogs (pav-lawfs, pav-lawvz) The dogs used in conditioned response experiments by a Russian scientist of the late nineteenth century, Ivan Pavlov. In these experiments, Pavlov sounded a bell while presenting food to a dog, thereby stimulating the natural flow of saliva in the dog’s mouth. After the procedure was repeated several times, the dog would salivate at the sound of the bell, even when no food was presented.

✥ Someone who reacts instinctively rather than reflectively to a situation is said to be engaging in a Pavlovian reaction.

peasant A farmer or agricultural worker of low status. The word is applied chiefly to agricultural workers in Asia, Europe, and South America, who generally adhere to traditional agricultural practices and have little social mobility or freedom.

pecking order A hierarchy within a social group or community, in which those members at the top assume positions of leadership, authority, and power. The expression originated from a description of social behavior among chickens, which attack each other by pecking to establish dominance.

pederast (ped-uh-rast) A man who engages in anal intercourse with boys.

peeping Tom One who derives pleasure, usually sexual, from secretly spying on others. (See voyeurism.)

✥ The original “peeping Tom” was a legendary resident of the town where Lady Godiva rode naked through the streets. According to the story, Tom defied official orders by looking out his window as she went by and was struck blind.

peer group A group of people who share certain social characteristics, such as age, class, occupation, or education, and interact on a level of equality. An individual may be a member of several peer groups, including friends, schoolmates, and coworkers. Peer groups are important in socialization, as individuals attempt to conform to the expectations of their peer groups. (See conformity and peer pressure.)

peer pressure The social influence a peer group exerts on its individual members, as each member attempts to conform to the expectations of the group. (See conformity.)

penis envy In Freudian theory, the repressed desire of females to possess a penis.

✥ Penis envy is also used generally to mean a supposed female envy of men.

phallic symbol (fal-ik) A symbol of the penis.

phobia (foh-bee-uh) An extreme and often unreasonable fear of some object, concept, situation, or person.

the Pill A pill designed for contraception by preventing ovulation.

✥ The Pill was introduced in the s, and its possible side effects are still being investigated. It nonetheless offered an ease of use and reliability of result that no other method of contraception had ever before supplied. In this way, it contributed greatly to the sexual revolution.

pleasure principle In psychoanalysis, the demand that an instinctive need (usually sexual or aggressive) be gratified, regardless of the social or practical consequences. Sigmund Freud held that the id was dominated totally by the pleasure principle, but that, with the development of the ego and superego, individuals become aware of the demands of social reality (the reality principle), and thereby learn to temper and regulate their quest for pleasure.

polyandry (pol-ee-an-dree) A practice in which women have two or more husbands at the same time. A rare form of polygamy, polyandry is practiced by only a few cultures. (Compare monogamy.)

polygamy (puh-lig-uh-mee) The practice of having several wives or husbands at the same time. (Compare monogamy.)

pornography Books, photographs, magazines, art, or music designed to excite sexual impulses and considered by public authorities or public opinion as in violation of accepted standards of sexual morality. American courts have not yet settled on a satisfactory definition of what constitutes pornographic material. (See obscenity.)

Post, Emily A twentieth-century American authority on manners and etiquette. Post’s book Etiquette first appeared in the s, and new editions are still issued regularly.

postindustrial society A term used by social theorists to describe the stage of economic development that follows industrialization. The postindustrial society emphasizes not the production of goods, but of services, which depend on intelligent designers and users of technology.

posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) A psychological disorder in which a person continues to respond with distress to a traumatic event long after that event has occurred. The affected person may reexperience the event in their thoughts or dreams and exhibit a heightened state of arousal characteristic of extreme stress. Combat and rape are two of the most common causes of this disorder.

✥ PTSD was formalized as a disorder after the Vietnam War, when returning soldiers would often continue to show the signs of stress long after they had left the military.

prejudice A hostile opinion about some person or class of persons. Prejudice is socially learned and is usually grounded in misconception, misunderstanding, and inflexible generalizations. In particular, African-Americans have been victims of prejudice on a variety of social, economic, and political levels. (See civil rights movement and segregation.)

primogeniture (preye-moh-jen-uh-choor, preyemoh-jen-uh-chuhr) A system of inheritance in which land passes exclusively to the eldest son. Until the Industrial Revolution, this system severely restricted the freedom of younger sons, who were often forced into the military or the clergy to earn a living.

pseudoscience (sooh-doh-seye-uhns) A system of theories or assertions about the natural world that claim or appear to be scientific but that, in fact, are not. For example, astronomy is a science, but astrology is generally viewed as a pseudoscience.

psyche (seye-kee) The mind, soul, or spirit, as opposed to the body. In psychology, the psyche is the center of thought, feeling, and motivation, consciously and unconsciously directing the body’s reactions to its social and physical environment.

psychedelic (seye-kuh-del-ik) A descriptive term for things that produce or are related to hallucinations, especially drugs such as LSD.

✥ Psychedelic art, most popular during the late s and early s, combines patterns, objects, light, and sound to simulate hallucinatory experiences.

psychiatry (seye-keye-uh-tree, si-keye-uh-tree) The medical science that studies and treats mental illness and mental maladjustment. Psychiatrists treat mental disorders; psychologists study mental activities, whether healthy or disordered. In the United States, psychiatrists usually hold the degree of doctor of medicine (M.D.) and may prescribe medication for their patients.

psychic research Scientific investigation into phenomena that cannot be explained by known natural laws. (See ESP, extrasensory perception, parapsychology, and telepathy.)

psychoanalysis A method of treating mental illness, originating with Sigmund Freud, in which a psychiatrist (analyst) helps a patient discover and confront the causes of the illness. Many psychiatrists believe that these causes are buried deep in the unconscious of the patient and can be brought to the surface through such techniques as hypnosis and the analysis of dreams. Psychoanalysis emphasizes that mental illness usually originates in repressed sexual desires or traumas in childhood.

✥ Psychoanalysis is sometimes simply called analysis.

psychology The science dealing with mental phenomena and processes. Psychologists study emotions, perception, intelligence, consciousness, and the relationship between these phenomena and processes and the work of the glands and muscles. Psychologists are also interested in diseased or disordered mental states, and some psychologists provide therapy for individuals. In the United States, however, psychologists, unlike psychiatrists, are not medical doctors. (See psychiatry.)

✥ The two main divisions of psychology are individual or personality psychology and social psychology; social psychology deals with the mental processes of groups.

psychopath (seye-kuh-path) A mentally unbalanced person who is inclined toward antisocial and criminal behavior. (Compare sociopath.)

psychosis (seye-koh-sis) A severe mental disorder, more serious than neurosis, characterized by disorganized thought processes, disorientation in time and space, hallucinations, and delusions. Paranoia, manic depression, megalomania, and schizophrenia are all psychoses. One who suffers from psychosis is psychotic.

psychotherapy The use of the techniques of psychology or psychiatry or both to treat mental and emotional disorders. The term includes psychoanalysis, as well as other forms of psychological therapy.

Pygmy A member of any ethnic group in which the average height of the adult male is less than four feet, eleven inches. There are Pygmy tribes in dense rainforest areas of central Africa, southern India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The most widely studied Pygmies are the Mbuti of northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, who pursue a nomadic hunting and gathering subsistence (see nomadism and hunting and gathering societies), but have established complex interdependent relationships with their nonPygmy farming neighbors.

pyromania (peye-roh-may-nee-uh) An uncontrollable urge to set fires.

redneck A slang term, usually for a rural white southerner who is politically conservative, racist, and a religious fundamentalist (see fundamentalism). This term is generally considered offensive. It originated in reference to agricultural workers, alluding to how the back of a person’s neck will be burned by the sun if he works long hours in the fields.

regression A Freudian concept used by psychiatrists to signify a return to primitive or impulsive behavior after more mature behavior has been learned. (See also defense mechanism, id, and libido.)

rites of passage Ceremonies that mark important transitional periods in a person’s life, such as birth, puberty, marriage, having children, and death. Rites of passage usually involve ritual activities and teachings designed to strip individuals of their original roles and prepare them for new roles. The traditional American wedding ceremony is such a rite of passage. In many so-called primitive societies, some of the most complex rites of passage occur at puberty, when boys and girls are initiated into the adult world. In some ceremonies, the initiates are removed from their village and may undergo physical mutilation before returning as adults.

✥ Rites of passage generally affirm community solidarity, especially in times of change or crisis.

role conflict A situation in which a person is expected to play two incompatible roles. For example, a boss will suffer role conflict if forced to fire an employee who is also a close friend.

role model A person who serves as an example of the values, attitudes, and behaviors associated with a role. For example, a father is a role model for his sons. Role models can also be persons who distinguish themselves in such a way that others admire and want to emulate them. For example, a woman who becomes a successful brain surgeon or airline pilot can be described as a role model for other women.

Rorschach test (rawr-shahk) A test for personality traits that relies on the subject’s interpretations of a series of inkblots. The test was developed by Hermann

Rorschach, a Swiss psychiatrist of the twentieth century.

sadism (say-diz-uhm, sad-iz-uhm) Abnormal behavior characterized by deriving sexual gratification from inflicting pain on others. More loosely, sadism refers to deriving any pleasure from inflicting pain. Named after the Marquis de Sade, a French author of the eighteenth century, whose works describe many sexual perversities.

scapegoat A person or group that is made to bear blame for others. According to the Old Testament, on the Day of Atonement, a priest would confess all the sins of the Israelites over the head of a goat and then drive it into the wilderness, symbolically bearing their sins away.

schizophrenia (skit-suh-free-nee-uh, skit-suh-frenee-uh) A form of psychosis marked by a strong tendency to dissociate oneself from reality. Schizophrenia is often characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and inappropriate reactions to situations. The word schizophrenia is often used informally as well as scientifically to indicate a split personality.

sensory deprivation A natural or experimentally arranged situation in which stimulation of a subject’s senses is greatly reduced. Experiments have included floating subjects in soundproof water chambers. Though short periods of sensory deprivation can be relaxing, extended deprivation can result in extreme anxiety, hallucinations, bizarre thoughts, depres sion, and antisocial behavior. Sensory deprivation experiments have demonstrated that humans need constant sensory contact with their environment in order to function.

sex roles/gender roles The behaviors, attitudes, and activities expected or common for males and females. Whereas sex roles are essentially biologically determined (ensuring successful reproduction and forming the basis of sexual division of labor, in which women are associated with childrearing), gender roles (behavior that is considered “masculine” or “feminine”) are culturally determined. In the United States, for example, men are generally expected to be independent, aggressive, physical, ambitious, and able to control their emotions; women are generally expected to be passive, sensitive, emotional, nurturing, and supportive. These traditional gender roles frequently come under attack, especially from women. (See stereotype.)

sexism The belief that one sex (usually the male) is naturally superior to the other and should dominate most important areas of political, economic, and social life.

sexual abuse Unwanted sexual activity forced on a person by another through coercion or threats.

sexual orientation Preference for sexual activity with people of the opposite sex, the same sex, or both. (See bisexuality, heterosexuality, and homosexuality.)

sexual revolution A drastic relaxation in general standards of sexual behavior. The most recent occurred in the s and was helped by the introduction of the Pill, an easy and reliable method of preventing pregnancy.

shock therapy The treatment of a mentally ill person by passing electric shocks through the brain.

short-term memory Retention of information that undergoes little processing or interpretation and can be recalled for only a few seconds. Short-term memory can retain about seven items.

✥ A popular example of short-term memory is the ability to remember a seven-digit telephone number just long enough to dial a call. In most cases, unless the number is consciously repeated several times, it will be forgotten.

significant other A person whose close relationship with an individual affects that individual’s behavior and attitudes. A significant other is usually a family member, spouse, child, employer, coworker, friend, or lover, who serves as a role model or whose acceptance and approval is sought.

Skinner, B. F. An American psychologist of the twentieth century who stressed the similarities between human and animal learning processes. To measure learning, Skinner devised a box (the Skinner box) in which an animal learns to press a lever to get food or water. (See also behaviorism and conditioned response.)

Skinner Box. A Skinner box with a rat as subject. The food reservoir is on the left side of the box.

social Darwinism A theory arising in the late nineteenth century that the laws of evolution, which Charles Darwin had observed in nature, also apply to society. Social Darwinists argued that social progress resulted from conflicts in which the fittest or best adapted individuals, or entire societies, would prevail. It gave rise to the slogan “survival of the fittest.”

social mobility The ability of individuals or groups to move upward or downward in status based on wealth, occupation, education, or some other social variable.

✥ American society operates on the principle that an individual’s achievements can be rewarded by upward social mobility.

social science The study of how groups of people behave, often in an effort to predict how they will behave in the future. The social sciences include economics, anthropology, sociology, political science, and aspects of psychology and history.

socialization Learning the customs, attitudes, and values of a social group, community, or culture. Socialization is essential for the development of individuals who can participate and function within their societies, as well as for ensuring that a society’s cultural features will be carried on through new generations. Socialization is most strongly enforced by family, school, and peer groups and continues throughout an individual’s lifetime. (See also acculturation.)

socioeconomic status (SES) An individual’s or group’s position within a hierarchical social structure. Socioeconomic status depends on a combination of variables, including occupation, education, income, wealth, and place of residence. Sociologists often use socioeconomic status as a means of predicting behavior.

sociology The systematic study of human society, especially present-day societies. Sociologists study the organization, institutions, and development of societies, with a particular interest in identifying causes of the changing relationships among individuals and groups. (See social science.)

sociopath (soh-see-uh-path, soh-shee-uh-path) Someone whose social behavior is extremely abnormal. Sociopaths are interested only in their personal needs and desires, without concern for the effects of their behavior on others. (Compare psychopath.)

sodomy (sod-uh-mee) Sexual intercourse that is not the union of the genital organs of a man and a woman. The term is most frequently applied to anal intercourse between two men or to sexual relations between people and animals. (See pederast.)

✥ According to the Bible, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah for unacceptable sexual practices, apparently including anal intercourse between men. Sodomy takes its name from the city of Sodom. ✥ Many governments have laws against sodomy. These laws are difficult to enforce, however, and many people believe they violate personal privacy.

Stanford-Binet scale (stan-fuhrd-bi-nay) A test developed in  to measure intelligence and knowledge. After several subsequent revisions, the StanfordBinet scale became the foundation of intelligence quotient testing.

status The relative position of an individual within a group, or of a group within a society.

✥ Though the term can refer to either high or low standing, it is often used only to imply a position of prestige.

stereotype A generalization, usually exaggerated or oversimplified and often offensive, that is used to describe or distinguish a group.

stimulus plur. stimuli (stim-yuh-leye) An action, condition, or person that provokes a response, especially a conditioned response.

subconsciousness The part of the psyche just below consciousness and capable of bursting into consciousness. For example, a repressed sexual desire is part of our subconsciousness, although we may at some time become conscious of it.

✥ The subconscious is not the same as the unconscious. Blinking, for example, is usually unconscious and occasionally conscious, but never subconscious.

subculture A group within a society that has its own shared set of customs, attitudes, and values, often accompanied by jargon or slang. A subculture can be organized around a common activity, occupation, age, status, ethnic background, race, religion, or any other unifying social condition, but the term is often used to describe deviant groups, such as thieves and drug users. (See counterculture.)

sublimation (sub-luh-may-shuhn) In Freudian psychology, a defense mechanism by which the individual satisfies a socially prohibited instinctive drive (usually sexual or aggressive) through the substitution of socially acceptable behavior. For example, someone with strong sexual drives who paints nude portraits may be engaging in sublimation.

suburbanization (suh-bur-buh-nuh-zay-shuhn) The establishment of residential communities on the outskirts of a city. In the United States, many suburbs were created after World War II, during a period of tremendous growth in population and industry. Suburban dwellers typically work in the cities but raise their families in a less-congested, safer, and more relaxed atmosphere. Especially in the United States, suburbanization often is associated with the sprawl of population.

superego (sooh-puhr-ee-goh) In Freudian psychology, the part of the psyche that incorporates parental or community values and standards and acts as an inner check on behavior. The superego and ego, responding to social demands, are often in conflict with the primitive impulses of the id.

survivor guilt A deep sense of guilt, combined often with feelings of numbness and loss of interest in life, felt by those who have survived some catastrophe.

It was first noticed among survivors of the Holocaust. Survivors often feel that they did not do enough to save those who died or that they are unworthy relative to the perished.

symbol Something that represents or suggests something else. Symbols often take the form of words, visual images, or gestures that are used to convey ideas and beliefs. All human cultures use symbols to express the underlying structure of their social systems, to represent ideal cultural characteristics, such as beauty, and to ensure that the culture is passed on to new generations. Symbolic relationships are learned rather than biologically or naturally determined, and each culture has its own symbols.

taboo A descriptive term for words, objects, actions, or people that are forbidden by a group or culture. The expression comes from the religion of islanders of the South Pacific.

technocracy (tek-nok-ruh-see) A type of society marked by the dominant role of people with specialized technical skills, particularly engineers.

telepathy (tuh-lep-uh-thee) Knowledge conveyed from one individual to another without means of the five senses; mind reading. (See also extrasensory perception, parapsychology, and psychic research.)

therapy Treatment intended to cure or alleviate an illness or injury, whether physical or mental.

totemism (toh-tuh-miz-uhm) The belief that people are descended from animals, plants, and other natural objects. Symbols of these natural ancestors, known as totems, are often associated with clans (groups of families tracing common descent). By representing desirable individual qualities (such as the swiftness of a deer) and helping to explain the mythical origin of the clan, totems reinforce clan identity and solidarity.

transvestite Someone who dresses in the clothes usually worn by the opposite sex. Transvestites may be bisexual, heterosexual, or homosexual (see bisexuality, heterosexuality, and homosexuality).

type A personality A temperament marked by excessive competitiveness and ambition, an obsession with accomplishing tasks quickly, little time for selfreflection, and a strong need to control situations.

type B personality The opposite of type A personality. The type B personality is relaxed, uncompetitive, and inclined to self-analysis.

unconscious The part of the psyche lying far below consciousness and not easily raised into consciousness. In Freudian psychology, the unconscious cannot be directly observed with the conscious mind, but it has its own processes and deeply affects conscious thought.

upward mobility Rising from a lower to a higher social class or status. (See also social mobility.)

urban renewal Programs designed to clear, rebuild, and redevelop urban slums. Critics contend that although they bulldoze slums, urban renewal programs often have led to their replacement by office buildings and by apartment houses for the well-to-do.

value judgment An assessment of a person, situation, or event. The term is often restricted to assessments that reveal the values of the person making the assessment rather than the objective realities of what is being assessed.

$\clubsuit$ We often make value judgments without realizing that we are doing so. For example, a teacher who describes a student as “the best I’ve ever taught — very polite and obedient” is making a value judgment about the qualities (politeness and obedience) that make a student good.

voyeurism (voy-ur-iz-uhm, vwah-yur-iz-uhm, voyuhr-iz-uhm) Deriving sexual satisfaction by secretly watching others undress or engage in sexual activity. (See peeping Tom.)

Weber, Max (vay-buhr) A German sociologist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Weber maintained that modern capitalist society is created when technical advances require administration by a bureaucracy. Disagreeing with Karl Marx, Weber argued against the inevitability of revolution by the proletariat and the triumph of socialism, maintaining that social and political ideology can act independently of economic and material conditions. He also wrote extensively on the Protestant work ethic. Weber’s research methods established the foundations of social science research, as distinct from the natural sciences.

white-collar A descriptive term for office workers, who use a minimum of physical exertion, as opposed to blue-collar laborers. Managerial, clerical, and sales jobs are common white-collar occupations.

Woodstock A village in New York state, where some , young people assembled in  for a rock music festival.

✥ The size of the crowd and the prevalence of hippie dress and customs led to use of the term Woodstock nation to indicate the youth counterculture of the late s. ✥ The term Woodstock is now used loosely to mean a large, impromptu gathering.

working class In the United States, the population of blue-collar workers, particularly skilled and semiskilled laborers, who differ in values, but not necessarily in income, from the middle class. In Marxism, this term refers to propertyless factory workers.

xenophobia (zen-uh-foh-bee-uh, zee-nuh-foh-beeuh) An unreasonable fear, distrust, or hatred of strangers, foreigners, or anything perceived as foreign or different.

zero population growth A condition in which a population neither grows nor declines, because the number of births in a year equals the number of deaths. Many industrialized countries have relatively low birth and death rates, and a steady but small population growth. Many Third World countries, however, have extremely high birth and death rates. Without effective methods of birth control, these populations grow at a phenomenal rate but without the resources to support them.

# Business and Economics

![](img/940d9b0e06064d5138e826e7a0f648f22901b07c637c0740e112d32972bdfb6a.jpg)

Economics is the social science that deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Business may refer to any gainful economic activity or, more narrowly, to organizations that produce and distribute commodities. Basically, economics is a branch of investigation and study, whereas business connotes activity. Yet the two terms increasingly overlap. Once thought of as a knack or skill that could never be taught in school, business developed claims to scientific status in the twentieth century. Today, there are schools of business administration that, much like departments of economics, engage in study and investigation.

Both economic theory and the growing emphasis on the study of business have spilled over from the universities into the public forum. The s saw one of the longest periods of sustained growth in American history. A rise in productivity, low rates of unemployment, modest inflation, low interest rates, and the popularity of dot-coms contributed to a boom in the stock market. By , American households held  percent of their assets in stocks. As the baby boomers of the s and s reached their peak earning years, they prepared for retirement by contributing to pension plans, which plunged huge amounts of money into stocks and bonds. Less obvious but no less important, the deregulation of financial institutions by the federal government and periodic changes in the federal tax code have raised the threshold of financial knowledge for Americans. As late as the s, banks rarely advertised, savings and loan associations did not offer checking accounts, and insurance companies concentrated on selling insurance. Now, all of these institutions advertise and compete with one another by offering similar services. For example, all of them offer pension and retirement plans, and individual investors must be able to sort out and assess their rival claims.

To do so, ordinary Americans need not become professors of economics; however, they must understand the difference between stocks and bonds, and they should understand why the stock market tends to decline when the interest rates rise. This section provides the basic definitions necessary for threading one’s way not only through political debates about the future of the economy but also through the rival claims of financial institutions.

absenteeism Habitual absence from work, thought to reflect employee demoralization or dissatisfaction.

accounting The system of recording and auditing business transactions. (See audit.)

act of God A natural catastrophe, e.g., a hurricane, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption. (See volcano.)

✥ As a legal term relating to property damage, it appears in insurance contracts: “After the flood, Papovich was dismayed to discover that his house was not insured against acts of God.” ✥ In contracts dealing with the delivery of goods or services, the term is used to protect the parties from litigation over delays or failures in performance owing to circumstances beyond their control.

actuary (ak-chooh-er-ee) A mathematician who uses statistics to calculate insurance premiums.

affluent society A society in which scarcity of resources is not the predominant condition, and a general level of economic well-being has been achieved by most members of society. The term was made current by John Kenneth Galbraith in The Affluent Society, which described conditions in the United States after World War II.

✥ Conventional economic theory is based on the assumption that resources are scarce. Therefore, it makes increasing production in the private sector and limiting interference and regulation from the government a priority. In Galbraith’s affluent society, this priority is misplaced because scarcity is not predominant. The continued pursuit of conventional economic objectives in an affluent society leads to the conditions Galbraith observed in postwar America: private-sector affluence and public-sector squalor. For example, affluence in the private sector led to the mass availability of automobiles. Because public-sector interference (in the form of regulation and taxation) was discouraged, however, governments could not afford to build adequate roadways to accommodate those automobiles.

agribusiness The part of the economy devoted to the production, processing, and distribution of food, including the financial institutions that fund these activities.

✥ Agribusiness emphasizes agriculture as a big business rather than as the work of small family farms.

American Stock Exchange Traditionally, the second largest stock exchange in the United States, after the New York Stock Exchange. The American Stock Exchange is in New York City. It is often identified in financial pages as AMEX. In , AMEX merged with the NASD, which runs the NASDAQ exchange.

✥ Commonly, the term denotes anything of value.

audit The examination by an outside party of the accounts of an individual or corporation.

balance of payments The relationship between the payments made by one nation to all other nations and its receipts from all other nations.

✥ A nation whose payments exceed its receipts is said to be running an unfavorable balance of payments, which can affect the value of its currency in foreign countries. (See foreign exchange.)

✥ “Blue chip” suggests a safe investment.

bond A security issued by a corporation or public body and usually carrying a fixed rate of interest and a set date, called the bond’s maturity, for redemption of the principal. Like a stock, a bond is a type of investment, but unlike a stock, a bond has a definite, but not necessarily fixed, yield. Some bonds have a feature known as a call, which gives the borrower an option to pay off the principal of the bond before its maturity, the date when the bond is due to be redeemed. (See municipal bonds and Treasury bills.)

bond market The market in which bonds are traded before their maturity. If interest rates decline after a bond has been issued, the value of bonds already issued with higher rates of interest will rise, and hence the bond market is said to be “up.” A rise in interest rates will lower the value of bonds issued with lower rates of interest and send the bond market “down.”

At the same time, it gives dishonest management the opportunity to loot the firm’s assets while the case is before the courts.

Chávez, Cesar An American labor leader of the twentieth century. In the s, Chávez organized food harvesters in California, many of them MexicanAmericans like himself, into the United Farm Workers.

✥ In common usage, the “point of diminishing returns” is a supposed point at which additional effort or investment in a given endeavor will not yield correspondingly increasing results.

discount rate The rate of interest charged by the Federal Reserve System on loans it makes to the banking system.

✥ Because the Federal Reserve System lends money to the banking industry, one mechanism it has for regulating interest rates is to vary the discount rate that is, to make the money that banks borrow relatively more or less expensive. It is likely to lower the discount rate during economic downturns to stimulate investment and raise it during upswings to check inflation.

disposable personal income The total amount of money available for an individual or population to spend or save after taxes have been paid. As an economic measure it is abbreviated DPI.

Enron An American corporation based in Houston, Texas, that traded in energy and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December . Enron’s collapse stunned most investors and analysts because Enron, the seventh largest corporation in the United States, had long reported huge earnings. Subsequent investigations revealed that Enron had inflated its earnings by hiding its debt and losses in subsidiary partnerships. Although some of the company’s top executives made huge profits as Enron fell apart, many of its employees saw their retirement savings in Enron’s

401(k) plan wiped out by the collapse of Enron’s share price.

✥ Enron’s collapse raised many questions about the reliability of corporate financial statements and the potentially cozy relationships between accountants and the firms they audit.

equilibrium In economics, a state of the economy in which for every commodity or service (including labor), total supply and demand are exactly equal. Equilibrium is never actually attained; it is approximated by movements of the market.

✥ Keynesian economics departed from conventional economic theory in demonstrating that economic equilibrium and full employment need not occur together. Therefore, as a system tends toward equilibrium, it might not eliminate unemployment.

equity In real estate, the financial value of someone’s property over and above the amount the person owes on mortgages. For example, if you buy a house for $\$ 100,000$ , paying $\$ 20,000$ down and borrowing $\$ 80,000$ , your equity in the house is $\$ 20,000$ . As you pay off the principal of the loan, your equity will rise.

The euro became the official currency of these nations in , but nations were not obliged to phase out their existing currencies until . The expectation is that introduction of the euro will stimulate cross-border investment by eliminating fluctuating exchange rates.

Galbraith, John Kenneth (gal-brayth) An American economist; author of The Affluent Society and The New Industrial State. (See affluent society.)

global economy The international spread of capitalism, especially in recent decades, across national boundaries and with minimal restrictions by governments. The global economy has become hotly controversial.

gross Exclusive of deductions, prior to taxation, as in gross income. (Compare net.) Total, aggregate, as in gross domestic product.

gross domestic product (GDP) The monetary value of all of a nation’s goods and services produced within a nation’s borders and within a particular period of time, such as a year.

Group of Eight The world’s leading industrial nations (Great Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United States) whose leaders meet regularly to discuss the world’s economic problems. Often called the G-. In recent years their meetings have become the scenes of large and sometimes violent protests against the global economy.

hedging The practice by which a business or investor limits risk by taking positions that tend to offset each other. For example, a business stands to lose money if the price of a commodity it holds declines, but it can offset this risk by agreeing to sell a specified amount of the commodity at a set price at some point in the future.

✥ Hedge funds, which are investment funds usually open only to the very wealthy, grew in the s. The near failure of one such fund in , Long-Term Capital Management, sent shock waves through Wall Street.

hidden unemployment The unemployment or underemployment of workers that is not reflected in official unemployment statistics because of the way they are compiled. Only those who have no work but are actively looking for work are counted as unemployed. Those who have given up looking, those who are working less than they would like, and those who work at jobs in which their skills are underutilized are not officially counted among the unemployed, though in a sense they are. These groups constitute hidden unemployment.

✥ Because of hidden unemployment, official statistics underestimate unemployment.

individualism A view that stresses the importance and worth of each person. In economics, it is the doctrine that individuals best serve the public interest by pursuing their own self-interest. For example, the businessman who expands his company to increase his profits also creates jobs for many people and thereby serves the public interest. (See laissez-faire.)

industrial relations Relations between management and labor unions or between management and individual workers. Sometimes called labor relations.

inelastic demand Demand whose percentage change is less than a percentage change in price. For example, if the price of a commodity rises twenty-five percent and demand decreases by only two percent, demand is said to be inelastic. (See elasticity.)

inelastic supply Supply whose percentage change is less than a percentage change in price. For example, if the price of a commodity drops twenty-five percent and supply decreases by only two percent, supply is said to be inelastic. (See elasticity.)

inflation A general increase in prices.

labor union An organization of workers formed to promote collective bargaining with employers over wages, hours, fringe benefits, job security, and working conditions.

labor-intensive A term describing industries that require a great deal of labor relative to capital (compare capital-intensive). Examples of labor-intensive industries are forms of agriculture that cannot make use of machinery and service industries, such as restaurants.

laissez-faire (les-ay-fair, lay-zay-fair) French for “Let (people) do (as they choose).” It describes a system or point of view that opposes regulation or interference by the government in economic affairs beyond the minimum necessary to allow the free enterprise system to operate according to its own laws.

lien (leen, lee-uhn) A claim or right given to a creditor to secure payment of a debt, usually by sale of the debtor’s property.

limited liability A fundamental feature of corporations, whereby investors are liable only up to the amount of their investment.

$\clubsuit$ This principle is important for failing corporations because it holds that only the assets of the corporation, not the personal assets of its owners, can be liquidated (see liquidation) to cover the corporation’s debts.

liquid asset An asset in the form of money, or one that can be converted quickly into money.

liquidation The conversion of the assets of a firm into cash, often just before the firm goes out of business.

macroeconomics The part of economic theory that deals with aggregates, such as national income, total employment, and total consumption. (Compare microeconomics.)

make-work Publicly provided employment that is designed primarily to relieve unemployment and only incidentally to accomplish important tasks. If private employers are hiring few people because of a business slump, the government can “make work” for people to do.

Malthus, Thomas (mal-thuhs) A British economist of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, especially concerned with overpopulation.

✥ Malthusian theories hold that populations will always increase faster than food supplies and that, therefore, hunger will always exist among the poorest populations (see Malthusianism). ✥ Malthus’s pessimistic views, along with those of David Ricardo, earned economics the reputation of being the “dismal science.”

management The body of individuals who run major businesses, usually without owning them but often with the reward of stock options.

marginal cost The change in total cost of production when an output is varied by one unit.

marginal tax rate The rate at which income over a certain amount is taxed. Although in general, graduated income taxes impose higher tax rates on higher incomes, the tax rate does not rise for each additional dollar earned. Rather, it rises by income brackets, and each tax rate applies only to income that falls in that bracket. For example, in , the highest marginal federal tax rate was . percent, which for single taxpayers was imposed on income in excess of $\$ 54,000$ .

market economy An economy in which the greater part of production, distribution, and exchange is controlled by individuals and privately owned corporations rather than by the government, and in which government interference in the market is minimal. Although a total market economy is probably only theoretically possible (because it would exclude taxation and regulation of any kind), capitalist economies approximate it and socialist economies are antithetical to it (see capitalism and socialism). Market economies are also called free economies, free markets, or free enterprise systems.

Marx, Karl A German scholar of the nineteenth century; the originator of Marxism, the fundamental theory of communism. Marx viewed political, social, and economic reality as based in the class struggle and predicted that capitalism would destroy itself. With the downfall of capitalism, the workers of the proletariat would come to power and begin a new age, free of economic exploitation. Much of Marx’s

Karl Marx

work, including The Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital, was done with Friedrich Engels. (See also socialism.)

mass production The manufacture of goods in large quantities by machinery and by use of techniques such as the assembly line and division of labor.

mean An average in statistics. (See under “Physical Sciences and Mathematics.”)

mediation The attempt to settle a dispute through a neutral party.

mercantilism (mur-kuhn-tee-liz-uhm, mur-kuhnti-liz-uhm, mur-kuhn-teye-liz-uhm) An economic doctrine that flourished in Europe from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Mercantilists held that a nation’s wealth consisted primarily in the amount of gold and silver in its treasury. Accordingly, mercantilist governments imposed extensive restrictions on their economies to ensure a surplus of exports over imports. In the eighteenth century, mercantilism was challenged by the doctrine of laissez-faire. (See also Adam Smith.)

✥ The European quest for colonial holdings in Asia, Africa, and North and South America was partially a product of mercantile economics.

merger The union of two or more independent corporations under a single ownership. Also known as takeovers, mergers may be friendly or hostile. In the latter case, the buying company, having met with resistance from directors of the targeted company, usually offers an inflated (overmarket) price to persuade stockholders of the targeted company to sell their shares to it. Such mergers often have been financed by junk bonds.

✥ Especially common in the s, hostile takeovers have become highly controversial. Some contend that they bring needed infusions of capital and efficiency to the targeted company. Others argue that, having borrowed heavily to finance the merger, the buyer is forced to sell valuable assets of the targeted company to pay off its debt.

microeconomics Economic analysis of particular components of the economy, such as the growth of a single industry or demand for a single product. (Compare macroeconomics.)

minimum wage The lowest legal hourly wage.

mixed economy An economy that combines elements of capitalism and socialism, mixing some individual ownership and regulation. Some capitalist countries, France, for example, employ what is often called state capitalism. In this form of a mixed economy, the state becomes a major shareholder in private enterprises. An alternative, employed in Great Britain (more in the past than now), is for the state to own some industries while leaving others in private hands.

monetarism (mon-uh-tuh-riz-uhm) The economic doctrine that the supply of money has a major impact on a nation’s economic growth. For example, monetarists prefer to control inflation by restricting the growth of a nation’s money supply rather than by raising taxes. The doctrine is associated with Milton Friedman.

monetary policy An attempt to achieve broad economic goals by the regulation of the supply of money. (Compare fiscal policy.)

money market A collective term for the many markets in which funds that are loaned for short periods to businesses or to governments are bought and sold.

Commonly used to purchase homes, mortgages specify the terms by which the purchaser borrows from the lender (usually a bank or a savings and loan association), using his or her title to the house as security for the unpaid balance of the loan.

multinational corporation A corporation with operations in two or more countries.

✥ The rise of multinationals, a relatively recent occurrence, has resulted in a great deal of legal ambiguity because they can operate in so many jurisdictions.

multiplier effect An effect in economics in which an increase in spending produces an increase in national income and consumption greater than the initial amount spent. For example, if a corporation builds a factory, it will employ construction workers and their suppliers as well as those who work in the factory. Indirectly, the new factory will stimulate employment in laundries, restaurants, and service industries in the factory’s vicinity.

municipal bonds Bonds issued by nonprofit bodies such as cities, public hospitals, and school boards. They bear relatively low interest rates, but accrued interest is exempt from federal income tax.

mutual fund A company organized for the purpose of making investments. A mutual fund gets its capital stock from private individual investors, who, in effect, allow the mutual fund to decide where to invest their money.

mutual insurance company A type of insurance company in which policyholders share in the profits.

Nader, Ralph (nay-duhr) An American lawyer of the twentieth century and a leading advocate for consumers. Nader became prominent in the s with his book Unsafe at Any Speed, which accused the automobile industry of producing dangerous cars. Later, Nader attacked unsanitary conditions in the meat packing industry and called for more attention to railroad and airline safety.

✥ Nader initially was known for his focus on immediate and concrete concerns; however, in the s he increasingly called for basic changes in the ways in which business is conducted, and in  he ran for president as the candidate of the Green Party. ✥ Nader’s assistants, often university students, are known as “Nader’s Raiders.”

NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System) An electronic stock market, where all trading takes place through NASDAQ’s computer network rather than at a central trading location. Started in , NASDAQ surpassed the New York Stock Exchange in annual share volume during the s, mainly because of its popularity with investors of emerging high-tech companies. Microsoft®, for example, is listed on NASDAQ.

national debt The debt of the government; the amount of borrowing by the government to meet expenditures exceeding tax revenues.

✥ A large national debt can inhibit growth and drive up interest rates.

nationalization A government takeover of a private business.

natural resources Factors of production not created (though harnessed) by effort. Minerals and fossil fuels are examples of natural resources.

negative income tax A plan to raise the income of the poor by direct cash subsidies. Instead of paying an income tax, the poor would receive a cash payment from the government.

no-fault insurance A type of automobile liability insurance that tries to cut the cost of insurance by restricting the legal grounds on which suits arising out of accidents can be brought. Most payments are made without determining legal responsibility, which is most often the reason for going to court.

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) An organization of about a dozen nations that sell oil to other nations. The purpose of OPEC, a cartel, is to control the production of oil and to establish favorable oil prices for the member nations. Most OPEC countries, such as Libya and Saudi Arabia, are in the Middle East or northern Africa, but Indonesia and Venezuela are members as well.

✥ OPEC was formed in the early s but had little impact before . Then, to punish the United States and several Western nations for supporting Israel in a war against Egypt and Syria (see Arab-Israeli conflict), the Arab members of OPEC placed an embargo on the sale of oil to the United States and some of its allies. The result was a severe gasoline shortage and a recession in Western nations, especially in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Since then the price of oil has fluctuated, partly because OPEC members have had difficulty agreeing on and policing a common pricing policy.

overdraft The amount by which a check exceeds the funds on deposit to cover it.

overhead All costs of running a business other than wages paid to production workers or payments for raw material to be used in production. Overhead includes the cost of renting or leasing a store in which business is transacted, the cost of heating a factory, and similar expenses.

Parkinson’s Law A law propounded by the twentieth-century British scholar C. Northcote Parkinson. It states, “Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.”

partnership An association of two or more persons to conduct a business. In contrast to a corporation, those who engage in a partnership are liable for debts incurred by the company to the full extent of their private fortunes rather than merely to the extent of their investment.

pension Payments made to a retired person either by the government or by a former employer.

peonage (pee-uh-nij) A system of forced labor based on debts incurred by workers. Peonage developed particularly in plantation economies, where employers forced laborers to buy from employer-owned stores, pay inflated prices, and stay in debt.

per capita (puhr kap-i-tuh) A Latin phrase literally meaning “by heads,” and translated as “for each person.” It is a common unit for expressing data in statistics. A country’s per capita personal income, for example, is the average personal income per person.

per diem (puhr dee-uhm, deye-uhm) A Latin phrase meaning “by the day.” Traveling sales reps or government workers often are paid a per diem, meaning an allowance out of which to cover daily expenses while traveling.

personal property Furniture, automobiles, boats, and other possessions that are not included in the category of real property.

planned economy A type of economy in which some central authority makes a wide range of decisions pertaining to production and wages.

✥ The former Soviet Union and other communist nations are examples of planned economies.

planned obsolescence (ob-suh-les-uhns) Incorporating into a product features that will almost certainly go out of favor in a short time, thereby inducing the consumer to purchase a new model of the product. Placing sweeping tail fins on an automobile was an example of planned obsolescence.

postindustrial economy A phrase that describes the shift of some major industrial economies in the late twentieth century away from producing goods and toward producing services.

poverty level A level of income above which it is possible to achieve an adequate standard of living and below which it is not. It fluctuates with the cost of living.

✥ Because the poverty level is somewhat artificially established by the government, it can be manipulated for political ends. As with hidden unemployment, governments are often accused of establishing a poverty level that underestimates the number of poor people.

price controls Measures, usually temporary, taken by governments to limit price rises in times of rapid inflation.

price fixing Any usually unlawful practice by which producers of a commodity act together to obtain an artificially high price.

proxy A person authorized to act for another, or the written authorization to act for another.

✥ Shareholders in corporations may designate proxies to represent them at stockholders’ meetings and vote their shares.

public company A company that sells shares in itself to the public to raise capital. When a previously privately owned company offers shares, it is said to $^ { \mathrm { { \sc ~ \alpha ~ } } } \mathrm { { g o } }$ public.”

Ricardo, David A British economist of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Ricardo was essentially a classical economist in the tradition of Adam Smith, but he expanded Smith’s vision to forecast an eventual end to economic growth owing to the difficulty of increasing food production to keep up with population growth.

✥ With Thomas Malthus, he is credited with propounding the pessimistic views that earned economics the label of the “dismal science.”

Exchange. (Compare Dow Jones Industrial Average.)

savings and loan association A financial institution that resembles a bank but that historically did not offer services such as personal checking accounts and that invested capital mainly in home mortgages. In the late s, Congress passed legislation freeing savings and loan associations (often called S&Ls) from their traditional dependency on home mortgage loans. In response, S&Ls invested their capital, often unwisely, in a range of enterprises, especially real estate. In the late s, hundreds of S&Ls went bankrupt, leaving the federal government, which insured the accounts of depositors, with an enormous bill. Since then they have been subject to tighter regulation.

savings bond A bond issued by the United States government and sold in relatively small denominations, mainly to individuals.

scab Informally, a worker who stays on the job while others go on strike. Also, a worker brought in to keep a plant operating when its work force is on strike. (See strikebreaker.)

selling short Borrowing shares of stock from a brokerage firm (see broker) and then selling in the expectation that the price of the stock will decline. If it does, the borrower buys them back at a reduced price, returns them to the brokerage, and makes a profit. If it rises, the investor loses money. To sell short is to “short” a stock.

seniority Length of service on a job. Seniority may be considered in making decisions about wages, layoffs, and other working conditions.

sinking fund A fund into which companies or governments place money to redeem their bonds and other forms of indebtedness.

sliding scale A set of rates that change according to a mathematical formula. The income tax, for example, is levied on a sliding scale, with the rich paying a higher percentage than the poor.

Smith, Adam A Scottish scholar of the eighteenth century whose ideas about economics led to the growth of modern capitalism. His best-known work is The Wealth of Nations. (See invisible hand.)

Social Security System A system of federally funded services and payments to help support the needy, the aged, and the temporarily unemployed as well as providing support for needy, dependent, disabled, or neglected children, rehabilitation for the disabled, and a host of other social services. The system was established as part of the New Deal and is funded by payroll taxes paid by workers and employers.

stagflation An economic phenomenon of the late s and s characterized by sluggish economic growth and high inflation. The word is a blend of stagnation and inflation.

stock market A market in which stocks are bought and sold (see stock exchange). Also, the general condition of the sale of securities in a corporation.

stock options The right to purchase a company’s shares at a future date at an agreed price. Companies often give stock options to their executives as an incentive to improve the company’s performance and boost its share price. If the share price has risen above the agreed price of the option by the time the option is exercised, the executive stands to make a considerable profit.

stockholders The persons or corporations holding stock in a corporation.

strike A concerted refusal by employees in a particular business or industry to work. Its goal is usually to force employers to meet demands respecting wages and other working conditions.

strikebreaker An employee hired to replace a striking worker. (See scab.)

structural unemployment Relatively long-lasting unemployment resulting from long-term shifts in economies and markets rather than short-term savings in economic conditions.

✥ Structural unemployment tends to develop around major changes in an economy, such as the move from an industrial to a technological economy. Workers displaced by the decline of the old economy tend not to be trained in fields suitable for the new economy, so they remain out of work.

Strike. United Parcel Service workers on strike in Minneapolis.

subsidy A grant made by a government to some individual or business in order to maintain an acceptable standard of living or to stimulate economic growth.

subsistence farming Farming that provides enough food for the farmer and his family but not enough for sale. By comparison, commercial farming is farming that provides products for sale.

supply The amount of any given commodity available for sale at a given time.

supply and demand In classical economic theory, the relation between these two factors determines the price of a commodity. This relationship is thought to be the driving force in a free market. As demand for an item increases, prices rise. When manufacturers respond to the price increase by producing a larger supply of that item, this increases competition and drives the price down. Modern economic theory proposes that many other factors affect price, including government regulations, monopolies, and modern techniques of marketing and advertising.

supply-side economics An economic theory that holds that, by lowering taxes on corporations, government can stimulate investment in industry and thereby raise production, which will, in turn, bring down prices and control inflation. The theory also favors improvements in education and training to make workers more productive and reducing the welfare state to spur individuals to work harder. Supplysiders focus on increasing the supply of goods rather than stimulating demand by granting subsidies to the public. Supply-side economics influenced the presidency of Ronald Reagan.

surplus An unsold quantity of a good resulting from a lack of equilibrium in a market. For example, if a price is artificially high, sellers will bring more goods to the market than buyers will be willing to buy. (Compare shortage.)

surtax A tax added to an existing tax. To help finance the Vietnam War, for example, Congress imposed a surtax on the federal income tax.

sweatshop A small factory or shop in which employees are poorly paid and work under adverse conditions. Sweatshops were especially common in the garment industry during the early twentieth century.

take-home pay Pay after deductions for taxes, Social Security, insurance, and other services.

tariff A government tax on imports, designed either to raise revenue or to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

tax break A special tax benefit given to promote specific economic or social objectives. For example, the U.S. government, having decided that individual home ownership is a boon to the economy, allows interest on a home mortgage to be subtracted, in whole or in part, from one’s taxable income. The resulting lower taxation for homeowners constitutes a tax break.

tax deduction An expense, such as a charitable contribution, that can be deducted from one’s taxable income. Unlike a tax shelter, a tax deduction does not necessarily take the form of an investment.

tax haven A place that levies very low taxes or none at all on foreigners.

✥ Monaco and various small Caribbean island nations are famous as tax havens.

tax loophole A provision in the laws governing taxation that allows people to reduce their taxes. The term has the connotation of an unintentional omission or obscurity in the law that allows the reduction of tax liability to a point below that intended by the framers of the law.

✥ A tight-money policy might be pursued to limit inflation.

trade Business or commerce; economic activity.

trade barriers Tariffs, import quotas, customs regulations, and other disincentives meant to discourage international trade.

✥ Trade barriers are usually protectionist; that is, they are erected to protect domestic producers who would not be able to compete successfully with foreign producers in a free market or in free trade.

trade deficit The condition that exists when the value of what a country imports exceeds the value of what it exports; also called an unfavorable balance of trade.

✥ Trade deficits, because they imply that capital is leaving a country, can cause higher interest rates.

tradeoff What must be given up, and what is gained, when an economic decision is made.

transfer payment Income transferred from one party to another without a corresponding exchange of goods or services. Examples are a corporation’s charitable contributions or a government’s provision of social services.

Treasury bills (T-bills) Securities issued by the U.S. government. T-bills normally have fixed terms; that is, the purchaser cannot take possession of the accrued interest for a fixed period of time after purchase. T-bills are auctioned by the Treasury each week; the auction determines the six-month interest rate.

trust A combination of firms or corporations for the purpose of reducing competition and controlling prices throughout a business or industry. Trusts are generally prohibited or restricted by antitrust legislation. (Compare monopoly.)

trust busting Government activities aimed at breaking up monopolies and trusts. (See antitrust legislation.)

vested interest A phrase that indicates a deep personal (and possibly financial) interest in some political or economic proposal: “As a major stockholder of the Ford Motor Company, Senator Bilge had a vested interest in legislation restricting the import of Japanese autos.” The plural, vested interests, often refers to powerful, wealthy property holders: “His radical policies enraged vested interests.”

voucher A credit of a certain monetary value that can be used only for a specified purpose, such as to pay for housing or for food. Food stamps are a kind of voucher.

✥ Some economists believe that goods and services supplied by the government would be provided more efficiently if vouchers that could be spent only on such goods and services were given to citizens, and private business competed to provide those goods and services.

wage scale A schedule of the wages paid to different classes of workers in a company.

wages Payment for services to a worker, usually remuneration on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.

# Physical Sciences and Mathematics

![](img/80678577585138b7d59207ab9ac0f4c7852c0bba5f45945ba0f3338a87e8f9aa.jpg)

The physical sciences include physics, chemistry, and astronomy, along with related branches of engineering. They are the most highly developed of the sciences, and serve as a model for development of other areas of learning. Mathematics, while not a science itself, is the language in which the physical sciences are written, and hence has had a close relation with these sciences throughout history.

Physics is the study of matter and motion. It is divided into two sections: classical physics, which is the science as developed before ; and modern physics, which encompasses twentieth-century work. Classical physics is further divided into mechanics, the study of motion; thermodynamics, the study of phenomena related to heat; and the study of electricity and magnetism. The content of each of these fields can be summarized in a few basic laws from which all the rest of the contents can be derived by mathematical reasoning. There are three laws for mechanics (Newton’s laws of motion), three for thermodynamics (known simply as the laws of thermodynamics), and four for electricity and magnetism (Maxwell’s equations). If you add to these Newton’s law of universal gravitation (now known to be a special case of general relativity), you have a handful of laws that explain everything that was studied by scientists to the end of the nineteenth century, from the motion of the moon in its orbit to the flow of blood through an artery.

In the twentieth century, two new fields were added to physics: relativity, which deals with objects moving near the speed of light and which constitutes our modern theory of gravitation; and the study of the atom and the particles that compose it. The latter field occupies the bulk of the attention of modern physicists.

The atom consists of a nucleus and electrons circling around the nucleus; the ways in which atoms come together to form molecules is governed by the behavior of the electrons. When the number of atoms in a molecule is in the thousands or hundreds of thousands, the basic laws of atomic behavior discovered by physicists are of limited use, and the complex interactions of the molecules constitute their own field of study. The infinite variety of possible atomic combinations is the domain of chemistry. In the same way, the new science of materials, in which scientists produce substances with new and hitherto undreamed-of properties, involves procedures for arranging atoms in new ways.

The nucleus of the atom is composed of elementary particles, which are themselves composed of things called quarks, which are still more elementary. The study of the interactions of elementary particles at high energy is the frontier of knowledge in physics today.

We now know that stars, like people and trees, have life cycles — that they are born, live out their lives, and die. The sun and other stars are powered by nuclear reactions in their core and die when the nuclear fuel is consumed.

Cosmology is the branch of astronomy concerned with the universe as a whole, as well as its origin. The universe is expanding and is believed to have originated about fourteen billion years ago, in an event known as the Big Bang. The study of these origins is an important frontier in astronomy.

Mathematics does not involve experimentation or observation of nature and is therefore not a science like physics or chemistry. In mathematics, one may start with assumptions and rules of logic and use deduction to reach conclusions. Plane geometry of the type taught in high school is a good example of how this procedure works. Alternately, as in the study of statistics, one may start with a set of incomplete data and use induction to reach conclusions. Mathematicians provide the tools that physical scientists apply to their studies of the world. Modern mathematics has, however, become extremely abstract and is well beyond the reach of the general public (and even of most scientists). Consequently, only those notions of mathematics that are likely to be encountered in general discussion are included in the following list.

— J.T.

absolute zero The lowest temperature that can be attained by matter, corresponding to the point at which most motion in atoms stops. Absolute zero is about $^ { - 2 7 3 }$ degrees on the Celsius scale and about – on the Fahrenheit scale.

accelerating universe A phrase used to refer to the discovery that the Hubble expansion is not slowing down, as one would expect if only gravity were acting on the galaxies, but is actually speeding up as time goes by. (See dark energy.)

acceleration A change in the velocity of an object.

✥ The most familiar kind of acceleration is a change in the speed of an object. An object that stays at the same speed but changes direction, however, is also being accelerated. (See force.)

acid A sour-tasting material (usually in a solution) that dissolves metals and other materials. Technically, a material that produces positive ions in solution. An acid is the opposite of a base and has a pH of  to . A given amount of an acid added to the same amount of a base neutralizes the base, producing water and a salt. Common vinegar, for example, is a weak solution of acetic acid.

✥ Figuratively, acid applies to anything sour or biting; for example, an “acid wit” is sharp and unpleasant.

acute angle An angle that measures less than ninety degrees but more than zero degrees. (Compare obtuse angle and right angle.)

adhesion The molecular (see molecule) attraction that holds the surfaces of two dissimilar substances together. (Compare cohesion.)

adsorption The assimilation of a gas, liquid, or dissolved substance by the surface of a solid.

aerodynamics The branch of science devoted to the study of the flow of gases around solid objects. It is especially important in the design of cars and airplanes, which move through the air.

✥ A vehicle that has been built to minimize friction with the air is said to be aerodynamically designed.

alchemy (al-kuh-mee) A science (no longer practiced) that sought to transform one chemical element into another through a combination of magic and primitive chemistry. Alchemy is considered to be the ancestor of modern chemistry.

✥ The search for the philosopher’s stone that would change lead and other base metals into gold was part of alchemy. $\clubsuit$ Today, alchemy is associated with wizards, magic, and the search for arcane knowledge.

algebra A branch of mathematics marked chiefly by the use of symbols to represent numbers, as in the use of $a ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 } = c ^ { 2 }$ to express the Pythagorean theorem.

algorithm (al-guh-rith-uhm) A set of instructions for solving a problem, especially on a computer. An algorithm for finding your total grocery bill, for example, would direct you to add up the costs of individual items to find the total.

alkali (al-kuh-leye) A bitter, caustic mineral often found in large beds in the desert. Alkalis are bases; two common examples are lye and ammonia.

✥ Plants have difficulty growing in soil that is rich in alkalis.

alloy (al-oy, uh-loy) A material made of two or more metals, or of a metal and another material. For example, brass is an alloy of copper and zinc; steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. Alloys often have unexpected characteristics. In the examples given above, brass is stronger than either copper or zinc, and steel is stronger than either iron or carbon.

alpha radiation (al-fuh) Particles sent out by some radioactive nuclei, each particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound together. Alpha particles carry a positive charge. (See beta radiation and gamma radiation.)

✥ Alpha radiation, unlike gamma radiation, has low penetrating power; it can be stopped by clothing.

amplitude In physics, the height of a crest (or the depth of a trough) of a wave.

Andromeda galaxy (an-drom-uh-duh) In astronomy, the galaxy nearest to the Milky Way, usually seen as a large collection of stars arranged in a central core with spiral arms. The galaxy was given this name because the stars of the constellation Andromeda appear to enclose it.

antimatter In physics, matter made of antiparticles.

antiparticle In physics, a rare form of subatomic matter that is a mirror image of normal matter. The antiparticle corresponding to an elementary particle has the same mass as the particle but is opposite in all other properties. The antiparticle corresponding to an electron is a positron, which has the same mass as an electron but a positive charge. Antiprotons have the same mass as protons but a negative charge. When matter and antimatter come together, the two particles annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy or into other types of particles.

✥ As far as scientists can tell, there is almost no naturally occurring antimatter in the universe, although it is possible to make antimatter in particle accelerators.

apogee (ap-uh-jee) In astronomy, the point during the orbit of a satellite, such as the moon, at which it is farthest from the body being orbited. For planets in the solar system orbiting the sun, their farthest point from the sun is referred to as aphelion.

Archimedes (ahr-kuh-mee-deez) An ancient Greek scientist, mathematician, and inventor. He is best known for his investigations of buoyancy.

✥ Archimedes is said to have shouted “Eureka!” (“I have found it!”) as he stepped into his bath and realized that the volume of an object can be measured by determining how much water it displaces. He used this insight to measure the volume of a crown supposedly made of pure gold. After measuring the crown’s volume and weighing it, he could calculate its density. He then could prove that the crown was not dense enough to be pure gold. ✥ According to the “principle of Archimedes,” when an object placed in water is weighed, and its weight in the water is compared to its weight out of the water, it seems to lose a definite amount — an amount equal to the weight of the water it displaces. This principle holds not only for water, but also for gases, such as air. A boat floats, or a balloon rises, because it weighs less than the material it displaces. (See buoyancy.) Archimedes is also supposed to have said, with regard to levers and fulcrums, “Give me the place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the Earth!”

asteroid (as-tuh-royd) A small planet that revolves around the sun. The largest asteroid is only about six hundred miles in diameter. (See asteroid belt.)

asteroid belt A region of the solar system between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt.

astronomical unit The mean distance between the Earth and the sun, about  million miles or  million kilometers. It is often abbreviated as AU.

astronomy The science that deals with the universe beyond the Earth. It describes the nature, position, and motion of the stars, planets, and other objects in the skies, and their relation to the Earth.

astrophysics The branch of astronomy devoted to the study of the physical characteristics and composition of objects in the sky. Typical concerns of astrophysics are how much light the stars give off and the size, mass, and temperature of planets and stars.

Atom. A diagram of a hydrogen atom.

atom A unit of matter; the smallest unit of a chemical element. Each atom consists of a nucleus, which has a positive charge, and a set of electrons that move around the nucleus. (See Bohr atom.)

✥ Atoms link together to form molecules.

atomic clock The most accurate clock available. Time is measured by the movement of electrons in cesium atoms. The standard second is now defined by measurements on an atomic clock.

atomic number The number of protons or electrons normally found in an atom of a given chemical element. The higher the atomic number, the heavier the atom is. In a neutral atom, the number of protons and electrons is the same. (See atomic weight and periodic table of the elements.)

atomic weight The mass of a given atom, measured on a scale in which the hydrogen atom has the weight of one. Because most of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus, and each proton and neutron has an atomic weight near one, the atomic weight is very nearly equal to the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. (See atomic number.)

average A single number that represents a set of numbers. Means, medians, and modes are kinds of averages; usually, however, the term average refers to a mean.

axiom (ak-see-uhm) In mathematics, a statement that is unproved but accepted as a basis for other statements, usually because it seems so obvious.

✥ The term axiomatic is used generally to refer to a statement so obvious that it needs no proof.

axis In geometry, a straight line about which an object may rotate or that divides an object into symmetrical halves.

✥ The axis of the Earth is an imaginary line drawn through the North Pole and the South Pole.

background radiation Low-level radiation at the surface of the Earth that comes from cosmic rays and from small amounts of radioactive materials in rocks and the atmosphere.

Baconian method (bay-koh-nee-uhn) A method of experimentation, created by Francis Bacon in the seventeenth century, that derives its conclusions from observed facts rather than from previous conclusions or theories.

base Any of a number of bitter-tasting, caustic materials. Technically, a material that produces negative ions in solution. A base is the opposite of an acid and has a pH of  to . A given amount of a base added to the same amount of an acid neutralizes the acid;

water and a salt are produced. Alkalis are bases; ammonia is a common base.

beta radiation (bay-tuh) High-energy electrons, carrying a negative charge, that are sent out by some radioactive nuclei. (See alpha radiation and gamma radiation.)

✥ Beta radiation, unlike alpha radiation, has some penetrating power and can pass through clothing and wooden walls.

Big Bang theory In astronomy, a theory according to which the universe began billions of years ago in a single event, similar to an explosion. There is evidence for the Big Bang theory in the observed red shift of distant galaxies, which indicates that they are moving away from the Earth, in the existence of cosmic microwave background, and from other data. The Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe is accepted by most astronomers today.

✥ Scientists have recently found that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up. This effect is attributed to the presence of dark energy.

Big Dipper A constellation in the northern sky. The two stars on the far end of the bowl of the dipper point toward the North Star. The Big Dipper is part of the constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear).

black hole In astronomy, an object so massive that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitation. Black holes were given their name because they absorb all the light that falls on them. The existence of black holes was first predicted by the general theory of relativity. Supermassive black holes have been found in the centers of many galaxies. Stellar black holes are thought to arise from the death of very massive stars. Astronomers expect to find many stellar black holes in the Milky Way.

✥ Figuratively, the term black hole is used to refer to a total disappearance: “They never saw the man again — he might as well have fallen into a black hole.”

blackbody An object that can absorb and send off radiation with complete efficiency — that is, it reflects (see reflection) none of the radiation that falls on it. The higher the object’s temperature, the higher the frequency of the radiation it gives off.

Bohr atom (bawr) The simplest modern picture of the structure of the atom, according to which electrons move in orbits around the nucleus. The electron’s orbits can exist only at certain well-defined distances from the nucleus. When an electron changes orbits, it does so in a sudden quantum leap. The energy difference between the initial and final orbit is emitted by the atom in bundles of electromagnetic radiation called photons.

✥ The Bohr atom is named after the twentieth-cen tury Danish physicist Niels Bohr.

Bohr, Niels (bawr) A Danish physicist of the twentieth century. Bohr was one of the founders of quantum mechanics and the originator of the Bohr atom.

boiling point The temperature at which a given material changes from a liquid to a gas. The boiling point is the same temperature as the condensation point. (See phases of matter.)

✥ Water boils at  degrees Fahrenheit or  degrees Celsius.

British thermal unit (Btu) A unit for measuring heat. One Btu raises the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.

Brownian motion The erratic motion, visible through a microscope, of small grains suspended in a fluid. The motion results from collisions between the grains and atoms or molecules in the fluid.

✥ Brownian motion was first explained by the twentieth-century physicist Albert Einstein, who considered it direct proof of the existence of atoms.

buffer In chemistry, the components of a solution that can neutralize either an acid or a base and thus maintain a constant pH.

✥ Buffers are often used in medications designed to decrease acidity in the stomach.

buoyancy The force that causes objects to float. According to the principle of Archimedes, when a solid is placed in a fluid (a liquid or a gas), it is subject to an upward force equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid it has displaced.

calculus The branch of mathematics, usually studied after algebra, that provides a natural method for describing gradual change.

✥ Most modern sciences use calculus.

Calorie The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. A calorie (with a lower-case c) is a measurement of the heat needed to raise the temperature of a gram of water, rather than a kilogram.

capillary (-uh-ler-ee) A thin tube, such as a blood vessel or a straw, through which fluids flow.

✥ The interaction between the fluid and the vessel walls produces a force that can lift the fluid up into the tube, a phenomenon known as capillary action.

carbon A chemical element; its symbol is C. The carbon nucleus has six protons and six or more neutrons; six electrons are in orbit around the carbon nucleus. (See hydrocarbons and organic molecules.)

✥ Carbon forms the basis for all living tissue.

carbon dioxide $( \mathbf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ A compound made up of molecules containing one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

$\clubsuit$ Carbon dioxide is normally found as a gas that is breathed out by animals and absorbed by green plants. The plants, in turn, return oxygen to the atmosphere. (See carbon cycle and respiration.) ✥ Carbon dioxide is also given off in the burning of fossil fuels (see greenhouse effect).

carbon 14 A radioactive isotope of carbon. A carbon 14 atom contains six protons, six electrons, and eight neutrons. Carbon 14 is produced when neutrons bombard atoms of nitrogen.

✥ Carbon 14 is used in a common form of radioactive dating to determine the age of ancient objects.

carbon monoxide (CO) A compound made up of molecules containing one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.

✥ Carbon monoxide is usually formed when materials burn; it is found, for example, in automobile exhaust. ✥ Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be fatal to human beings if inhaled.

cardinal numbers Numbers that indicate the quantity of things in a group or set, but not the order or arrangement of those things. One, two, and one thousand are cardinal numbers. (Compare ordinal numbers.)

catalyst (kat-uh-list) In chemistry, a substance that causes a chemical reaction to occur but is not itself involved in the reaction.

✥ The term catalyst is often used to refer to the prime agent of any change: “She was the catalyst for the reorganization.”

cc An abbreviation for cubic centimeter — the volume of a cube that has edges one centimeter long.

Celsius (sel-see-uhs) A temperature scale, also called centigrade, according to which water freezes at zero degrees and boils at one hundred degrees.

center of gravity The point in any solid where a single applied force could support it; the point where the mass of the object is equally balanced. The center of gravity is also called the center of mass. When a man on a ladder leans sideways so far that his center of gravity is no longer over his feet, he begins to fall.

centigrade The Celsius temperature scale.

centimeter (sen-tuh-mee-tuhr) A unit of length in the metric system; one-hundredth of a meter, or about two-fifths of an inch.

centrifugal force (sen-trif-yuh-guhl, sen-trif-uhguhl) A force that tends to move objects away from the center in a system undergoing circular motion. Centrifugal force keeps the water in a whirling bucket from spilling or throws a rider in a car against the door when the car goes around a sharp curve. Centrifugal force is actually a form of inertia.

CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) Chemical compounds originally developed for use in refrigeration systems, now used widely in industry. When released into the air, these compounds break down and release chlorine, which causes damage to the Earth’s ozone layer and is responsible for creating the ozone hole.

chain reaction In chemistry and physics, a selfsustaining series of reactions. In a chain reaction in a uranium-based nuclear reactor, for example, a single neutron causes the nucleus of a uranium atom to undergo fission. In the process, two or three more neutrons are released. These neutrons start more fissions, which produce more neutrons, and so on.

✥ Figuratively speaking, any group of events linked so that one is the cause of the next can be called a “chain reaction.”

chaos A new branch of science that deals with systems whose evolution depends very sensitively upon the initial conditions. Turbulent flows of fluids (such as white water in a river) and the prediction of the weather are two areas where chaos theory has been applied with some success.

charge, electrical A fundamental property of matter. Protons and the nuclei of atoms have a positive charge; electrons have a negative charge; neutrons have no charge. Normally, each atom has as many protons as it has electrons and thus has no net electrical charge; in other words, it is neutral. Charged substances have an imbalance of positive and negative charges, a net charge that exerts a force on other charged substances. Charges that are both positive or both negative repel each other; charges that are different attract.

chemical bond Any rearrangement of electrons in two atoms that generates a force, causing the atoms to be bound to each other, forming a molecule. (See covalent bond and ionic bond.)

# chemical element See element.

chemical equilibrium A balanced condition within a system of chemical reactions. When in chemical equilibrium, substances form and break down at the same rate, and the number of molecules of each substance becomes definite and constant.

chemical reaction A process in which atoms of the same or different elements rearrange themselves to form a new substance. While they do so, they either absorb heat or give it off.

chemistry The study of the composition, properties, and reactions of matter, particularly at the level of atoms and molecules.

chlorine (klawr-een, klawr-in) A chemical element, normally a corrosive gas, that is widely used for sterilization and cleaning.

✥ Chlorine is added to drinking water to kill bacteria. ✥ Chlorine in CFCs is believed to be responsible for the ozone hole.

circumference (suhr-kum-fuhr-uhns) The measure of the distance around a circle.

closed universe If there is enough matter in the universe to stop the expansion associated with the big bang, we say that the universe is closed. In a closed universe, the current period of expansion will be followed by a period of contraction (sometimes called the Big Crunch) as the gravitational force pulls matter back in. Searching for matter to “close” the universe is a major task of modern cosmology. (See also dark matter, flat universe, and open universe.)

cobalt  (koh-bawlt) A radioactive isotope produced when neutrons bombard atoms of the element cobalt.

✥ Cobalt  is a common substance used in radiation therapy for cancer.

cohesion The molecular (see molecule) attraction or joining of the surfaces of two pieces of the same substance. (Compare adhesion.)

cold fusion The fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium at room temperature. In  two scientists announced that they had produced cold fusion in their laboratory, an achievement that — if true — would have meant a virtually unlimited cheap energy supply for humanity. When other scientists were unable to reproduce their results, the scientific community concluded that the original experiment had been flawed.

colloid (kol-oyd) A substance made up of particles that are larger than most molecules; these particles do not actually dissolve in substances but stay suspended in them.

✥ Fog, paints, and foam rubber are colloids.

combustion Burning; a chemical reaction that involves the rapid combination of a fuel with oxygen. (See oxidation and spontaneous combustion.)

comet An object that enters the inner solar system, typically in a very elongated orbit around the sun. Material is boiled off from the comet by the heat of the sun, so that a characteristic tail is formed. The path of a comet can be in the form of an ellipse or a hyperbola. If it follows a hyperbolic path, it enters the solar system once and then leaves forever. If its path is an ellipse, it stays in orbit around the sun.

✥ Comets were once believed to be omens, and their appearances in the sky were greatly feared or welcomed. ✥ The most famous comet, Comet Halley (or Halley’s comet), passes close to the Earth roughly every seventy-six years, most recently in .

common denominator A number that will allow fractions with different denominators to be converted into fractions with the same denominator, so that these fractions can be added or subtracted. The fractions can be expressed as whole numbers divided by the common denominator. Thus,  is a common denominator for $1 _ { / 3 }$ and $1 _ { / 4 }$ , since they can be written as $^ 4 / _ { 1 2 }$ and $\%$ , respectively. (See lowest common denominator.)

$\clubsuit$ Figuratively, a common denominator is a common factor in different events: “The common denominator in these crimes is the use of inside knowledge of computer systems.”

compound In chemistry, a substance containing two or more elements in definite proportions.

condensation point The temperature at which a material changes from a gas to a liquid; the same as the boiling point. (See phases of matter.)

conduction Transfer of energy through a medium (for example, heat or electricity through metal) without any apparent change in the medium.

constant A number that appears in equations and formulas and does not vary or change. Examples are Planck’s constant and the speed of light.

constellation An easily recognized group of stars that appear to be located close together in the sky and that form a picture if lines connecting them are imagined. Constellations are usually named after an animal, a character from mythology, or a common object. (See Big Dipper, Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor.)

convection The motion of warm material that rises, cools off, and sinks again, producing a continuous circulation of material and transfer of heat. Some examples of processes involving convection are boiling water, in which heat is transferred from the stove to the air; the circulation of the atmosphere of the Earth, transferring heat from the equator to the North Pole and South Pole; and plate tectonics, in which heat is transferred from the interior of the Earth to its surface.

coordinates A set of numbers, or a single number, that locates a point on a line, on a plane, or in space. If the point is known to be on a given line, only one number is needed to locate it. If the point is known to be on a given plane, two numbers are needed. If the point is known to be located in space, three numbers are needed.

Copernicus, Nicolaus (kuh-pur-ni-kuhs) A Polish cleric and scholar of the sixteenth century. In , Copernicus produced the first workable model of the sun and planets that had the sun at the center. (See Galileo, Ptolemaic universe, and solar system.)

Coriolis effect (kawr-ee-oh-lis) An apparent force ultimately due to the rotation of the Earth. It is the Coriolis effect that makes the air in storms rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.

cosmic microwave background The microwave radiation that arrives at the Earth from every direction in space. The detection of this radiation played an important role in acceptance of the Big Bang theory.

✥ This radiation is sometimes referred to as the “echo” of the Big Bang.

cosmology (koz-mol-uh-jee) The branch of science dealing with the large-scale structure, origins, and development of the universe. (See astronomy and Big Bang theory.)

covalent bond (koh-vay-luhnt) A chemical bond in which two atoms share some of their valence electrons, thereby creating a force that holds the atoms together.

✥ Many molecules in living systems are held together by covalent bonds.

critical mass In physics, the amount of material that must be present before a chain reaction can sustain itself.

✥ The term critical mass is used to refer generally to the minimum amount of something needed to produce a given effect: “The town needs a critical mass of industry to attract more business.”

crystal A material in which the atoms are arranged in a rigid geometrical structure (see geometry) marked by symmetry. Crystals often have clearly visible geometrical shapes.

✥ Most minerals are crystalline structures.

Curie, Marie (kyoor-ee, kyoo-ree) A French chemist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, born in Poland. With her husband, Pierre Curie, she discovered the element radium.

✥ Marie Curie was the first major female scientist of modern times. ✥ Marie Curie was the only person ever to win the Nobel Prize in two different sciences (physics and chemistry).

current, electric The flow of electrical charge, usually electrons. (See Benjamin Franklin.)

cyclotron (seye-kluh-tron) The first kind of particle accelerator built.

✥ Cyclotrons are now used for special research projects.

dark energy An as yet unknown and unidentified form of energy that pervades the universe and produces a force that counteracts the gravitational attraction between galaxies.

✥ Dark energy is thought to be responsible for the accelerating universe.

dark matter Unseen matter that may make up more than ninety percent of the universe. As the name implies, dark matter does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, so it cannot be seen directly, but it can be detected by measuring its gravitational effects. It is believed that dark matter was instrumental in forming galaxies early in the Big Bang.

decibel (des-uh-buhl, des-uh-bel) A unit of measurement of the volume of sounds.

decimal point The point or dot placed to the left of decimals to separate them from the whole number portion of the decimal. When the number is spoken aloud, the word point is usually used to signify the decimal point. For example, $^ { \alpha } 8 . 3 ^ { \gamma }$ is read “eight point three.”

decimals Fractional numbers (see fraction) expressed as whole numbers of tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on. One-half, for example, is . in decimal terms.

degree In geometry, a unit of measurement of angles, $^ 1 / _ { 3 6 0 }$ of a circle. In physics, a unit of temperature (see Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scale). A degree on the Fahrenheit scale is smaller than a degree on the Celsius or Kelvin scale. Degrees on the Celsius and Kelvin scales are the same size.

dehydration The removal of water; in chemistry, the loss of two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom $( s e e \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } )$ .

denominator (di-nom-uh-nay-tuhr) In mathematics, the number that appears on the bottom of a fraction. In the fraction $2 / 3$ , the denominator is . (Compare numerator.)

density The relative heaviness of objects, measured in units of mass or weight per units of volume. (See specific gravity.)

diameter (deye-am-uh-tuhr) A straight line passing through the center of a figure, especially a circle or sphere, and joining two opposite points on its circumference.

diffraction The breaking up of an incoming wave by some sort of geometrical structure — for example, a series of slits — followed by reconstruction of the wave by interference. Diffraction of light is characterized by alternate bands of light and dark or bands of different colors.

diffusion The spreading of atoms or molecules of one substance through those of another, especially into liquids or gases.

distillation In chemistry, the separating of the constituents of a liquid by boiling it and then condensing the vapor that results. Distillation can be used to purify water or other substances, or to remove one component from a complex mixture, as when gasoline is distilled from crude oil or alcohol from a mash. When water is purified by distillation, it is boiled in a container, and the steam is sent into cooling tubes. The steam is condensed and then collected as purified water in a second container. The impurities in the water are left behind in the first container and can be discarded.

✥ Figuratively, “distillation” is the process of retaining the essential features or components of something while removing nonessentials: “This book represents knowledge distilled from decades of research.”

Doppler effect (dop-luhr) A phenomenon observed with waves. The frequency of a wave of light or sound seems higher if the source is moving toward the observer and seems lower if the source is moving away. For example, if an automobile blows its horn as it travels past someone, the apparent pitch of the sound will be higher as it approaches the person and then will grow lower as it passes and moves away.

✥ The red shift of distant galaxies is a result of the Doppler effect on light.

$\scriptstyle { E = m c ^ { 2 } }$ An equation derived by the twentieth-century physicist Albert Einstein, in which $E$ represents units of energy, $m$ represents units of mass, and $c ^ { 2 }$ is the speed of light squared, or multiplied by itself. (See relativity.)

✥ Because the speed of light is a very large number and is multiplied by itself, this equation points out how a small amount of matter can release a huge amount of energy, as in a nuclear reaction.

eclipse In astronomy, the blocking out of light from one object by the intervention of another object. The most dramatic eclipses visible from the Earth are eclipses of the sun (when sunlight is blocked by the moon) and eclipses of the moon (when sunlight on its way to the moon is blocked by the Earth).

✥ The term eclipse is also used to refer to a general decline or temporary obscurity: “After taking the title last year, the team has gone into an eclipse this season.”

Einstein, Albert (eyen-steyen) A twentieth-century physicist; Einstein was born in Germany in $^ { 1 8 7 9 }$ and moved to the United States in the s. Einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity. His equation $E = M { \boldsymbol { C } } ^ { 2 }$ led to the development of nuclear fission and the atomic bomb.

✥ In , a group of scientists, including Edward Teller, received evidence that Germany, then controlled by the Nazis, was planning to build an atomic bomb to use against the United States. These scientists persuaded Einstein to write to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and urge that the United States develop an atomic bomb first. (See Manhattan Project.) ✥ In

Albert Einstein. Einstein writing out the equation for the density of the Milky Way in .

his last years, before his death in , after the atomic bomb had been used in war (see Hiroshima and Nagasaki), Einstein sought to educate the public on how nuclear weapons had changed the world situation. ✥ Einstein believed strongly in the regularity of nature. He said, “God does not play dice with the universe,” and “God is subtle, but he is not malicious.” ✥ It is important to distinguish between the theory of relativity, in which the laws of nature are the same for all observers anywhere in the universe, and the philosophical doctrine of relativism, which holds that there are no absolute truths. The similarity in their names has been a source of confusion.

elasticity The property of a material that allows it to return to its original shape after having been deformed and to exert a force while deformed. (See stress.)

electrical field A quantity proportional to the force that would be exerted on an electrical charge if it were located at a given point. Electrical fields are usually associated with the presence of other electrical charges.

electricity A flow of electrical charges, such as electrons, through a conductor.

Electromagnetic spectrum. An electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths measured in hertz. The hertz frequency ${ _ { 1 0 } } ^ { 6 }$ indicates that six zeros should follow the number one (i.e., ${ _ { 1 0 } } ^ { 6 }$ equals ,, hertz).

electrolysis (i-lek-trol-uh-sis) In chemistry, any process that brings about a chemical reaction by passing electric current through a material.

✥ The most common form of electrolysis is electroplating, in which a thin coat of metal is deposited on a solid object.

electromagnet A magnet created by passing an electric current through coils of wire. Electromagnets are widely used in common electrical systems.

electromagnetic induction Production of an electric current by changing the magnetic field enclosed by an electrical circuit. The most common use of electromagnetic induction is in the electric generator.

# electromagnetic radiation Any type of electromagnetic wave.

electromagnetic spectrum The family of electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic spectrum, starting from the waves with the longest wavelengths (and least energy), consists of radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and gamma radiation. Members of the family differ from one another only in their wavelength, or frequency. For example, the wavelength of blue light is roughly half that of red light, but the waves corresponding to the two colors are otherwise identical.

electromagnetic waves Waves composed of undulating electrical fields and magnetic fields. The different kinds of electromagnetic waves, such as light and radio waves, form the electromagnetic spectrum. All electromagnetic waves have the same speed in a vacuum, a speed expressed by the letter c (the speed of light) and equal to about , miles (or , kilometers) per second.

electron (i-lek-tron) An elementary particle with a negative charge and a very small mass. Electrons are normally found in orbits around the nucleus of an atom. The chemical reactions that an atom undergoes depend primarily on the electrons in the outermost orbits (the valence electrons).

✥ The movement of large numbers of electrons through conductors constitutes an electric current.

electron microscope A device that uses electrons instead of light to form images of very small objects, such as individual parts of small living things.

element In chemistry, any material (such as carbon, hydrogen, iron, or oxygen) that cannot be broken down into more fundamental substances. Each chemical element has a specific type of atom, and chemical compounds are created when atoms of different elements are bound together into molecules. There are  chemical elements whose discovery has been claimed;  occur in nature, and the rest have been produced in laboratories.

elementary particles The particles that make up the atom. The elementary particles include electrons and a large number of particles, including protons and neutrons, that exist inside the nucleus of atoms. Strictly speaking, the term elementary as applied to most of the particles in the nucleus is inaccurate, for scientists now believe that all the particles except electrons are made of still more elementary particles called quarks.

✥ The study of elementary particles is one of the frontiers of modern physics and is associated with the building of particle accelerators.

ellipse (i-lips) In geometry, a curve traced out by a point that is required to move so that the sum of its distances from two fixed points (called foci) remains constant. If the foci are identical with each other, the ellipse is a circle; if the two foci are distinct from each other, the ellipse looks like a squashed or elongated circle.

✥ The orbits of the planets and of many comets are ellipses.

energy In physics, the ability to do work. Objects can have energy by virtue of their motion (kinetic energy), by virtue of their position (potential energy), or by virtue of their mass (se $e E = { M C } ^ { 2 } ,$ ).

✥ The most important property of energy is that it is conserved — that is, the total energy of an isolated system does not change with time. This is known as the law of conservation of energy. Energy can, however, change form; for example, it can be turned into mass and back again into energy.

entropy (en-truh-pee) A measure of the disorder of any system, or of the unavailability of its heat energy for work. One way of stating the second law of thermodynamics — the principle that heat will not flow from a cold to a hot object spontaneously — is to say that the entropy of an isolated system can, at best, remain the same and will increase for most systems. Thus, the overall disorder of an isolated system must increase.

✥ Entropy is often used loosely to refer to the breakdown or disorganization of any system: “The committee meeting did nothing but increase the entropy.” ✥ In the nineteenth century, a popular scientific notion suggested that entropy was gradually increasing, and therefore the universe was running down and eventually all motion would cease. When people realized that this would not happen for billions of years, if it happened at all, concern about this notion generally disappeared.

equation An expression of equality between two formulas in mathematics. The two formulas are written with an equal sign between them: $2 + 2 = 4$ is an equation, as is $\bar { \boldsymbol { E } } = _ { M } \bar { \boldsymbol { C } } ^ { 2 }$ .

equilibrium A condition in which all influences acting cancel each other, so that a static or balanced situation results. In physics, equilibrium results from the cancellation of forces acting on an object. In chemistry, it occurs when chemical reactions are proceeding in such a way that the amount of each substance in a system remains the same. (See chemical equilibrium.)

equinox (ee-kwuh-noks, ek-wuh-noks) The twice yearly times when the lengths of day and night are equal. At equinox, the sun is directly over the Earth’s equator. The vernal equinox occurs about March  and the autumnal equinox about September .

escape velocity The speed an object must reach to escape the pull of gravitation exerted by another object.

$\clubsuit$ To overcome the gravitation of the Earth and place an artificial satellite in orbit, a rocket must reach a speed of about , miles per hour, or about seven miles per second.

ethanol (eth-uh-nawl, eth-uh-nohl) Another name for ethyl alcohol.

ethyl alcohol (eth-uhl) The kind of alcohol made by fermentation of the sugar in grains; the fermentation is brought about by the enzymes in yeast.

✥ Alcoholic drinks and gasohol contain ethyl alcohol.

Euclid (yooh-klid) An ancient Greek mathematician; the founder of the study of geometry. Euclid’s Elements is the basis for modern school textbooks in geometry. One of the basic statements, or postulates, of Euclid’s geometry is that if a line and a point separate from it are given, only one line parallel to the first line can pass through the point.

✥ Albert Einstein used other approaches to geometry to derive the theory of relativity. These “nonEuclidean geometries” deny Euclid’s postulate about parallel lines.

evaporation The changing of a liquid into a gas, often under the influence of heat (as in the boiling of water). (See vaporization.)

✥ The evaporation of water from the oceans is a major component in the hydrologic cycle.

exponent A number placed above and to the right of another number to show that it has been raised to a power. For example, $3 ^ { ^ { 2 } }$ indicates that  has been raised to a power of , or multiplied by itself; $3 ^ { ^ { 2 } }$ is equal to .

exponential growth (ek-spuh-nen-shuhl) Growth of a system in which the amount being added to the system is proportional to the amount already present: the bigger the system is, the greater the increase. (See geometric progression.)

✥ In everyday speech, exponential growth means runaway expansion, such as in population growth.

extrapolation (ik-strap-uh-lay-shuhn) A mathematical procedure designed to enable one to estimate unknown values of a parameter from known values. A common method of extrapolation is to look at data on a curve, then extend the curve into regions for which there is no data. Extrapolation is often used to predict the future.

extraterrestrial (ek-struh-tuh-res-tree-uhl) A descriptive term for things outside the Earth, such as possible civilizations outside the solar system, or objects, such as meteorites, that actually reach the Earth.

Fahrenheit A temperature scale according to which water freezes at  degrees and boils at  degrees. The scale was devised by Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, an instrument maker of the eighteenth century, born in Germany.

Fermi, Enrico (fur-mee, fer-mee) An American physicist of the twentieth century, born in Italy. Fermi built the first nuclear reactor in the s under the stands of a football field at the University of Chicago.

fission, nuclear A nuclear reaction in which a single large nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei. In some cases, for example with uranium, energy is released in this process.

✥ The fission of uranium , an isotope of uranium, supplies energy for nuclear reactors and atomic bombs.

flash point For a given flammable substance, the lowest temperature at which vapors passing from the substance into the air will catch fire spontaneously if a small flame is present.

flat universe If there is just enough matter in the universe for its gravitational force to bring the expansion associated with the big bang to a stop in an infinitely long time, the universe is said to be flat. The flat universe is the dividing line between an open universe and a closed universe.

✥ Most theorists believe that the universe is flat.

fluid In physics, a substance that flows — usually a liquid or a gas.

fluorescence The emission of light from an object as a result of bombardment by other kinds of electromagnetic radiation, such as x-rays or ultraviolet rays. Fluorescent materials may appear one color when bathed in visible light and another color when exposed to other kinds of electromagnetic radiation.

✥ “Black light” depends on fluorescence for its effects.

fluoride (floor-eyed, flawr-eyed) Any of a number of naturally occurring compounds of the element fluorine. Fluorides have been found to be effective in preventing tooth decay and are routinely added to drinking water in most jurisdictions.

focal length The distance between the focal point of a lens (that is, the point at which the lens will focus parallel rays of light) and the lens itself.

force In physics, something that causes a change in the motion of an object. The modern definition of force (an object’s mass multiplied by its acceleration) was given by Isaac Newton in Newton’s laws of motion. The most familiar unit of force is the pound. (See mechanics.)

✥ Gravity, and therefore weight, is a kind of force.

fractal (frak-tuhl) Contraction of “fractional dimension.” This is a term used by mathematicians to describe certain geometrical structures whose shape appears to be the same regardless of the level of magnification used to view them. A standard example is a seacoast, which looks roughly the same whether viewed from a satellite or an airplane, on foot, or under a magnifying glass. Many natural shapes approximate fractals, and they are widely used to produce images in television and movies.

fraction A mathematical expression representing the division of one whole number by another. Usually written as two numbers separated by a horizontal or diagonal line, fractions are also used to indicate a part of a whole number or a ratio between two numbers. Fractions may have a value of less than one, as with $^ { 1 } / _ { 2 }$ , or equal to one, as with $\%$ , or more than one, as with $\%$ . The top number of a fraction is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator.

free fall In physics, the motion of a body being acted upon only by gravity. A satellite in orbit is in free fall, as is a skydiver (if we neglect the effects of air resistance).

✥ During free fall, objects are said to be weightless.

freezing point The temperature at which a liquid changes into a solid; the same temperature as the melting point. (See phases of matter.)

galaxy A large, self-contained mass of stars.

✥ A common form for galaxies is a bright center with spiral arms radiating outward. $\clubsuit$ The universe contains billions of galaxies. $\clubsuit$ The sun belongs to the galaxy called the Milky Way.

frequency In physics, the number of crests of a wave that move past a given point in a given unit of time. The most common unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), corresponding to one crest per second. The frequency of a wave can be calculated by dividing the speed of the wave by the wavelength. Thus, in the electromagnetic spectrum, the wavelengths decrease as the frequencies increase, and vice versa.

friction The resistance of an object to the medium through which or on which it is traveling, such as air, water, or a solid floor.

function In mathematics, a quantity whose value is determined by the value of some other quantity. For example, “The yield of this field is a function of the amount of fertilizer applied” means that a given amount of fertilizer will yield an amount of whatever crop is growing.

fusion, nuclear The combining of two small atomic nuclei to form a larger nucleus, sometimes with the release of energy. (Compare nuclear fission.)

✥ The fusion of hydrogen into helium releases huge amounts of energy and is the main energy source

Galaxy. The Whirlpool Galaxy.

Galileo (gal-uh-lee-oh, gal-uh-lay-oh) An Italian scientist of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries; his full name was Galileo Galilei. Galileo proved that objects with different masses fall at the same velocity. One of the first persons to use a telescope to examine objects in the sky, he saw the moons of Jupiter, the mountains on the moon, and sunspots.

✥ Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church forced Galileo to renounce his belief in the model of the solar system proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus. Galileo had to assert that the Earth stands still, and the sun revolves around it. A famous legend holds that Galileo, after making this public declaration about a motionless Earth, muttered, “Nevertheless, it does move.”

gamma radiation (gam-uh) The most energetic radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum; it has the lowest wavelength and the highest frequency in the spectrum. Gamma rays are sent out by some radioactive nuclei. Unlike alpha radiation and beta ragram The basic unit of measurement for mass in the metric system; one cubic centimeter of water has a mass of approximately one gram.

gas In physics, one of the phases of matter. The atoms or molecules in gases are more widely spaced than in solids or liquids and suffer only occasional collisions with one another.

geometric progression In mathematics, a sequence of numbers in which each number is obtained from the previous one by multiplying by a constant. For example, the sequence , , , , ,  . . . (in which each number is multiplied by  to get the next one) is a geometric progression.

diation, gamma rays are not made up of particles, and they have no charge.

✥ Many processes involving growth and spreading, such as population increases, can be described as geometric progressions.

geometry The branch of mathematics that treats the properties, measurement, and relations of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. (See Euclid and plane geometry.)

Goddard, Robert H. (god-uhrd) An American physicist of the twentieth century. Goddard launched the first liquid-fuel rocket, in .

✥ Goddard’s work helped to pave the way for the American space program.

Grand Unified Theory (GUT) A theory that describes the behavior of matter at temperatures that existed only in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. In these theories, the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces are unified. The greatest triumph of GUTs is that they explain the absence of antimatter in the universe. (See also unified field theory.)

gravitation The force, first described mathematically by Isaac Newton, whereby any two objects in the universe are attracted toward each other. Gravitation holds the moon in orbit around the Earth, the planets in orbit around the sun, and the sun in the Milky Way. It also accounts for the fall of objects released near the surface of the Earth. The modern theory of gravitation is the general theory of relativity.

gravity Another term for gravitation, especially as it affects objects near the surface of the Earth.

$\mathbf { H } _ { 2 } \mathbf { O }$ The chemical symbol for water. Each molecule of water contains two atoms of hydrogen (H) joined to a single atom of oxygen (O).

half-life In physics, a fixed time required for half the radioactive nuclei in a substance to decay. Halflives of radioactive substances can range from fractions of a second to billions of years, and they are always the same for a given nucleus, regardless of temperature or other conditions. If an object contains a pound of a radioactive substance with a half-life of fifty years, at the end of that time there will be half a pound of the radioactive substance left undecayed in the object. After another fifty years, a quarter-pound will be left undecayed, and so on.

✥ Scientists can estimate the age of an object, such as a rock, by carefully measuring the amounts of decayed and undecayed nuclei in the object. Comparing that to the half-life of the nuclei tells when they started to decay and, therefore, how old the object is. (See radioactive dating.)

heat In physics, a form of energy associated with the movement of atoms and molecules in any material. The higher the temperature of a material, the faster the atoms are moving, and hence the greater the amount of energy present as heat. (See infrared radiation.)

heat capacity In physics, the capability of a substance to absorb energy in the form of heat for a given increase in temperature. Materials with high heat capacities, such as water, require greater amounts of heat to increase their temperatures than do substances with low heat capacities, such as metals. (See entropy.)

heavy water Water with a higher average molecular weight than ordinary water. In a molecule of heavy water, the hydrogen atoms are isotopes in which the nuclei each contain a proton and a neutron, and hence are twice as heavy as a normal hydrogen atom.

Heisenberg, Werner (heye-zuhn-burg) A German physicist of the twentieth century. Heisenberg was one of the founders of quantum mechanics, the discoverer of the uncertainty principle, and a leader of Germany’s attempt to construct an atomic bomb in World War II.

# Heisenberg uncertainty principle See uncertainty principle.

helium A chemical element, usually found in the form of a gas, in which two electrons are in orbit, and the nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. Its symbol is He.

$\clubsuit$ Household current in the United States is sixty hertz.

hexagon A polygon having six sides.

horsepower A unit of power equal to about  watts.

✥ The horsepower is used to measure the power of engines. ✥ This term was coined by James Watt, who invented a new type of steam engine in the eighteenth century. Watt found that the horse could do a certain amount of work per second; when he sold his steam engines, this measurement allowed him to estimate the worth of an engine in terms of the number of horses it would replace. Therefore, a six-horsepower engine was capable of replacing six horses.

Hubble, Edwin An American astronomer of the twentieth century. Hubble was the first to show that there are galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He also discovered the red shift, thereby laying the foundation for the Big Bang theory. (See also Hubble Space Telescope.)

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) The first permanent astronomical observatory above the Earth’s atmosphere, HST was designed to provide much more detailed views of the universe than can be obtained from the ground. Since its launch in , it has served as one of the major tools by which astronomers have learned about the universe.

✥ The HST is routinely refurbished and repaired by astronauts, who get to it in the space shuttle.

hydrocarbons Chemical compounds whose main feature is a long chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons are organic molecules.

✥ Many hydrocarbons are used as fuels. Some examples of hydrocarbon fuels are the components of gasoline; methane, which is the main ingredient of natural gas; and some components of wood.

hydrogen The lightest chemical element; its symbol is H. Hydrogen normally consists of a single electron in orbit around a nucleus made up of a single proton. It is usually found as a gas and has several uses as a fuel.

✥ Hydrogen atoms are combined to form helium atoms in fusion reactions in stars and in hydrogen bombs, which release huge amounts of energy. Hydrogen also burns rapidly, producing water as it combines with oxygen (see $_ \mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ and oxidation). ✥ For a time, hydrogen was frequently used to fill blimps and dirigibles because of its extremely low weight. In , however, the hydrogen in the dirigible Hindenburg caught fire, and many of the passengers and crew were killed. Since that time, helium has been widely preferred to hydrogen for use in airships; it is not as buoyant (see buoyancy) or cheap as hydrogen, but, being an inert gas, it does not burn. ✥ Because there is so much hydrogen in stars, it is by far the most abundant element in the universe.

A hypothesis is tested by drawing conclusions from it; if observation and experimentation show a conclusion to be false, the hypothesis must be false. (See scientific method and theory.)

Hz The abbreviation for hertz, a standard unit of frequency.

inertia (i-nur-shuh) In physics, the tendency for objects at rest to remain at rest, and for objects in uniform motion to continue in motion in a straight line, unless acted on by an outside force. (See Newton’s laws of motion.)

interference The disturbance that results when two waves come together at a single point in space; the disturbance is the sum of the contribution of each wave. For example, if two crests of identical waves arrive together, the net disturbance will be twice as large as each incoming wave; if the crest of one wave arrives with the trough of another, there will be no disturbance at all.

✥ One common example of interference is the appearance of dark bands when a light is viewed through a window screen.

isotope (eye-suh-tohp) In physics, different forms of the same element, with nuclei that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes are distinguished from each other by giving the combined number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For example, uranium  is the isotope of uranium that has  protons and neutrons in its nucleus rather than the more commonly occurring . All elements have isotopes.

Completed in , it is the first of a new generation of telescopes in which electronic controls constantly adjust a collection of small mirrors to compensate for atmospheric distortion to produce images of unprecedented clarity.

Kelvin, Lord A British physicist of the nineteenth century. He was one of the founders of the modern science of thermodynamics. His full name was William Thompson, Lord Kelvin. (See Kelvin scale.)

Kelvin scale The standard temperature scale in scientific work, proposed by Lord Kelvin. A degree on the Kelvin scale is the same size as a degree on the Celsius scale, but the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero instead of at the freezing point of water. Thus, on the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is zero degrees, ice melts at about  degrees, and water boils at about  degrees.

✥ Upon receiving a copy of Laplace’s major work, Napoleon Bonaparte observed, “You have written this huge book on the system of the world without once mentioning the author of the universe.” Laplace gave this well-known reply: “Sire, I have no need for that hypothesis.”

latent heat The heat released or absorbed when matter undergoes a change of phase (see phases of matter). If the heat is given off during the change from a liquid to a solid, it is called heat of fusion. If it is given off during the change from a gas to a liquid, it is called heat of vaporization.

Lavoisier, Antoine (luhv-wah-zee-ay, lah-vwah-zyay) A French scientist of the eighteenth century, Lavoisier was one of the founders of modern chemistry. He discovered the role of oxygen in chemical reactions.

line A set of points that have one dimension — length — but no width or height. (See coordinates.)

liquid A phase of matter in which atoms or molecules can move freely while remaining in contact with one another. A liquid takes the shape of its container. (Compare gas and solid.)

litmus (lit-muhs) In chemistry, a kind of paper used to tell whether a solution is an acid or a base. Acids turn blue litmus paper red; bases turn red litmus paper blue. Other testing paper or sophisticated instruments can be used to measure the pH of a solution more precisely.

✥ The term litmus is often used to refer to a general and simple test: “Your vote on this issue is a litmus test of your political philosophy.”

locus plur. loci (loh-seye, loh-keye) In geometry, the set of all points (and only those points) that satisfy certain conditions; these points form a curve or figure. For example, the locus of all points in space one foot from a given point is a sphere having a radius of one foot and having its center at the given point. The locus of all points in a plane one foot from a given point is a circle having a radius of one foot and having its center at the given point.

lowest common denominator The smallest number that can be divided evenly into two other numbers (see common denominator). When fractions with different denominators are added together, their denominators have to be made the same; thus, fractions with denominators of nine and twelve have thirty-six as a lowest common denominator. Seventy-two and  are also common denominators for fractions with denominators of nine and twelve, but thirty-six is the lowest.

$\clubsuit$ The term lowest common denominator is often used to indicate a lowering of quality resulting from a desire to find common ground for many people: “This fall’s TV programming finds the lowest common denominator of taste.”

Mach number (mahk) The speed of an object, measured in multiples of the speed of sound. Thus, an airplane traveling at the speed of sound is said to be at Mach ; at twice the speed of sound, it is said to be at Mach .

✥ The unit is named after Ernst Mach, an Austrian physicist of the nineteenth century.

magnet An object that attracts iron and some other materials. Magnets are said to generate a magnetic field around themselves. Every magnet has two poles, called the north and south poles. Magnetic poles exert forces on each other in such a way that like poles repel and unlike poles attract each other. A compass is a small magnet that is affected by the magnetic field of the Earth in such a way that it points to a magnetic pole of the Earth. (See magnetic field and magnetism.)

magnetic field A magnetic field is said to exist in a region if a force can be exerted on a magnet. If a compass needle is deflected when it is put at a particular location, we say a magnetic field exists at that point, and the strength of the field is measured by the strength of the force of the compass needle. The Earth, the sun, and the Milky Way galaxy all have magnetic fields. All known magnetic fields are caused by the movement of electrical charges. Electrons in orbit in atoms give rise to magnetic fields, so that every atom is, like the Earth, surrounded by a magnetic field. (See magnet and magnetism.)

magnetism A fundamental property of some materials (for example, iron) and electrical currents by which they are capable of exerting a force on magnets. (See electromagnet, magnet, and magnetic field.)

Mars In astronomy, the fourth major planet from the sun. Mars was named after the Roman god of war because of its red color. (See solar system; See under “Mythology and Folklore.”)

✥ Smaller than the Earth, Mars has polar ice caps and a surface that includes red sands. ✥ The Viking space mission, which placed landers on the surface of Mars, did not discover any signs of life. ✥ Mars has been, and remains, the focus of space research by NASA. Voyages to Mars, including multiple landings, are scheduled through the first decade of the twentyfirst century.

mass In physics, the property of matter that measures its resistance to acceleration. Roughly, the mass of an object is a measure of the number of atoms in it. The basic unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram. (See Newton’s laws of motion; compare weight.)

mass spectograph A device that uses electrical or magnetic fields to determine the masses of atoms or molecules in a sample. A beam of ions is passed through the electrical or magnetic field. The field deflects the ions at different angles depending on their masses, thereby breaking the beam into separate, identifiable bands.

mathematical induction A method of proof in which a statement is proved for one step in a process, and it is shown that if the statement holds for that step, it holds for the next.

mathematics The study of numbers, equations, functions, and geometric shapes (see geometry) and their relationships. Some branches of mathematics are characterized by use of strict proofs based on axioms.

Some of its major subdivisions are arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and calculus.

Maxwell, James Clerk A Scottish physicist of the nineteenth century. Maxwell organized the modern study of electricity and magnetism when he wrote down Maxwell’s equations.

Maxwell’s equations Four equations that contain the basic laws governing electricity and magnetism, and thus play a role in the study of electricity and magnetism analogous to that of Newton’s laws of motion in mechanics.

mean In statistics, an average of a group of numbers or data points. With a group of numbers, the mean is obtained by adding them and dividing by the number of numbers in the group. Thus the mean of five, seven, and twelve is eight (twenty-four divided by three). (Compare median and mode.)

mean free path The average distance that an object (usually an atom or molecule) can move before colliding with something.

mechanics The branch of physics that deals with the motion of material objects. The term mechanics generally refers to the motion of large objects, whereas the study of motion at the level of the atom or smaller is the domain of quantum mechanics.

✥ The basic laws of mechanics are Newton’s laws of motion.

median In statistics, the middle value of a set of numbers or data points; half the figures will fall below the median and half above. (See average; compare mean and mode.)

melting point The temperature at which a given material changes from a solid to a liquid, or melts; the same temperature as freezing point. (See phases of matter.)

$\clubsuit$ Ice melts at thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit or zero degrees Celsius.

Mendeleev, Dmitri (men-duh-lay-uhf) A Russian chemist of the nineteenth century. Mendeleev first wrote down the periodic table of the elements.

Mercury In astronomy, the planet closest to the sun, named after the fleet-footed messenger of the Roman gods (see under “Mythology and Folklore”) because of its swift movement in its orbit. Mercury takes only eighty-eight days to go around the sun. (See solar system.)

✥ Mercury is sometimes visible from the Earth as a morning or evening star.

mercury In chemistry, a heavy, silvery metallic element, a liquid at normal temperatures. Mercury expands or contracts rapidly in response to changes in temperature and therefore was once widely used in thermometers.

✥ The term mercury is used figuratively in such expressions as “The mercury’s rising” to mean that the temperature is going up.

meson (mez-on, may-zon) An elementary particle in the atomic nucleus.

meter The basic unit of length in the metric system; it was originally planned so that the circumference of the Earth would be measured at about forty million meters. A meter is . inches. Today, the meter is defined to be the distance light travels in $^ { 1 } / _ { 2 9 9 , 7 9 2 , 4 5 8 }$ seconds.

metric system A system of measurement in which the basic units are the meter, the second, and the kilogram. In this system, the ratios between units of measurement are multiples of ten. For example, a kilogram is a thousand grams, and a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter. Virtually all countries of the world, except the United States, use the metric system. Among scientists, the metric system is called SI — an abbreviation for Système internationale, which is French for “International System.”

microwaves Electromagnetic waves with a wavelength on the order of a few inches. Microwaves are longer than infrared radiation and shorter than radio waves. Microwaves are used extensively for communication, both in satellite television and for the transmission of long-distance telephone signals. In a microwave oven, food is cooked by the heat generated when the water in the food absorbs microwaves.

Milky Way The galaxy to which our sun belongs. ✥ The Milky Way is also the swath of light in the night sky produced by the other stars in the galaxy.

mode In statistics, the most frequently appearing value in a set of numbers or data points. In the numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 4, 9, 6, 8, and 6, the mode is 6, because it appears more often than any of the other figures. (See average; compare mean and median.)

molecular weight (muh-lek-yuh-luhr) The sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in a molecule.

molecule (mol-uh-kyoohl) A combination of two or more atoms held together by a force between them. (See covalent bond and ionic bond.)

momentum In physics, the property or tendency of a moving object to continue moving. For an object moving in a line, the momentum is the mass of the object multiplied by its velocity (linear momentum); thus, a slowly moving, very massive body and a rapidly moving, light body can have the same momentum. (See Newton’s laws of motion.)

✥ Figuratively, momentum can refer to the tendency of a person or group to repeat recent success: “The Bears definitely have momentum after scoring those last two touchdowns.”

moon A natural satellite of a planet; an object that revolves around a planet. The planets vary in the number of their moons; for example, Mercury and Venus have none, the Earth has one, and Jupiter has seventeen or more. The planets’ moons, like the planets themselves, shine by reflected light.

✥ The Earth’s moon is about , miles away and is about , miles in diameter. The volume of the Earth is fifty times that of the moon; the mass of the Earth is about eighty times that of the moon. The moon has no atmosphere, and its gravity is about one-sixth that of the Earth.

Mount Palomar (pal-uh-mahr) The location of an astronomical observatory in California. Inside the observatory is the Hale telescope, which contains a mirror two hundred inches across; for decades, it was the largest telescope in the world and remains productive today.

nebula (neb-yuh-luh) plur. nebulae In astronomy, a hazy patch of light visible in the sky. Some nebulae are clouds of gas within the Milky Way; others are distant galaxies. (See photo, next page.)

Nebula. The Great Nebula in Andromeda — the most distant object in space visible to the naked eye.

necessary condition In mathematics, a condition that must be satisfied for a statement to be true, but that does not in and of itself make it true. For example, a necessary condition to become president of the United States is that a candidate be over thirty-five years of age, but just being over thirty-five does not make one president.

Neptune In astronomy, a major planet, the eighth planet from the sun. Neptune is named for the Roman god of the sea. Neptune is similar in size and composition to Uranus. It is usually visible only through a telescope and was discovered in the s. For a period ending in , Pluto’s orbit took it inside the orbit of neptune. (See solar system; see under “Mythology and Folklore.”)

✥ Some astronomers have suggested that Pluto is not a planet in the usual sense but is an object more like an asteroid, and that Neptune, therefore, is actually the outermost planet.

neutrino (nooh-tree-noh) An electrically neutral particle that is often emitted in the process of radioactive decay of nuclei. Neutrinos are difficult to detect, and their existence was postulated twenty years before the first one was actually discovered in the laboratory. Millions of neutrinos produced by nuclear reactions in the sun pass through your body every second without disturbing any atoms.

neutron An elementary particle without an electrical charge; one of the building blocks of the nucleus of the atom. A neutron has about the same mass as a proton.

neutron star A star about the size of the Earth, made almost entirely of neutrons. It is the end product of the evolution of some stars larger than the sun.

Newton, Isaac An English scientist and mathematician of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Newton made major contributions to the understanding of motion, gravity, and light (see optics). He is said to have discovered the principle of gravity when he saw an apple fall to the ground at the same time that the moon was visible in the sky. He also invented calculus. (See Newton’s laws of motion.)

Newton’s laws of motion The three laws that govern the motion of material objects. They were first written down by Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century and gave rise to a general view of nature known as the clockwork universe. The laws are: () Every object moves in a straight line unless acted upon by a force. () The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force exerted and inversely proportional to the object’s mass. () For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

✥ Until the beginning of the twentieth century, these three laws, together with the laws of thermodynamics and Maxwell’s equations, were thought to explain the entire physical universe.

nitrogen A chemical element that makes up about four-fifths of the atmosphere of the Earth. Its symbol is N.

✥ Like carbon, nitrogen is a necessary element in the tissues of living things.

normal distribution curve In statistics, the theoretical curve that shows how often an experiment will produce a particular result. The curve is symmetrical and bell shaped, showing that trials will usually give a result near the average, but will occasionally deviate by large amounts. The width of the “bell” indicates how much confidence one can have in the result of an experiment — the narrower the bell, the higher the confidence. This curve is also called the Gaussian curve, after the nineteenth-century German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss. (See statistical significance.)

✥ The normal distribution curve is often used in connection with tests in schools. Test designers often find that their results match a normal distribution curve, in which a large number of test takers do moderately well (the middle of the bell); some do worse than average, and some do better (the sloping sides of the bell); and a very small number get very high or very low scores (the rim of the bell).

North Star (Polaris) A star positioned along the line in space that includes the axis of rotation of the Earth. For this reason, the star does not appear to move in the sky, but remains fixed above the North Pole.

✥ Locating the North Star is useful in navigation.

nova (noh-vuh) In astronomy, the appearance of a new star in the sky (nova is Latin for “new”). Novae are usually associated with the last stages in the life of a star. (See supernova.)

nuclear energy Energy obtained from nuclear reactions.

nuclear reaction A reaction that changes the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. There are several kinds of nuclear reactions, including the fragmentation of large nuclei into smaller ones (nuclear fission), the building up of small nuclei into larger ones (nuclear fusion), and changes begun by collisions with elementary particles or other nuclei (as in particle accelerators).

nuclear winter A theory first put forward in  predicting that a large-scale nuclear exchange would produce enough smoke and soot to lower the temperature of the Earth significantly. Subsequent calculations indicated that the climatic effects would be much less than had originally been claimed, leading to the use of the term nuclear autumn to describe the phenomenon.

nucleus plur. nuclei (nooh-klee-eye) The small, dense center of the atom. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons and has a positive electrical charge.

✥ Nuclear physics deals with the composition and structure of the nucleus.

Oppenheimer, J. Robert (op-uhn-heye-muhr) An American physicist of the twentieth century. Oppenheimer led the research and development of the atomic bomb and was head of the Manhattan Project.

$\clubsuit$ In the early s, Oppenheimer’s opposition to building the hydrogen bomb and his past association with leftists led to a hearing regarding his security clearance. Although the committee found that he was a “loyal citizen,” his security clearance was not restored, and he was barred from government research. Oppenheimer’s chief opponent in the scientific community at this time was Edward Teller.

optics The branch of physics dealing with light. (See electromagnetic waves, laser, lens, reflection, and refraction.)

orbit In astronomy, the path followed by an object revolving around another object, under the influence of gravitation (see satellite). In physics, the path followed by an electron within an atom. The planets follow elliptical orbits around the sun (see ellipse).

$\clubsuit$ Informally, something is “in orbit” when its actions are controlled by an external agency or force: “The countries of eastern Europe were once in the orbit of the Soviet Union.”

order of magnitude A rough measure of the size, or magnitude, of something, expressed as a power of ten: “The mass of the Earth is of the order of magnitude of ${ 1 0 } ^ { 2 4 }$ kilograms.” Also, the range of values that such a rough statement applies to.

ordinal numbers Numbers that indicate the order or position of something in a group or set, such as first, second, or fifteenth. (Compare cardinal numbers.)

organic chemistry The branch of chemistry dealing with organic molecules.

organic molecule A molecule of the kind normally found in living systems. Organic molecules are usually composed of carbon atoms in rings or long chains, to which are attached other atoms of such elements as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.

osmosis (ahz-moh-sis, ahs-moh-sis) The seeping of a fluid through a seemingly solid barrier, such as a cell wall or a rubber sheet. When the concentration of the fluid is the same on both sides of the barrier, osmosis stops.

$\clubsuit$ Informally, “osmosis” is the process by which information or concepts come to a person without conscious effort: “Living in Paris, he learned French slang by osmosis.”

oxidation Any chemical reaction in which a material gives up electrons, as when the material combines with oxygen. Burning is an example of rapid oxidation; rusting is an example of slow oxidation. (See combustion and reduction.)

oxygen An element, normally a gas, that makes up about one-fifth of the atmosphere of the Earth. Oxygen is usually found as a molecule made up of two atoms. Its symbol is O.

✥ When we breathe in oxygen, it is carried by the hemoglobin in our blood throughout the body, where it is used to generate energy by oxidation. (See respiration.) ✥ Oxygen is a waste product of green plants and photosynthesis.

parabola (puh-rab-uh-luh) A geometrical shape (see geometry) consisting of a single bend and two lines going off to an infinite distance.

✥ An object that is propelled away from the Earth and then drawn back by gravity, such as a fly ball in baseball, follows a path shaped like a parabola.

parameter (puh-ram-uh-tuhr) A quantity or number on which some other quantity or number depends. An informal example is, “Depending on the traffic, it takes me between twenty minutes and an hour to drive to work”; here, “traffic” is the parameter that determines the time it takes to get to work. In statistics, a parameter is an unknown characteristic of a population — for example, the number of women in a particular precinct who will vote Democratic. ✥ The term is often mistakenly used to refer to the limits of possible values a variable can have because of confusion with the word perimeter.

particle accelerator A machine (sometimes called an “atom smasher”), often very large, that brings elementary particles (usually either protons or electrons) to a very high speed and then allows them to collide with a target. From the resulting behavior of the particles and the target, scientists deduce the structure of the particles.

✥ Almost all of our knowledge of the nucleus and of elementary particles depends on experiments using particle accelerators.

particle physics The branch of science devoted to the study of the basic constituents of matter, particularly the constituents of the atomic nucleus.

Pauling, Linus (paw-ling) An American physicist of the twentieth century. Pauling has won the Nobel Prize for both chemistry (for research into the forces that hold molecules together) and peace (for his opposition to the testing of nuclear weapons). Later in life, he advocated the use of large amounts of vitamin C to prevent sickness.

periodic table of the elements A chart of the chemical elements that displays them in rows horizontally in order of increasing atomic number and vertically according to similarity of the chemical properties of their atoms. (See chart, next page.) The position of an element on the table thus gives useful information about the structure and chemical properties of the element. (See Dimitri Mendeleev.)

pH (pee-aych) In chemistry, a measure of the strength of an acid or a base. A neutral solution has a $\mathrm { p H }$ of ; acids a $\mathrm { p H }$ between  and ; bases a $\mathrm { p H }$ from  to . Specially treated strips of paper (see litmus), or more precise instruments, may be used to measure pH.

phases of matter The states in which matter can exist: as a solid, liquid, or gas. When temperature changes, matter can undergo a phase change, shifting from one form to another. Examples of phase changes are melting (changing from a solid to a liquid), freezing (changing from a liquid to a solid), evaporation (changing from a liquid to a gas), and condensation (changing from a gas to a liquid). (See boiling point, condensation point, freezing point, melting point, triple point, and vaporization.)

Planck, Max (plahngk, plangk) A German physicist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Planck was one of the founders of quantum mechanics. (See Planck’s constant.)

Planck’s constant A universal constant, first discovered by Max Planck, that states the mathematical relationship between the frequency of an electromagnetic wave and the energy in that wave. Planck’s discovery unifies the seemingly contradictory observations that energy sometimes acts like a wave and at other times acts as if it is made up of particles.

✥ Knowing Planck’s constant sets the scale of energy for events in which the atom and subatomic particles take part.

plane A geometrical location having only two dimensions — length and width (no height). (See coordinates and plane geometry.)

plane geometry The study of two-dimensional figures (figures that are confined to a plane).

$\clubsuit$ Plane geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. ✥ The Greek mathematician Euclid was the first to study plane geometry carefully. His book Elements was the standard plane geometry textbook for centuries.

planet An object in orbit around a star. A planet does not give off its own light; rather, it shines by reflecting sunlight. Planets close to the sun are rocky. Those farther out consist mostly of gases and liquids. ✥ There are nine major planets, including the Earth, in orbit around our sun, along with many asteroids. (See solar system.) ✥ Scientists have discovered evidence for the existence of many planets that circle other stars.

plasma (plaz-muh) A state of matter in which some or all of the electrons have been torn from their parent atoms. The negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions move independently.

✥ Plasmas are usually associated with very high temperatures — most of the sun is a plasma, for example.

# Periodic Table

Pluto In astronomy, the smallest of the major planets, usually ninth from the sun. Pluto was discovered in  and is named for the Roman god of the underworld. (See solar system)

✥ Astronomers in the late nineteenth century, thinking they saw disturbances in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, suspected that there was a ninth planet, not yet discovered, exerting gravitation on the other two. In the early twentieth century, astronomers searched for that planet and found Pluto. Ironically, Pluto is much too small to be the planet they sought. ✥ Pluto’s orbit is a stretched ellipse, unlike the orbits of the other major planets, which are nearly circular. As a result, for a period ending in , Pluto was actually closer to the sun than Neptune. ✥ There is some debate among astronomers as to whether Pluto should really be classified as a planet or should instead be considered a large asteroid-like body.

plutonium (plooh-toh-nee-uhm) A radioactive chemical element that is artificially derived from uranium.

✥ Plutonium is used in nuclear reactors.

# Periodic Table

polarization The direction in which the electrical field of an electromagnetic wave points.

✥ Reflected light, such as the light that produces glare on a sunny day, is polarized so that the electrical field is parallel to the ground. Some sunglasses are designed to take advantage of this property by blocking out that particular polarization while allowing other light to come through.

✥ Positrons are found in collisions initiated by cosmic rays.

potential energy The energy an object has because of its position, rather than its motion. An object held in a person’s hand has potential energy, which turns to kinetic energy — the energy of motion — when the person lets it go, and it drops to the ground.

power In physics, the amount of energy put out or produced in a given amount of time. Power is often measured in watts or kilowatts.

In mathematics, a power is a number multiplied by itself the number of times signified by an exponent placed to the right and above it. Thus, $3 ^ { ^ { 2 } }$ , which means $3 \times 3$ , is a power — the second power of three, or three squared, or nine. The expression ${ 1 0 } ^ { 6 }$ , or ten to the sixth power, means $1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1 0 \times 1 0$ , or one million.

precipitate (pri-sip-uh-tayt, pri-sip-uh-tuht) In chemistry, a solid material that is formed in a solution by chemical reactions and settles to the bottom of the container in which the reaction takes place. A precipitate may also be a substance removed from another by an artificial filter.

pressure The force exerted on a given area. (See atmospheric pressure.)

✥ The most familiar measure of pressure is psi (pounds per square inch), used to rate pressure in automobile and bicycle tires.

prime number A number that cannot be divided evenly by any other number except itself and the number one; , , , , and  are prime numbers.

prism (priz-uhm) A solid figure in geometry with bases or ends of the same size and shape and sides that have parallel edges. Also, an object that has this shape.

✥ A prism of glass (or a similar transparent material) can be used to bend different wavelengths of light by different amounts through refraction. This bending separates a beam of white light into a spectrum of colored light.

probability A number between zero and one that shows how likely a certain event is. Usually, probability is expressed as a ratio: the number of experimental results that would produce the event divided by the number of experimental results considered possible. Thus, the probability of drawing the ten of clubs from an ordinary deck of cards is one in fifty-two (:), or one fifty-second.

proton (proh-ton) An elementary particle with a positive charge, found in the nucleus of an atom.

✥ A proton is over a thousand times heavier than an electron. ✥ Protons and neutrons make up most of an atom’s mass.

Ptolemaic universe (tol-uh-may-ik) The model for the universe, put forth by the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy, that had the Earth at the center, with the sun, moon, planets, and stars revolving around it.

✥ The Ptolemaic system prevailed in astronomy for nearly fifteen hundred years, until the model of the solar system proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus (with the sun, not the Earth, at the center) was accepted. Church authorities forced Galileo to declare belief in the Earth-centered universe.

Ptolemy (tol-uh-mee) An ancient Greek astronomer, living in Egypt, who proposed a way of calculating the movements of the planets on the assumption that they, along with the sun and the stars, revolved around the Earth. (See Ptolemaic universe.)

pulsar (pul-sahr) A rapidly rotating neutron star. The radiation from such a star appears to come in a series of regular pulses (one per revolution), which explains the name.

Pythagorean theorem (puh-thag-uh-ree-uhn, peyethag-uh-ree-uhn) The theorem in geometry that, in a triangle with one right angle, usually called a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

✥ The theorem is often expressed $a ^ { 2 } + b ^ { 2 } = c ^ { 2 } .$ . ✥ The simplest whole number expression of this theorem is called the , ,  triangle. In a right triangle, if one side measures three units, and the second side measures four units, the hypotenuse must measure five units because $3 ^ { ^ { 2 } } + 4 ^ { ^ { 2 } } = 5 ^ { ^ { 2 } }$ ; that is, $9 + 1 6 = 2 5$ .

quanta (kwahn-tuh) sing. quantum In physics, discrete bundles in which radiation and other forms of energy occur. For example, in the Bohr atom, light is sent out in quanta called photons. (See quantum mechanics.)

quantum leap In physics, the movement of an electron from one orbit in an atom to another, sending out or taking on a photon in the process. (See Bohr atom.)

✥ Informally, a “quantum leap” may be any great, sudden, or discontinuous change.

quantum mechanics The branch of physics that deals with the behavior of matter at the level of the atom, the nucleus, and the elementary particle. At this level, energy, mass, momentum, and other quantities do not vary continuously, as they do in the largescale world, but come in discrete units, or quanta. (See Bohr atom and photon.)

quarks (kwahrks, kwawrks) In physics, the elementary particles that make up the protons and neutrons that in turn make up the atomic nucleus. Quarks are the most basic known constituent of matter. (See antimatter.)

✥ No quarks have been seen in the laboratory because, according to current theory, they cannot exist as free particles.

quasars (kway-zahrz) The most distant galaxies seen from the Earth, believed to be the first stage in the evolution of galaxies. The name is short for “quasistellar radio source.”

rad An acronym for radiation absorbed dose. A unit of energy absorbed from ionizing radiation.

radiation Energy sent out in the form of particles or waves. (See alpha radiation, beta radiation, blackbody, cosmic rays, electromagnetic radiation, fluorescence, gamma radiation, photon, and quanta.)

radiation damage The damage caused by the removal of atoms from a solid material when elementary particles, such as those associated with cosmic rays or radioactivity, collide with it.

✥ Radiation damage is an important consideration in the design of nuclear reactors, where radiation levels are high. ✥ Radiation damage is one of the devastating effects of nuclear weapons.

radical In chemistry, an atom or group of atoms that has at least one electron free to participate in forming a chemical bond.

✥ In general, radicals are associated with chemical reactions that proceed rapidly.

radio waves Waves at the end of the electromagnetic spectrum with the lowest frequency (less than  megahertz) and the longest wavelength (from a few feet to many miles). Because of their low frequency, radio waves carry very little energy compared to other electromagnetic waves. (See Planck’s constant.)

✥ Radio waves can pass through the atmosphere and therefore are very useful for communication. Commercial, short-wave, and citizens’ band radio are broadcast with radio waves, as is television.

radioactive A descriptive term for a material made up of atoms in which radioactivity occurs.

radioactivity The emission of elementary particles by some atoms when their unstable nuclei disintegrate (see half-life). Materials composed of such atoms are radioactive. (See alpha radiation, beta radiation, and gamma radiation.)

ratio (ray-shee-oh, ray-shoh) An expression of the relative size of two numbers by showing one divided by the other.

reciprocal The number by which a given number must be multiplied to get a result of one. The reciprocal of one-half, for example, is two.

red shift In physics, the reddening of light sent out by an object that is moving away from an observer. (See Doppler effect.)

✥ The red shift that can be observed in light from distant galaxies suggests that the universe is expanding, and thus supports the Big Bang theory.

reduction Any chemical reaction in which the atoms in a material take on electrons.

✥ Reduction is the opposite of oxidation.

reflection A bouncing of light off a surface. People see themselves in mirrors through reflection. (Compare refraction.)

refraction A change of direction that light undergoes when it enters a medium with a different density from the one through which it has been traveling — for example, when, after moving through air, it passes through a prism. (Compare reflection.)

✥ Lenses and other optical instruments work through refraction of light.

relativity A theory concerning time, space, and the motion of objects, proposed first in  by Albert Einstein in his special theory of relativity.

The “special theory of relativity” is based on the principle of special relativity, which states that all observers moving at constant velocities with respect to each other should find the same laws of nature operating in their frames of reference. It follows from this principle that the speed of light would have to appear to be the same to every observer. The theory predicts that moving clocks will appear to run slower than stationary ones (see time dilation), that moving objects will appear shorter and heavier than stationary ones, and that energy and mass are equivalent (see $E = M { \cal C } ^ { 2 }$ ). There is abundant experimental confirmation of these predictions.

The general theory of relativity is the modern theory of gravitation, proposed in , also by Albert Einstein. The central point of the theory is the principle of general relativity, which states that all observers, regardless of their state of motion, will see the same laws of physics operating in the universe. The most famous prediction of the theory is that light rays passing near the sun will be bent — a prediction that has been well verified.

✥ The special and general theories of relativity have had important implications for thought in general. They show that no frame of reference for observation of nature is more correct than any other. ✥ It is important to distinguish between the theory of relativity, in which the laws of nature are the same for all observers anywhere in the universe, and the philosophical doctrine of relativism, which holds that there are no absolute truths. The similarity in their names has been a source of confusion.

rem An acronym for roentgen equivalent man. A unit of absorbed doses of radiation.

✥ A normal medical x-ray delivers about . rem; a fatal dose of radiation is several thousand rem.

right angle An angle measuring ninety degrees, formed by the intersection of two perpendicular lines. (Compare acute angle and obtuse angle.)

right triangle A triangle that contains a right angle.

satellite In astronomy, an object, whether natural (such as the moon) or artificial (such as a weather observation satellite), that revolves around a central body. (See under “World Politics.”)

Saturn In astronomy, the second-largest major planet, sixth from the sun. Saturn was named for the Roman god of agriculture. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed largely of gases and liquids. Saturn is the most distant planet plainly visible to the naked eye. (See solar system; see under “Mythology and Folklore.” )

✥ Saturn, often called the most beautiful planet, is known for the rings that encircle it.

scale A system of marks set at fixed intervals, used as a standard for measurement.

✥ On a map, plan, or chart, a scale indicates the proportion between the representation and what it represents, such as the legend “One inch equals twenty miles” on a map. ✥ Temperature scales divide up the range of temperatures into equal degrees.

gress. The method consists of the following steps: () Careful observations of nature. () Deduction of natural laws. () Formation of hypotheses — generalizations of those laws to previously unobserved phenomena. () Experimental or observational testing of the validity of the predictions thus made. Actually, scientific discoveries rarely occur in this idealized, wholly rational, and orderly fashion.

SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) (set-ee) A program devoted to the search for signals from other parts of the galaxy that would indicate the presence of advanced technological civilizations. Over the years, it has sometimes been funded by NASA, sometimes by private organizations.

✥ SETI involves scanning radio waves for signals, but it has found none to date.

solar system The region of the universe near the sun that includes the sun, the nine known major planets and their moons or satellites, and objects such as asteroids and comets that travel in independent orbits. The major planets, in order of their average distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

solstice (sol-stuhs, sohl-stuhs) The two occasions each year when the position of the sun at a given time of day does not seem to change direction. In the Northern Hemisphere, the summer solstice occurs around June  and is the longest day of the year. The sun stops getting higher in the sky, and the days begin to grow shorter. The winter solstice, which occurs around December , is the shortest day. The sun stops getting lower in the sky, and the days begin to grow longer.

solution In chemistry, a uniform mixture of one solid, liquid, or gas with another solid, liquid, or gas.

space-time The four-dimensional continuum in which all objects are located and all events occur, viewed as a single and continuous framework for existence. Space-time consists of length, width, depth, and time.

specific gravity The mass of a substance, given as a multiple of the mass of the same volume of a standard substance (usually water). The specific gravity of aluminum is .; hence, a cubic foot of aluminum weighs . times as much as a cubic foot of water.

specific heat The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius, or to raise the temperature of one pound of a substance by one degree Fahrenheit.

spectroscopy (spek-tros-kuh-pee) The branch of science devoted to discovering the chemical composition of materials by looking at the light (and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation) they emit. Scientists use spectroscopy to determine the nature of distant stars and galaxies as well as to identify and monitor the production of products in factories.

spectrum The range of wavelengths characteristic of a specific type of radiation.

✥ The spectrum making up visible light contains light in the colors violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, with violet having the shortest wavelength and highest frequency, and red having the longest wavelength and lowest frequency.

speed of light The distance light can travel in a unit of time through a given substance. Light travels through a vacuum at about , miles, or $^ { 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 }$ kilometers, per second. (See $E = M { \cal C } ^ { 2 }$ , electromagnetic waves, relativity, and twin paradox.)

✥ A light year, or the distance light can travel in a year, is over five trillion miles. ✥ Light from the sun takes about eight minutes to reach the Earth. ✥ Light from the moon, and other electromagnetic radiation from the moon, takes about a second and a half to reach the Earth. In conversations between astronauts on the moon and their ground crews, there are lapses of about three seconds between exchanges, because of the time it takes for radio waves to make a round trip between the Earth and the moon. ✥ The special theory of relativity states that the speed of light as measured by all observers is the same.

spontaneous combustion A process by which a collection of materials (such as oily rags) catches fire without the application of heat from outside. The oxidation of substances in the materials starts the fire.

square (of a number) A number multiplied by itself, or raised to the second power. The square of three is nine; the square of nine is eighty-one.

square root A number that, when multiplied by itself, will result in a given number. The square root of four is two; the square root of one hundred is ten.

✥ The square roots of many numbers, such as three, are irrational numbers.

standard deviation In statistics, a measure of how much the data in a certain collection are scattered around the mean. A low standard deviation means that the data are tightly clustered; a high standard deviation means that they are widely scattered.

$\clubsuit$ About sixty-eight percent of the data are within one standard deviation of the mean.

standard model The best theory of the ultimate nature of matter available today. In this theory, all matter is made from quarks and leptons. Particles interact with each other through the medium of the strong force, the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the gravitational force. At high temperature, the theory sees the first three of these forces as an example of a single unified force. ✥ The standard model is a unified field theory. ✥ The standard model describes the early evolution of the big bang.

star An object in the sky that sends out its own light, generated by nuclear reactions in its center. There are many billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.

✥ Our own sun is a medium-sized star. ✥ Each star has a definite lifetime and dies when it uses up its supply of fuel. (See black hole, neutron star, supernova, and white dwarf.) ✥ All chemical elements heavier than helium are created in the center of stars and are returned to space when the star dies. ✥ New stars are forming constantly.

static electricity An electrical charge that accumulates on an object when it is rubbed against another object — for example, the spark that jumps from someone’s hand to a doorknob after the person has walked across a rug.

statistical significance In statistics, a number that expresses the probability that the result of a given experiment or study could have occurred purely by chance. This number can be a margin of error (“The results of this public opinion poll are accurate to five percent”), or it can indicate a confidence level (“If this experiment were repeated, there is a probability of ninety-five percent that our conclusions would be substantiated”).

statistics The branch of mathematics dealing with numerical data. (See mean, median, mode, normal distribution curve, sample, standard deviation, and statistical significance.)

✥ A particular problem of statistics is estimating true values of parameters from a sample of data.

stress In physics, the internal resistance of an object to an external force that tends to deform it.

string theory In physics, a theory that views subatomic particles as string-like objects floating in space-time rather than as point-like objects. Spacetime in string theory can have up to nine dimensions of space, plus the dimension of time.

strong force In physics, the force that holds particles together in the atomic nucleus and the force that holds quarks together in elementary particles.

✥ As the name implies, this is the strongest force known in nature.

subatomic A descriptive term for objects and events within the atom.

subatomic particles See elementary particles.

sublimation (sub-luh-may-shuhn) In chemistry, the direct conversion of a solid into a gas, without passage through a liquid stage. (See phases of matter.)

sufficient condition In mathematics, a condition that must be satisfied for a statement to be true and without which the statement cannot be true. For example, although no one can run for president of the United States unless he or she is thirty-five or older, simply being thirty-five is not a sufficient condition to be president. (Compare necessary condition.)

sun The star around which the Earth revolves.

✥ The sun is about . billion years old and is expected to remain in its present state for approximately another six billion years; it will eventually evolve into a white dwarf.

sunspots Dark spots on the surface of the sun caused by magnetic storms.

✥ The number of sunspots goes through a maximum and minimum about every eleven years. During periods of maximum sunspots, the elementary particles associated with the spots cause disturbances in the atmosphere of the Earth and interfere with radio and television communication.

superconductivity (sooh-puhr-kon-duk-tiv-uh-tee) A property of materials by which their electrical resistance goes to zero, and they acquire the ability to carry electric current with no losses whatsoever.

✥ Formerly, materials showed superconductivity only near absolute zero, but new materials have been found that are superconducting at much higher temperatures.

supernova (sooh-puhr-noh-vuh) A large star in its death throes that suddenly explodes, increasing many thousands of times in brightness.

✥ Most heavy elements are created by nuclear reactions in supernovas and then returned to space. ✥ In $^ { 1 9 8 7 }$ , a supernova was sighted near the Milky Way galaxy. This supernova provided astronomers with a unique opportunity to test the theories of the structure of stars.

surface tension The force exerted along the surface of a fluid that causes it to “bead up” and form into drops. Water has high surface tension and beads up easily; alcohol has low surface tension and does not often show droplets.

symmetry In geometry, the equivalence, point for point, of a figure on opposite sides of a point, line, or plane.

telescope A device used by astronomers to magnify images or collect more light from distant objects by gathering and concentrating radiation. The most familiar kind of telescope is the optical telescope, which collects radiation in the form of visible light. It may work by reflection, with a bowl-shaped mirror at its base, or by refraction, with a system of lenses. Other kinds of telescopes collect other kinds of radiation; there are radio telescopes (which collect radio waves), x-ray telescopes, and infrared telescopes. Radio and optical telescopes may be situated on the Earth, since the Earth’s atmosphere allows light and radio waves through but absorbs radiation from several other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. X-ray telescopes are placed in space.

Teller, Edward An American physicist of the twentieth century, born in Hungary.

✥ Teller is known for his research on nuclear fission and fusion and for his firm support for development of nuclear weapons in the United States. (See Albert Einstein.) $\clubsuit$ Teller is called the father of the hydrogen bomb.

theory In science, an explanation or model that covers a substantial group of occurrences in nature and has been confirmed by a substantial number of experiments and observations. A theory is more general and better verified than a hypothesis. (See Big Bang theory, evolution, and relativity.)

thermal equilibrium In physics and chemistry, a condition in which all parts of a system are at the same temperature.

thermodynamics The branch of physics devoted to the study of heat and related phenomena. The behavior of heat is governed by the three laws of thermodynamics: () The total energy of an isolated system cannot change; this is the law of conservation of energy. () Heat will not flow from a cold to a hot object spontaneously (see entropy). () It is impossible, in a finite number of operations, to produce a temperature of absolute zero.

✥ All thermodynamic properties of matter can be understood in terms of the motion of atoms and molecules.

thermonuclear reaction A reaction between nuclei, usually fusion, which releases very large amounts of energy.

time dilation In physics, the apparent slowing down of moving clocks that is predicted by the special theory of relativity. Time dilation is well verified experimentally.

titration (teye-tray-shuhn) In chemistry, the determination of what materials are present in a sample by adding precise amounts of known chemicals and observing the chemical reaction.

✥ The term titration is occasionally used informally to suggest extreme precision in some sort of measurement or determination.

tomography (tuh-mog-ruh-fee) A procedure by which waves are sent through an object and computers produce images of cross sections of the object by using information on how the waves are changed. Both ultrasound and CAT scans are medical uses of this technique, but it is also widely used in science and industry.

trapezoid (trap-uh-zoyd) A four-sided polygon in which two sides are parallel and two are not.

triple point In physics, the temperature at which all three phases of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) for a given substance can coexist.

✥ The triple point for water is a little above the freezing point, and is used to define temperature scales.

twin paradox An effect predicted by the general theory of relativity: if one of a pair of twins remains on Earth, and the other travels in a rocket at a speed near the speed of light, the traveling twin will be younger than the earthbound twin upon returning to Earth. This effect has been verified experimentally by measurements with atomic clocks.

UFO (yooh-ef-oh) The abbreviation for unidentified flying object. Sometimes referred to colloquially as “flying saucers.” Most UFO sightings have prosaic explanations; there is no hard evidence that extraterrestrial beings are visiting Earth.

ultraviolet radiation Radiation in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum where wavelengths are just shorter than those of ordinary, visible violet light but longer than those of x-rays.

✥ Like infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation can be detected with special instruments or films. Sunburn is caused by ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer of the atmosphere of the Earth blocks most of the potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation.

uncertainty principle The statement in quantum mechanics, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, that it is impossible to measure two properties of a quantum object, such as its position and momentum (or energy and time), simultaneously with infinite precision.

unified field theory Any theory in which two seemingly different forces are seen to be fundamentally identical. Maxwell’s equations express a unified field theory that demonstrates the basic identity of electricity and magnetism, and the standard model postulates a basic identity for the strong force, the weak force, and electromagnetism.

uranium A chemical element that is naturally radioactive. An isotope of uranium, uranium , is the main fuel for nuclear reactors and atomic bombs. Its symbol is U. (See fission and chain reaction.)

Uranus (yoor-uh-nuhs, yoo-ray-nuhs) In astronomy, the seventh major planet from the sun, named for the Greek god of the sky. Uranus was the first planet discovered in modern times (). (See solar system.)

Ursa Major (ur-suh) A constellation; the Great Bear. (See Big Dipper.)

Ursa Minor The Little Bear or Little Dipper; the constellation that contains the North Star (Polaris).

vacuum The absence of matter.

✥ In the natural world, air will flow into regions of vacuum, giving rise to the saying “Nature abhors a vacuum.” ✥ The saying is extended informally: in politics, a lack of leadership may be referred to as a vacuum, which will presumably be filled by others rushing in.

valence (vay-luhns) A number characterizing an atom, equal to the number of valence electrons.

valence electrons In chemistry, those electrons found in orbits farthest from the nucleus of the atom. These electrons determine the way in which the atom will combine with other atoms, and thus determine its chemical properties.

vapor pressure In physics and chemistry, the atmospheric pressure that would be exerted by any single component of a gas if that component were the only one present. For example, the vapor pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere of the Earth is the pressure that would exist if everything but oxygen were removed. The total atmospheric pressure is the sum of the vapor pressures of all the materials in the atmosphere.

vaporization In physics and chemistry, the conversion of a solid or a liquid into a gas. (See boiling point, phases of matter, and sublimation.)

vector In physics and mathematics, any quantity with both a magnitude and a direction. For example, velocity is a vector because it describes both how fast something is moving and in what direction it is moving. Because velocity is a vector, other quantities in which velocity is a factor, such as acceleration and momentum, are vectors also.

velocity The vector giving the speed and direction of motion of any object.

Venus In astronomy, the second major planet from the sun, named for the Roman goddess of love. The surface of Venus is very hot and covered with clouds. Spacecraft from the former Soviet Union landed on Venus and survived long enough to send back photographs and measurements. (See solar system; see under “Mythology and Folklore.”)

✥ Venus is seen from the Earth as a bright morning or evening star — occasionally bright enough to cast a shadow.

viscosity (vis-kos-uh-tee) The internal friction of a fluid, produced by the movement of its molecules against each other. Viscosity causes the fluid to resist flowing.

Wave. A diagram of a sound wave.

of as a disturbance moving through a medium. Waves are characterized by wavelength, frequency, and the speed at which they move. Waves are found in many forms.

✥ The motion of a wave and the motion of the medium on which the wave moves are not the same: ocean waves, for example, move toward the beach, but the water itself merely moves up and down. Sound waves are spread by alternating compression and expansion of air.

wavelength The distance between crests (or troughs) of a wave.

wave-particle duality In quantum mechanics, the condition that allows every quantum to appear like a wave in some experiments and like an elementary particle in others.

weak force One of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is involved primarily in the phenomenon of radioactivity. (See standard model and strong force.)

weight The force exerted on any object by gravity.

white dwarf A kind of star about the size of the Earth. White dwarfs represent a final stage of the life cycle of stars similar to the sun; they are formed when the stars use up their fuel and can no longer support nuclear reactions.

whole numbers The set of familiar numbers (, , , , , and so on) sometimes called natural numbers or counting numbers. When they are called counting numbers, zero is not included.

✥ The whole numbers are also called the positive in tegers (or the nonnegative integers, if zero is included).

work In physics, the product of a force applied, and the distance through which that force acts.

$\mathbf { x }$ -ray A form of electromagnetic radiation with very high frequency and energy. X-rays lie between ultraviolet radiation and gamma radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum.

✥ Because x-rays can travel through solid material and affect photographic plates, they are widely used in diagnosing medical problems. ✥ Objects in the sky also send out x-rays in processes that use very high energy.

zodiac The imaginary band in the sky through which the sun, the moon, and the planets appear to move. The twelve constellations in the band (Aquarius, Pisces, and so on) are the familiar signs of the zodiac used in astrology.

# Earth Sciences

![](img/a0d1f90cdc847c5a7bc53b831c25d84d3e7620eb0ae2495fd1020b2ab8cb5fe5.jpg)

The central problem of the Earth sciences is to understand how our planet works and how it came to be the way it is. The essential fact emerging from these sciences is that the Earth can be pictured as a set of three separate but interconnected cycles.

The geological cycle governs the formation and disappearance of solid land. The science of geology contains two central insights. The first of these, arrived at in the eighteenth century, is that the Earth is very old and that its history can be read in the rocks on its surface. The second insight, gained in the late s, is that the Earth has evolved and continues to do so. The continents have not always been where they are now, nor have they always had their present shape. Instead, the surface of the Earth has changed constantly, and the continents have moved about, sometimes breaking up into pieces, sometimes coming together again. This picture of the Earth, called plate tectonics, replaced the old idea of a static and unchanging planet. The study of the rocks and their history is the subject of geology, whereas the study of the forces that drive the activity on the surface is part of the newer field of geophysics.

At the same time that the continents are moving, a smaller-scale geological cycle, involving the formation of rocks and their erosion into sediments and soil, goes on. In river deltas and the eruption of volcanoes, new land surface is added to the Earth. At the same time, the inexorable forces of weather and time break down the mountains.

On the stage set by motion of the continents, the atmospheric cycle operates. Powered by heat from the sun and the Earth’s rotation, winds move across the surface, carrying weather systems. Rainfall, temperatures, and other day-to-day aspects of our environment change in response to the prevailing winds and the jet streams. These weather patterns and their causes are the subject of the science of meteorology.

Over longer time periods, changes in the Earth’s orbit or movement of the continents alter the patterns followed by the winds and the temperatures on the Earth. Such changes in climate, of which the recurring ice ages are a good example, have had a profound effect on the development of the human race. Understanding long-term climate development is one of the major research fields in the Earth sciences.

Intermediate between the slow, majestic changes in the continents and the daily changes in the weather is the third great cycle — the hydrologic cycle, the cycle of the Earth’s water, or hydrosphere. Water evaporates from the surface and returns as rain or snow. Some water is locked up in the polar ice caps, but most resides in the oceans. Perhaps the most poorly understood part of our planet, the oceans act as a great reservoir for many natural and artificial substances. Their currents help equalize temperatures on the globe, while at the same time they spawn the major storm systems that have such an important effect on human activities.

The entries in this section were chosen according to slightly different criteria from those used in the humanities and social sciences sections. They were chosen not because the majority of educated readers are expected to be familiar with them, but because most scientists would agree that they are essential to a knowledge of the Earth sciences. Some of these words might be used without explanation in the New York Times, but many would not. Nevertheless, if you are familiar with these terms and the concepts they represent, you should know enough about the study of the Earth, the oceans, and the weather to follow their progress as it is presented in the popular press.

acid rain A type of precipitation made up of dilute acids, primarily a by-product of heavy industry.

✥ Acid rain is a result of the combination of water with chemicals released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels.

air pollution The addition of harmful chemicals to the atmosphere. The most serious air pollution results from the burning of fossil fuels, expecially in internal-combustion engines.

Air Quality Index A measure of the quantity of harmful particles and chemicals in the air.

✥ The index is used by weather forecasters to indicate the purity of the air on a given day. The higher the index, the smoggier (see smog) and more polluted the air.

Alvarez hypothesis (al-vuh-rez) The theory that the mass extinction that involved the dinosaurs and many other living things was caused by the impact of a large asteroid on the Earth sixty-five million years ago.

✥ The hypothesis is named after the father-and-son team of scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, who first suggested it. ✥ Evidence indicates that the asteroid fell in the Yucatan peninsula.

atmosphere The blanket of gas on the surface of a planet or satellite.

✥ The atmosphere of the Earth is roughly eighty percent nitrogen and twenty percent oxygen, with traces of other gases. (See ionosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere.)

✥ In general, when the barometer falls in response to a drop in pressure, bad weather is approaching; when the barometer rises because of an increase in pressure, good weather will follow.

barrier island Any low sandy island that is parallel to the mainland and protects it from storms. (See Cape Hatteras.)

✥ Barrier islands normally change location every ten to thirty years, a fact that makes coastline management a major problem in environmental policy.

Cirrus clouds

cirrus clouds (sir-uhs) Lacy or wispy clouds that form at high altitudes, generally before a change in the weather.

climate A region’s usual weather patterns. The climate at any point on Earth is determined by things such as the general movement of the atmosphere, the proximity of the oceans, and the altitude of the location.

✥ The climate also is affected by the sun, by changes in the orbit of the Earth, by plate tectonics, and by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which may lead to a greenhouse effect.

cloud seeding A technique for producing rain by dropping chemicals or small objects into clouds.

clouds Particles of water or ice suspended in the air. (See cirrus clouds, cumulus clouds, nimbus clouds, and stratus clouds.)

continental divide An imaginary geographic line defined by the fact that water poured on one side of it would ultimately flow into the ocean on one side of a continent, while water poured on the other side of the line would flow into the ocean on the other side of the continent.

✥ In North America, the continental divide is located in the Rocky Mountains.

continental drift A term, no longer used by geologists, that refers to the fact that continents are not stationary, but move across the Earth’s surface. Continental drift is one feature of the modern theory of plate tectonics. (See Pangaea.)

continental shelf The region adjoining the coastline of a continent, where the ocean is no more than a few hundred feet deep. The shelf is built up from sediments washed down to the sea by rivers.

✥ The continental shelves are often valuable because of the mineral resources and abundant marine life found there. (See offshore drilling.)

continents The large parts of the surface of the Earth that rise above sea level. The seven major continents are Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

✥ Continents are made from the lightest rocks in the Earth. Some of these are also the oldest known rocks

Continental shelf

on Earth, with an age of . billion years, measured by radioactive dating. ✥ According to the theory of plate tectonics, continents move along piggy-back on the tectonic plates like rafts floating on water.

coral reef A formation, at or near the surface of tropical waters, formed by skeletal deposits of corals, a form of sea life.

✥ Coral reefs form a protective environment for a wide variety of marine animals. ✥ Atolls — ringshaped islands that nearly or entirely enclose a lagoon are coral reefs. ✥ The largest coral reef is the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. ✥ Coral reefs are very sensitive to chemical pollution and changes in temperature and are considered to be in danger from environmental stress.

core In geology, the central region of the Earth; it extends fourteen hundred to eighteen hundred miles from the Earth’s center.

✥ The core is made primarily of iron and nickel and has two parts — an inner solid core and an outer liquid core. ✥ The mantle is the layer of the Earth that overlies the core.

cosmic rays Elementary particles, mainly protons, that are produced by the sun and other stars and then strike the upper atmosphere of the Earth. Some of these particles are absorbed, some help form the Van Allen belt, and some reach the Earth’s surface, where they form a part of the background radiation that constantly surrounds us.

crust In geology, the outermost layer of the Earth.   
It overlies the mantle.

✥ The crust includes the continents and the ocean bottom and is generally estimated to be about five to twenty-five miles thick. ✥ The crust is made from relatively lightweight rocks that floated to the surface when the Earth was molten early in its history.

cumulus clouds (kyooh-myuh-luhs) Large, white, puffy clouds that generally appear during fair weather, although they also form thunderheads on hot days. Some carry rain.

cyclone Any circular wind motion. A region of low atmospheric pressure. Also, a tropical storm.

✥ Cyclones can be a few feet across (“dust devils”) or can be major storm systems such as hurricanes, tor

# Cumulus clouds

nadoes, and typhoons. ✥ These winds move counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. (See Coriolis effect.)

desalinization (dee-sal-uh-nuh-zay-shuhn) Any process that removes salt from water.

✥ The term is usually applied to processes that remove salt from seawater to make it available for human consumption and agriculture. Such processes tend to be very expensive.

Earth The planet on which we live — the third planet from the sun.

✥ The Earth was formed at the same time as the sun, about . billion years ago. ✥ It consists of an inner

Earth. A cutaway view showing Earth’s layers.

core made of iron and nickel, an outer core of liquid metal, a mantle, and, on the outside, a crust. ✥ The surface of the solid Earth is in a state of constant change as the rock is moved around by the processes of plate tectonics. ✥ On the Earth’s surface, the oceans and the continents form the stage on which the evolution of life takes place. The atmosphere above the surface circulates, producing the daily weather.

Earth, evolution of The Earth was formed at the same time as the rest of the solar system by the coming together of materials that were not incorporated into the sun. The Earth was very hot (perhaps molten) at first, but quickly cooled off. Oceans appeared very early and have been on the surface continuously ever since. Life in the form of single-celled algae was present when the Earth was . billion years old. Animals with hard skeletons and shells appeared and formed fossils  million years ago. The period since then is usually broken up into the Paleozoic Era (“old life”) from  to  million years ago, the Mesozoic Era (“middle life”) from  million to  million years ago, and the Cenozoic Era (“modern life”) from  million years ago to the present. Dinosaurs flourished in the Mesozoic, whereas human beings have been present for only a few million years.

earthquake A tremor of the surface of the Earth, sometimes severe and devastating, which results from shock waves generated by the movement of rock masses deep within the Earth, particularly near boundaries of tectonic plates. (See fault, Richter scale, and seismology.)

$\clubsuit$ Earthquakes are particularly likely where such plates are sliding past each other, as in the San Andreas Fault. ✥ Earthquakes cannot be accurately pre dicted, although the likelihood of a region’s suffering an earthquake can be estimated.

El Niño (neen-yoh) A warming of the surface water of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, occurring every four to twelve years when cold water does not rise to the surface, causing unusual weather patterns. The warmer water kills fish and plankton, brings heavy rains to western South America, and causes drought in eastern Australia and Indonesia.

erosion A type of weathering in which surface soil and rock are worn away through the action of glaciers, water, and wind.

estuary (es-chooh-er-ee) A wide body of water formed where a large river meets the sea. It contains both fresh and salt water.

extinction The disappearance of a species from the Earth.

✥ The fossil record tells us that . percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct.

eye of a hurricane The region at the center of a hurricane about which the winds rotate, but which itself is relatively calm.

$\clubsuit$ Figuratively, the eye of a hurricane is the quiet center of a dispute or controversy.

fault In geology, a place where sections of the crust of the Earth move relative to each other. (See earthquake and San Andreas fault.)

$\clubsuit$ Faults tend to occur near the edges of tectonic plates.

fossil The evidence in rock of the presence of a plant or an animal from an earlier geological period. Fossils are formed when minerals in groundwater replace materials in bones and tissue, creating a replica in stone of the original organism or of their tracks. The study of fossils is the domain of paleontology. The oldest fossils (of bacteria) are . billion years old.

✥ The term is used figuratively to refer to a person with very old-fashioned or outmoded viewpoints: “That old fossil thinks that men should wear suits at the theater!”

fossil fuels Coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

✥ All of these fuels were formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. ✥ All fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide when burned. (See greenhouse effect.) ✥ Burning fossil fuels is a main cause of air pollution.

fossil record A term used by paleontologists (see paleontology) to refer to the total number of fossils that have been discovered, as well as to the information derived from them. (See evolution of Earth.)

front (frontal zone) In meteorology, the line that forms the boundary between two air masses. Unless they are very similar in temperature and humidity, they will not mix.

✥ Fronts usually produce unstable weather.

geological cycle The continuous process in which hot, molten material coming to the surface of the Earth from the interior forms igneous rocks, which are then broken down by weathering to create soil and sedimentary rocks. These sedimentary rocks can be lifted up by the motion associated with plate tectonics, in which case they are again weathered and washed down to the sea. Alternatively, they can be buried deep within the Earth, changed into metamorphic rocks, and brought to the surface of the Earth, or buried so deeply that they are melted and become part of the magma from which igneous rocks are formed.

geology The science devoted to the study of the Earth, particularly the solid Earth and the rocks that compose it.

geophysics The science devoted to the study of the physical properties and processes of geological phenomena, including fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and seismology.

✥ At present, little of the world’s energy supply is obtained from these sources.

glacier A large mass of ice formed over many years that does not melt during the summer. Glaciers move slowly over an area of land such as a mountain valley.

$\clubsuit$ Glaciers exist in high mountains throughout the temperate zones and cover most of Antarctica. Glaciers recede during warm periods and can expand during cold periods, creating ice ages. ✥ A significant percentage of the water of the Earth is locked up in glaciers.

global warming The term attached to the notion that the Earth’s temperature is increasing due to the greenhouse effect.

✥ Whether global warming is actually happening is a subject of scientific debate.

gradualism The belief that changes in the Earth, such as the development of species, have taken place slowly, without sudden and violent transitions. (Compare punctuated equilibrium and catastrophism.)

granite A relatively lightweight igneous rock that makes up most of the Earth’s crust beneath the continents. (See basalt, plate tectonics, and tectonic plates.)

greenhouse effect A term used to describe the heating of the atmosphere owing to the presence of carbon dioxide and other gases. Without the presence of these gases, heat from the sun would return to space in the form of infrared radiation. Carbon dioxide and other gases absorb some of this radiation and prevent its release, thereby warming the Earth. This is an effect analogous to what happens in a greenhouse, where glass traps the infrared radiation and warms the air.

✥ The burning of fossil fuels adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and therefore places the Earth at risk from an increase of this effect.

groundwater Water that seeps through the soil or rocks underground.

✥ Groundwater is a source of drinking and spring water for many communities. ✥ Groundwater can be contaminated by chemical pollutants. (See water pollution.)

hail Pellets of ice that form when updrafts in thunderstorms carry raindrops to high altitudes, where the water freezes and then falls back to Earth. Hailstones as large as baseballs have been recorded. Hail can damage crops and property.

hard water Water in which dissolved minerals make it difficult to produce a lather with soap.

✥ Hard water is usually associated with well water in regions where the rocks contain a large proportion of iron-bearing minerals.

hot spot A place deep within the Earth where hot magma rises to just underneath the surface, creating a bulge and volcanic activity (see volcano). The chain of Hawaiian Islands (see Hawaii) is thought to have been created by the movement of a tectonic plate over a hot spot.

humidity (relative and absolute) The amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity is measured in two ways: () Absolute humidity is the percentage of water vapor actually present in the air. () Relative humidity is the absolute humidity divided by the amount of water that could be present in the air. Relative humidity indicates the degree of comfort or discomfort one feels from the humidity, because it indicates the amount of perspiration that can evaporate from the skin.

hurricane A large tropical storm system with highpowered circular winds. (See cyclone and eye of a hurricane.)

✥ Between July and October, hurricanes cause extensive damage along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. (See Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.)

Hutton, James Scottish natural philosopher of the eighteenth century; generally regarded as the founder of modern geology. He argued that the Earth is very old and that its history can be read in the rocks. He also argued that the physical processes that shape the Earth today are the same as those that operated in the past.

hydrologic cycle (heye-druh-loj-ik) The continuous circular process in which the water of the Earth evaporates from the oceans, condenses, falls to the Earth as rain or snow, and eventually returns to the oceans through run-off in rivers or streams. Some water is absorbed by plants and returned to the atmosphere as vapor.

ice ages Periods in the history of the Earth when large glaciers covered much of the surface of the continents.

✥ The last ice age ended less than twenty thousand years ago. ✥ Scientists believe that there will be more ice ages in the future, caused by tiny changes in the Earth’s orbit and rotation.

iceberg A large piece of ice that has broken away from a glacier at the shore and floated out to sea.

✥ Most of the ice in an iceberg is underwater, leaving only the “tip of the iceberg” visible — a fact that is often alluded to in discussions of subjects in which the most important aspects are hidden from view.

igneous rock (ig-nee-uhs) Rocks formed by the cooling and solidifying of molten materials. Igneous rocks can form beneath the Earth’s surface, or at its surface, as lava.

✥ Granite, solid volcanic lava, and basalt are examples of igneous rock.

inversion, thermal In meteorology, a situation in which a layer of warm air (an inversion layer) lies over a layer of cool air.

✥ If an inversion occurs over a city, it results in air pollution, because some pollutants, such as smoke or soot, which are usually removed by normal weather processes, are held at the surface by the cool layer. (See smog.)

ionosphere (eye-on-uh-sfeer) A region of the atmosphere that begins at an altitude of about thirty miles.

✥ In this region, free particles carrying an electrical charge, atoms ionized (see ionization) by radiation from the sun, reflect radio waves. “Bouncing” radio waves off the ionosphere makes communication possible over long distances of the surface of the Earth.

jet stream A narrow band of swiftly moving air found at very high altitudes.

✥ Movements of the jet stream have important (but generally short-lived) effects on weather patterns. ✥ Travel time in an airplane can be lengthened or shortened by the jet stream, depending on the direction of flight and the strength of the stream.

land breeze The breeze that blows from the land toward the sea after sunset. The land cools more quickly than the ocean, cooling the air above it. The warmer air above the water continues to rise, and cooler air from over the land replaces it, creating a breeze. (Compare sea breeze.)

lava A type of igneous rock that is formed when molten magma from a volcano hardens.

lightning An electrical discharge from clouds that have acquired an electrical charge, usually occurring during storms. (See thunder.)

limestone Sedimentary rock formed primarily of calcium carbonate, often the skeletons of small marine organisms.

lithosphere (lith-uh-sfeer) The outer layer of the Earth, comprising the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is about sixty miles thick.

Lyell, Charles (leye-uhl) Nineteenth-century Scottish natural philosopher who laid the foundations for the modern sciences of geology and evolutionary biology. His book Principles of Geology had an enormous influence on other scientists in the nineteenth century, especially Charles Darwin. He was the founder of the doctrine of uniformitarianism, which holds that all processes on the Earth are the same today as they have been in the past. Geologists often use the slogan “the present is the key to the past” to summarize Lyell’s ideas.

magma Molten rock usually located deep within the mantle of the Earth that occasionally comes to the surface through cracks in the mantle or through the eruption of volcanoes.

✥ When magma cools and solidifies, it forms igneous rock, of which lava is one type.

magnetic field of the Earth The magnetic field (see magnetism) that surrounds and permeates the Earth. It is the presence of this field that causes compass needles to line up in a north-south direction. The origin of the Earth’s magnetic field is poorly understood at the present time.

magnetic field reversals Changes in direction or orientation of the magnetic field of the Earth that have occurred from time to time. (Several hundred are known in the geological record.) Sometimes the north magnetic pole is near the geographic North Pole and sometimes near the South Pole in Antarctica.

✥ The causes of these reversals are not known in detail, but are thought to be related to the motion of fluids in the Earth’s core.

magnetic north The direction of the north magnetic pole.

magnetic pole The spot on the Earth toward which a compass needle will point.

✥ The north magnetic pole is not located exactly at the geographic North Pole. Therefore, depending on where a compass is, its needle may not point exactly north. ✥ The variation between magnetic north and “true” north is usually shown on navigation maps as the “angle of declination.”

magnetic storm The effect on the ionosphere of large bursts of charged particles (see electrical charge) from the sun.

✥ During a magnetic storm, radio reception can become very difficult.

mantle The region of the interior of the Earth between the core (on its inner surface) and the crust (on its outer).

✥ The mantle is more than two thousand miles thick and accounts for more than three-quarters of the volume of the Earth.

Marianas Trench (mar-ee-an-uhz) The deepest spot in the oceans, more than thirty-five thousand feet deep, near the Philippines.

mass extinction Any of several events in the Earth’s past in which large numbers of species (in some cases, up to eighty percent) became extinct.

✥ The most famous mass extinction included the destruction of the dinosaurs sixty-five million years ago. (See Alvarez hypothesis.)

metamorphic rock Rock that was once one form of rock but has changed to another under the influence of heat, pressure, or some other agent without passing through a liquid phase.

✥ Examples are marble, which can be formed from limestone, and slate, which is formed from shale.

meteor A streak of light in the sky, often called a “shooting star,” that occurs when a bit of extraterrestrial matter falls into the atmosphere of the Earth and burns up.

✥ Meteor showers occur at regular times during the year.

meteorites Objects from outside the Earth that enter the Earth’s field of gravitation and fall to the Earth’s surface. Meteors, on the other hand, are objects from space that burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere.

✥ Meteorites are bodies that are left over from the time when the planets formed, and therefore give us clues about the formation of the solar system.

meteorology The study of the weather and climate.

microclimate The long-term weather conditions in a small area on the Earth. Usually, this term refers to such things as the differences in weather between the tops of hills and neighboring valleys, or between different parts of the same piece of land.

mineral In geology, a naturally occurring inorganic substance (see inorganic molecules) with a definite chemical composition and a regular internal structure.

$\clubsuit$ Most minerals are crystals, like salt and diamonds. ✥ Rocks are aggregates of minerals.

monsoon A wind system that affects large climatic regions and reverses direction seasonally.

✥ The Asiatic monsoon brings heavy rains to Southeast Asia in spring and summer.

moraine (muh-rayn) A pile of debris, often extending for miles, deposited by a glacier. It is composed of rock fragments transported by the ice, which are left behind when the ice melts.

nimbus clouds The dark clouds characteristic of storms.

# Nimbus clouds

northern lights See aurora borealis.

oil sands Surface deposits of tarry sand that contain large quantities of petroleum.

✥ The major deposits of oil sands in North America are in the western United States and northern Canada. ✥ Extracting the oil from these sands is difficult and expensive.

ore In geology, a mineral that contains a commercially useful material, such as gold or uranium.

✥ Ore deposits are generally mined, and the ore is processed to recover the material.

ozone hole A depletion of ozone that occurs over Antarctica in the winter. The ozone returns to normal levels in the summer, and the amount of depletion varies from year to year. The hole is thought to be caused by a combination of the peculiarities of atmospheric circulation (see atmosphere) near the South Pole and chemical reactions involving chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere and ice crystals in clouds.

ozone layer A band of ozone in the upper atmosphere. Ozone is a molecule made of three atoms of oxygen instead of the usual two.

✥ The ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun and is thus very important to the health of human beings and other life forms on Earth. The Earth’s ozone layer could be at risk because of the action of chlorofluorocarbons, but international treaties have banned the production of these chemicals. The ozone layer is expected to return to normal in a few decades. (See ozone hole.)

paleontology (pay-lee-uhn-tol-uh-jee) The study of ancient life forms, particularly as they are seen in fossils.

Pangaea (pan-jee-uh) A former “supercontinent” on the Earth. In the distant past a large landmass, Pangaea, included all the present continents, which broke up and drifted apart. (See plate tectonics.)

plate tectonics (tek-ton-iks) In geology, a theory that explains the distribution of continents, earthquakes, volcanoes, mountains and other geologic phenomena in terms of the formation, movement, and destruction of tectonic plates. These plates move in response to forces deep within the Earth. Because continents, such as North America, often ride piggy-back on plates, their movement is referred to as continental drift.

✥ Earthquakes and volcanoes tend to occur at the boundaries between plates: the San Andreas Fault is on such a boundary. ✥ New plate material is constantly created by the process of sea floor spreading, and old material is destroyed when two plates collide and one plate moves under the other.

precipitation In meteorology, the fall of water, ice, or snow deposited on the surface of the Earth from the atmosphere. In chemistry, a chemical reaction in a solution in which a solid material is formed and subsequently falls, as a precipitate, to the bottom of the container.

![](img/bbed92074445f3ffaffaeed4342d8418b64a2909a2bb8d665bcc3fcaea60b6e2.jpg)

prevailing westerlies The west-to-east winds that occur in the temperate zones of the Earth.

punctuated equilibrium The theory that new species evolve suddenly over brief periods of time, followed by longer periods during which there is no genetic change. Punctuated equilibrium is a revision of Darwin’s theory of evolution. (Compare gradualism and catastrophism.)

radioactive dating A process for determining the age of an object by measuring the amount of a given radioactive material it contains. If one knows how much of this radioactive material was present initially in the object (by determining how much of the material has decayed), and one knows the half-life of the material, one can deduce the age of the object.

✥ The best known example of radioactive dating employs carbon 14, a radioactive isotope of carbon.

rainbow The colored arch in the sky that is often seen after a rain. The rainbow is formed when water droplets in the air cause the diffraction of sunlight.

✥ The colors of the rainbow are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.

renewable resource Any resource, such as wood or solar energy, that can or will be replenished naturally in the course of time.

Richter scale (rik-tuhr) A scale used to rate the intensity of earthquakes. The scale is open-ended, with each succeeding level representing ten times as much energy as the last. A serious earthquake might rate six to eight, and very destructive quakes rate higher.

✥ No quake greater than nine has ever been recorded.

San Andreas Fault (san an-dray-uhs) A fault in California where the North American and the Pacific tectonic plates meet and slide past each other. (See earthquake and plate tectonics.)

✥ A major earthquake along this fault has been predicted for many years. Because California is densely populated, such an event might have very serious consequences.

sandstone A sedimentary rock formed of sandsized grains that have been either compacted or cemented together. Altough sandstone usually consists primarily of quartz, it can also consist of other minerals.

sea breeze The breeze that blows from the sea toward the land during the day, as air rising over the warmer land is replaced by cooler air from above the sea. (Compare land breeze.)

sea floor spreading The process by which new material that lies under the ocean rises and pushes the existing tectonic plates aside, creating new crust as it does so.

✥ Sea floor spreading is making the Atlantic Ocean wider by a few inches each year.

sedimentary rock (sed-uh-men-tuh-ree) Rock that has formed through the deposition and solidification of sediment, especially sediment transported by water (rivers, lakes, and oceans), ice (glaciers), and wind. Sedimentary rocks are often deposited in layers, and frequently contain fossils.

✥ Limestone and shale are common sedimentary rocks.

seismic waves (seyez-mik) In geology, shock waves in solid rock generated by earthquakes or underground explosions. (See seismology.)

✥ Seismic waves travel through the Earth and can be detected far from their source. ✥ Most of our knowledge of the Earth’s interior comes from studying seismic waves. ✥ The measurement of seismic waves is also important in detecting underground nuclear tests.

seismology (seyez-mol-uh-jee) The branch of science devoted to the study of seismic waves and the information they provide about the structure of the interior of the Earth.

✥ Our knowledge of the properties of the crust, the mantle, and the core comes from this field.

shale A sedimentary rock formed from layers of clay.

silicates (sil-uh-kuhts, sil-uh-kayts) The main minerals found in many rocks. Silicates are composed of atoms of silicon, oxygen, and elements such as potassium, sodium, or calcium, under great heat and pressure. Silicates make up about one-quarter of the crust of the Earth.

✥ Mica and quartz are silicates.

smog A haze or fog composed of water vapor, complex molecules, and suspended particles.

✥ In North America, the primary cause of smog is pollution from automobile exhaust. ✥ The Los Angeles basin, where pollutants can be trapped by inversions and the surrounding mountains, has frequent problems with smog, as do other major urban areas. ✥ The word smog is a combination of smoke and fog.

soil Material on the surface of the Earth on which plants can grow. (See topsoil.)

✥ Soil is produced by the weathering of rocks.

solar energy The energy the Earth receives from the sun, primarily as visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. (See renewable resource.)

✥ The term solar energy often refers to processes that use this energy to generate heat or electricity for human use. (See solar cells.)

Stalactites and stalagmites. The Luray Caverns, Virginia.

stalactites (stuh-lak-teyets) Rock structures formed on the ceilings of caves as water drips down, leaving behind minerals before it falls. (Compare stalagmites.)

✥ Stalactites grow very slowly. ✥ One easy way to distinguish stalactites from stalagmites is to recall that stalactites “hold tight” to the ceiling of a cave. Stalagmites “might reach the ceiling” of the cave and form a column.

stalagmites (stuh-lag-meyets) Rock structures that grow up from the floors of caves as water drips down and deposits minerals. (Compare stalactites.)

✥ Stalagmites grow very slowly.

stratification The process by which materials form or are deposited in layers, as in sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks.

✥ The atmosphere and the ocean also exhibit stratification, with the warmer air or water occupying the upper layers.

stratosphere (strat-uh-sfeer) The region of the atmosphere of the Earth above the troposphere. The stratosphere begins at an altitude of seven to ten miles and extends to approximately thirty miles.

stratus clouds (stray-tuhs, strat-uhs) Low clouds that stretch over large portions of sky, creating overcast conditions.

✥ The plates are not the same as the continents. The North American plate, for example, extends from the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to the west coast of the United States and Canada. These plates are about thirty miles thick.

thunder The noise created when air rushes back into a region from which it has been expelled by the passage of lightning.

tides The periodic rise and fall of the ocean level owing to the gravitational force exerted by the moon and sun.

✥ In most parts of the world, two tide cycles occur each day.

topsoil The thin, rich layer of soil where most nutrients for plants are found.

$\clubsuit$ Most of the land-based biological activity of the Earth takes place here. ✥ The loss of topsoil through erosion is a major agricultural problem.

tornado In meteorology, a storm in which highspeed winds move in a funnel-shaped pattern.

$\clubsuit$ Tornadoes occur chiefly during thunderstorms. $\clubsuit$ If the tip of the funnel touches the ground, it can cause extensive damage. ✥ Tornadoes are common in the Middle West.

troposphere (troh-puh-sfeer, trop-uh-sfeer) The lowest layer of the atmosphere of the Earth, extending from ground level to an altitude of seven to ten miles.

tsunami (tsooh-nah-mee) A large wave on the ocean, usually caused by an undersea earthquake, a volcanic eruption, or coastal landslide. A tsunami can travel hundreds of miles over the open sea and cause extensive damage when it encounters land. Also called tidal waves.

# Stratus clouds

strip mining Removing a mineral deposit from the Earth after first removing the layer of earth above it.

✥ Strip mining, the cheapest method of mining, is also the most controversial, because it jeopardizes the environment, and because strip-mined land is either expensive or impossible to reclaim.

tectonic plates (tek-ton-ik) The dozen or so plates that make up the surface of the Earth. Their motion is studied in the field of plate tectonics.

tundra A land area near the North Pole where the soil is permanently frozen a few feet underground.

✥ There are no trees on the tundra: the vegetation is primarily lichens and mosses. ✥ Tundra is widespread in Lapland and in the far northern portions of Alaska, Canada, and the Soviet Union.

typhoon In meteorology, a type of cyclone occurring in the western regions of the Pacific Ocean.

✥ A typhoon is similar to a hurricane in levels of destructiveness.

volcano A cone-shaped mountain or hill created by molten material that rises from the interior of the Earth to the surface.

✥ Volcanoes tend to occur along the edges of tectonic plates. ✥ Eruptions and lava flows associated with them can be very destructive. (See Mount Saint Helens and Mount Vesuvius.)

water pollution The addition of harmful chemicals to natural water. Sources of water pollution in the United States include industrial waste, run-off from fields treated with chemical fertilizers, and run-off from areas that have been mined.

water table The depth (measured from the surface of the Earth) at which underground water is first encountered.

watershed A ridge of high land dividing two areas that are drained by different river systems. On one side of a watershed, rivers and streams flow in one direction; on the other side they flow in another direction. Also, the area drained by a water system.

weather map A map showing the weather patterns throughout a given region.

weather satellite An artificial satellite that revolves around the Earth and detects and reports weather patterns on the Earth’s surface.

The study of living things on the Earth has a long history. Because of the incredible richness and diversity of life, most of the effort in biology and in its predecessor, natural history, has been expended on an effort to describe what there is — simple exploration and cataloguing. The classical sciences of descriptive botany and zoology, with their emphasis on classification, are examples of this sort of work. The division of living things into the plant kingdom and animal kingdom (plus three more kingdoms added by modern scientists to describe microscopic organisms and fungi), and the collection of all living things into a coherent classification scheme, are the fruit of this work. During the past century and a half, however, two important discoveries have changed the face of the life sciences.

The first of these was the development of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin and others. The mechanism of natural selection gave naturalists for the first time a way of answering questions about how life came to have the forms it has, rather than just questions about what those forms are. The great social and intellectual turmoil triggered by Darwin’s work is interesting, of course, but is not relevant from a purely scientific standpoint. What does matter is that we can now understand how the observed diversity of living things could have arisen through the action of a simple and easily comprehended mechanism. The original Darwinian notions have been modified and expanded since his time, of course, and there is still debate about the pace at which species evolve. Nevertheless, the main principle of Darwinism — that living things change and adapt in response to their environment — has been incorporated as one of the pillars of the modern life sciences.

The second great change in the life sciences is the shift from studying organisms as a whole to studying the complex chemical processes inside the cell, both in its everyday workings and in reproduction. This change can be symbolized by the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the s and the completion of the Human Genome Project in .

The new emphasis on basic biochemistry has had several consequences. For one thing, the realization that genetic information is passed from one generation to the next through DNA has filled in the Darwinian picture of the development of life. Natural selection acts when individuals of the same species differ, but until recently we had no notion of why these differences occurred. Now, thanks to modern genetics, this missing piece of the Darwinian picture is being filled in.

A detailed understanding of the working of the individual cell, the basic building block of life, is also beginning to emerge. We see the cell as a system in which information is carried and stored in DNA and RNA molecules, but in which the actual work is done by an assembly of proteins. Most of the details of the cell’s working are too complex to be included in our list, but it is important to be aware that these secrets are being unraveled. It is hard to imagine modern cancer research progressing, for example, without consideration of what makes a cancer cell different from a normal one. At the same time, our knowledge of genetic processes makes it possible for us to cure hereditary diseases and to create living things that never existed in nature. We can produce life forms to help improve the human condition, much as our ancestors developed domestic livestock thousands of years ago. This field remains one of the most vital and exciting areas of research in modern science.

While some life scientists are examining the smallest parts of living organisms, others are studying the complex interrelationships of communities of plants and animals. The new science of ecology aims at understanding the way that living systems (including human beings) interact with one another and with their environment. The scope of such studies can extend from a small marsh to the entire planet.

action potential The rapid change in electric potential that parts of a nerve cell undergo when a nerve impulse is generated. Unlike ordinary electric current, which consists of the flow of electrons, the action potential involves the movement of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane.

active site The part of an enzyme or antibody where a chemical reaction occurs.

adaptation The changes made by living systems in response to their environment. Heavy fur, for example, is one adaptation to a cold climate.

aerobic (air-oh-bik) In biology, a descriptive term for organisms that require the presence of oxygen to live. (Compare anaerobic.)

There can be several variations of this sequence, and each of these is called an allele. In the case of the gene for eye color, for example, one allele codes for blue eyes, whereas the other may code for brown eyes.

amino acids (uh-mee-noh) Basic organic molecules that combine to form proteins. Amino acids are made up of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Some examples of amino acids are lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan.

✥ Amino acids are the basic molecular building blocks of proteins.

biology The study of life and living systems.

Bacteria. E coli Bacterium with pili, tiny hollow projections used to attach to surfaces.

biomass Material in growing or dead plants.

balance of nature A concept in ecology that describes natural systems as being in a state of equilibrium, in which disturbing one element disturbs the entire system. The inference is usually drawn that the natural state of any system is the preferred state and that it is best to leave it undisturbed.

✥ This is the stage of development where embryonic stems cells can be harvested for medical research.

blood-brain barrier The separation of the brain, which is bathed in a clear cerebrospinal fluid, from the bloodstream. The cells near the capillary beds external to the brain selectively filter the molecules that are allowed to enter the brain, creating a more stable, nearly pathogen-free environment.

botany The scientific study and categorization of plants. (See fruit, photosynthesis, and plant kingdom.)

Brontosaurus (bron-tuh-sawr-uhs) A large herbivorous (see herbivore) dinosaur, perhaps the most familiar of the dinosaurs. The scientific name has recently been changed to Apatosaurus, but Brontosaurus is still used popularly. The word is from the Greek, meaning “thunder lizard.”

cambium (kam-bee-uhm) The layer of a tree where growth occurs, just under the bark.

✥ Carbohydrates in food provide energy for the body and, if present in excess, are stored as fat.

carbon cycle In ecology, the movement of atoms of carbon through the biosphere. Molecules of carbon dioxide are taken in by plants, to be incorporated into their tissues, which may then be eaten by and incorporated into animals. Animals return the carbon to the air in the form of carbon dioxide, and the cycle starts again. (See photosynthesis and respiration.)

cell wall The rigid outer covering of a typical plant cell, composed mainly of cellulose and lying outside the cell membrane. Animal cells do not have cell walls.

✥ It is the cell walls that give plant stems and wood their stiffness.

cellular differentiation The process by which a cell becomes specialized in order to perform a specific function, as in the case of a liver cell, a blood cell, or a neuron. There are more than  general types of cells in the human body. Differentiation is the process that takes place inside an embryo that deter

central dogma of molecular biology Describes a key assumption of molecular biology, namely, that each gene in the DNA molecule carries the information needed to construct one protein, which, acting as an enzyme, controls one chemical reaction in the cell.

chemical evolution The formation of complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic molecules through chemical reactions in the oceans during the early history of the Earth; the first step in the development of life on this planet. The period of chemical evolution lasted less than a billion years.

✥ Many of the steps in chemical evolution can now be reproduced in the laboratory. ✥ Some scientists believe that all or most of the Earth’s original organic molecules were created in space and were brought to the Earth’s oceans by meteorites.

cladistics (kluh-dis-tiks) A method of taxonomic classification that groups organisms according to their lines of evolutionary descent. All descendants of a given organism are called a clade.

class In biology, the classification beneath a phylum and above an order. (See Linnean classification.)

✥ Mammals, reptiles, and insects are classes.

cleavage The process by which an animal cell divides into two daughter cells after mitosis. In an embryo, this process is repeated many times and leads to the formation of the blastula.

clone A living system that is genetically identical to its ancestor (that is, it has exactly the same DNA molecules). Because each cell contains the DNA molecules that characterize an individual, it is, in principle, possible to replicate, or reproduce, complex living systems in the laboratory.

✥ The first cloned mammal, a sheep named Dolly, was born in Scotland in . DNA from an adult donor was placed into an egg, which was then implanted in the uterus of another sheep. Since that time, mice, cows, and pigs have been cloned. ✥ There is a major debate on the ethical aspects (see bioethics) of cloning, especially as applied to human beings. Therapeutic cloning involves the placing of adult DNA in an egg for the express purpose of creating stem cells for medical purposes. Reproductive cloning involves the placement of adult DNA into an egg and the implantation of the egg into a uterus for the purpose of creating a viable fetus. ✥ Clone is often used informally to indicate a close copy or resemblance: “This new computer is a clone of the IBM model.”

cloning vector An agent used to transfer bits of DNA into the DNA of a cell in genetic engineering. Common types of vectors include the genetically engineered viruses that infect a cell.

closed ecosystem An ecosystem in which no materials can leave or enter but through which energy from external sources can flow.

✥ The Earth is a closed ecosystem.

codon (koh-don) A group of three bases on the DNA molecule. Each codon determines the identity of one amino acid in proteins made by the cell.

coevolution The process that occurs when two species influence each other during evolution. For example, an insect may evolve specialized parts that allow it to feed on a specific flower, whereas the flower evolves to facilitate pollination by that particular insect.

cold-blooded animals Animals, such as reptiles, fishes, and amphibians, that cannot control their body temperature and therefore become sluggish in cold weather. (Compare warm-blooded animals.)

✥ Cold-blooded animals are often seen sunning themselves to warm up.

$\clubsuit$ Deforestation is considered to be a main contributor to the greenhouse effect.

developmental biology The study of the processes by which an organism develops from a zygote to its full structure. This field includes the study of cellular differentiation as well as body structure development. (See also embryology.)

dinosaurs Reptiles, now extinct, that were the dominant life form on Earth for many millions of years. The name dinosaur comes from the Greek words for “monstrous lizard.” Dinosaurs became extinct suddenly, about sixty-five million years ago. Scientists now believe that their extinction was caused by the impact of a large asteroid on the Earth.

✥ Some dinosaurs were very large and had small brains — factors that may in part have led to their extinction. The term is often used to refer to something or someone that is antiquated and unable to adapt to change: “The old cavalry generals couldn’t adjust to the use of tanks — they became dinosaurs.” ✥ Commonly known dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus rex, Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. $\clubsuit$ Some scientists believe that modern birds are the descendants of dinosaurs.

dioxin (deye-ok-sin) A group of pollutants created as by-products in many industrial processes. Dioxins accumulate in human tissue and affect human metabolism. They are carcinogens. Eliminating dioxins is an important goal of environmental policy.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) The molecule that carries genetic information in all living systems (see genetic code). The DNA molecule is formed in the shape of a double helix from a great number of smaller molecules (see nucleotides). The workings of the DNA molecule provide the most fundamental explanation of the laws of genetics.

DNA acts in three important way. First, when a cell divides, the DNA uncoils, and each strand creates a new partner from the surrounding material — a process called replication. The two cells that result from the cell division have the same DNA as the original (see mitosis). Second, in sexual reproduction, each parent contributes one of the two strands in the DNA of the

offspring. Third, inside the cell, the DNA governs the production of proteins and other molecules essential to cell function.

DNA methylation (meth-uh-lay-shuhn) The chemical reactions that place a methyl group (a combination of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms) at a particular spot on DNA during organismal development. The effect of this process is probably to “turn off” various genes during the process of cellular differentiation, causing the cell to develop into a specific type.

✥ It is thought that during cloning, the methyl groups are removed from the DNA, turning the genes back “on” again. $\clubsuit$ There is evidence that embryonic stem cells are cells in which this process has not yet occurred.

completion of the Human Genome Project in  produced the largest DNA sequence ever assembled.

DNA polymerase (pol-uh-muh-rays) An enzyme that assembles new DNA by copying an existing strand.

To carry out the sequencing of the human genome, scientists cut the DNA up into short fragments, sequenced these fragments simultaneously, and then assembled the entire genome by using sophisticated computer techniques to match the fragments to each other.

✥ Many believe that knowledge of the human genome will lead to enormous advances in medicine. (Compare gene mapping and DNA fingerprinting.)

DNA repair The way in which a cell corrects potentially damaging or mutagenic errors in its DNA. (See mutagen.) DNA bases may be directly replaced by enzymes, or part of a strand may be replaced by enzymes using its opposite, paired strand as a template.

Dolly The first mammal successfully cloned — Dolly, a sheep — was born in  in Scotland as the result of work by biologist Ian Wilmut (see clone). The procedure that produced Dolly involved removing the nucleus from an egg cell and placing the nucleus of an adult sheep’s mammary cell into it. Further manipulations caused the egg to “turn on” all genes and develop like a normal zygote. (See totipotency.)

ecology The study of living things, their environment, and the relation between the two.

ecosystem (ee-koh-sis-tuhm, ek-oh-sis-tuhm) A collection of living things and the environment in which they live. For example, a prairie ecosystem includes coyotes, the rabbits on which they feed, and the grasses that feed the rabbits.

$\clubsuit$ Chemical substances move through ecosystems on the Earth in cycles (see carbon cycle). ✥ The source of energy for almost every ecosystem on Earth is the sun.

# egg A female gamete.

embryo (em-bree-oh) A developing plant or animal. A plant embryo is an undeveloped plant inside a seed. An animal embryo is the animal as it develops from the single cell of the zygote until birth. Among humans and most other mammals, the embryo is carried in the mother’s womb.

✥ The term is occasionally used to denote a new or developing idea or project: “The idea for the complete theory was already present in his work, in embryo form, in .”

embryology (em-bree-ol-uh-jee) The study of the embryo; a major field of research in modern biology.

embryonic stem cell Cells obtained from an embryo in the blastula phase, when they are still only a few days old. Because they have only begun to differentiate, these cells have the capability of developing into any cell in the human body, a fact which makes them potentially important in medicine. (See stem cell.)

enzyme (en-zeyem) A protein molecule that helps other organic molecules enter into chemical reactions with one another but is itself unaffected by these reactions. In other words, enzymes act as catalysts for organic biochemical reactions.

eugenics (yooh-jen-iks) The idea that one can improve the human race by careful selection of those who mate and produce offspring.

✥ Eugenics was a popular theory in the early twentieth century but is no longer taken seriously, primarily because of the horrors of the eugenic efforts of the Nazi regime in Germany.

✥ Eukaryotes evolved in a process in which one early prokaryote consumed another, forming a more complex structure. ✥ The word eukaryote comes from the Greek for “true nucleus.”

evolution A theory first proposed in the nineteenth century by Charles Darwin, according to which the Earth’s species have changed and diversified through time under the influence of natural selection. Life on Earth is thought to have evolved in three stages. First came chemical evolution, in which organic molecules were formed. This was followed by the development of single cells capable of reproducing themselves. This stage led to the development of complex organisms capable of sexual reproduction. Evolution is generally accepted as fact by scientists today, although debates continue over the precise mechanisms involved in the process. (See mutation, punctuated equilibrium, and creation science.)

✥ The first cell is thought to have been formed when the Earth was less than a billion years old.

exon Stretches of DNA in genes that code for proteins. In eukaryotes, exons in a given gene are generally separated from each other by stretches of DNA that do not contain instructions for constructing proteins. (Compare intron.)

fermentation A chemical reaction in which sugars are broken down into smaller molecules that can be used in living systems. Alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, and whiskey, are made from the controlled use of fermentation. Fermentation is an anaerobic process.

fertilization The joining of sex cells to form a new living thing. In humans, a male sperm joins a female ovum, or egg; the resulting zygote divides into a multicelled structure that implants in the womb and grows into an embryo. In plants, pollen grains, containing the male sex cells, enter the female sex cells in the pistil; from this union, fruit eventually grows. When fertilization occurs within a single flower, we call it self-fertilization. (See cross-fertilization.)

fetus The embryo of an animal that bears its young alive (rather than laying eggs). In humans, the embryo is called a fetus after all major body structures have formed; this stage is reached about sixty days after fertilization.

fishes Traditionally, a class of vertebrates that breathe with gills rather than lungs, live in water, and generally lay eggs, although some bear their young alive. Some biologists consider the fishes a “superclass,” and divide them into three classes: bony fishes, such as sunfish and cod; fishes with a skeleton formed of cartilage rather than bone, such as sharks; and fishes that lack jaws, such as lampreys.

✥ Fishes are cold-blooded animals.

flora (flawr-uh) Plants, especially the plants of a particular place and time.

flower The part of a plant that produces the seed. It usually contains petals, a pistil, and pollen-bearing stamens.

fluid mosaic model A model that describes the structure of cell membranes. In this model, a flexible layer made of lipid molecules is interspersed with large protein molecules that act as channels through which other molecules enter and leave the cell.

food chain The series of steps by which energy is obtained, used, and transformed by living things. For example: sunlight helps grain to grow, the grain feeds cattle, and humans eat the cattle. (See illustration, next page.)

![](img/daa677770796c7b7b4f1a053bd56998b3e21f3c140bd04361a164f2063e6ad02.jpg)

Flower. A cross-section.

fruit In botany, the part of a seed-bearing plant that contains the fertilized seeds capable of generating a new plant (see fertilization). Fruit develops from the female part of the plant. Apples, peaches, tomatoes, and many other familiar foods are fruits.

fungi (fun-jeye, fung-geye) sing. fungus Plantlike organisms lacking chlorophyll, such as mushrooms, molds, yeasts, and mildews. Modern biologists tend to place fungi in their own kingdom, not in the plant kingdom, because they get their nutrients from other living things (or from the remains of living things that have died) rather than from photosynthesis. (See under “Medicine and Health.”)

gamete A reproductive cell having a single set of chromosomes, especially a mature sperm or egg.

gel electrophoresis (i-lek-toh-fuh-ree-sis) A technique used in DNA fingerprinting and other processes in which large molecules are to be identified. Fragments of DNA are placed in a semiporous gel, and an electrical field is turned on. The fragments move in response to the field, with smaller fragments generally moving faster. After a time, the fragments have separated enough to form a series of separated lines like a bar code that characterizes the DNA.

formation in the sequence of nucleotides on short sections of DNA.

gene amplification A process in a cell by which a particular gene is replicated so that more copies are available to produce a protein for the cell’s use. For example, the genes that code for proteins involved in ribosomes are amplified early in the process of cell development so that there are sufficient numbers of them to assemble the cell.

✥ PCR, polymerase chain reaction, can be considered a type of man-made gene amplification process.

gene mapping The process of determining where genes are located on individual chromosomes. (Compare DNA sequencing.)

gene patent The controversial legal practice of patenting a newly discovered gene. It allows unique segments of DNA, which perhaps code for a certain disease or a certain protein, to be owned by an individual or corporation.

gene pool The total number of genes available in a given species.

✥ Loosely speaking, the gene pool represents the total breeding stock available to the species.

gene splicing A term used to refer to the process by which the DNA of an organism is cut and a gene, perhaps from another organism, is inserted. (See genetic engineering and recombinant DNA.) Gene splicing is often used in industry to allow single-celled organisms to produce useful products, such as human insulin. It is also used in the production of genetically modified organisms.

gene therapy A promising technology that involves replacing a defective gene in the body with a healthy one. This can be done by removing cells from the body, using genetic engineering techniques to change defective sequences in the DNA, and then reinserting the cells. This technique has been carried out successfully, for example, on bone marrow cells, in which defective cells were successfully replaced with healthy, genetically engineered cells. Scientists hope to find an agent, such as a therapeutic virus, that will be able to correct defective DNA in situ. (See cloning vector.)

genetic code The code that translates the sequence of nucleotides in genes along the DNA strand into the structure of protein, which, through its action as an enzyme, governs one chemical reaction in the cell. A simple mnemonic is “One gene codes for one protein which runs one reaction.”

✥ All living things share the same genetic code, a fact that represents strong evidence for evolution. Unraveling the genetic code was one of the great scientific achievements of the twentieth century, and it opened the way to genetic engineering.

genetic drift A term that describes the random fluctuations in a gene pool over time. In large populations, the effects of genetic drift are negligible. (Compare natural selection.)

genetic engineering The manipulation of DNA to produce new types of organisms, usually by inserting or deleting genes.

✥ Genetic engineering has been developed commercially, with uses such as producing human insulin or bacteria that will keep plants from freezing in a mild frost. It is also used to produce genetically modified organisms. ✥ U.S. courts have ruled that the products of genetic engineering can be patented. ✥ There is often controversy about the risk involved in releasing genetically engineered organisms into the environment.

homeotic genes Genes that control the develop ment of an animal’s body plan.

hominids (hom-uh-nidz) The biological family that includes our species, Homo sapiens. This family has also included Neanderthals and other forerunners of today’s humans, such as Australopithecus, Homo erectus, and Homo habilis. Today’s human beings are the only surviving hominids.

Homo (hoh-moh) The genus to which human beings belong. The genus Homo includes Neanderthals and other hominids closely related to today’s humans, such as Homo erectus.

$\clubsuit$ Hybridization is used extensively in agriculture, where new forms of hardy and disease-resistant plants are produced commercially.

hydroponics (heye-druh-pon-iks) Cultivating plants in an artificial environment in which the necessary nutrients are carried to the roots in a liquid mixture.

in vitro (in vee-troh) In the laboratory; literally, “in glass” (laboratory experiments are often carried out in glass containers). In vitro conditions are distinguished from conditions that actually apply in nature. (Compare in vivo.)

✥ In vitro appears in the expression in vitro fertilization, a way of producing human embryos in a laboratory.

in vivo (in vee-voh) In nature; literally, “in life.” In vivo conditions are distinguished from those that might exist only in a laboratory. (Compare in vitro.)

instinct Behavior that is not learned but passed between generations by heredity.

intron A stretch of DNA in a gene that does not code for proteins. In eukaryotes, introns in a given gene separate stretches of DNA that contain instructions for constructing proteins. (Compare exon.)

invertebrates (in-vur-tuh-bruhts, in-vur-tuh-brayts) Animals without backbones. (Compare vertebrates.)

jumping genes See transposon.

“junk” DNA Segments of DNA along a chromosome that are not genes, do not code for anything that we know of, and whose purpose we do not understand. Approximately ninety-five percent of the human genome falls into this category. The term junk may be misleading, however, as this DNA may have other functions, such as regulating genes during development.

✥ Some scientists speculate that junk DNA may be archaic material left over from an earlier stage of evolutionary development.

karyotype (kar-ee-uh-teyep) The complete set of chromosomes that constitutes the entire genome of a species. The human karyotype contains forty-six chromosomes, twenty-three from each parent. This set is contained in the nucleus of almost every cell in the body

kingdom In biology, the largest of the divisions of living things. The best-known kingdoms are those of the plants and animals. Modern biologists recognize three additional kingdoms: Monera (or Prokaryotae) (for example, bacteria and blue-green algae), Protoctista (for example, red algae, slime molds, and amoebas and other protozoa), and fungi. (See Linnean classification.)

Linnean classification A way of organizing living things. In biology, plants and animals have traditionally been classified by the structure of their bodies, in a descending hierarchy of categories: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. For example, human beings are classified as belonging to the animal kingdom, the phylum of chordates, the class of mammals, the order of primates, the genus Homo, and the species sapiens. The scheme is based on a system developed by the Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus in the eighteenth century.

There is a debate among scientists about whether the traditional classification system should be retained. Some argue that classifying living things by their descent, with all descendants of a single ancestor being grouped together, is more in keeping with the ideas of evolution (see cladistics). Others want to classify organisms by their genetic makeup, using sequences in DNA or RNA. Each of these schemes provides a different way of ordering living things, but there is no “right” way to accomplish this task.

✥ Plants and animals are usually identified merely by genus and species; thus, human beings are given the scientific name Homo sapiens.

Linnaeus, Carolus (li-nee-uhs, li-nay-uhs) A Swedish biologist of the eighteenth century. Linnaeus originated our present scheme of classification of living things. Linnaeus started the standard scientific practice of referring to animals and plants by genus and species whereby, for example, people are Homo sapiens and sugar maple trees are Acer saccharum.

lipids (lip-idz, leye-pidz) A group of organic molecules that includes fats, oils, and waxes. Lipids do not dissolve in water. In animals, including humans, lipids store energy and form parts of cell structures, such as cell membranes.

mammals A class of vertebrates characterized by the production of milk by the females and in most cases, by a hairy body covering. Most mammals give live birth to their young. Human beings are mammals.

meiosis (meye-oh-sis) Division of cells in which four “daughter” cells are produced from one “parent” cell, each with half the genes of the parent. Meiosis is a key process in sexual reproduction. In the ovaries and testes, meiosis produces a great variety of sex cells (sperm and ova), because the genes of the parent cell can be split in many different ways. The sex cells combine in fertilization to produce a new individual with the full number of genes — half from each parent. Because the sex cells come in such variety, and come from two parents, there is an enormous number of possible forms for the offspring. (See chromosomes, genetics, and mitosis.)

memory cell A cell in the immune system that, when exposed to an invading pathogen, replicates itself and remains in the lymph nodes searching for the same antigen, resulting in a more efficient and rapid response to any subsequent attack.

✥ The creation of memory cells is one of the main goals of vaccination.

Mendel, Gregor (men-dl) An Austrian biologist and monk of the nineteenth century. Mendel discovered the basic laws of genetics by doing experiments with pea plants.

meristem (mer-i-stem) The region on a plant where division of cells (and hence growth) occurs. Usually, meristems are found in the shoots and root tips, and places where branches meet the stem. In trees, growth occurs in the cambium — the layer just beneath the bark.

metabolism (muh-tab-uh-liz-uhm) The total of the chemical reactions that maintain the life of a living thing.

$\clubsuit$ In humans, metabolism is related to the intake and use of food; persons with a high metabolism can eat more without gaining weight.

metamorphosis (met-uh-mawr-fuh-sis) A change in an animal as it grows, particularly a radical change, such as the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly.

microorganisms Organisms so small that they can be seen only through a microscope. (See bacteria, protozoa, and viruses.)

missing link A supposed animal midway in evolution between apes and humans. The term is based on a misunderstanding about the theory of evolution, which does not state that humans are descended from apes, but rather maintains that both humans and apes descended from a common ancestor. Modern evolutionary scientists do not search for a “missing link.”

mitochondrion (meye-tuh-kon-dree-uhn) The cell organelle where much of cellular respiration takes place; the “power plant” of the cell.

$\clubsuit$ Mitochondria probably entered eukaryotes by an act of endosymbiosis, in which one simple cell was absorbed by another. ✥ Mitochondria contain their own DNA. It is by tracing the mitochondrial DNA, which individuals inherit only from their mothers, that genetic linkeages are often traced. (See mitochondrial Eve.)

mitochondrial Eve When the original analysis of the DNA in the mitochondria of modern humans was carried out, the results suggested that all modern humans share the DNA of a single individual female who lived a few hundred thousand years ago. This female was named Eve in reference to the Creation story in the Book of Genesis in the Bible.

✥ Further research has largely discredited the notion of a single Eve, although scientists have found that modern humans are descended from a very small population, perhaps as few as five thousand individuals.

mitosis (meye-toh-sis) Division of a single cell into two identical “daughter” cells. Each daughter cell has an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Mitosis begins when the DNA in the parent cell replicates itself; it ends with two cells having the same genes (see genetics). Most cells in the human body, and all single-celled organisms, reproduce through mitosis. (Compare meiosis.)

molecular biology (muh-lek-yuh-luhr) The branch of science devoted to studies of the structure, function, and reactions of DNA, RNA, proteins, and other molecules involved in the life processes.

mollusks (mol-uhsks) A phylum of invertebrates with soft bodies and muscular feet. Some mollusks also have hard shells. Oysters, clams, snails, slugs, octopuses, and squid are mollusks.

Monera (muh-neer-uh) (or Prokaryotae) The kingdom of single-celled organisms without a cell nucleus (see also prokaryotes). Monera are the most primitive living things and are thought to have been the first to evolve.

morphology (mawr-fol-uh-jee) The study of the structure of living things. (Compare anatomy and physiology.)

mutagen (myooh-tuh-juhn, myooh-tuh-jen) Something that causes mutations in living things. Mutagens include chemicals, such as drugs or toxins, and radiation.

mutations Changes in chromosomes or genes that cause offspring to have characteristics different from those of their parents. Mutations can be caused by the effects of chemicals, radiation, or even ordinary heat on DNA. Mutations produce some of the differences between members of a species on which natural selection acts.

natural selection A process fundamental to evolution as described by Charles Darwin. By natural selection, any characteristic of an individual that allows it to survive to produce more offspring will eventually appear in every individual of the species, simply because those members will have more offspring.

✥ The expression survival of the fittest was used to describe this process in the nineteenth century but is not favored by modern scientists.

neurotransmitter Any one of a number of chemicals that are used to transmit nerve signals across a synapse. They are sprayed from the end of the “upstream” nerve cell and absorbed by receptors in the “downstream” cell.

✥ Drugs like Prozac and alcohol affect the emission and reception of neurotransmitters.

nitrogen fixing The conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (which plants cannot absorb) into forms of nitrogen that plants can absorb. Bacteria in the topsoil carry out the conversion.

nitrogenous wastes (neye-troj-uh-nuhs) Animal wastes (particularly urine) that contain materials high in nitrogen content.

✥ Nitrogenous waste can be valuable as fertilizer.

nucleic acids (nooh-klee-ik) Organic molecules found in the nuclei of cells. DNA and RNA, the bestknown nucleic acids, govern heredity and the chemical processes in the cell.

nucleotides (nooh-klee-uh-teyedz) The molecules that form the basic modular structure of the double helix of the DNA molecule. A nucleotide consists of three molecules — a sugar, a phosphate group, and a molecule called a base. If the double helix is a twisted ladder, the sugar and phosphates form the sides of the ladder and pairs of bases form the rungs. There are four different bases, usually abbreviated A, C, G, and T for adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine). The order of bases in DNA determines the genetic code.

nucleus plur. nuclei In biology, the central region of the cell, in which DNA is stored. The nucleus usually appears as a dark spot in the interior of the cell. Primitive cells (such as bacteria and blue-green algae) have no nuclei.

omnivore (om-nuh-vawr) An animal whose normal diet includes both plants and animals. Human beings and bears, for instance, are omnivores.

opposable thumb A thumb that can be used for grasping.

✥ Opposable thumbs are one of the distinguishing features of primates. ✥ The opposable thumb of human beings allows us to use tools.

order In biology, the classification lower than a class and higher than a family. Dogs and cats belong to the order of carnivores; human beings, monkeys, and apes belong to the order of primates. Flies and mosquitoes belong to the same order; so do birch trees and oak trees. (See Linnean classification.)

organ Part of a living thing, distinct from the other parts, that is adapted for a specific function. Organs are made up of tissues and are grouped into systems, such as the digestive system.

✥ The brain, liver, and skin are organs.

organelles (awr-guh-nelz) Parts of a cell that store food, discharge waste, produce energy, or perform other functions analogous to what organs do in large living things.

organic compounds The compounds containing carbon that are typically found in living systems.

✥ Generally, anything made from living systems, such as cloth, fuels, or wood, is said to be organic. Organic foods are grown with no fertilizer except the organic compounds found naturally in plants and animals.

organic molecules The smallest units of organic compounds. Important examples of these molecules are based on chains of carbon atoms and come in four major categories: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).

The Origin of Species () A book by Charles Darwin explaining his theory of evolution. It provoked great controversy; by casting doubt on the historical accuracy of the biblical accounts of Creation, it caused many believers to question their faith in Christianity. (See creationism and Scopes trial.)

p gene A gene that is thought to play a role in regulating cell death or apoptosis, in suppressing tumors, in regulating the cell cycle, and in stopping the cell from dividing when the DNA is damaged.

PCR (polymerase chain reaction) A laboratory technique that can amplify the amount of DNA from a tiny sample to a large amount within just a few hours. Theoretically, PCR can take one molecule and produce measurable amounts of identical DNA in a short period of time. It is used in DNA fingerprinting and DNA sequencing.

$\clubsuit$ An enzyme used in this process was originally found in bacteria in hot springs.

phenotype (fee-nuh-teyep) The outward appearance of an organism; the expression of a genotype in the form of traits that can be seen and measured, such as hair or eye color.

phloem (floh-em) The system of vessels in a plant that carries food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. (See xylem.)

photosynthesis Use by green plants of the energy in sunlight to carry out chemical reactions, such as the conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen. Photosynthesis also produces the sugars that feed the plant.

✥ Green plants depend on chlorophyll to carry out photosynthesis.

phylum (feye-luhm) plur. phyla One of the major divisions of the kingdoms of living things; the secondlargest standard unit of biological classification. The arthropods, chordates, and mollusks are phyla. Phyla in the plant kingdom are frequently called divisions. (See Linnean classification.)

physiology The study of the function of living things, including processes such as nutrition, movement, and reproduction. (Compare anatomy and morphology.)

pistil (pis-tuhl) The female part of a plant. In flowering plants, it is at the center of the flower. When fertilized with pollen, the pistil develops into fruit.

plant kingdom One of the five kingdoms of living things. Most plants derive energy from photosynthesis.

plasmid A circular bacterial DNA, sometimes used as a vector for gene insertion or genetic engineering. Plasmids are often the site of genes that code for resistance to antibiotics.

pollen The male sex cells in plants. In flowering plants, pollen is produced in thin filaments in the  called stamens. (See fertilization and pollination.)

✥ When pollen is carried into the air by the wind, it frequently causes allergic reactions (see allergy) in humans.

pollination The carrying of pollen grains (the male sex cells in plants) to the female sex cells for fertilization. Pollination can occur between plants when pollen is carried by the wind or by insects such as the honeybee (see cross-fertilization), or within the same plant, in which case it is called self-fertilization.

population genetics The study of the genetic composition of populations in order to understand the evolutionary forces that select for a particular gene.

primates (preye-mayts) The order of mammals that includes monkeys, apes, and human beings. Primates are distinguished from other animals in that they generally possess limbs capable of performing a variety of functions, hands and feet adapted for grasping (including opposable thumbs), flattened snouts, and other anatomical features. (See Linnean classification.)

prokaryotes (proh-kar-ee-oht) Organisms whose cells do not have a nucleus in which DNA is housed and which lack many of the organelles found in more advanced cells. The kingdom of Monera or Prokaryotae is composed of single-celled prokaryotes. (Compare eukaryotes.)

✥ It is thought that prokaryotes were the first cells to appear on Earth.

protein folding problem One of the main unsolved problems in molecular biology, the protein folding problem deals with the question of predicting the three-dimensional shape of a protein molecule from the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein molecules. The main difficulty arises from the large number of interactions between different atoms in a protein molecule, a number that lies outside of the ability of modern computers to handle. (See also protein structure and proteomics.)

protein structure The three-dimensional structure of a protein that is often key to its enzyme function. The structure of a protein is characterized in four ways: The primary structure is the order of the different amino acids in a protein chain, whereas the secondary structure consists of the geometry of chain segments in forms such as helices or sheets. The tertiary structure describes how a protein folds in on itself; the quaternary structure of a protein describes how different protein chains hook up with each other.

proteins (proh-teenz, proh-tee-inz) Complex organic molecules made up of amino acids. Proteins are basic components of all living cells and are therefore among the principal substances that make up the body. In addition to being necessary for the growth and repair of the body’s tissues, proteins provide energy and act as enzymes that control chemical reactions in the cell.

✥ Foods that contain a high percentage of protein include meat, fish, poultry, milk products, beans, and nuts.

proteomics (pro-tee-ohm-iks) A new and evolving field of science that seeks to specify all the proteins produced by a cell in all types of situations and environments and to understand how they function. Because proteins are the product of information coded for in DNA, proteomics is closely allied to the study of the genome.

Protoctista (pruh-tohk-tis-ta) The kingdom of organisms, mostly single celled, whose cells contain a nucleus. The amoeba is a member of this kingdom.

protoplasm (proh-tuh-plaz-uhm) The jellylike material in a cell, both inside and outside the nucleus, where the chemical reactions that support life take place.

protozoa (proh-tuh-zoh-uh) Single-celled animals, such as amoebas, that are the most primitive form of animal life. In modern biology, they are classified in the kingdom of Protoctista rather than in the animal kingdom. (See Linnean classification.)

✥ Some protozoa are parasites and may be pathogenic, causing diseases such as malaria and dysentery.

recessive trait In genetics, a trait that must be contributed by both parents in order to appear in the offspring. Recessive traits can be carried in a person’s genes without appearing in that person. For example, a dark-haired person may have one gene for dark hair, which is a dominant trait, and one gene for light hair, which is recessive. It is thus possible for two darkhaired parents to have a light-haired child, provided each parent contributes a gene for light hair.

recombinant DNA technology (ree-kom-buh-nuhnt) Techniques, usually associated with genetic engineering, in which strands of DNA from different sources are spliced together to form DNA for a new life form. Gene splicing is another name for this process.

regenerative medicine A term applied to new medical advances in which an understanding of the human genome allows us to use the body’s own mechanisms to heal it. Expected advances include a host of new pharmaceuticals and, eventually, the ability to create new tissues for transplant. (See embryonic stem cell.)

repetitive DNA Stretches of DNA that repeat themselves throughout a genome, either in tandem or interspersed along the genome. These stretches can comprise up to fifty percent or more of an organism’s DNA. It can code for an end product, perhaps a certain enzyme that is needed in large numbers; it can have a structural function (such as a telomere); or it can comprise sequences with no known function.

reproductive cloning The cloning of organisms with the goal of planting the blastula produced by the technique into the uterus of an adult female and thus creating a new organism. (Compare therapeutic cloning; see Dolly.)

reptiles A class of scaly vertebrates that usually reproduce by laying eggs. Lizards, snakes, turtles, and alligators are reptiles. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals.

✥ The dinosaurs were reptiles.

respiration The conversion of oxygen by living things into the energy by which they continue life. Respiration is part of metabolism.

✥ Carbon dioxide is a waste product of respiration.

restriction enzymes Chemicals used in the lab to cut up DNA at specific sites so that it may be sequenced. They function in nature as a form of bacterial self-protection that can cut up foreign DNA. The use of restriction enzymes is crucial in DNA fingerprinting.

ribonucleic acid (reye-boh-nooh-klee-ik) See RNA.

ribosome (reye-buh-sohm) A small, ball-like structure in the cell, made of proteins and RNA molecules, that serves as a platform on which the cell’s proteins are made.

RNA One of a group of molecules similar in structure to a single strand of DNA. The function of RNA is to carry the information from DNA in the cell’s nucleus into the body of the cell, to use the genetic code to assemble proteins, and to comprise part of the ribosomes that serve as the platform on which protein synthesis takes place.

Root. A buttercup and a detail of its root system.

and minerals from the soil, and often stores food.   
The main root of a plant is called the primary root;   
others are called secondary roots. The hard tip is called the root cap, which protects the growing cells behind it.   
Root hairs increase the root’s absorbing surface.

second messenger A molecule that relays messages in a cell from a receptor on a cell membrane to the final destination where an action within the cell is to take place. (See signal transduction pathway.)

sex cells The sperm and egg of living things. Sex cells have only half the number of chromosomes that other cells (body cells) have. (See meiosis.)

sex chromosomes The two chromosomes in each body cell of a living thing that determine what sex it is.

✥ As with other pairs of chromosomes, one of the sex chromosomes is contributed by each parent; they are of two types, X and Y. The mother supplies only an X-chromosome, but the father can transmit both the X- and the Y-chromosome. At fertilization, if the father’s sperm is also carrying an X-chromosome, the child will be female. If the father’s sperm is carrying a Y-chromosome, the child will be male.

RNA. An RNA chain; note the single strand. The nucleotide bases of RNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil.

root In biology, the part of a plant that grows downward and holds the plant in place, absorbs water sex-linked trait A trait associated with a gene that is carried only by the male or female parent.

✥ In humans, the gene for colorblindness is carried by the X-chromosome.

sexual reproduction The production of a new living thing by two parent organisms, with each parent contributing half the material in the DNA of the offspring. The young, genetically different from either parent, can rapidly adapt to their environment by means of natural selection. (See chromosomes and meiosis.)

sexual selection In evolution, the selection of a mate based on secondary sex characteristics. Sexual selection is thought to lead distinct differences in the appearance of the two sexes within a species. For example, the tail of the male peacock may be the result of sexual selection.

signal transduction pathway A set of chemical reactions in a cell that occurs when a molecule, such as a hormone, attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane. The pathway is actually a cascade of biochemical reactions inside the cell that eventually reach the target molecule or reaction. Thus, the pathway is a method by which molecules inside the cell can be altered by molecules on the outside.

single-celled Made up of only one cell. Bacteria are single-celled organisms.

sociobiology (soh-see-oh-beye-ol-uh-jee) An area of inquiry in biology, still somewhat controversial but gaining wider acceptance. Its central tenet is that many human behavioral and social traits are genetically inherited and are thus determined by genetic makeup and not culture.

✥ Sociobiology is on the “nature” side in the naturenurture controversy.

species (spee-sheez, spee-seez) A group of closely related and interbreeding living things; the smallest standard unit of biological classification. Species can be divided into varieties, races, breeds, or subspecies. Red pines, sugar maples, cats, dogs, chimpanzees, and people are species; Siamese cats and beagles are varieties, not species. (See Linnean classification.)

✥ The term can be used to refer to any group of related things: “This species of novel has become quite popular in recent years.”

sperm The male sex cell, typically consisting of a head, midpiece, and tail. (See fertilization.)

✥ Sperm are much smaller than the ova they fertilize.

spore A reproductive cell or group of cells, produced by some plants, that is capable of developing into an adult plant without combining with another reproductive cell. Plants also produce sperm cells. The spores of nonflowering plants are analogous to the seeds of flowering plants. (See asexual reproduction; compare sexual reproduction.) Fungi and algae typically reproduce by means of spores that are carried by the wind or some other agency to a new location for growth.

stamen (stay-muhn) The organ of a flower on which the pollen grows.

stem cell A cell from which a variety of other cells can develop through the process of cellular differentiation. Stem cells can produce only a certain group of cells (as with skin stem cells) or any cell in the body (as with embryonic stem cells).

✥ A major controversy involves the question of whether nonembryonic stem cells should be used for medical purposes.

sugars Carbohydrates that can supply energy to living things. Common table sugar is sucrose. Some other sugars are fructose, which is found in fruits; lactose, which is found in milk; and glucose, which is the most common sugar in the bodies of animals and plants.

symbiosis (sim-bee-oh-sis, sim-beye-oh-sis) The process by which two organisms live together, usually to their mutual benefit. An example of a symbiotic pair are cows and the bacteria that live in their digestive tracts, enabling them to digest cellulose in grass.

Symbiosis. Hippopotamus and egret.

synapse (sin-aps, si-naps) A gap between two nerve cells. Nerve signals are sent across the gap by neurotransmitters.

system A group of bodily organs that have similar structures or work together to perform some function, such as the digestive system, nervous system, and respiratory system.

taproot The single deep root of many deciduous trees that forms the basis for their root systems.

✥ Figuratively, a “taproot” is the source of an idea or work: “His childhood in Wales is the taproot of his po etry.”

taxonomy (tak-son-uh-mee) The classification of living things. (See Linnean classification.)

T-cell Key to the immune system, these cells originate in the bone marrow but mature in the thymus (the $t$ stands for thymus). T-cells attack other body cells that are infected by some bacteria, a virus, or another pathogen. (Compare B-cell.)

$\clubsuit$ The HIV/AIDS virus destroys a type of T-cell, leading to the syndrome characterized by a defective immune system. ✥ T-cell counts are used as a diagnostic test to indicate the strength of the immune system in AIDS patients.

telomere (tel-uh-meer) The long end sequences of a DNA strand occuring at the tip of the chromosomes; a type of repetitive DNA that usually consists of one hundred to fifteen hundred copies of a single DNA sequence.

$\clubsuit$ During DNA replication, small parts of the telomere are lost with each cycle. Scientists think that this loss may be related to the aging process.

therapeutic cloning A type of cloning with the goal of harvesting embryonic stem cells from the resulting blastula to grow tissues and other biological products with therapeutic value. (See clone; compare reproductive cloning.)

therapeutic virus A virus created in the laboratory whose function is to transfer DNA into the cells of an organism in the process of gene therapy.

totipotency The ability of cells such as an embryonic stem cell to differentiate into any type of body cell. Plant cells are also totipotent, which helps to explain why a graft of a plant can generate a whole new individual out of just a small branch cutting.

toxic waste A general term used to refer to chemical compounds produced by industry which, if they are ingested or breathed in by humans, can cause physiological damage. The disposal of toxic wastes is a major environmental problem in the United States.

transgenic species An organism that has had part of another species’ genome transferred into its own through the techniques of genetic engineering. (See also gmo.)

transposon (trans-poh-zon) Segments of DNA that shift from one area of a genome to another. Previously called jumping genes.

Tyrannosaurus rex (ti-ran-uh-sawr-uhs reks) A large, carnivorous (see carnivore) dinosaur that walked on two legs. Its name is from the Greek words meaning “tyrant” and “lizard” and the Latin word for “king.”

vertebrates (vur-tuh-bruhts, vur-tuh-brayts) Animals that have a spinal cord enclosed in a backbone.

✥ The five traditional classes of vertebrates are amphibians, birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles. (Compare invertebrates.) ✥ Human beings are vertebrates.

virus (veye-ruhs) plur. viruses Microorganisms consisting of DNA and RNA molecules wrapped in a protective coating of proteins. Viruses are the most primitive form of life. They depend on other living cells for their reproduction and growth. (See under “Medicine and Health.”)

$\clubsuit$ Viruses cause many diseases. (See viral infection.)

vivisection (viv-uh-sek-shuhn, viv-uh-sek-shuhn) The cutting up or dissection of animals, including anesthetized live animals, in scientific research. Vivisection is also a general term for the use of animals as subjects in laboratory experiments, especially in the development of new medical techniques and drugs.

✥ Vivisection, as well as the general use of animals in medical research, is a target of protest by animal rights advocates.

warm-blooded animals Animals, such as mammals and birds, that maintain a constant body tem perature regardless of the temperature of the surroundings. (Compare cold-blooded animals.)

The human body, along with its structure, function, illnesses, and characteristic behaviors, is only one of a multitude of living organisms in the world. Nevertheless, we have a special interest in it — a fact that is, as we shall see shortly, reflected in our educational system.

Like all living things except viruses, the human body is composed of cells. These cells are arranged into tissues, the tissues into organs, and the organs into organ systems. Thus, there are many levels at which an understanding of the body can be sought. We can look at the biochemistry of single cells or tissues, at individual organs, or at the system as a whole. Modern medical science functions at all these levels.

The amount of basic scientific knowledge required to understand the body has become so great that the boundaries between medicine and the sciences are no longer easy to define. Therefore, the material in this section consists of basic terminology from three related but separate bodies of knowledge anatomy, physiology, and medicine.

Anatomy is the science of the shape and structure of an organism. Human anatomy involves a detailed study of the body parts and their location. Physiology, the science dealing with the function of living organisms, explores the various chemical and physical processes of the body. Medicine is the science and art of diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease in the body. The relationship among these three branches of science is clear: in order to treat the disorders of the human body, an extensive understanding of both bodily structure and bodily function is necessary.

Most students have been exposed to courses labeled “Health” or “Health and Hygiene.” As a result, the level of understanding of the basic structure and function of the body is considerably higher than it is for the concepts related to other areas of science. For this reason, editors of major publications routinely assume that their readers possess considerable knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and medicine. Consequently, the following list is much more descriptive than those for the other sciences. Most of the words in this section are frequently used without explanation in the mass media, and hence should be part of the vocabulary of the culturally literate.

abdomen (ab-duh-muhn, ab-doh-muhn) The part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis that encloses the organs of the abdominal cavity; the belly.

abdominal cavity (ab-dom-uh-nuhl) The cavity within the abdomen that contains the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, and kidneys, and the lower part of the esophagus.

abortion The ending of pregnancy and expulsion of the embryo or fetus, generally before the embryo or fetus is capable of surviving on its own. Abortion may be brought on intentionally by artificial means (induced abortion) or may occur naturally (spontaneous abortion, which is commonly referred to as a miscarriage). (Compare stillbirth; see also family planning and population control.)

abscess (ab-ses) An inflamed area (see inflammation) in the body tissues that is filled with pus.

Achilles tendon (uh-kil-eez) A tendon connecting the heel bone with the calf muscle of the leg.

✥ In Greek legend, the hero Achilles could be wounded only in the heel.

acupuncture (ak-yuh-pungk-chuhr) A technique, which originated in China, for curing disease, relieving pain, or bringing about partial anesthesia by inserting needles into the body at specific points.

acute disease A disease or disorder that lasts a short time, comes on rapidly, and is accompanied by distinct symptoms. (Compare chronic disease.)

adenoids (ad-n-oydz, ad-noydz) Two masses of tissue at the junction of the nose and throat, which, like the tonsils, function in the lymphatic system. They help filter out harmful microorganisms that can cause infection. Continually swollen adenoids may interfere with breathing and affect speech.

✥ Adenoids are sometimes surgically removed along with the tonsils if they are persistently inflamed (see inflammation). ✥ Swollen adenoids give a distinctive nasal sound to the voice.

adipose tissue (ad-uh-pohs) Connective tissue that contains cells filled with fat; fat tissue.

adrenal glands (uh-dreen-l) Two small glands, one located near the upper part of each kidney, that function in the endocrine system. Part of each adrenal gland secretes adrenaline; another part secretes other important hormones.

adrenaline (uh-dren-l-in) A hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that helps the body meet physical or emotional stress (see endocrine system).

✥ Adrenaline plays a very large role in the fight or flight reaction, which refers to the various processes that occur within the body when it is confronted with some form of mental or physical stress. ✥ Figuratively, the term adrenaline is used in speaking of a high state of excitement: “When the race began, the adrenaline really started pumping.”

aerobics (air-oh-biks) Exercise designed specifically to improve cardiovascular fitness and, subsequently, the body’s use of oxygen. Also called aerobic exercise.

✥ The term aerobics usually refers to a specific kind of vigorous exercise, sometimes involving dance steps, that is set to music. Other forms of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, and swimming.

AIDS (aydz) Acronym for acquired immune de- ciency syndrome, a fatal disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Believed to have originated in Africa, AIDS has become an epidemic, infecting tens of millions of people worldwide. The virus, which is transmitted from one individual to another through the exchange of body fluids (such as blood or semen), attacks white blood cells, thereby causing the body to lose its capacity to ward off infection. As a result, many AIDS patients die of opportunistic infections that strike their debilitated bodies. AIDS first appeared in the United States in , primarily among homosexuals and intravenous drug users who shared needles, but throughout the world, it is also transmitted by heterosexual contact. Today, scientists are hopeful that AIDS can be managed by new drugs, such as protease inhibitors, and need not be fatal. (See AZT.)

alcoholism A chronic disease associated with the excessive and habitual use of alcohol; the disease, if left unattended, worsens and can kill the sufferer. Alcoholism is marked by physical dependency and can cause disorders in many organs of the body, including the liver (see cirrhosis), stomach, intestines, and brain. It is also associated with abnormal heart rhythms, with certain cancers, and, because of loss of appetite, with poor nutrition. The cause of alcoholism is very complicated and most often involves a mixture of physical, psychological, and possibly genetic factors.

allergy A highly sensitive reaction of the body to certain substances, such as pollen, that are present in amounts that do not affect most people. Common indications of allergy include sneezing, skin rashes, itching, and runny nose.

alternative medicine Medical practice or therapy that uses methods that have not been associated with the traditional, standard care most generally taught and executed by AMA-certified medical schools.

✥ Alternative medicine includes practices such as acupuncture, naturopathy, and chiropractic, as well as such therapies as chelation therapy, homeopathic remedies, and biofeedback. There has been an explosion of interest in alternative medicine in recent years.

Alzheimer’s disease (ahlts-heye-muhrz, alts-heyemuhrz, awlts-heye-muhrz) A disease in which mental capacity decreases because of the breakdown of brain cells.

✥ Alzheimer’s disease is a major cause of loss of in tellectual function in middle-aged and elderly people.

amniocentesis (am-nee-oh-sen-tee-sis) A procedure for finding certain disorders in a fetus during pregnancy. In amniocentesis, a small amount of the salty liquid that surrounds the fetus in the amniotic sac is drawn out through a needle inserted into the mother’s abdomen. The fluid generally contains some isolated cells from the fetus. These cells are analyzed to detect abnormalities in the chromosomes of the fetus, such as Down’s syndrome, and may also be used to judge some other conditions, such as the maturity of the fetus’s lungs.

amniotic fluid (am-nee-ot-ik) The fluid, resembling salt water, contained in the amniotic sac; the embryo or fetus floats in the amniotic fluid.

amniotic sac A two-layered membrane that surrounds the embryo or fetus in the uterus. The amniotic sac is filled with fluid in which the embryo or fetus is suspended. (See reproductive systems.)

amphetamine A drug that stimulates the central nervous system and is used to treat certain conditions, such as attention deficit disorder, depres sion, and narcolepsy.

# anabolic steroids See steroids.

analgesic (an-l-jee-zik, an-l-jee-sik) A drug, such as aspirin, that relieves pain in the body.

anemia (uh-nee-mee-uh) A condition in which the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen is decreased because of too few red blood cells in circulation or because of too little hemoglobin.

✥ Because people suffering from anemia often appear weak and pale, the term is frequently used to describe general apathy or weakness: “The team’s performance has been pretty anemic these past few weeks.”

anesthesia (an-is-thee-zhuh) Loss of sensation or consciousness. Anesthesia can be induced by an anesthetic, by acupuncture, or as the result of injury or disease.

anesthetic (an-is-thet-ik) A substance that causes loss of sensation or consciousness. With the aid of an anesthetic, people can undergo surgery without pain. (See general anesthetic and local anesthetic.)

angina pectoris (an-jeye-nuh, an-juh-nuh pek-tuhris) Severe chest pains caused by an insufficient supply of blood to the heart.

angioplasty (an-jee-uh-plas-tee) A surgical technique in which a catheter containing a small balloon is inserted into arteries around the heart. The balloon is inflated to compress deposits of fatty substances blocking the artery, thereby restoring the flow of blood.

✥ Also called balloon therapy.

anorexia A short name for anorexia nervosa.

anorexia nervosa (an-uh-rek-see-uh nur-voh-suh) A psychosomatic disorder in which the sufferer refuses to eat and undertakes activities (such as self-induced vomiting) to bring about extreme weight loss. Anorexia, which is also characterized by a distorted self-image, occurs most often in young women aged twelve to twenty-one and may result in death if medical treatment is not obtained. Treatment for anorexia often includes extensive counseling to reveal underlying emotional problems.

anthrax An infectious disease transmitted by a bacterium in animals, which can also be transmitted to humans. Often fatal if the bacterium enters the lungs, anthrax is usually treated by antibiotics. Anthrax is a potential weapon in germ warfare and bioterrorism.

✥ After the September 11 attacks () in the United States, anthrax spores sent through the mail caused several fatalities. ✥ If spores are prepared in a sophisticated way, they can stay in the air and be breathed in by human beings. Anthrax produced in this way is referred to as weaponized anthrax.

antibiotic (an-ti-beye-ot-ik, an-teye-beye-ot-ik, anti-bee-ot-ik) A substance that destroys or inhibits the growth of microorganisms and is therefore used to treat some infections. One of the most familiar antibiotics is penicillin.

✥ Microorganisms that are initially treatable with antibiotics may evolve resistance as the more susceptible members of the population are killed off. (See resistance to antibiotics.)

antibiotics, resistance to The insensitivity to a particular antibiotic developed by the bacteria against which the antibiotic has been used repeatedly or over a long time. The process works by the ordinary rules of natural selection: that segment of the bacteria population that has a natural ability to counter the drug’s effect will survive, so that their genes eventually are shared by the entire population.

antibodies (an-ti-bod-eez) Proteins in the blood that are produced by the body in response to specific antigens (such as bacteria). (See immune system.)

anticoagulants (an-tee-koh-ag-yuh-luhnts, an-teyekoh-ag-yuh-luhnts) Substances that slow down or prevent blood clotting.

✥ Although there are many antidepressant drugs now in use, the best known is Prozac®.

antigens (an-ti-juhnz) Substances that are foreign to the body and cause the production of antibodies. Toxins, invading bacteria and viruses, and the cells of transplanted organs can all function as antigens.

antihistamines (an-tee-his-tuh-meenz, an-tee-histuh-muhnz) Drugs that counteract the effects of a substance in the body called histamine. The body releases histamine, which causes many of the symptoms associated with allergies (sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose), in response to external agents such as pollen.

antiseptics Substances that prevent or inhibit the growth of disease-causing microorganisms.

anus (ay-nuhs) The opening through which feces pass out of the body.

aorta (ay-awr-tuh) The main blood vessel of the body; it carries blood from the left side of the heart to other arteries throughout the body. (See circulatory system.)

appendectomy (ap-uhn-dek-tuh-mee) The surgical removal of the appendix.

appendicitis (uh-pen-duh-seye-tis) Inflammation of the appendix.

appendix A small saclike organ located at the upper end of the large intestine. The appendix has no known function in present-day humans, but it may have played a role in the digestive system in humans of earlier times. The appendix is also called the vermiform appendix because of its wormlike (“vermiform”) shape.

arteries Blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and to the body tissues. (Compare veins; see circulatory system.)

arteriosclerosis (ahr-teer-ee-oh-skluh-roh-sis) A disease commonly called hardening of the arteries. In arteriosclerosis, the walls of the arteries thicken and harden. The loss of flexibility results in a lessening of the flow of blood to the various organs of the body. (Compare atherosclerosis; see circulatory system.)

arthritis The inflammation of tissues in the joints (such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), usually resulting in pain and stiffness.

arthroscope (ahr-thruh-skohp) A surgical instrument that uses fiber optics to allow physicians to see and perform surgery inside joints. The surgery involves only the insertion of a small tube into the joint.

✥ Arthroscopic surgery allows rapid recovery, and one often sees it mentioned with regard to injuries of athletes.

ascorbic acid (uh-skawr-bik) A form of vitamin C.

asthma (az-muh) A chronic disease of the respiratory system, characterized by sudden, recurring attacks of difficult breathing, wheezing, and coughing. During an attack, the bronchial tubes go into spasms, becoming narrower and less able to move air into the lungs. Various substances to which the sufferer has an allergy, such as animal hair, dust, pollen, or certain foods, can trigger an attack.

astigmatism (uh-stig-muh-tiz-uhm) A condition in which the curvature of the cornea of the eye is uneven, causing a blurring of vision. Astigmatism is normally corrected by glasses.

atherosclerosis (ath-uh-roh-skluh-roh-sis) A form of arteriosclerosis in which the arteries become clogged by the buildup of fatty substances, which eventually reduces the flow of blood to the tissues. These fatty substances, called plaque, are made up largely of cholesterol. (Compare arteriosclerosis; see circulatory system.)

✥ The term is also used in a more general way to refer to a wasting process: “Since he stopped playing, his piano skills have atrophied.”

Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) A disorder characterized by a difficulty in retaining focus, especially on tasks, for long periods of time.

✥ One of the most common reasons children are brought into therapy, ADD is often treated with the somewhat controversial drug Ritalin®, which is thought to work by stimulating the attention-focusing structures of the brain.

auditory nerve The nerve that connects the inner ear with the brain. One of its two branches carries the sensation of sound to the brain; the other is involved in maintaining balance.

autism A psychiatric disorder marked by deficits in communication and social interaction.

autoimmune disease A disease in which the body produces antibodies that attack its own tissues, leading to the deterioration and in some cases to the destruction of such tissue.

autonomic nervous system (aw-tuh-nom-ik) The part of the nervous system that controls involuntary functions of the body (those not controlled consciously), such as digestion, the beating of the heart, and the operation of glands in the endocrine system.

AZT (ay-zee-tee) A drug used in the treatment of AIDS. It does not cure the disease but does prolong the life of the patient in some cases.

bacterial infection An infection caused by bacte ria. The growth of many disease-causing bacteria can be halted by the use of antibiotics. (Compare viral infection.)

✥ Diseases caused by bacterial infections include diphtheria, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever.

balanced diet A diet that contains the proper proportions of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water necessary to maintain good health.

barbiturates (bahr-bich-uh-rits, bahr-bich-uh-rayts) Substances derived from an organic compound that are used as sedatives and sleep inducers. Barbiturates, which work by depressing the activity of the central nervous system, are sometimes used in the treatment of illnesses such as epilepsy.

benign (bi-neyen) A descriptive term for conditions that present no danger to life or well-being. Benign is the opposite of malignant.

✥ The term benign is used when describing tumors or growths that do not threaten the health of an individual.

bile A bitter fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is discharged into the small intestine when needed to aid in the digestion of fats (see digestive system).

✥ Bile is sometimes used figuratively to denote bitterness in general: “His writing was full of bile.”

bile ducts The passages in the liver and gallbladder that move bile into the duodenum.

biofeedback (beye-oh-feed-bak) A training technique by which a person learns how to regulate certain body functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure, or brain wave patterns, that are normally considered to be involuntary. The person learns by watching special monitoring instruments attached to the body that record changes in these functions.

✥ Biofeedback has had some success in the treatment of such disorders as chronic headaches and back pain.

biological clock The innate rhythm of behavior and body activity in living things. A twenty-four-hour cycle of body activity, which operates in some organisms, is called the circadian rhythm.

✥ Although the term biological clock refers to all innate timing mechanisms, it is often used when describing certain body functions that are subject to this rhythm, such as the loss of fertility with age.

bipolar disorder Also known as manic-depressive illness. This psychiatric disorder is marked by periods of euphoric (manic) highs often followed by periods of depression.

black lung A chronic disease of the lungs caused by inhaling coal dust over long periods. Common among coal miners, black lung is an examle of an occupational disease.

bladder A stretchable saclike structure in the body that holds fluids. The term is used most often to refer to the urinary bladder, which is part of the excretory system. Another kind of bladder is the gallbladder.

blind spot A small region in the visual field (the area scanned by the eye) that cannot be seen. The blind spot corresponds to an area in the eye where the optic nerve enters the retina.

✥ In a general sense, the term is used to refer to an inability to see things that might be obvious to another observer: “He has a blind spot as far as his daughter’s behavior is concerned.”

blood The fluid circulating through the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries of the circulatory system. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body and removes waste materials and carbon dioxide. It is composed of plasma (mainly water, but with a mixture of hormones, nutrients, gases, antibodies, and wastes), red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cells (which help combat infection), and platelets (which help the blood clot).

# blood group See blood type.

blood pressure The pressure of the blood against the walls of the blood vessels, especially the arteries. It is expressed in two figures, said to be one “over” the other: the systolic pressure, which is the pressure when the left ventricle of the heart contracts to push the blood through the body; and the diastolic pressure, which is the pressure when the ventricle relaxes and fills with blood. Blood pressure is affected by the strength of the heartbeat, the volume of blood in the body, the elasticity of the blood vessels, and the age and general health of the person. (See circulatory system.)

blood type One of many groups into which a person’s blood can be categorized, based on the presence or absence of specific antigens in the blood. Blood type is inherited.

✥ Blood transfusions can be given only between donors and recipients who have compatible types; if the types are not compatible, the blood of the recipient forms antibodies against the blood of the donor. There are four basic groupings — A, B, AB, and O — and within these groupings, the Rh factor may be present or absent.

blood vessels The flexible tubular canals through which blood circulates in the body. Arteries, veins, and capillaries are all kinds of blood vessels. (See circulatory system.)

# bone marrow See marrow.

botulism (boch-uh-liz-uhm) A severe form of food poisoning, often fatal if not treated quickly. Botulism is caused by a kind of bacterium that produces a toxin, and it is sometimes present in improperly canned or preserved foods.

brain The central organ in the nervous system, protected by the skull. The brain consists of the medulla, which sends signals from the spinal cord to the rest of the brain and also controls the autonomic nervous system; the pons, a mass of nerve fibers connected to the medulla; the cerebellum, which controls balance and coordination; and the cerebrum, the outer layer of which, the cerebral cortex, is the location of memory, sight, speech, and other higher functions.

The cerebrum contains two hemispheres (the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere), each of which controls different functions. In general, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body and such functions as spatial perception, whereas the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and functions such as speech.

Under the cerebral cortex are the thalamus, the main relay center between the medulla and the cere

✥ From  to , a disease known as the Black Death, similar to the bubonic plague, entered Europe from Asia and killed a large percentage of the population, sometimes wiping out entire towns. It caused widespread social changes in Europe.

bulimia An eating disorder that is characterized by episodic binge eating followed by feelings of guilt or depression and sometimes self-induced vomiting.

bursa (bur-suh) A fluid-filled sac or cavity that reduces friction between the bones, ligaments, and tendons in the body’s joints.

bursitis (buhr-seye-tis) Inflammation of a bursa. Common locations of bursitis include the joints of the shoulder, knee, and elbow.

cancer A disease characterized by rapid growth of cells in the body, often in the form of a tumor. Cancer is invasive — that is, it can spread to surrounding tissues. Although this disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, research has provided considerable insight into its many causes (which may include diet, viruses, or environmental factors) and options for treatment (which include radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and possibly gene therapy).

✥ The term cancer is often used to describe a nonmedical condition that is undesirable, destructive, and invasive: “Watergate was a cancer on the presidency.”

canines (kay-neyenz) The pointed teeth in the front of the mouth (two on the top and two on the bottom) next to the incisors. These teeth are also known as the eyeteeth.

capillaries (kap-uh-ler-eez) The tiny blood vessels throughout the body that connect arteries and veins. Capillaries form an intricate network around body tissues in order to distribute oxygen and nutrients to the cells and remove waste substances. (See circulatory system.)

More recently, electric stimulation to the heart (using devices called defibrillators) has greatly increased the efficacy of this technique.

cardiovascular (kahr-dee-oh-vas-kyuh-luhr) A descriptive term for the heart and the blood vessels.

carpal tunnel syndrome A repetitive stress injury to the wrist and hands often caused by typing on an ergonomically unsound keyboard. In this case, pain is thought to occur when swelling and scarring from the repetitive motion of typing compresses the nerves in the wrist. It is an example of an occupational disease.

cartilage (kahr-tl-ij) A kind of tough but elastic connective tissue that can withstand considerable pressure. It makes up portions of the skeletal system, such as the linings of the joints, where it cushions against shock. Cartilage is also found in other body structures, such as the nose and external ear.

Cesarean section (si-zair-ee-uhn) Childbirth by surgical removal of the fetus through an incision made in the wall of the abdomen and in the uterus, usually used as an alternative when natural delivery through the vagina is considered risky. The number of Cesarean sections in the United States has increased sharply in recent years, causing concern among patients, surgeons, and insurers.

✥ The term derives from the traditional belief that Julius Caesar was born by this method. ✥ The procedure is often referred to colloquially as a ${ } ^ { \infty } \mathrm { C }$ -section.”

chemotherapy (kee-moh-ther-uh-pee) The treatment of disease with chemicals. The term chemotherapy often refers to a kind of treatment for cancer in which chemicals are administered to destroy cancer cells.

$\clubsuit$ There are often side effects to chemotherapy, a common one being the temporary loss of hair.

chronic fatigue syndrome A condition characterized by fatigue over an extended period, sometimes accompanied by neurologic abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is unknown.

circadian rhythm (suhr-kay-dee-uhn) An activity cycle lasting twenty-four hours. Many living things, including humans, follow a circadian rhythm. (See biological clock.)

circulatory system The system in the body by which blood and lymph are circulated. The parts of the circulatory system include the heart, along with all the arteries, veins, and capillaries. The organs of the lymphatic system are also considered to be part of the circulatory system. Nutrients, oxygen, and other vital substances are carried throughout the body by the blood, which is pumped by rhythmic contractions of the heart. Blood is pumped from the heart to the arteries, which branch into smaller and smaller vessels as they move away from the heart. The blood passes oxygen and nutrients to the cells and picks up waste in the capillaries, then returns to the heart via a system of veins.

circumcision (sur-kuhm-sizh-uhn) The surgical removal of the skin that covers the tip of the penis, usually performed soon after birth. Although circumcision is common in the United States, the procedure is no longer widely recommended as a medical necessity by physicians.

✥ Circumcision is performed as a religious ceremony by Jews and Muslims.

cirrhosis (suh-roh-sis) A chronic disease of the liver, characterized by replacement of normal liver cells with a form of connective tissue. Owing to the scarring caused by this disease, irreversible damage to the liver can result.

✥ Cocaine use constitutes a major drug problem in the United States.

codeine (koh-deen) A drug obtained from opium or morphine that is used as a pain reliever and cough remedy.

colitis (kuh-leye-tis) An inflammation of the mucous membrane that lines the colon. Colitis is characterized by pain in the abdomen, with alternating episodes of constipation and diarrhea.

colon The middle and longest part of the large intestine. (See digestive system.)

colorblindness A defect in perception of colors, caused by a deficiency of certain specialized cells in the retina that are sensitive to different colors. The condition may be partial (as in “red-green colorblindness,” in which a person cannot distinguish red from green), or complete (in which the person sees all colors as gray).

✥ By extension, the law is said to be colorblind in its judgments, which are supposed to ignore a defendant’s race.

coma (koh-muh) An abnormal state of deep unconsciousness. A coma may occur as the result of trauma to the head, disease (such as meningitis, stroke, or diabetes mellitus), or poisoning.

✥ The word coronary is often used by itself in an informal sense to refer to a heart attack or coronary thrombosis.

coronary arteries The two arteries that supply blood to the heart tissue.

coronary bypass surgery A surgical procedure to restore normal blood supply to the heart by creating new routes for the blood to travel into the heart when one or both of the coronary arteries have become clogged or obstructed (possibly due to atherosclerosis). These new routes are created by removing blood vessels from another part of the body (most often the veins of the leg) and grafting them onto the heart to bypass the clogged arteries.

diarrhea (deye-uh-ree-uh) The frequent passage of abnormally watery feces, which is a sign of illness.

dietary supplement The wide assortment of minerals, vitamins, and sundry herbs that are taken as nutritional supplements to regular food.

✥ There has been a rapid increase in the use of supplements since the early s, leading to debates over whether or how tightly such supplements should be regulated by the FDA. (At this writing, because they are not medicines, they need not pass the stringent tests that medicines must undergo).

digestion The breaking down of food, which is made up of complex organic molecules, into smaller molecules that the body can absorb and use for maintenance and growth.

digestive system The organs and glands in the body that are responsible for digestion. The digestive system begins with the mouth and extends through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, ending with the rectum and anus.

fats Organic compounds that serve as a reserve of energy for the body. Fat is stored in the body’s fat tissues, which provide support, protection, and insulation for the body and its organs. A balanced diet must include some fats because, in addition to providing energy for the body, they are necessary for the absorption of certain vitamins.

✥ Many people consume too much fat in their diet; this imbalance can contribute to various diseases (such as disorders of the heart). Some fats, called saturated fats, have been found to raise the level of cholesterol in the blood, whereas other fats, called unsaturated fats, may help reduce blood cholesterol levels.

feces (fee-seez) Excrement; the waste material that is passed to the outside from the rectum through the anus.

fight or flight reaction The set of processes that occur in the body when it is confronted with some form of physical or mental stress. For example, if a person is faced with danger (as from a vicious animal about to attack), the nervous system signals for adrenaline and other hormones to be released into the blood. These hormones prepare the body either to confront the attacking animal or to flee to safety (thus, “fight or flight”). Changes in the body include increased heart rate, dilated pupils of the eye (to improve vision), and increased supply of blood to the muscles (to prepare the body for action).

FMRI Abbreviation for functional magnetic resonance imaging. In FMRI, a patient is placed in a high magnetic field and delicate measurements of magnetic fields associated with processes like blood flow are made. In this way, the functioning of organs like the brain can be monitored as they occur. (Compare MRI.)

genetic testing A process in which a person’s or an embryo’s DNA is isolated and tested for the presence of specific genes or defects that could indicate the future onset of some disease.

$\clubsuit$ In the United States, genetic testing is most often performed on alert prospective parents for possible problems during a pregnancy or the likelihood of congenital disease in a future child. The privacy of the results is one of the many difficult issues with this practice, particularly as it relates to insurance underwriting.

genitals The organs involved in reproduction. (See reproductive systems.)

German measles An acute and contagious disease, caused by a virus, producing symptoms milder than those usually associated with measles.

✥ German measles can cause severe congenital defects in the developing embryo or fetus of a woman who contracts the disease in her first three months of pregnancy.

✥ Queen Victoria of Britain, whose descendants have been kings and queens of several countries in Europe, carried the gene for hemophilia, which has turned up repeatedly in royal families since her lifetime. Her great-grandson, the heir to the throne of Russia, suffered from the disease, and his parents fell under the influence of the monk Grigori Rasputin in hopes of a miraculous cure. The resulting chaos in the government of Russia helped bring on the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union.

hepatitis (hep-uh-teye-tis) An inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis is most often caused by a virus, but it can be the result of exposure to certain toxic agents, such as drugs or chemicals. One viral form of the disease is spread by contaminated food and water, and other forms by contaminated injection needles and blood transfusions. Symptoms of hepatitis include fever and jaundice.

humor An archaic term for any fluid substance in the body, such as blood, lymph, or bile.

✥ Physicians in the Middle Ages believed that four principal humors — blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile — controlled body functions and that a person’s temperament resulted from the humor that was most prevalent in the body. Sanguine people were controlled by blood, phlegmatic people by phlegm, choleric people by yellow bile (also known as “choler”), and melancholic people by black bile (also known as “melancholy”).

hymen (heye-muhn) A thin fold of mucous membrane that covers all or part of the entrance to the vagina.

kidney stones Small, hard masses that form by chemical precipitation and are found in the kidneys. Kidney stones vary in size, with most of them being small enough to pass through the urinary tract for elimination in the urine. Some, however, may be large enough to obstruct the kidney and cause tremendous pain.

kidneys A pair of organs, the principal parts of the excretory system, located above the waistline at the back of the abdominal cavity. The kidneys filter waste materials from the blood, excreting these wastes in the form of urine; they also regulate the amounts of water and other chemicals in body fluids.

knee-jerk reflex A sudden involuntary forward movement of the lower leg that can be produced by a firm tap to the tendon located just below the kneecap.

✥ The term is loosely applied to any response or belief that is automatic rather than thoughtful. In this sense, it is usually a term of reproach: “Smith is a kneejerk liberal.”

liver A large organ, located on the right side of the abdomen and protected by the lower rib cage, that produces bile and blood proteins, stores vitamins for later release into the bloodstream, removes toxins (including alcohol) from the blood, breaks down old red blood cells, and helps maintain levels of blood sugar in the body.

lobotomy (luh-bot-uh-mee, loh-bot-uh-mee) A surgical incision into one or more of the nerve masses in the front of the brain. A lobotomy may be performed for the relief of certain mental disorders, although it has been largely abandoned in favor of less radical treatments.

✥ Because people who have had a lobotomy often become quite passive after the operation, the term is often used to refer to someone who shows a lack of response or reaction: “She was so tired she just sat there as if she had been lobotomized.”

local anesthetic An anesthetic that causes loss of sensation only to the area to which it is applied. (Compare general anesthetic.)

LSD A drug, lysergic acid diethylamide, that produces hallucinations similar to those of a psychosis. Persons on LSD “trips,” which may last for many hours, undergo distortions of their perceptions of space and time and may lose all contact with reality.

ultrasound A method of diagnosing illness and viewing internal body structures in which sound waves of high frequency are bounced off internal organs and tissues from outside the body. The technique measures different amounts of resistance the body parts offer to the sound waves, and then uses the data to produce a “picture” of the structures. Ultrasound is often used to obtain an image of the developing fetus in pregnant women; the image can confirm the presence of twins or triplets and can be used to diagnose some abnormalities.

$\clubsuit$ When an image of the inside of the body is needed, ultrasound is often considered a safer alternative to x-rays. Like $\mathbf { X }$ -rays, ultrasound involves exposure of the body to a form of radiation; unlike x-rays, ultrasound has not been shown to be carcinogenic.

The umbilical cord contains the blood vessels that supply the embryo or fetus with nutrients and remove waste products. Connected to the abdomen of the embryo or fetus, the umbilical cord is cut at birth, leaving a small depression — the navel, or “belly button.”

✥ The detaching of the umbilical cord provides a figure of speech for new independence: “He finally cut the umbilical cord and moved out of his parents’ home.”

unsaturated fats A kind of fat in which one or more pairs of electrons in the atoms making up the fat molecule form a bond with a pair of electrons from another atom (a double bond). There are two kinds of unsaturated fats: monounsaturated, which contain one double bond; and polyunsaturated, which contain two or more double bonds. Monounsaturated fats are found in peanuts, peanut butter, olives, and avocados. Polyunsaturated fats, which are usually liquid at room temperature, are found in oils such as corn, sunflower, and soybean.

✥ Unsaturated fats are generally regarded to be healthier in the diet than saturated fats because they may help lower the level of cholesterol in the blood.

An important part of a balanced diet, vitamins occur naturally in foods and may be added to processed foods to increase their nutritional value. Many vitamins have been identified, and each plays a specific role in the functioning of the body. For example, vitamin C is needed for the proper healing of wounds and broken bones; vitamin A helps the body resist infection. Some vitamins are so important that without them certain diseases or conditions could develop. For example, a deficiency of vitamin D may cause rickets, and a deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm { B } _ { 1 2 }$ could result in a form of anemia.

✥ These teeth are associated with wisdom because they appear during the late teens or early twenties, when a person is physically mature. Often, the wisdom teeth may not rise above the gum line, but remain impacted in the jaw, causing inflammation. If this impaction occurs, or if they pose a threat to other teeth, the wisdom teeth may need to be removed.

# Technology

![](img/fb233f2d6d24cd6042d036641969244889e21d9d7a5b6aef8287bec165dee923.jpg)

There are two reasons to pursue scientific knowledge: for the sake of the knowledge itself, and for the practical uses of that knowledge. Because this second aspect of science affects the lives of most people, it is more familiar than the first. Knowledge must be gained, however, before it can be applied, and often the most important technological advances arise from research pursued for its own sake.

Traditionally, new technology has been concerned with the construction of machines, structures, and tools on a relatively large scale. The development of materials for building bridges or skyscrapers is an example of this, as is the development of the internal-combustion engine and the nuclear reactor. While such activities involve all the sciences, from chemistry to nuclear physics, the overriding goal has been the same: to improve the human condition by finding better ways to deal with the macroscopic world.

Since World War II, the focus of technological activity has undergone a major change. While the old activities are still pursued, they have been largely superseded by applications of technology at the microscopic level. Instead of building large-scale structures and machines, modern technology tends to concentrate on finding improved ways to transfer information and to develop new materials by studying the way atoms come together. The silicon chip and microelectronics typify this new technological trend, as does the blossoming of genetic engineering. The advent of the Internet is just one familiar consequence of this new trend, which can be expected to continue into the foreseeable future.

The dividing line between what we include in the following list as technology and what we call science elsewhere in this volume is somewhat arbitrary. In general, what we have done is this: if a term is essential to understanding a particular branch of science, it appears in the list for that science. Thus, atom appears with the physical sciences, even though an understanding of atoms is clearly important to the new technology. If, however, the term involves something that is likely to affect an individual’s life, even though it is not a central concept of a particular branch of science, it is listed under “Technology.”

# Space Shuttle

space shuttle A vehicle built by NASA that is capable of taking off from Earth, carrying a crew and a cargo into space, and returning to Earth to be used again. It is used primarily to transport a crew to an orbiting space station and to deploy and retrieve satellites.

✥ The space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff in . All seven crew members died in the accident.

space station A structure being assembled in space by an international partnership led by NASA. The space station will be a permanent habitat at which scientific and technological work can be carried out. Building a space station is considered the next step in the development and exploration of space, although there is controversy concerning its cost and the value of the research that will be carried out there.

spam Unsolicited, undesired e-mail. Also used as a verb. Spam is the e-mail version of junk mail.

✥ The name comes from a Monty Python comedy skit about a restaurant that served only Spam.

The Spirit of St. Louis The specially designed airplane that Charles Lindbergh flew in the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. It is on display in a museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

spreadsheet Table of data arranged in columns and rows often used in business and financial applications. Spreadsheet software programs are widely used computer applications that allow the user to organize large amounts of data.

Sputniks (spoot-niks, sput-niks) A series of Soviet satellites launched in  and in following years. These were the first artificial satellites.

✥ The appearance of Sputnik stimulated a great deal of effort in the education of scientists and engineers in the United States. This period is now referred to as the post-Sputnik boom.

SST A commercial aircraft that flies faster than the speed of sound; SST stands for supersonic transport. The Concorde, developed by the British and French, is an example of an SST.

stealth technology The use of advanced design and specialized materials to make an aircraft difficult or even impossible to detect by radar.

$\clubsuit$ Stealth aircraft were used for the first time in the Persian Gulf War, where they were highly successful. ✥ The term is now used to refer more generally to something that remains hidden or unknown: “This is a stealth proposal: no one knows what it means.”

streamline The line traced by a liquid or gas as it moves. Streamlines are most commonly used in describing the flow of a liquid or gas around a solid object.

✥ A “streamlined” design is one in which objects that move through a gas or liquid are shaped to match these lines, and therefore reduce the energy required to produce that motion.

superconductivity (sooh-puhr-kon-duk-tiv-uh-tee) A property of some materials in which their electrical resistance drops to zero, and they acquire the ability to carry electric current with no loss of energy whatsoever. Formerly, materials developed superconductivity only at temperatures near absolute zero, but new materials have been found that remain superconductive at temperatures above those of liquid nitrogen. The goal of current research is to find a material that remains superconductive at room temperature.

superconductor A material that can develop superconductivity.

✥ Superconductors are used to make large electromagnets, and they are starting to play a major role in industry.

surfing the Web To navigate through the World Wide Web or Internet, usually by clicking with a mouse. The term also has a generic meaning of spending time on the Internet.

synfuels (sin-fyooh-uhlz) Short for synthetic fuels. Synfuels are substances made through the extraction of petroleum or coal from minerals found in the western United States.

✥ The cost of synfuels is presently too high to make them commercially attractive.

synthetic polymers (pol-uh-muhrz) Industrially produced chemical substances consisting of a number of molecules linked together with covalent bonds. Examples include plastics, synthetic fibers such as synthetic rubber.

telemetry (tuh-lem-uh-tree) Automatic measurement and transmission of data or information by such means as wire or (more commonly today) microwave relays from the source to a distant receiver.

✥ Satellites transmit their data by telemetry.

thermal pollution The dumping of heated gases or heated wastewater (often from electrical generating plants) into the air or water.

✥ Thermal pollution of the air can affect the weather; thermal pollution of water can threaten plants or animals living in it.

thermocouple A device for accurate measurement of temperature. A thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metals joined at two joints in a loop so that the difference in voltage can be measured. Because voltage changes in proportion to temperature, the voltage difference indicates temperature differences.

thermonuclear A term referring to devices that use nuclear fusion, the fusion of atomic nuclei, to produce energy at very high temperatures. (See hydrogen bomb.)

thermostat A device that monitors and automatically responds to changes in temperature and activates switches controlling devices such as furnaces or air conditioners.

Three Mile Island The location of an accident in  in a nuclear power plant — an electrical generator powered by a nuclear reactor — in Pennsylvania. The plant underwent a partial meltdown that resulted in very little leakage of radiation into the atmosphere, panic among nearby residents, losses of billions of dollars, and intense criticism of nuclear power programs in general. (Compare Chernobyl.)

transformer A device used to transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another. With an alternating current, a transformer will either raise or lower the voltage as it makes the transfer.

transistor An electronic device that can work as an amplifier, transforming weak electrical signals into strong ones. It is normally made from silicon or other semiconductors.

✥ The transistor is the basic device used in miniaturized electronic systems, such as portable radios, or as a fast switch in computers.

Turing test A test proposed by British mathematician Alan Turing, and often taken as a test of whether a computer has humanlike intelligence. If a panel of human beings conversing with an unknown entity (via keyboard, for example) believes that that entity is human, and if the entity is actually a computer, then the computer is said to have passed the Turing test.

UHF (ultra high frequency) Radio waves with frequencies that run between  and , megahertz. (Compare VHF.)

universal time The measure of time obtained from the rotation of the Earth, also known as Greenwich mean time, after the Greenwich Observatory in England. The world’s time standard today is Coordinated Universal Time, which is kept by atomic clocks. The two universal times are kept in synchronization by the occasional insertion of leap seconds into the year.

URL An abbreviation for Universal Resource Locator, a title that refers to the formal address of a document on the Internet.

V-chip A congressionally mandated embedded microchip for television sets that automatically blocks sexual or violent programming when activated.

✥ As of , all TV sets sold in the United States contained a V-chip.

VHF (very high frequency) Radio waves with frequencies between  and  megahertz. (Compare UHF.)

Viking spacecraft Two spacecraft launched by NASA that landed on Mars in the late s, sending back photographs and experimental reports about the planet’s surface.

virtual reality The creation of images and tactile sensations by means of a computer, producing the illusion of reality. Images are often projected onto special goggles to strengthen the illusion. (See cyberspace.)

virus See computer virus.

voice recognition technology Technology that allows a computer to recognize different spoken words. The process can be divided into two main parts: the actual phonetic recognition of different words, and the construction of or interpretation of the actual language as spoken, a field called natural language processing. (See biometrics.)

✥ One goal of this technology is to offer an alternative to the keyboard as a means of data input for computers. It is also increasingly used to interact with the public, as seen in the increasing use of this technology to replace humans in many customer service operations.

volt (vohlt) The unit of electromotive force, the volt measures how much “pressure” there is in an electric circuit. The higher the voltage, the more electrical current will flow in the circuit.

$\clubsuit$ Ordinary household outlets are usually rated at  volts, car batteries at  volts, and flashlight batteries at . volts.

vulcanization An industrial process that strengthens natural rubber. Because it requires great heat, the process was named after the Roman god of fire, Vulcan.

Watt, James A Scottish engineer active in the eighteenth century. Watt invented the modern version of the steam engine.

weapons of mass destruction Weapons that can produce devastating results when delivered in a single strike. They include nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.

$\clubsuit$ One of the great challenges of the twenty-first century will be to constrain the proliferation and use of such weapons, especially by terrorists (see terrorism).

Web See Internet.

Web address The location on the Internet of a certain company, server, or file. (See URL.)

Web browser A software program that facilitates entry to and usage of the Internet.

Web page A document with its own address on the Internet. It has become customary for companies, organizations, and individuals to create their own Web pages — in effect, explaining themselves to the world.

Web site See Web page.

Whitney, Eli An American inventor of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Whitney invented the cotton gin, a device for processing raw cotton.

wireless technology A technology, such as cell phones, that uses radio waves to transmit and receive data. It is used increasingly for data transmission.

World Wide Web See Internet.

Wright brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright, American mechanics and inventors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, who achieved the first sustained flight of a heavier-than-air machine — what we today call an airplane. Their flight was made at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in .

WWW An abbreviation for World Wide Web.

Yucca Mountain A site in Nevada designed for the permanent storage of nuclear waste, although none had yet been stored there as of .

✥ The decision to actually store waste at Yucca Mountain remains politically charged.
