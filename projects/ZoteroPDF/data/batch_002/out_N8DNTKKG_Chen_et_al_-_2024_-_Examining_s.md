# ABSTRACT

The present study tested whether the switch costs of production-based language switching tasks by trilinguals are due to competition from outside language schemas or from within language systems. We recruited 90 Tibetan-Chinese-English trilinguals in 10th grade in a Tibetan middle school in China to name digits and number words using different stimuli valence. The study was divided into three experiments, one for each combination of two languages possible amongst Tibetan, Chinese and English. We observed the switch cost symmetrical patterns in the three experiments. The results suggest that the sources of switch cost are partially from outside competition between language schemas and partially from within language system. These results may contribute to our understanding of the language control mechanism between production-based and comprehension-based language switching tasks and language control mechanism of trilinguals with three orthographically different languages.

# Introduction

The literature indicates two types of accounts concerning the attribution of bilingual switch cost asymmetry. One type of account attributes the switch cost asymmetry to the outside competition between language task schemas (e.g. Green 1998; Li and Gollan 2022; Orfanidou and Sumner 2005; Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti 2016; Thomas and Allport 2000). According to this account, each of the bilingual’s languages is associated with a language task schema and when bilinguals use their two languages, the target language is selected whereas the non-target language is inhibited. Overcoming the inhibition of the inhibited language will cause a switch cost. The relative amounts of the switch costs of the two languages depend on their strength. The stronger the language is, the greater the inhibition will need to be, and hence the greater the cost will be to overcome.1 These accounts have been supported by studies that have found an asymmetric switch cost pattern where the switch cost to L1 is larger than the switch cost to L2 (e.g. Chen and Liu 2020; Costa and Santesteban 2004; Costa, Santesteban, and Ivanova 2006; Meuter and Allport 1999; Mosca and De Bot 2017; Philipp, Gade, and Koch 2007).

If the switch cost is attributed to the outside competition between language task schemas, the symmetric patterns of switch cost in language comprehension and production should be different. When bilinguals use their languages, the language to be used as well as the specific configuration of the language system used to perform the language task will be determined by language schemas (Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti 2016). Different language tasks activate different configurations of the language system. For instance, in language comprehension tasks such as lexical decision or semantic categorization, the configuration of orthographic or semantic systems is used to perform the task, whereas in language production tasks such as picture naming or digit naming, the semantic system and the phonological system are used (e.g. Green 1998; Meuter and Allport 1999; Von Studnitz and Green 2002). For unbalanced bilinguals, the experience on the configuration of different language systems that are used to perform language tasks is different, resulting in relative language schemas strength. In language production, since unbalanced bilinguals practice much more L1 output then L2, the strength of the language task schema of phonological configuration in L1 will be stronger than L2. Thus it is possible that asymmetrical switch costs will be observed in production-based language switching in unbalanced bilinguals. However, since language comprehension tasks such as lexical decision or semantic categorization are novel (they are not the usual ways people use language) and similarly less experienced by the two languages for unbalanced bilinguals, the strength of the language task schemas should not be unbalanced, yielding symmetrical switch costs despite the relative strength of the two languages (Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti 2016).

A short review of studies on unbalanced bilingual language switch cost has revealed the general trend that symmetrical switch costs were observed in language comprehension tasks for unbalanced bilinguals (e.g. Chen et al. 2020; Declerck and Gollan 2020; Macizo, Bajo, and Paolieri 2012; Orfanidou and Sumner 2005; Thomas and Allport 2000; Von Studnitz and Green 1997; Von Studnitz and Green 2002) whereas asymmetrical switch costs were observed in language production tasks (Chen et al. 2022; Costa and Santesteban 2004; Fink and Goldrick 2015; Jackson et al. 2001; Jackson et al. 2004; Martin et al. 2013; Meuter and Allport 1999; Philipp, Gade, and Koch 2007; Verhoef, Roelofs, and Chwilla 2009). However, one might argue that this difference is possibly the consequence of the methodological differences in speech production and language comprehension since the two types of tasks used different stimuli types: in speech production the bivalent stimuli were used while in comprehension the univalent stimuli were used. Bivalent stimuli contain no language specific information and are used to respond in both language tasks, whereas univalent stimuli contain language specific information and are used to respond to a single language task (Finkbeiner et al. 2006; Orfanidou and Sumner 2005; Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti 2016). It is thus possible that the univalent words in language comprehension tasks may eliminate the switch cost asymmetry because they specify the orthographic information and thus trigger the appropriate language more directly than pictures or digits that are used in speech production tasks, and therefore do not require the same level of non-target language inhibition (Grainger, Midgley, and Holcomb 2010).

One of the aims of the present study is to test whether language switch cost asymmetry is, at least partially, from the outside competition between language schemas. Specifically, it is to test whether the difference of switch cost pattern between language production and comprehension is due to the stimuli differences (i.e. bivalent stimuli in production while univalent stimuli in comprehension) or is a consequence of different language control processes specifying the outside competition between language task schemas. The present study requires trilingual participants to name digits and number words with a combination of two of their languages. Since digits are bivalent stimuli and number words are univalent stimuli, if our study observes the same asymmetrical switch costs pattern when naming the two stimuli, it means that stimuli valence will not affect switch cost patterns. In other words, even univalent stimuli will not eliminate the switch cost asymmetry and hence the difference between production and comprehension should not be due to methodological differences. Instead, the difference may be due to language control differences, which is consistent with the accounts that bilingual language switch costs are caused by outside language competition of language task schemas. If our study finds asymmetrical switch costs in naming digits but symmetrical switch costs in naming number words, the difference will be attributed to the methodological differences, which is inconsistent with the first account.

The second type of account attributes bilingual language switch cost asymmetry to competition within the language system (Chen et al. 2020; Grainger and Beauvillain 1987; Peeters et al. 2014; Van

Heuven, Dijkstra, and Grainger 1998). According to this account, the competition comes from the representations of lexicon within the language system rather than the language task schema. When bilinguals use two languages, the representations of the lexicon in both languages will be activated and the non-target language representations need to be inhibited in order for the target language to be used. For unbalanced bilinguals, the strength of the inhibition of the lexical representation of the stronger L1 in a switch trial n when L2 is used will be larger than the inhibition of L2 in trial n-1 when L1 is used. This stronger inhibition of L1 requires more efforts to reactivate the lexical representation of the language in trial $\mathsf n + \mathsf n \mathsf n \mathsf n $ when it is to be used. Therefore, asymmetrical switch costs should be observed for the unbalanced bilinguals (Grainger and Dijkstra 1992; Grainger, Midgley, and Holcomb 2010; Peeters et al. 2014; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, and Grainger 1998).

Unlike the first account implying that stimuli valence should not affect language task schemas and thus should not cause different switch cost symmetrical patterns in language production, the second account implies that stimuli valence should affect switch cost strength in language production tasks. This is because stimuli valence will affect the competition between lexical representations within the language system. Since bivalent stimuli contain no language specific information, they will activate the representations of both languages of bilinguals, and the selection of the appropriate language representation would require higher level of inhibition of the non-target language representation. In contrast to this, the univalent stimuli that contain specific language information will activate the representation of the target language easily but will not activate, or activate very little of, the non-target language (Declerck and Gollan 2020; Chen et al. 2020), requiring a lower level of inhibition of the non-target language.

The second aim of the present study is to test whether language switch cost asymmetry is, at least partially, from the competition within the language system. Specifically, it is to test whether or not there is a stimuli valence effect when trilinguals name digits and number words in any two of their languages. As described above, if there is a stimuli valence effect, we expect that the switch costs for the univalent stimuli should be smaller than that for the bivalent stimuli. This means that stimuli valence would affect the amount of the switch cost which is determined by the competition among lexical representations that are activated into different levels.

For the above two purposes, we adopted a triangular study paradigm where we designed three experiments each requiring a group of Tibetan-Chinese-English trilinguals to name digits or number words using two of their languages (e.g. Tibetan and Chinese in Exp.1, Tibetan and English in Exp. 2, Chinese and English in Exp. 3). For each experiment, we looked at both of the two above mentioned questions: whether or not there is switch costs asymmetry for either of the univalent and bivalent stimuli and whether there is a stimuli valence effect on the amount of the switch cost. We expect our study may contribute to better understanding of the sources of language switching costs in trilingual language production, namely, whether the switch costs are caused by competition within language system or by outside competition between language task schemas. This study would also shed light on the difference of language control processes in production-based and comprehension-based language switching. In addition, this study is one of the few relevant studies that has employed trilinguals as the participants, particularly Tibetan-Chinese-English trilinguals, whose three languages have notable orthographic differences.

# Experiment 1

# Participants

The participants were 30 Tibetan students (10th grade, 17 males and 13 females, mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 1 6 . 9$ years) recruited from a Tibetan senior high school in Western China. Tibetan (L1) is their mother tongue. As a national common language in China, Chinese (L2) education began when they were in kindergarten or at the beginning of primary school. English (L3) education, which is a compulsory subject, started either in Grade 3 or Grade 7 depending on the local educational condition. All the participants were given written informed consent for data collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and were paid for their participation.

Before the formal experiment, participants were required to self rate their proficiency in Tibetan, Chinese, and English in terms of listening, speaking, reading and writing based on a seven-point Likert scale (from 1 to 7, $\ 1 =$ unskilled, $7 =$ proficient). They were then asked to take a Language Background Questionnaire (Chen 2020). The self-evaluation showed that the mean scores, which were calculated by obtaining the mean across the four skills, for Tibetan, Chinese and English proficiency were respectively 6.70 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 3 ,$ , range from 6 to 7), 5.25 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 5$ , range from 4 to 6), and 3.40 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 9 ,$ range from 1 to 5). The variance test revealed a significant proficiency difference between Tibetan and Chinese, F $( 1 , 2 9 ) = 4 . 0 0 6$ , $p < . 0 1$ , between Tibetan and English proficiency, F $( 1 , 2 9 ) = 1 3 . 3 4 4 ,$ , $p < . 0 1$ , and between Chinese and English, F $( 1 , 2 9 ) = 5 . 2 6 1$ , $p < . 0 5$ . For current language use, participants reported an average percentage of $8 0 \%$ and $9 3 \%$ in and out of school for Tibetan, $1 6 \%$ and $7 \%$ for Chinese, and $4 \%$ and $0 \%$ for English.

# Materials and instruments

We used bivalent and univalent stimuli in Exp.1: the bivalent stimuli were Arabic numerals from 1 to 9; the univalent stimuli were correspondingly Tibetan number words (e.g. གཅིག, གཉིས།, གསུམ།, $z _ { 1 9 } ,$ ལྔ།, $5 \% < 5 \textcircled { < } \textcircled { > }$ $\cos 5 ( 5 \textcircled { \div } )$ and Chinese number words (e.g.-, , =, , , , -L, /, FL). The experimental equipment included a display screen, a Chronos Response Box, and a laptop computer. Stimulus presentation and response collection were performed using an E-prime 3.0 system connected to the Chronos Response Box. All stimuli were presented in black in the center of one of the four boxes in a $2 \times 2$ display grid in the screen of the laptop computer. Arabic numerals were displayed in Times New Roman font, Tibetan number words used Microsoft Himalaya, and Chinese number words used the standard typeface of Chinese. The color of the box was designed to indicate the appropriate response language in a given trial. Standard E-Prime colors were used: yellow for Tibetan and red for Chinese.

# Procedure

The entire experiment consisted of a practice section and a test section. Before the practice section, participants were given verbal and onscreen instructions on how to perform the task. After the participants understood the experimental requirements, they could press the space bar to enter the practice section. The practice section consisted of 15 trials including switch trials and repetition trials2 , univalent and bivalent stimuli. Participants were asked to name the stimulus as quickly and as accurately as possible according to the provided color cues. The formal test experiment was conducted once the correct rate of practice section reached $100 \%$ .

The $2 \times 2$ display grid was visible throughout the presentation of the various trials. For the formal test, each participant had to complete eight blocks of pseudo-randomized trials. Each block consisted of 53 trials, including both switch trials and repetition trials. The assignment of language for the first trial in each block was counterbalanced across participants. The first trial on each block was coded as null, and these trials and the 15 practice trials were excluded from the subsequent data analysis. The number of switch trials for each block ranged from 23 to 29. Each participant completed a total of 217 switch trials and 222 repetition trials. Each trial commenced with the presentation of the box cue. After ${ 2 5 0 } \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s } ,$ the target stimulus was presented inside the box. In the $2 \times 2$ display grid, the adjacent horizontal locations always corresponded to a single language. The upper two boxes were yellow, representing Tibetan; the lower two were red, representing Chinese.

Both types of univalent number words in Tibetan and Chinese only appeared in the corresponding colored box, while the bivalent Arabic numerals appeared at random in the middle of one of the four boxes. The bivalent Arabic numerals and Tibetan and Chinese number words were arranged randomly in the presentation. The stimulus was visible until a vocal response was provided by the participant. Next, the targeted stimulus disappeared, and the researcher started coding the vocal response using button press as correct, incorrect, or verbal disfluency. Once the reaction was coded, the researcher pressed the space bar to enter the subsequent trial. Following the completion of each block, participants had the opportunity to take a break. The entire experiment lasted approximately for 25–30 minutes. The specific experimental procedures are shown in Figure 1.

# Data collection and analysis

Three main independent variables were considered for statistical analyses: language (L1 vs. L2), trial type (switch trials vs. repetition trials), and stimulus type (univalent stimulus vs. bivalent stimulus). The dependent variables were reaction times (RTs) and error rates (ERs). Error analysis was performed manually for all trials by checking response markings (e.g. correct, incorrect, or verbal disfluencies) against target responses. Error numbers included both incorrect responses and any verbal disfluencies (e.g. partial responses, shuttering, or utterance repairs). Reaction times were measured as the interval between the display of the stimulus and the start of a vocal response by participants speaking to the microphone connected to a Chronos Response Box that was used to set off the recording of time in E-prime. Only the correct responses were used for the analysis of reaction times.

Before the RTs data were analyzed, the following data were deleted: the first trial in each block, extremely quick $( < 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s } )$ or abnormally slow $( > 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s } )$ , data with invalid naming (false start, hesitation, coughing, etc.), items that were named incorrectly and a trial after each incorrect trial, and reaction times above or below three standard deviations from the mean (per participant). In total, $9 . 8 1 \%$ of the data were excluded, leaving 11,467 trials for further analysis, in which the numbers of L1 repetitions, L2-to-L1 switches, L2 repetitions, and L1-to-L2 switches were largely equal. We used linear mixed-effect models (Baayen 2008) with Item and Participant as random effects. We included random intercepts of both random effects in the model. In terms of random slopes, we included by-participant and by-item slopes. For fixed effects, we entered Language (L1 vs. L2), Trial type (switch vs. repetition), and Stimuli valence (univalent vs. bivalent). The models were fitted with the lmer function from the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2014) in the R statistical computing environment.

For ERs analysis, the following data was excluded: the first trial in each block, extremely quick $( < 2 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m s } )$ or abnormally slow $( > 2 0 0 0 \mathrm { m s } )$ , data with invalid naming (false start, hesitation, coughing, etc.), and reaction times above or below three standard deviations from the mean (per participant). A total of $7 . 6 1 \%$ of the data was excluded, leaving 12,158 trials for further analysis. We fitted the logistic mixed models (Jaeger 2008) with the glmer function in the R environment, with Participant and Item as random factors, and Language, Trial type, and Stimuli valence as fixed factors.

Table 1 shows the RTs of participants naming digits and number words using Tibetan and Chinese in Exp. 1. The mixed-effect model analysis showed, consistent with our participants being unbalanced bilinguals, that there was a main effect of language type, $\beta = 1 0 8 . 5 8 7$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 7 . 8 0 8$ , $t =$ 3.905, $p = . 0 0 1$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ . Further comparison between the RTs of two languages, responses were faster in L1 $( 6 3 4 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ than in L2 $( 6 4 2 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ . Consistent with participants adjusting their processing in response to changes in language, there was a main effect of trial type, $\beta = 6 7 . 1 9 1$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 2 . 0 3 1$ , $t = 3 . 0 5 0$ $0 5 0 , ~ p = . 0 0 5 ~ ( p < . 0 1 )$ . Participants took 48 ms longer to respond in switch trials $( 6 6 2 ~ \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s } )$ than in repetition trials $( 6 1 4 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ .

Since one of the main research goals of the present study is to examine whether there is an asymmetrical switch cost pattern for either bivalent or univalent stimuli, we looked at the interaction between language and trial type, and between language, trial type, and stimuli valence. The mixed-effect model analysis showed there was a significant interaction between language and trial type, $\beta = - 3 7 . 6 5 2 , \mathrm { ~ } \mathsf { S E } = 1 4 . 0 3 6 , \mathrm { ~ } t = - 2 . 6 8 3 , \mathsf { ~ } p = . 0 1 2 \mathrm { ~ } ( p < . 0 5 ) ,$ indicating an asymmetrical switch cost pattern with switch costs in L2 being larger than that in L1. A further look at the interaction among the three showed no significant effect, $\beta = 1 4 . 3 7 8 , \mathsf { S E } = 8 . 9 3 2 , t = 1 6 1 0 , p = . 1 1 9 ( p > . 0 5 )$ , indicating there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern for both univalent and bivalent stimuli trials. These results suggest that switch costs are at least partially from outside competition between language schemas.

The second main goal of the present study is to examine whether there is a main effect of stimuli valence on response times. The mixed-effect model analysis showed there was a significant effect of stimulus type when participants took $6 0 2 { \mathsf { m s } }$ to respond to univalent stimuli and $6 7 4 \mathsf { m s }$ to respond bivalent stimuli, $\beta = 2 0 2 . 9 9 7$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 6 . 6 0 3$ , $t = 7 . 6 3 1$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ . There was a significant interaction between language and stimulus type, $\beta = 5 0 . 9 1 2$ ${ \sf S E } = 1 6 . 4 4 1$ , $t = 3 . 0 9 7$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ , and a significant interaction between trial type and stimulus type, $\beta = 5 8 . 7 2 6$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 4 . 0 8 6$ , $t =$ 4.169, $p = . 0 0 0$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ . This result is in line with our expectation that the switch cost for the univalent stimuli should be smaller than that for the bivalent stimuli, suggesting that switch costs are at least partially from the competition within language lexical representations.

Table 2 shows the ERs of participants naming digits and number words using Tibetan and Chinese in Exp. 1. The logistic mixed model analysis showed there was a main effect of language type, $\beta = 2 3 . 6 6 9 .$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 0 . 3 6 1$ , $Z = 2 . 2 8 4$ , $p = . 0 4 2$ $( p < . 0 5 )$ , and a main effect of trial type, $\beta = 5 6 . 2 1 1$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 2 0 . 3 9 0$ , $Z = 2 . 7 5 7$ , $p = . 0 0 6$ $( p < . 0 5 )$ , the error rate for the switch trials $( 2 . 7 1 \% )$ was significantly higher than that for the repetition trials $( 1 . 6 8 \% )$ . There was a significant main effect of stimulus type, $\beta = 2 2 . 1 4 5$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 0 . 3 1 6$ , $Z = 2 . 1 4 7$ , $p = . 0 3 2$ $( p < . 0 5 )$ , the mean ER for the univalent stimuli $( 0 . 1 9 \% )$ was lower than that for the bivalent stimuli $( 4 . 2 0 \% )$ . There was a significant interaction between language and trial type, $\beta = - 2 7 . 0 7 4$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 0 . 2 0 6$ , $z = - 2 . 6 5 3$ , $p = . 0 0 8$ $( p < . 0 5 )$ , indicating an asymmetrical switch cost pattern. There was a significant interaction between language, trial

Both the RTs analysis and ERs analysis showed there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern for both univalent and bivalent stimuli and the stimuli valence affected response times in Experiment 1, indicating that the switch cost could be partially from the outside competition between language schemas and partially from within competition between lexicon representations when TibetanChinese-English trilinguals named digits and number words using Tibetan (L1) and Chinese (L2). In the next experiment, we want to look at whether a similar results will be observed between Tibetan (L1) and English (L3), two languages with largely different proficiency levels and different orthographic features.

# Experiment 2

# Participants

The participants were 30 Tibetan students (10th grade, 8 males and 22 females, mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 1 6 . 7$ years) recruited from the same school as in Exp. 1, who were given written informed consent for data collection and were required to do the same pre-experiment tasks and were paid for their participation. The self-evaluation showed that the mean scores for Tibetan and English proficiency were respectively 6.80 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 5$ , range from 6 to 7) and 3.59 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 9 _ { i }$ range from 1 to 5). The variance test revealed a significant proficiency difference between the two languages, $F \left( 1 , 2 9 \right) = 2 0 3 . 7 8 1$ , $p < . 0 1$ . For current language use, participants reported an average percentage of $7 4 \%$ and $90 \%$ i n and out of school for Tibetan, $2 1 \%$ and $9 \%$ for Chinese, and $5 \%$ and $1 \%$ for English.

# Materials and instruments and procedure

Materials in Exp.2 were Arabic numerals from 1 to 9, corresponding Tibetan number words (e.g. $\eta \widehat { \otimes } \varpi _ { \gamma }$ 9y yoay  } 5 g 5t 5) and English number words (from one to nine). English number words were displayed in Times New Roman font and in lower case letters. Standard E-Prime color blue was used for English. The other instruments and procedures were similar with those in Exp.1.

# Data collection and analysis

Data collection and analysis methods were similar with Exp.1 Following the same requirements a total of $8 . 6 2 \%$ of the data was excluded, leaving 11,648 trials for RTs analysis. For ERs analysis, a total of $7 . 6 1 \%$ of the data was excluded, leaving 12,163 trials for further analysis.

# Results and discussion

The results of RTs and ERs analysis in Exp.2 are shown in Tables 3 and 4 and Figures 4 and 5.

Table 3 shows the RTs of participants naming digits and number words using Tibetan and Chinese in Exp. 1. The mixed-effect model analysis showed, consistent with the participants using two languages being largely unbalanced in proficiency, there was a significant main effect of language type, $\beta = 6 1 . 0 6 0 , 5 \mathsf { E } = 1 5 . 3 4 4 , t = 3 . 9 7 9 , p = . 0 0 1 ( p < . 0 1 ) ,$ the RTs for L1 Tibetan $( 6 6 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s )$ were shorter than those for L3 English $( 7 0 3 ~ \mathsf { m } s )$ . Meanwhile, consistent with participants adjusting their processing in response to changes in language, there was a main effect of the trial type, $\beta = 6 9 . 8 4 3$ , SE $1 6 . 9 5 9 , t = 4 . 1 1 8 , p = . 0 0 0 ( p < . 0 1 ) _ { i }$ , the RTs of the switch trials $( 7 0 1 ~ \mathsf { m } s )$ were longer than that of the repetition trials $( 6 6 2 ~ \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s } )$ ).

Particularly interesting for the present study, there was an interaction between language type and trial type where switch costs were asymmetric with 32 ms of higher switch costs in L1 $( 6 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s )$ than in L3 $( 1 8 \mathsf { m } s )$ ), $\beta = - 1 9 . 0 5 1$ , $\mathsf { \bar { s } E } = 7 . 5 7 7 , \mathsf { t } = - 2 . 5 1 4 , p = . 0 2 1 \ ( p < . 0 5 )$ . Further simple effect analysis of this interaction showed that RTs of Tibetan significantly differed in the two trial types $( p < . 0 1 )$ , with switch trials leading to longer reaction times $( 6 9 0 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ than repetition trials $( 6 3 0 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ . However, English had no significant difference in the two trial types, $p = . 2 8 6 \ ( p > . 0 5 )$ . Further, an interaction was observed between language type, stimulus type, and trial type, $\beta = 2 6 . 8 5 7$ , ${ \sf S E } = 4 . 8 4 9$ , $\mathbf { t } = 5 . 5 3 8 ,$ , $p = . 0 0 0 \ ( p < . 0 1 )$ , suggesting that switch cost asymmetry was affected by stimulus valence as the asymmetry was smaller for univalent stimuli $( 1 4 \ m s )$ than for bivalent stimuli $( 6 9 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ . The above results indicated that for both univalent and bivalent stimuli trials, there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern, which suggests that switch costs were at least partially from outside competition between language schemas.

The RTs in Exp.2

Another interesting finding was that there was a significant main effect of stimulus type, $\beta = 2 6 3 . 9 4 3$ , ${ \mathsf { S E } } = 2 1 . 4 0 6 $ , $t = 1 2 . 3 3 0$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ , the RTs for the univalent stimuli $( 6 3 3 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ were shorter than that for the bivalent stimuli $( 7 3 0 \ \mathsf { m s } )$ ). There was also a significant interaction between language and stimuli, $\beta = - 4 7 . 9 0 2 , \mathsf { S E } = 9 . 0 7 7 , \ t = - 5 . 2 7 7 , \ p = . 0 0 0 \ ( p < . 0 1 ) _ { i }$ and between trial type and stimuli, $\beta = - 1 0 1 . 7 5 3$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 0 . 8 0 3$ , $t = - 9 . 4 1 9$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ . This result was in line with our expectation that the switch costs for the univalent stimuli should be smaller than that for the bivalent stimuli, suggesting that switch costs were at least partly from the competition within lexical representations.

Meanwhile, there was not an interaction effect between language type and trial type, $\beta = - . 4 0 3 ,$ $\mathsf { S E } = 1 . 1 8 8$ , $Z = - . 3 3 9$ , $p = . 7 3 4 $ $( p > . 0 5 )$ , and not an interaction effect among language type, trial type and stimulus type, $\beta = . 1 6 6 , 5 \mathsf { E } = . 6 1 4 , z = . 2 7 0 , p = . 7 8 7 \ ( p > . 0 5 ) .$ .

Taken together, although the ERs analysis showed no stimuli valence effect, the RTs analysis did find there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern for both univalent and bivalent stimuli, and that the switch costs for the bivalent stimuli were larger than those for the univalent stimuli. These results suggest that, similar with Exp.1, the switch costs could be partially explained by outside competition between language schemas and partially from within language competition between lexicon representations when Tibetan-Chinese-English trilinguals named digits and number words using Tibetan (L1) and English (L3). In the next experiment, we want to look at whether a similar results will be observed between Chinese (L2) and English (L3), two languages that are of largely different proficiency levels and different orthographic features and are both non-native languages.

# Experiment 3

# Participants

Participants were 30 Tibetan students (10th grade, 11 males and 19 females, mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 1 6 . 5$ years) recruited from the same school as in Exp. 1 and 2, who were given written informed consent for data collection and were required to do the same pre-experiment tasks and were paid for their participation. The self-evaluation showed that the mean scores for Chinese and English proficiency were 5.40 $( \mathsf { S D } = . 5$ , range from 4 to 6) and 3.40 $( \mathsf { S D } = 1 . 1$ , range from 1 to 5). The variance test revealed a significant proficiency difference between the two languages, $F \ ( 1 , \ 2 9 ) = 8 7 . 9 2 4 _ { i }$ $p < . 0 1$ . For current language use, participants reported an average percentage of $8 1 \%$ and $91 \%$ in and out of school for Tibetan, $1 4 \%$ and $8 \%$ for Chinese, and $5 \%$ and $1 \%$ for English.

# Materials and instruments and procedure

Materials in Exp.2 were Arabic numerals from 1 to 9, and corresponding Chinese number words (from 一 to九) and English number words (from one to nine). The other instruments and procedures were similar with those in Exps. 1 and 2.

# Data collection and analysis

Data collection and analysis methods were similar with Exps. 1 and 2. Following the same requirements, a total of $1 2 . 6 7 \%$ of the data was excluded, leaving 11,105 trials for RTs analysis. For ERs analysis, a total of $9 . 4 6 \%$ of the data was excluded, leaving 12,040 trials for further analysis.

The RTs in Exp. 3

Table 5 shows the RTs of participants naming digits and number words using Chinese and English in Exp. 3. The mixed-effect model analysis showed there was not a main effect of language, $\beta = - 1 3 . 3 4 3$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 9 . 1 3 0$ , $t = - . 4 5 8$ , $p = . 6 5 0$ $( p > . 0 5 )$ . There was also not a main effect of trial type, $\beta = - 1 1 . 1 1 0$ , ${ \sf S E } = 4 2 . 0 1 1$ , $t = - . 2 6 4 , p = . 7 9 4 \ ( p > . 0 5 )$ . Furthermore there was not significant interaction between language and trial type, $\beta = 8 . 1 5 9$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 1 6 . 3 9 1$ , $\pm = 0 . 4 9 8$ , $p = . 6 1 8$ $( p > . 0 5 )$ . However, there was a significant interaction between language, trial type and stimuli, $\beta = 3 5 . 8 8 7$ , $5 \mathsf { E } = 1 0 . 3 4 4 , t = 3 . 4 6 9 , p = . 0 0 0 \ ( p < . 0 1 )$ .

In order to test whether or not there was an asymmetric switch cost pattern for univalent stimuli or bivalent stimuli, we looked at the interaction between language and trial type by univalent stimuli and bivalent stimuli separately. The results showed there was a significant interaction for univalent stimuli, $\beta = 4 4 . 7 3 5 , 5 \mathsf { E } = 5 . 9 4 9 , t = 7 . 5 1 9 , p = . 0 0 0 \ ( p < . 0 1 )$ and for bivalent stimuli, $\beta =$ 80.281, ${ \sf S E } = 8 . 4 4 5$ , $t = 9 . 5 0 6 , p = . 0 0 0 \ : ( p < . 0 1 )$ , indicating for both univalent and bivalent stimuli there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern with switch costs in L2 being larger than that in L3.

Similar to the previous two experiments, there was a main effect of stimuli for the RTs, $\begin{array} { r } { 3 = 2 3 2 . 2 6 9 , \ S \mathsf { E } = 4 5 . 6 6 7 , \ t = 5 . 0 8 6 , \ p = . 0 0 0 \ ( p < . 0 1 ) ; } \end{array}$ the RTs for univalent stimuli $( 6 4 0 ~ \mathsf { m s } )$ were shorter than that for bivalent stimuli $( 7 3 0 \mathrm { m } s )$ . There was a significant interaction between language and stimuli, $\beta = - 3 4 . 9 7 8 , \ S \mathsf { E } = 1 7 . 7 2 5 , \ t = - 1 . 9 7 3 , \ p = . 0 4 8$ $( p < . 0 5 )$ , and between trial type and stimuli, $\beta = 2 3 2 . 2 6 9 _ { \cdot }$ , $\mathsf { S E } = 4 5 . 6 6 7$ , $t = 5 . 0 8 6 ,$ $p = . 0 0 0$ $( p < . 0 1 )$ . These results suggest that switch costs were at least partly from the competition within language lexical representations.

Table 6 shows the ERs statistics. The logistic mixed model analysis showed there was not a main effect for language type, $\beta = 3 . 6 5 1$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 . 5 6 5$ , $z = 1 . 4 2 4$ , $p = . 7 1 6$ $( p > . 0 5 )$ , for trial type, $\beta = 2 . 1 8 8 ,$ $\mathsf { S E } = 3 . 7 6 4$ , $z = . 5 8 1$ , $p = . 5 6 1$ $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Besides, there was also not a main effect for stimulus type, $\beta = . 0 2 3 ,$ , ${ \sf S E } = 2 . 9 8 3$ , $z = . 0 0 8 _ { \scriptscriptstyle \cdot }$ $p = . 9 9 4 $ $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Finally, there was not significant interaction between language type, trial type and stimulus type, $\beta = - . 0 7 7 , 5 5 = . 8 6 2 , z = - . 0 8 9 , p = . 9 2 9 ( p > . 0 5 )$ .

Taken together, although the ERs analysis indicated no asymmetrical switch cost pattern and no stimuli valence effect, the RTs analysis did find that there was an asymmetrical switch cost pattern for either univalent or bivalent stimuli, and that the switch costs for the bivalent stimuli were larger than those for the univalent stimuli. Those results suggested that, similar with Exps.1 and 2, switch costs could be partially explained by the outside competition between language schemas and partially from within language competition between lexicon representations when TibetanChinese-English trilinguals named digits and number words using Chinese (L2) and English (L3).

# General discussion

The present study attempted to explain sources of language switch costs through examining switch costs asymmetrical patterns as well as stimuli valence effect when trilinguals named digits and number words in any two of their languages. We argued that if an asymmetrical switch cost pattern was observed in naming both digits and number words, the switch costs would be assumed to come from outside competition between language schemas, and that if a stimuli valence effect was observed, the switch cost would be assumed to come from competition within the language system. We designed three experiments each using two of the Tibetan-ChineseEnglish trilinguals’ languages. The three experiments found similar results that there was an asymmetrical switch costs pattern for both bivalent and univalent stimuli and a stimuli valence effect. Those results indicated that the switch costs could be partially from the outside competition between language schemas and partially from within language competition between lexicon representations.

The results indicating language switch costs were partially from the outside competition between language schemas are consistent with the accounts supported by previous studies (e.g. Green 1998; Li and Gollan 2022; Orfanidou and Sumner 2005; Thomas and Allport 2000). As discussed previously, the outside competition between language schemas will cause an asymmetrical switch cost pattern, that is, switching to the more proficient language will cause more costs than switching to the less proficient language. In the present study, while this language proficient related asymmetrical pattern was evidenced by the results of Experiments 2 and 3 in which switch costs were larger for the more proficient L1 and L2 than that for the less proficient L3, it was not evidenced by the results of Experiment 1 in which switch costs were larger for L2, the language that was reported by participants to be less proficient than L1. Given the complexity of the switching process, some possible reasons might be taken into account for this result. First, for the participants in the present study, the proficiency disparity between L1and L2 was not as noticeable as that between L1 and L3, or between L2 and L3. Note that as L2 Chinese is the official language of China as well as the socially dominant language, many Tibetan students began to learn Chinese at a very early age even before schooling time. Besides, Chinese was used in both social communication and school study as the instruction language for many courses including the English course (Chen 2020). Therefore, it is possible that the different self-evaluation proficiency levels for L1 and L2 might not be a full reflection of their practical competence in the two languages, but rather, to a large extent, it might be a reflection of the frequency of use in their daily life (note that Tibetan students speak Tibetan with their peers at school and with their family at home). However, the scenario for learning English is rather different. Most of the students began to learn English as a foreign language in the school when they were around 12 years old, and they do not use English in their daily life. According to the parallel activation accounts (Declerck and Gollan 2020; Chen et al. 2020), the inhibition amount of a language depends on its relative activation strength, indicating that the larger the proficiency discrepancy between two languages, the more noticeable the differences of inhibition strength are upon them. Note that in Experiments 2 and 3, the asymmetrical latency between L3 and the other two languages is 83 and $1 1 7 \mathsf { m s }$ respectively, which is much larger than the asymmetrical latency between L1 and L2 in Experiment 1, which is $3 3 ~ \mathsf { m s }$ .

The results indicating language switch costs were partially from the outside competition of language schemas will provide implication for the question of whether the different asymmetrical switch costs between language comprehension and production are due to methodological differences or from within competition between linguistic representations. As we have predicted earlier, since digits are bivalent stimuli and number words are univalent stimuli, if we observed asymmetrical switch costs pattern for the two types, it means that even univalent stimuli would not eliminate the switch cost asymmetry, and hence the difference between production and comprehension should not be out of methodological differences. In other words, the fact that the symmetrical switch costs pattern was found in comprehension-based language switch tasks (e.g. Chen et al. 2020; Declerck and Gollan 2020; Macizo, Bajo, and Paolieri 2012; Orfanidou and Sumner 2005; Thomas and Allport 2000; Von Studnitz and Green 1997; Von Studnitz and Green 2002) was due to the outside competition between language schemas. This finding is supportive for the account made by Reynolds, Schlöffel, and Peressotti (2016) arguing that since language comprehension tasks are novel and similarly less experienced by the two languages for unbalanced bilinguals, the strength of the language task schemas should not be unbalanced, yielding symmetrical switch costs despite the relative strength of the two languages.

The results indicating that language switch costs were partially from within language system competition are consistent with the accounts supported by the previous studies (Grainger and Beauvillain 1987; Peeters et al. 2014; Van Heuven, Dijkstra, and Grainger 1998). As described earlier, those accounts argue that the competition comes from the representations of lexicon within language system. Given that the present participants’ three languages are orthographically largely different, the univalent features of the lexicon representation of each language are consequently more apparent, which will make the co-activation of the non-target language stay in a lower level and hence the selection of the target language will become easier. These results may contribute to our understanding of the language control mechanism of trilinguals whose three languages are orthographically distant.

Given that the present study indicated that language switch costs were partially from the outside language competition and at the same time were partially from competition within language system, one might ask whether the two accounts are exclusive to each other? Our research results suggested that the answer was no. Instead, the two types of competition during language switching tasks could coexist and each cause its own switch costs. That is to say, when bilinguals or trilinguals are using two of their languages, both the language schemas and their respective linguistic representations will be activated and the right selection of the target language schema and the target linguistic representations will need to inhibit the non-target language schema and nontarget linguistic representations.

# Conclusion

The present study tested whether the switch costs of production-based language switching tasks by trilinguals are due to competition from outside language schemas or from within language systems.

We controlled stimuli valence and examined switch cost symmetrical patterns in three experiments where Tibetan-Chinese-English trilinguals used two languages respectively. The results suggested that sources of switch costs were bilaterally from competition both outside language schemas and within language system. These results may contribute to our understanding of the language control mechanism between production-based and comprehension-based language switching tasks and language control mechanism of trilinguals with three orthographically different languages.

# Notes

1. Note that some studies (i.e., Gade et al. 2021) suggested that asymmetrical switch costs is currently not the sole index of inhibition language control.   
2. A trial requiring participants to name the stimulus with the same language as the previous trial is called a repetition trial and a trial requiring participants use a different language from the previous one is called a switch trial.
