Lexical bundles use in academic discourse has been explored across numerous dimensions including discipline, genre, register, student proficiency, and language, among others. These studies have resulted in claims about the nature of these different discourses or their authors, and they have been used in EAP instructional practices. Recent studies on methodological considerations in frequency-based lexical bundles research have pointed to variability in results that stem from changes in criteria used in lexical bundle extraction and corpus composition. Following this, the current study explores the impact of methodological variation in lexical bundle extraction from sets of research articles in Linguistics and Biology, with a focus on the extent of disciplinary variation uncovered in lexical bundles use and function. Experiments with varying frequency thresholds and range specifications as well as corpus composition show that results about lexical bundles use in different disciplinary discourses could be more sharply differentiated when certain variables are used, underscoring the variableness in results and the need for caution in interpreting the findings of lexical bundles research. This paper also evaluates claims made in previous lexical bundles studies using the findings from this study. Finally, previous pedagogical applications of lexical bundles research in academic discourse are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Formulaic language or pre-fabricated multi-word units have been the focus of a long tradition of research, which includes a variety of means of identifying these units, research goals, and methodologies (Biber et al., 2004). Idiomatic expressions, colligations (the grammatical company a word keps), collocations, continuous sequences, and discontinuous frames are among the kinds of multi-word units that discourse analysts and corpus lingusts have studied. Within this, a large and growing number of ublications in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in the last two decades have reported on the use of lexical bundles or n-grams, that is, "contiguous sequence [s] of 3or 4 words identified purely through automatic means using afrequency-driven approach" (Flowerdew, 2015, p. 105) in academic discourse.

Lexical bundles in academic discourse have been the focus of studies for several reasons. Biber et al. (2004: 371) state that linguistic research studies on academic discourse in the twenty years prior to their publication had focused \*on the description of a specific grammatical fatureor a lexical clas in writen academic registers. Their shf i focus to a description of lexical bundes in academic registers was to further elucidate the nature of academic discourses. As Biber et al. (2004) have noted, these multi-word combinations are building blocks of discourses and applied linguists have analyzed them to explore the discourse functions and grammatical structure of these multi-word units.

In this descriptive vein, studies have focused on the contrastive use of lexical bundles in different registers such as classroom lectures and conversations (Biber et al., 2004), genres such as research articles, theses, and textboos (Shirazizadeh & Amirfazlian, 2021), by students producing texts in their first and second languages at various proficiency levels and stages of being acculturated into their discourse communities for example, Chen & Baker, 2010), and by writers in different languages (Esfandiari & Barbary, 2017). In most of thesestdie, rarchers have catorized the lexical bundes according to strctural fature for example, whether a lexical bundle is part of a noun phrase or verb phrase) and thir discoursal function (for example, whether they convey interpersonal or textual meaning) to reach conclusions about the nature of discourses produced. Given the importance of descriptions of specific discourses in the fields of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English for Specific Purposes (ESP), researchers have also compared the use of lexical bundles in different disciplines (for example, Hyland, 2008b; Ren, 2021), concluding about the nature of meaning construction in disciplinary discourses based on the lis of lexical bundes identified and the functional categories they have been placed in. Because f the foundational goal of EAP research to facilitate academic literacy development, the descriptive work on lexical bundles has also led to research on the teaching and learning of lexical bundles in academic contexts (for example, Murray, 2017; Liou & Chen, 2018). Researchers have arrived a lists of lexical bunde that they recommend be explicitly taught t 2 students. For instance, a recent study by Ren (2021: 100 968) compares the bundles found in research artice from aplied linguistics and pharmaceutical studies and arrives at two ist of lexical bundles for the two disciplinary areas that \*could be used as valuable in. struction materials for graduate-level academic writing class." Another study on email writing concludes that "a list of lexical bundles will be informative for language teachers to teach email writing" (Li & Volkov, 2017, p. 73).

Importantly, in recent years, a call has also been sounded (for example, by Chen & Baker, 2016) for an examination of the methods used in lexical bundles research with the acknowledgement that variations in corpus design as well as choices in lexical bundle size. threshold limit, and levels of dispersion in studies can influence the results obtained, with consequences for our understanding of academic discourses their role in discourse communities, and the place of exical bundes in students academic literacy development ODonnell e a. (2013: 88) point out that we can "expect different statistical operationalizations of formulaic language to produce different patterns of results." Their study of lexical bundles usage by diffrent populations does indeed demonstrate that different defintions offormulaic language, that is defined by frquency alone or by Mutal Information, give rise to different pictures of writing produced by different groups of writers: 1 and 2 writer as wl as writers grouped by varying levels of expertise. Their study further demonstrates that \*[choices of corpus design . ae equally potent determinants of outcome" (O'Donnell et al., 2013, p. 102). An extension of O'Donnell et al. (2013), Lu et al. (2018) points to variations in threshold frequencies and n-gram lengths in frequencya studes f fomuac gagerulting different clams. They asert tht he use f different approches t identify formulaic sequence from the same corpus willikly result in different sets of formulaic sequences being extracted, which will in turn have consequences for the claims made regarding formulaic sequence use based on them' (Lu et al., 2018, p. 161). Among other findings, through their study, they show that variations in frequency-based n-grams length and frequency thresholds lead to considerable variation in the results (p. 174).

A more recent study probing methodological isues in lexical bundles research (Pan et al., 2020) reveals that corpus composition (that is, number and lengths of texts in a corpus) together with variation in lexical bundle identification criteria can have important effects on the lexical bundles identified in comparative corpus analysis. Equally importantly, the results indicate considerable variability in the set of specific lexical bundles identified from an analysis depending on the specific composition of the corpus" (Pan et al., 2020, p. 28). More broadly in corpus studie, methodological considerations have esulted in monographs such as Designing and evaluating language corpora (Egbert et al., 2022) to promote sound corpus design and representativeness.

Nonetheless the findings from methodological studies such as those discussed above have important implications for the results from previous studies of lexical bundes from specific discourses (such as reearch artce from spefic disciplines), especially claims that have emerged about the nature of meaning construction in particular disciplines or disciplinary groups. These findings also raise questions about the claims that have been made about the nature of student writig versus those of established members of disciplinary communities. More importantly, such findings seemto indicate that it might be necesary to reconsider the pedagogical implications of lexical bundles research, such as the use of selections of lexical bundes for instruction. As such, this paper has the fllowing research goals.

# 1.1. Research goals

This paper has three main goals.

# 1.1.1. Goal 1

The first goal of the study is to explore the impact of methodological variations on the lexical bundles extracted from research articles from different disciplines. Specifically, the following two questions will be addressed through aseries of experiments.

# 1.1.1.1. Research questions supporting goal #1.

a) Do research article from two diffrent disciplines look more similar i terms of lexical bundles use when particular frequency thresholds and range specifications are employed?

b) If changing the frequency thresholds and range specifications for lexical bundle identification changes the number and type of lexical bundles identified in research articles from a particular discipline, what does that mean for our understanding of meaning construction in disciplinary texts?

I analyze research articles from Linguistics and Biology and vary the frequency thresholds and range specifications (that is, dispersion across acertain number of texts) for identifying lexical bundle. I also vary the number of texs in each sub-corpus to explore effects on lexical bundle frequency and on the proportion of pecific lexical bundle functional types. The results of the experiments are used to answer the two research questions.

# 1.1.2. Goal 2

A second goal of this paper is to re-evaluate the meaning of the small number of shared lexical bundles across the most frequent lexical bundes lists from different disciplines that has been reported in previous lexical bundes research (such as Hyland, 2008b). In order to explore whether the lack of overlap of frequent lexical bundles in texts from two disciplines reall signals disciplinary specificit, I search for the high frequency lexical strings idenified in txt from one discipline inthe texts fromthe scond discipline

# 1.1.3. Goal 3

A third goal of this paper is to critically review previous lexical bundes studies with pedagogical applications of lexical bundles research. Studie rporting onthe instruction of lexical bundles will be reviewed in the section on Lexical Bundle and Pedagogy." The justifications provided in previous research for the focus on lexical bundes in academic writing in areas of literacy development and acculturation into discourse communities, in particular, will be discussed.

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Background to method

Lexical bundles have been identified in groups of texts using two factors, frequency per million words and range,that is, distri bution of multi-word unit acrossa minimum number of texs. The number of words in a lexical bundle can vary to, with most studies focusing on 4-word bundles. There has been some variation in the frequency threshold used to identify these multi-word units, from 40 times per million words to 10 times per million words (pmw) (see Cortes, 2004; Biber et al., 199; Simpson-Vlach & Elis, 2010 for different frequency thresholds). The range of distribution used in identifying lexical bunde has often been five text. In some studies, a percentage of texts might be used to set the range of distribution. In Hyland (2008b), the range was set at $1 0 \%$ of the texts. However, it should be noted that with 30 research articles and 20 theses from each discipline analyzed in his corpus, $1 0 \%$ of texts in each discipline in this cross-disciplinary study would also mean a range of fve texts. Durrant (2017) considered ngrams that occur across $2 0 \%$ of authors as lexical bundles, although his work employed a more complex process to identify lexical bundles.

The lexical bundles thus identified are then analyzed for their discourse functions and structural features. As Ren (2021) has noted there is alarge overlap in the taxonomies of discourse functions created by different researchers such as Biber et al. (2004), Hyland (2008b), and Byrd and Coxhead (2010), with all these taxonomies including three main subcategories. Each taxonomy includes a category of lexical bundes that communicaes stance or an expression of atitude, labeled as participant-oriented lexical bundles in Hyland's taxonomy. A second sub-category of lexical bundles fulills the function of a discourse organizer, analyzed as being text-oriented or serving as a text connectr. The third sub-category is known as referential or content or reearch-oriented bundes. The proportion of lexical bundles identified from a group of texs (belonging, for example, to a specific register, genre, or disciline, or produced by a specific group of writers, such as undergraduates) using a particular frequency and range threshold, which expresses a particular dicourse function, for example, text organzatio, i then usuall calulated to arrive at eneralizations about that goup of texts, such as research articles from a particular discipline (for example, Perez-Llantada, 2014; Lu & Deng, 2019; Hyland, 2012; Esfandiari & Barbary, 2017). Studies have also compared the most frequent lexical bundles (for example, the 50 most frequent lexical bundles) in two or more groups of texts to arrive at conclusions about similarities and diffrences in meaning construction and argumentation norms in the sets of texts being compared (see, for example, Appel & Murray, 2020; Esfandiari & Barbary, 2017; Hyland, 2008b; Sanchez, 2014).

# 2.2. Corpus design

The lexical bundles study reported in this paper explores the questions outlined in the introduction using two sets of research   
Table 1 Data.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline</td><td>Number of RAs</td><td>Number of words</td><td> Raw frequency for 20 pmw</td><td>Raw frequency for 15 pmw</td><td>Raw frequency for 10 pmw</td></tr><tr><td> Biology 1</td><td>200</td><td>1,202,502</td><td>24</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Linguistics 1</td><td>200</td><td>1,670,682</td><td>33</td><td>25</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td> Biology 2</td><td>100</td><td>583, 649</td><td>12</td><td>9.</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Linguistics 2</td><td>100</td><td>780, 680</td><td>16</td><td>12</td><td>8</td></tr></table></body></html>

articles, one from Linguistics and the other from Biology. I used Anthony's (2017) AntConGen, a corpus generation too that llows you to search for and download documents from the PLOS ONE research database, which contains articles from PLOs ONE, a peer-reviewed open aes journal (https://journals.plo.org/plosone/). Two hundred research artice each from Linguistics, in the area of Phonetics, and from Biology, in the area of Ecology, were downloaded (labeled Linguistics 1 and Biology 1 in Table 1). In addition, smaller corpora of 100research articles each from Linguisics and Biology (labeled Linguistics 2 and Biology 2 in Table 1) were also created to explore the efects of the number of texts in a corpus on bundle presence across disciplines. As can be seen from Table 1, the total word count for the Linguistics research artices is higher than for the Biology research articles. Table 1 also provides the correspondence between theraw frequency thresholds and the normalizd frequency thresholds for corpora of different sies (Chen & Baker, 2010). For example, for Biology 1, where the corpus size is 1,202, 502 words, a normalized frequency threshold of 20 occurrences per million words (20 pmw) corresponds to a raw frequency threshold of 24 times.

# 2.3. Identification of lexical bundles

Since 4-word bundles have been a common bundle length in previous studies of academic discourse, this was the length of bundes used in the experiments conducted. An earlier version of this study extracted lexical bundles using AntConc (Anthony, 2021). However, the results reported in this paper are based on lexical bundles identified through use of a Python script written to remove overlapping bundles. The script identified lexical bundles in two phases. The first phase identified 4-word lexical bundles meeting specified frequency and disperson criteria. The second phase removed overlapping bundes using the method discussed in Cortes and Lake (2023). When tokens of two 4-word bundles overlapped, only the more frequent bundle was counted. Frequency and dispersion criteria were reapplied to the adjusted token counts, generating a new smaller set of bundles. For example, for a particular set of extraction criteria and corpus size, both \*it should be noted" and "should be noted that" were phase 1 bundles with frequencies of 63 and 57 respectively. But in 56 cases they were overlapping. That is, they occurred in the 5-token sequence it should be noted that." Since "it should be noted" was the more frequent bundle, only it was counted in these overlaps, and the phase 2 count for "should be noted that' shrank to 1. Hence it no longer met the criteria for a bundle in phase 2.

# 2.4. Lexical bundle categorization

I used Hyland's functional taxonomy (2008b, 2012), which categorizes lexical bundles into three main groups: research-oriented, text-oriented, and participant-oriented bundles, argued to account for al the functions of lexical bundle found in research writing. According to this taxonomy, research-oriented bundles \*help writers tostructure their activities and experiences of the real world," text-oriented bundles are "concerned with the organization of text and its meaning as a message or argument," and participant oriented bundles are "focused on the writer or reader of the text' (Hyland, 2008b: 13-14).

# 2.5. Experiments

Four-word lexical bundles were extracted using frequency thresholds ranging from 10 to 20 times per million words and dispersion ranges varying from 5 texts to $5 \%$ and ${ \bf 1 0 \% }$ of the total number of texts, which equates to 10 ( $5 \%$ of 200) and 20 ( $1 0 \%$ of 200) texts in the complete corpus of 200 texts (Biology 1 and Linguistics 1), and 5 and 10 texts in the smalle corpus of 100 articles each (Biology 2 and Linguistics 2). For the first question exploring the impact of varying frequency thresholds and dispersion range on the lexical bundles identified, besides noting the effcts on the total number of bunde extracted, I als identified bundes that were participantoriented and calculated what proportion they formed of all bundles extracted from the research articles from Linguistics and Biology. In other words, I wanted to explore if the proportion of bundes expressig a particular discourse function varied for the same corpus when the criteria for bundle extraction were changed. The efect of corpus composition on bundle frequency and type was also investigated as lexical bundes were also extracted from the smaller corpora, namely, 100 research articles each from Linguisics and Biology.

As others (such as Simpson-Vlach & Elli, 2010) have pointed out, lexical bundles are multi-functional and therefore categorizing lexical bundles for the discourse function they convey can be challenging. In my analysis, only lexical bundes where the participant-oriented function was dominant were categorized as such. An applied linguist colleague was trained with Hyland's (2008b) functional typology. The longest list of lexical bundles generated in each discipline through the experiments was each analyzed independently by the author and the applied linguist colleague to identify participant-oriented bundes. The independent functional identification of participant-oriented bundles yielded an inter-annotator agreement of $8 7 \%$ . The discrepancies were resolved by consulting analyses from previous studies employing the same framework for example, Hyland, 2008b, 2012) and by jointly deter. mining the primary function of differently analyzed bundles.

Finally, to addres the second goal of the paper, that is to evaluate revious claims ofdisciplinary pecificity based on the number of lexical bundes shared acros research articles and theses from different disciplines, I searched for the 50 most frequent bundes in Engineering provided in Hyland (2008b) in my Biology corpus. further searched for the participant-oriented lexical bundle identified in my Lingustics corpus in the Biology corus to explore their presence in Biology research articles, even if these mult-word units had not been classified as lexical bundles through frequency and dispersion criteria.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1. Preliminaries

Before delving into the results from my study, I will first provide a short discussion of multi-word units and the claims made in previous research about meaning construction in texts based on the main functions expressed by the identified lexical bunde through use of a hypothetical case. This discussion willbe relevant for understanding the implications of the results of my experiments.

Fig. 1 depicts mult-word units in two hypothetical sets of texts. The top strand represents the multi-word units that have been identified as exical bundes based on some set frequency and range criteria. Of these lexical bundes, lets say that functional analysis shows that $4 0 \%$ of the identified lexical bundles were those that expressed a participant-oriented function and $2 0 \%$ a textual-oriented function in Group A texts. In Group B texts, $2 0 \%$ of the lexical bundles expressed a participant-oriented function and $3 0 \%$ expressed a textual function. From that, one might conclude that there are substantive differences in meaning construction between these two groups of texts. However, such a conclusion raises a couple questions. The first question is whether multi-word units that are extracted as lexical undes in one set of texts might be present in the second set of texts even if they were not extrcted as lexical bundes because they did not meet the extraction criteri. The second question is whether the meaning or function expressed by the lexical bundles in Group A texts might be expressed by a variet of les frequent mult-word units in the Group B texts that did not meet the frequency threshold to be identified as lexical bundes simply because there are more variants competing to expres the same function. It ollows that claims about functions or meanings expressed in a group of texts could be naccurate or exaggerated as the claims are not based on an exhaustive list of forms but just the most frequent forms.

Results from previous comparative studie of discourses through the analysis of lexical bundle have ofered claims with respect to the use of prefabricated sequences, sometimes not considering the fct that a mult-word unit is a lexical bundle by dint of it frequency in the first place. For example, Hyland (2008a: 54) in astudy comparing lexical bundles in the genres produced by master's and PhD students and research article authors claimed that \*the real-world, physical practicalities of the investigation played a greater part in how these apprentice writers [masters students] conceptualized thir studies' ecause master's students' discourse showed a heavy use of research-oriented clusters and a relatively low use of participant-oriented bundles. However, there could have been a greater variety of multi-word units expressing participant-oriented meanings which didn't reach lexical bundle status because they were each not that frequent, that is there could have been multi-word units with participant-oriented meanings lurking in the blue dark gray n print versions) area in Fig. 1. (Of course, the same function could be expresed by linguistic unit other than lexcal bundles as has been pointed out in studies such as Durrant (2017) and others.)

# 3.2. Results from experiments

I will now discus the findings from the experiments conducted. In Table 2,Ipresent the total number of lexical bundle tokens extracted using various criteria and the proportion 4-word lexical bundles form of the total number of words in each sub-corpus. The lexical bundles were extracted using a variety of thresholds for frequency per million words (pmw) as wellas different hresholds for range of dispersion, that i, the number of texts a multi-word unit needs to appear in to be considered a lexical bundle. These experiments were conducted to consider the effects of varying the thresholds for these criteria used for identifying lexical bundles (research goal $\# 1$ ). As mentioned earlier, I considered the results for frequency ranging from 10 to 20 times per million words and varied the range from 5 texts to $5 \%$ and $1 0 \%$ of the total number of texts, which equates to 10 ( $5 \%$ of 200) and 20 C $1 0 \%$ of 200) texts in the larger corpus of 200 texts (Biology 1 and Linguisic 1), and 5 and 10 text in the smalle corpus of 100 article each (Biology 2 and Linguistics 2).

a A range of $5 \%$ is equal to 5 texts when the corpus size is 100 RAs, leading to similar results whether the range is $5 \%$ or 5 texts for a particular frequency.

As expected, the total number of lexical bundle tokens increases as the thresholds for frequency and range are lowered and, as a result, the proportion that bundes make out fall words varies by the frequency criteria used. What is noteworthy from Table 2, but not surprising, given what corpus linguists have pointed out regarding the efect of corpus size on lexical bundle frequency (Chen & Baker, 2010; Cortes, 2004), is that when the corpus i composed of a smaller number of txs, the proportion that lexical bundles form of the total number of words in each discipline is larger for every threshold criterion.

As mentioned earlier, the proportion of words in a corpus given to bundles varies when the frequency criteria for bundle extraction are changed. From Table 2, we see that the iference n the proportion that 4-word bundles make out of all words in Biology is about $1 8 8 \%$ greater when the percentage yielded with the most stringent criteria (a frequency of 20 pmw with a range of $1 0 \%$ of the texts) is compared to the percentage with the least stringent criteria (a frequency of 10 pmw with a range of 5 text) in the corpus of 200 texts $( 0 . 9 \%$ versus $2 . 6 \%$ . Also, the results indicate that if we compared the level of formulaicity in Biology and Linguistics by comparing the results from the corpora of 200 texts using the criteria of 20 pmw and a range of $1 0 \%$ of texts, we would conclude that Linguistics has a much greater reliance on pre-fabricated structures than Biology, given that $1 . 8 \%$ of words are comprised of bundles in Linguistics compared to $0 . 9 \%$ in Biology, a difference of $1 0 0 \%$ . However, the difference between the two disciplines in the use of bundles is less striking when we compare the results from corpora of 100 texts each (Biology 2 and Linguistics 2), using the least stringent frequency criteria of 10 pmw and a range f five texts. Here the iffrence between the two disciplines in the proportion of words given to lexical bundles ( $2 . 8 \%$ in Biology compared to $3 . 5 \%$ in Linguistics) is only $2 5 \%$ . Although Linguistics is shown to contain more formulaic language than Biology in thee experiments, disciplinary difference in lexical bundles use can appear larger or smaller depending onthe frequency and range thresholds used in bundle extraction and the composition of corpora.

I will now discuss the findings on lexical bundle types when frequency thresholds and range specifications vary. Out of all exical bundle types, those that were participant-oriented in their function were counted to determine if the proportion of bundes that performed a particular function varied when extraction criteria were changed. To explore the effct of corpus composition on the number and proportion of a functional type of lexical bundle, I alo performed the same analysis on half the number of texts in both the Biology and Linguistics corpora.

The results reported in Table 3 indicate that Linguistics research articles contain a larger number of lexical bundle types than the Biology reearch article. However, my experiments show that the difeence in number ofall lexical bundle types found acrosthe two disciplines variestrikingly when the extraction criteria are changed. Linguistics 1research articles contain twice the number of lexical bundle types as Biology 1 research articles when the frequency threshold is 20 pmw and the range $1 0 \%$ of texts (113 versus 56). However, Linguistics only contains $8 \%$ more of lexical bundle types than Biology (390 versus 360) when the frequency threshold is lowered to 10 times per million words with a range of five texts in corpora of 200 texts, leading one to conclude, in contrast, that linguists and biologists might be similar in the ariety of lexical bundles used in their publications. In fact given that the total number of words in the Bology 1 corpus is 1, 202 502 and the total number of words in the Linguisics 1 corpus is 1, 670, 682 (see Table1), the Biology research articles contain a greater number of lexical bundle types per 10 00 words, with 3.0 per 10 o00 words in Biology rather than 2.3 per 10 o00 words in the Linguistics research articles!

a A range of $5 \%$ is equal to 5 texts when the corpus size is 100 RAs, leading to similar results whether the range is $5 \%$ or 5 texts for a particular frequency threshold.

In addition, as seen in Table 3, the Linguistics research articles do indeed contain a greater number of lexical bundles that are participant-orinted, such as itis clear that or are likely to be than the Biology research artce, nd a greater proportion of otl lexical bunde tyes are participant-rientd in Linguistics reearch artice other than for one set f critria) similar to the eults of previous studies (for example, Hyland, 2012).

Importantly, the proportion of exical bundes expressing a particular function, in this case, a participant-oriented meaning, changes when you vary frequency and dispersion values as wel as corpus composition. Thediffernces in the proportion of participant-riented bundles acros Linguistics and Biology does not remain the same acros various frequency and dspersion criteria. With corporaf 200 texts (Biology 1 and Linguistics 1), the proportion of participant-oriented lexical bundes out of the total number f exical bundle types is $4 . 8 \%$ in Biology when the frequency threshold is 15 pmw with a range of $5 \%$ of the texts in the corpus. With these same thresholds, the proportion of participant-oriented lexical bundles in Linguistics research articles is $6 . 3 \%$ . The proportion of participant-oriented bundles in these two sets of research articles is more similar ( $. 4 . 8 \%$ and $6 . 3 \%$ ) at these frequency and threshold values than they are when the frequency threshold is 20 pmw and the range is $1 0 \%$ of texts ( $3 . 6 \%$ and $8 . 0 \%$ , where we see the largest difference between the two disciplines, with Linguisics having more than twice the percentage of participant-oriented bundes. What his means is that we an arrive atdifferent conclusions about the discourse preferences of various genres or reisters and different writers when we employ different frequency cut-off points for identifying lexical bundles. My experiments show that we would reach a different conclusion about the use of participant-oriented bundles in Biology and Linguistics if we use 15 pmw for the frequency threshold and a $5 \%$ range instead of a frequency threshold of 20 pmw and a range of $1 0 \%$ of texts.

The crucial point that emerges from these experiments i that many of the multi-word sequences whose frequency fall just below the arbitrry cut-off point can express the same discourse unctions as those that fall above the cut-off imit earchers, howeer, may overlook this point and present claims about the texts they are analyzing as though no other mult-word unit expressing a particular discourse function exists other than what has been identified as a lexical bundle by the set criteria. Therefore, claims about the meanings constructed in a set of texts or attributes about the authors of a set of texts based on the lexical bundes identified by a particular frequency may not always be completely accurate.

The results of the experiments with corpus composition provided in Table 3 generally show a greater number of lexical bundle types with the smaller corpus of half the number of texts in each discipline. Interestingly, the proportion of participant-oriented lexical bundles does not remain the same for a particular extraction citerion acros the two corpus sizes in a particular iscipline. For example, when we compare the proportion of participant-oriented bundle in Biology and Linguistics for the frequency threshold of 20 pmw and a range of $1 0 \%$ of texts, with a corpus of 200 research articles in each discipline, the proportion of participant-oriented bundles in Linguistics is $1 2 2 \%$ more than the proportion of participant-oriented bundles in Biology (8.0 versus $3 . 6 \%$ . Surprisingly, the proportion of participant-oriented bundles in Linguistics is $3 . 7 \%$ less than the proportion of participant-oriented bundles in Biology when we compare the results using the same threshold frquencies with the smallr sub-corpora of 100 research artices from each discipline (5.2 versus $5 . 4 \%$

When we consider the figures in Table 3for total lexical bundle types, the number of participant-oriented bundle types, and the proportion participant bundle types make out of allbundle types, we see variation within one discipline. What is noteworthy is the variation in the proportion of a particular bundle function when different corpus composition and frequency thresholds are used in bundle extraction since the proportion of bundles of a particular function has been used as a distinguishing feature of the discourses being analyzed (for example, in Esfandiari & Barbary, 2017; Hyland & Jiang, 2018). Although i all but one experiment the proportion of participant-oriented lexical bundles in Linguistics research article i higher than that found in Biology research articles, the dif ference in proportion or predominance of this type of lexical bundleacrossthe two disciplines varies depending on corpus composition and frequency thresholds used in bundle extraction. If researchers only use one set of criteria for bundle extraction and functional analysis, they could reach conclusions about discourse preferences and meanings constructed in disciplines and by authors they would not have had they used a different set of criteria for lexical bundle extraction.

# 3.3. Shared bundles across corpora

Another yardstick used as an indicator of systematic ifferences across groups of texts, whether to point out differences across disciplinary norms or the writing characteristics of goups of writers, has been the number of lexical bundles shared across groups of texts. For example, Hyland (2008b: 12-13) supports his claims of disciplinary specificity in academic writing from four disciplines, Electrical Engineering, Biology, Applied Linguistics, and Busines Studies, through the smal overlap infrequent lexical bunde from the different discipline, pointing to the finding that, "over half of the items in eac ist of the 50 most frequent bundes] do not occur at all in any other discipline and that \*only five bundles [are] shared acrossal four disciplines." However, this picture about the distinctivenessof a specific corpus can change considerably if we consider more than the top 10 or top 50 lexical bundles from the corpora being compared since a lexical bundle missing from the top 10 or top 50 list could very wellhave ben extracted as a lexical bundle following the criteria being used.

I searched for the top 50 bundle from Hyland's Engineering list (Hyland, 2008b, p. 12) in the corpus of 20 research artices from Biology used in this study. All but five of the50 lexical bundles were found in the corpus of 200reearch artice from Bology, albeit at different frequencies. Hyland's claim that half the items from any discipline are not found in the other disciplines, which was based only on comparing the 50 most frequent lexical bundles, is therefore, problematic. The multi-word units identified as lexical bundes in one discipline, Engineering, are, i fact, present in another discipline (Biology) but just not at the same frequency to merit being on a "top $. 5 0 ^ { \circ }$ list or even to be identified as a lexical bundle. Nonetheless these units are sill instances of prefabricated or formulaic Ianguage with the same discourse function although they are not used at the frequency level that they emerge as the top 50 lexical bundles determined by the threshold points selected by the researcher.

As indicated earlier, overall, the number and proportion of participant-oriented lexical bundles is mostly higher in the Linguistics corpus. As such, we could conclude that authors of Biology research articles do not use the range of participant-oriented bundles that Linguistics authors use. We could further conclude that Biology authors do not place as much emphasis on focusing on participant relations and stance in their research writing. Since lexical bundes identified in one corpus could be stil found in another corpus even if they do not reach lexical bundle status, I searched for 33 participant-oriented bundles that were identified in the Research and Discussion sections of Linguistics articles, the largest number that were identifie in various experiments I conducted (an experiment not reported inthis paper due to length constraints), in the Biology corpus because, a indicated in ig. 1, mult-word expressions that are labeled as lexical bundles in one corpus could be present in another corpus with les frequency and therefore not be flaged as a lexical bundle. Only one out of the 33 participant bunde identified in the Linguistics texts was asent in the Biology texts, reuting any claim that might be made of the distinctivenessof the participant-oriented bundles used in Linguistics based solely on the lexical bundles identified in both corpora. Obviously, seral of thee bundes were not found as frequently in the Biology texts ut it would e inaccurate to claim from lexical bundles research that Biology uses a smaller range of participant-orinted bundles. It would be inaccurate to say, for example, that Biology writers are not using the lexical bundles \*may be atributable to" or it is interesting to" because they only occur one or two times in this corpus. Clearly, these expressions are being used by Biology research article writers although not as frequently as by the Linguistics writers.

# 3.4. Summary of results

In summary, my experiments varying frequency and range thresholds in lexical bundle extraction and employing these sets of thresholds on corpora of diffrent composition have indicated that the number of lexical bundle tokens and types extracted from research articles in one discipline can vary. The proportion that 4-word bundles make out of otal number of words, which researchers have used to conclude about the degre of formulaicit in a corpus, changes with different threshold and dispersion criteria and corpus size. More importantly, when different frequency and range criteria are employed in bundle extraction, lexical bundles serving a particular function can be found to vary in their frequency and proportion in a disciplinary corpus. As such, what my experiments have shown is that what we conclude to be differences in values across academic writing from various discilines is afected by the critria used for bunde extraction and corus size. We could, therfore,conclude that writing intwo different discilines or writing by two sets of writers is more different to ach ther depending on the corpus and criteria used for bunde extraction. Additionall, my analysis of the two sets f texts also showed that just because a particular lexical bundle does not appear among the lexical bundles extracted or the most frequent lexical bundles from a disciplinary corpus does not mean that that multi-word unit is not being used in that discipline.

Because of arbitrary frequency cut-off points for identifying lexical bundles, which sidelines the fact that multi-word unit frequencies form a continum, the results from some previous studies could present a starker difference across disciplinary academic writing than might be warranted. Importantly, losing sight of the frequency requirements for lexical bundle extraction can result in interpretations about disciplinary writing that are inaccurate, especiall regarding the sharing of lexical bundles across disciplines.

# 3.5. Implications from results for previous research

The results of my experiments raise some important questions about previous research. It should be noted that some previous studies making claims about the levels of formulaicity in different genres or in the writing of different groups of writers have not considered the effct that the size of a corpus can have on the lexical bundles extracted. For example, in a study on disciplinary variation, Hyland (2008b) speculates on the reasons for Electrcal Enginering having a greater number of lexical bundles and the highest percentage of words given to 4-word bundles $( 3 . 5 \% )$ , while overlooking the fact that the Electrical Engineering corpus was the smalles corpus in his cross-disciplinary study. In another recent study, a claim that \*the higher employment of bundles by thesis writers can be due to their lower writing competence" is made, where thesis corpus with fewer but longer texts (50 texts) i compared with a research article corpus of 173 text Shirazizadeh & Amirfazlian, 2021 p.100 946) Inthis study, istribution of lexical bundes in $1 0 \%$ of texts in each sub-corpus was used as a criterion, which would equate to five texts for the thesis corpus versus 17 texts for the research article corpus. This dfference in corus composition could have inflate the number of bundes identified in the thesis corpus and not the thesis writers' "lower writing competence" as intimated by the study authors.

Another finding from my experiments is that the proportion of a type of lexical bundle (that is a bundle with a particular discourse function) can vary for texts from the same discipline or by a group of writers when different extraction criteria or corpus sies are used. Esfandiari and Barbary (2017) is an example of a study where clams about two groups of writers, Persian and English writers, i based on proportions of particular lexical bundle types identified using one set of extraction criteria. We could wonder if the conclusions reached about thee writrs would be different if dfferen eraction criteria had be used Inaent study, Hyland and Jing (2018) acknowledge the skewing in counts of lexical bundles when comparing lexical bundles in corpora of diffrent sizes following normalization, referring to observations from Cortes (2015), and claim that they have circumvented this methodological isue by only comparing the proportions of lexical bundle functional and structural types across sets of research articles from four disciplines over three points of time in their chronological study, where the sub-corpus from one time period is four times larger than another sub-corpus. However, my experiments have shown that corpus ize can also affect the proportion of a particular lexical bundle func. tional type, so the problem of using different corpus sizes has not been circumvented by comparing the proportion of a particular bundle type. Results can be skewed even when the proportions of lexical bundle types are compared across corpora of diffrent sizes.

Numerous studies have based their claims about the distinctivenes of groups of texts or writers by the lack of overlap of frequent lexical bundle acrosscorpora. Appel and Murray (2020: 6) remark that only two lexical bundles are shared in the academic writin of students with three ifferent 1s. owever, the number of shared lexical bundes in this case was only from the top ten lexical bundes from each sub-corpus. Shirazizadeh and Amirfazlian (2021), in their recent study of lexical bundles in Aplied Linguisics, compare the lexical bunde extracted from these, reearch artices and textbooks and conclude about the level of distinctivenes of lexical bundes used in each genre based on those not shared wit the bundles extracted in the other genres. In thi case all lexical bundes extracted were compared (and not just those that were on a top ten or top 50 list). But what was identified as a lexical bundle in one sub-corpus could have ben found in the other sub-corpora even if it did not meet th frequency requirement (set somewhat arbitrily in a study) to be identified as a lexical bundle. Therefore, stating that  set of lexical bunde i distinctive to a particular corpus can be inaccurate if there had not been a search for these distinctive lexical bundles in the comparative corpora. (See discussion above on the hypothetical case given in Fig. 1.)

When researchers set stringent requirements and compare only frequent lexical bundles acros corpora to arive at claims about disciplinary spcificity or the stinctivenes of a particular gne or the writing of a particular group of writers, they are overlooking a crucial point about multi-word units that have been identified as lexical bundes. A multi-word unit hati formulaic can still be present in a type of discourse without surfaing as a lexical bundle. The point to underscoreis that the methodology itelf is making differences that are merely points on a continum look sharply categorical. Therefore, differences in academic writing across disciplines may be more nuanced and not as dissimilar as some results from lexical bundles research may make them appear. What sms to be overlooked in claims made is that lexical bundes were identified due to ther frequency and that we cannot ssume thee expresions are absent in a corpus simply because they are not being used at an arbitrrily setfrequency level. Therefore, clams made in lexical bundle articles such as in Hyland (2008b: 9), that [m]any bundles used by enginer are not found in the other disciplines" (tlics added) can only be made if these bundles were searched for in other disciplinary corpora and were not used at al. In astudy comparing expert and novice writers, Wang (2018) showed, through manual identification, that novice writers produced a wider range f formulaic sequences than expert writers and also noted that the methodology of frequency-based research overlooked sequences that did not met a certain frequency threshold.

Researchers have advocated that the authors of corpora with fewer lexical bundles need to increase the range or variety of multi word units they use. For example, Kashiha and Chan (2015:309) report that native speakers \*demonstrated a higher variety of lexical bundles" and recommend that ET materials include more actvities on the use of lexical bundes. However, what some researchers al to consider is that because lexical bundles are identified by high frequency usage, use of a greater variety of expressions or multi-word units would result i fewer lexical bundes being identified in such texts. Some other researchers, on the other hand, have acknow! edged that writing might include more variety when there are fewer lexical bundles. A comment by Biber et al. (2004) about their finding that classoom discourse makes use of four times as many lexical bundles as textbooks is relevant here. They offr the explanation that the textbook writers are free of real time production constraints and therefore make more diverse language choices. Similarly, in the study comparing lexical bundes use by English leaners with thre different first languages mentioned earlier, ppel and Murray (2020: 10) speculate that French learners might have felt more confident "experimenting with the language in unique ways that were les frequently repeated among writers' to account for the finding of lower use of lexical bundles by French 1 students compared to Chinese and Arabic L1 students.

# 4. Lexical Bundles and Pedagogy

I turn now to discussing the use f lexical bundles research in academic writing instruction. As indicated earlier, studies of lexical bundles in academic discourse have been justified in terms of the role played by lexical bundles use in acculturation into a discourse community with claims such as \*frequent use f lexical bundles . sems to signal competent language use within a register' (Cortes 2004, p. 398). Hyland similarly provides as reason for his studies that the use of bundles signal \*competent participation in a given community" (Hyland, 2008b, p. 5) and that \*the absence of such clusters reveals the lack of fluency of a novice or newcomer to that community' Hyland, 2012, p. 165). Such studies hoped then to uncover the lexical bundles of expert discourses to facilitate the acculturation of novices. As previously mentioned, studies have ilustrated differences in use f lexical bundes between novices, both undergraduates and graduate students, and the patterns found in published genres such as textbooks and research articles (Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008a). The findings from these studies have not always pointed in the same direction. For example, Hyland (2008a) found that apprentice writers used a greater variety of clusters with greater frequency while others such as Chen and Baker (2016: 877) found that low proficiency writrs showed repetitive use f alimited range of familiar formulae. In contrast to Chen and Baker (2016), Appel and Wood (2016: 66) found that lower proficiency writers manifested greater use of stance lexical bundles and discourse-organizing bundles than higher proficiency L2 writers in a timed writing assessment, which they caution \*should not automatically be taken as a sign of increased proficiency." In contrast, it was found that higher rated essays by L1 Korean writers in timed writing contained more academic bigrams and trigrams (Garner et al., 2019).

Studies identifying lower proficiency students' limited use of lexical bundles have also advocated for instruction and materials development using list of lexical bundes (Li & Volkov, 2017; Byrd & Coxhead, 2010). The lexical bundlesthat have been identified in published academic writing are said to have \*high pedagogic value' as they are "community-authorized ways of meaning making (Hyland, 2012 p. 153). However, the frequent use of lexical bundles as a signal of competent production of discourse is an area that still eems to be in ned of further empirical study. ssues recently raised y Durrant (2018: 213) question theasumption of a positive connection between the use of lexical bundles and writing proficiency; one question raised i the extent to which \*formulas constrain and limit originality in academic work and student learning." Durrant (2018: 220) also points to the need for \*substantial further research" on the \*relationship between use of formulas and perceived qualit of academic texts." In addition, Morton and Storch (2019: 20) in their study of authorial voice in doctoral writing list the \*reetitive use of formulaic expresions" as an example of a text feature that led some disciplinary readers to react negatively as they saw this use as detracting from the development of a strong authorial voice in doctoral writing.

Studies have also reported the results of pedagogical efforts to consciously teach students the lis of lexical bundles identifie in corpus analyses. Some studies on teaching lexical bundles have noted the growth in use of these bundes in student writing (AlHassan & Wood, 2015; Murray, 2017), while others have reported littl ong-lasting learning of these lexical bundles even if there might be short-term gains (Fritz et al., 2022). An early study by Jones and Haywood (2004) did not find muchaccurate use of the lexical bundles that were explicitly taught in the writing produced by students.

Several studies have been conducted on the teaching of lexical bundles to novices but not all have evaluated the quality of writing resulting from such instruction. AlHassan and Wo0d (2015 report on a study of focused instruction of 12L2 learners academic writing and provide empirical evidence for an increase in use of lexical bundles fllowing the intruction. This study also showed independent evaluation of the student texts as mostly showing improvement in quality fter treatment. Rashtchi and Mohammadi (2017) point out that the qualit of their students compositions was negatively affected by the overuse of some discourse-oriented lexical bunde after lexical bundes intruction. Murry (2017) showed an increase in total use and variety f formulaic sequences in the treatment group following explicit intruction although overuse of a particular formulaic sequence was also noticed. A study by Liou and Chen (2018) showed an increase in formulaic sequences after explicit instruction but showed a decrease in use in a delayed post-test. The authors also claimed that the writing had improved steadily although the writing was rated by the study authors themseles and not evaluators unconnected to the study. In a recent study on instructing EFL students on sequences needed for email writing, Fritz et al. (2022: 25) found that students were able to "moderately increase their usage of formulaic sequences following the treatment but were unable to correctly produce most of the 27 formulaic sequences they had been taught after the post-test.

These studies raise a number of points. First, not allstudies have shown that lower proficiency students or novices use fewer lexical bundles in their writing. Another point (also mentioned in the previous section) is that the greater the range of mult-word sequence in a discourse, the lower the number of identified lexical bundles willbe in that iscourse. A third point is that studies have not always shown competent student us f lexical bundles following instruction. Even if explicit instruction of frequent lexical bundes results in some lening and us of these unde in writing, it i not clear that the use f the bundes reults in higher ratdwritig that is more likely to gain the students entrance to the academic communities they seek membership to, an original justification for lexcal bundes research. Studies exploring the writing qualit of students who have been taught lexical bundes are needd to ill the gap pointed toby Durrant (2018) for studies on the impact of lexical bundles use on perceived quality of writing.

Teaching L2 students or novices lexical bundles using lists of bundles from research studies, even if such lists are meant to prompt more independent exploration, does present a pedagogy where lists of lingustic forms are being foregrounded, which may not necessarily promote the sort of genre inovation in a writing class that Tardy (2016) call for. Interestingly, students in at least one class fcusing on lexical bundles requested a larger number of altenatives to express similar functions (Eriksson, 2012, p. 205) In addition, Byrd and Coxhead (2010) have also noted that teachers and students may nee convincing arguments about the need to focus on well-known words in lexical bundles when the language on either side of lexical bundles is often more complex in structure.

# 5. Conclusion

This study showed through a series of experiments that the tokens and types of lexical bundles extracted from corpora were different when bundle exraction criteria and corus siz were changed. Scificall, findings fromiscilinary discour varied when lexical bundle extraction citria and corpus size were changed It was shown that ifferences acrosdisciplines in lexical bundes use can be exacerbated when certan frequency criteria are mployed in lexical bundle extraction and for certain corpus sizes. This can lead to a skewing of our understanding of formulaicty and the use of certain functional features in disciplinary discourses. This study also showed that the lexical bundes we identify using set criteria for extraction do not always capture the variet in formulaic trings being used in a particular discipline. ome previous studie have arrived at narrow conclusions about the eclusive use of few lexical bundes in certain disciplines (or by a certain group of writers) without ascertaining if the identified lexical strings might be present in a comparative corpus for example, Hyland, 2008; Appel & Murray, 2020; Shirazizadeh & Amirfazlian, 2021). Disciplinary differences in academic writing may not be as pronounced as some lexical bundle research findings have indicated. My experiments showed that the differences acros disciplines could converge more in the context of certain parameters of bundle extraction, highlighting the need for more nuanced interpretations of results from lexical bundles research. Future studies clearly need to exercise more caution in interpreting the results of lexical bundes studies, bearing in mind that frequency critri, corus composition and si affect the results of lexical bundle extraction.

The critical review of studies teaching and evaluating the use of lexical bundles in academic writing provided in the second half of this paper has highlighted the mixed results from attempts at instructing lexical bundle. It hasn't yet been consistently shown that such instruction leads to writing of higher quality. Finally, although most lexical bundles studies state as a premise that the lack of appropriate lexical bundle use results in marginalization in a discourse community, there are no studies to my knowledge, that have definitively shown this to be the case.
