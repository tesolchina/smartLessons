# ABSTRACT

This article discusses whether digital visual and audio feedback in learners’ own voices improves their perception and production of lexical tones in Chinese as a foreign language. Forty-four beginners participated in a four-week training focused on the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese tones at the word level. Half received digital feedback generated by Praat, a phonetic research software, to visualize the contours of their tones while hearing corrected tones in their voices. The other half participants received visual and audio feedback given by the researcher. While both groups enhanced their tone perception and production skills during the training, the Praat-aided group made significantly larger progress than the control group. Post-training survey revealed participants’ preference for the imitation of corrected tones in their voices and the direct visual comparison between their tone contours and those of corrected tones. The findings corroborate the importance of computer-assisted multimedia learning in foreign language pedagogy, which also has implications for employing research-oriented technologies and automated tonal feedback in the instruction of Chinese as a foreign language.

# Introduction

Mandarin tones are one of the difficult suprasegmental features for learners from non-tonal language backgrounds to acquire in Chinese, not only because of their contrastive properties for lexical meanings (Duanmu, 2007), but also owing to the variability of individual pitch among learners (Pike, 1972). Various pedagogical approaches have been explored to improve learners’ tone perception and production, including minimal pair drills and explicit instruction (Wiener et  al., 2020; Zhang,

2019). Nevertheless, it is still hard for them to pinpoint which aspects of their tones are wrong and what standard tones are like in their voices (Anderson-Hsieh, 1992; Peabody & Seneff, 2006). Teachers also find it challenging to verbalize students’ tone errors and offer advice for further improvement (Chun et  al., 2015; Mushangwe, 2014).

Computer-assisted speech visualization is one of the approaches Chinese language teachers have used to overcome the difficulties with tone instruction. It provides more accurate and replicable feedback than humans do (Pennington, 1999). It also gives learners a certain autonomy to reflect upon the gaps between their tones and standard tones. The synchronous illustration of audio and visual tones makes errors more observable as well, leading to more tailored analyses from the researcher’s perspective (Anderson-Hsieh, 1992; Chun, 1989). However, these computer-aided pedagogies are more experiential than being informed by cognitive theories such as multimedia learning and constructivism (Mayer, 2002; von Glasersfeld, 1989). Correspondingly, there is a lack of systematic investigation on how to apply digital tonal feedback in teaching and how to enhance students’ tonal input from multiple cognitive channels.

The present study examined the effect of computer-aided feedback on a tone training of Chinese as a foreign language. Multimedia learning, a cognitive theory of pedagogies that advocates the simultaneous presentation of visual and audio input for better learning outcomes, underlies the implementation of digital multimedia feedback in the training. Speech visualization technologies were adopted to provide visual tonal feedback. Pitch transformation techniques were employed to correct learners’ tone errors while maintaining their voice traits. The findings of the study contribute to computer-aided foreign language pedagogy by offering an alternative approach to utilizing audio feedback in tone training. The digital manipulation of audio and visual tones also provides guidance on applying the cognitive theory of multimedia learning in foreign language instruction.

# Literature review

# Conceptual framework of multimedia learning

Multimedia learning refers to the consideration of more than one channel of cognitive resources in instructional design, for instance, the alignment of audio and visual materials to illustrate a concept (Mayer, 2002). It is more related to teaching than learning, the latter of which is denoted as multimodal learning (Mayer & Sims, 1994). The cognitive theory of multimedia learning advocates constructivism, which proposes that teaching and learning occur through people’s active participation rather than passive involvement in knowledge and skill construction. Accordingly, constructive teaching can be fostered in light of the cognitive processes involved in teaching and learning; for example, when the teacher explains an abstract concept with diagrams, students’ learning of this concept can be boosted by the complementarity of verbal and visual representations of the same concept in their minds (Ainsworth, 1999).

Constructivist teaching is supported by the assumptions of multimedia learning, particularly dual-channel coding and active processing (Mayer, 2005; Paivio, 1990). Dual-channel coding entrenches cognitive processing by establishing connections between visual and audio representations in human minds; for example, narration with pictures is easier to remember than monologue as the former has visuals as additional resources to recall (Baddeley, 1997). This kind of connections is assumed to facilitate active processing, which features a coordination of integrating learning materials with prior knowledge (Mayer, 1997). However, simply adding multimedia resources does not guarantee their effective use in teaching. More instructional efforts should be spared in creating favorable conditions for multimedia learning.

Computer-assisted language instruction is a suitable field to apply constructivist teaching informed by multimedia learning. Multimedia content compensates for teachers’ verbal lecturing by illustrating an instructional message from multiple cognitive channels (Gilakjani et  al., 2011). The inclusion of multi-channel resources also conforms to the multimodal learning styles of individual students, leading to more engaging practices (Gee, 2005). Nonetheless, theoretically oriented studies of multimedia learning addressed reading and writing more than speaking (Jewitt, 2005; Mayer & Moreno, 2003). Multimedia learning also needs to be distinguished from sociocultural theories of learning in that it aims to promote learning by manipulating internal cognitive processes rather than situating language behaviors in social contexts (Mayer & Moreno, 2002; Karagiorgi & Symeou, 2005).

# Computer-aided pronunciation pedagogy

Notwithstanding the theoretical concerns, multimedia learning has been robustly evidenced in computer-assisted foreign language pronunciation training, with prosody as the most investigated topic (Gorjian et  al., 2013; Kong & Yue, 2014; Meng, 2014; Yenkimaleki & van Heuven, 2016), followed by phonemes (Lambacher, 1999; Neri et  al., 2006; Olson, 2014) and speaking skills (Hincks, 2005; Osatananda & Thinchan, 2021; Pennington & Esling, 1996). A variety of audiovisual technologies have been exploited, including phonetic research tools such as oscilloscope displays and spectrograms (Vardanian, 1964; Spaai & Hermes, 1993), tutoring programs for pitch and accent (Lima, 2020; Teeranon, 2020), and automatic speech recognition techniques (Eskenazi, 1999; Kim, 2006). Studies comparing computer-assisted multimedia learning to auditory-dominant human instruction clearly show an advantage for the former in aspects such as speech intelligibility and social communication (Jiang & Chun, 2021; Yenkimaleki & van Heuven, 2019).

Nevertheless, a few studies still obtained more favorable results for human feedback; teachers can also offer multimedia learning resources by gestures and social contexts with more adaptability as compared to computers (Lee et  al., 2015). Most teachers are also not prepared to employ pronunciation technologies, not only because of their insufficient technological knowledge (Levis, 2007) but also little guidance on how to utilize digital feedback to benefit pedagogy (Anderson-Hsieh, 1994). Technical discussions are conducted more often than instructional dialogues as well, which may have overshadowed the pedagogical focus of pronunciation technologies (Neri et  al., 2002). While exercises at the discourse level contribute to the development of students’ foreign language communication skills (Hardison, 2005; Levis & Pickering, 2004), inquiries into the cognitive processes of pronunciation equip teachers with more awareness of foreign language features and more manners of multimedia learning in instructional design (Coniam, 2002).

Computer-assisted foreign language instruction of Mandarin Chinese tones embraces multimedia learning as one of its underlying rationale. Acoustic analyses of pitch height and contours generated by computers provide more accurate and comprehensible feedback on tone errors (Molholt & Hwu, 2008; Wang et  al., 2003), although they cannot tell why students make certain errors, which still depends on teachers’ verbal interpretations (Chun, 1989; Zhang, 2019). Practice materials are mostly the same as test items, resulting in the concerns of generalizing computer-assisted learning effect to the natural use of a foreign language (Chun et  al., 2015). Few research are conducted on the pedagogical reasoning of multimedia feedback, leading to an illusion that simply adding audiovisual technologies would induce positive learning outcomes (Mushangwe, 2014).

# The present study

In view of the foregoing literature, this study investigated whether digital feedback was more helpful than human instruction in the pronunciation training of Mandarin Chinese tones. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning was used to interpret the training results concerning internal cognitive processes rather than social interaction. The research focus was the influence of computer-aided feedback on tone practices during the training.

Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2021), a free phonetic software, was used to offer digital tonal feedback for the training. Praat has been widely employed in computer-assisted foreign language instruction, especially for suprasegmental features, because of its user-friendly interface and few requirements of phonetic knowledge to operate (Chun et  al., 2015; Li, 2019). Another reason for selecting Praat was that it could present original and corrected tone contours simultaneously on the screen, with either of them being able to be played back. A third advantage was that it could correct tones in speakers’ own voices, which fulfilled the purpose of contrasting computer-aided audio feedback with human pronunciation in this study.

Praat-generated tone contours were used as visual feedback in the training. Digital audio feedback was created by the researcher manually transforming learners’ incorrect tone contours into correct tones in their voices (see Appendix E for an exemplar of pitch transformation procedures in Praat) according to the five-point-scale method for tone transcription (Chao, 2006). This pitch transformation technique was proposed by Peabody and Seneff (2006) to provide audio feedback on learners’ tone production while keeping their voices unchanged. However, its pedagogical effect has not been tested. Nor has it been combined with visual feedback to see their collective impact on the tone training of Chinese as a foreign language.

Research questions are as follows:

1. Is digital feedback more helpful than human feedback in promoting learners’ tone perception and production in the training?   
2. What are the learners’ opinions about computer-assisted multimedia feedback on their foreign language learning of Mandarin Chinese tones?

# Materials and methods

The study adopted a mixed-methods design. The first research question was addressed by a quasi-experiment training on the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese tones. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the multimedia group with digital feedback created by the researcher manipulating Praat, and the control group with human feedback from the researcher. Pre- and posttests for listening and speaking were conducted to assess the training effect on participants’ tone perception and production. Although the training exercises were focused on production, both perception and production performance were assessed in the tests to gain an understanding of the skill transfer effect in the training.

The second research question was probed by an email survey after the training. It investigated participants’ tone issues and their perceptions about Praat-aided multimedia feedback. Since participants in the control group were not involved with Praat in the training, they were given a demonstration of it before the survey to ensure that they understood how it was operated.

Test and training items were piloted on another 20 students who were enrolled in the same course level as participants were before the study. Items were selected from the Pinyin textbook of the course (Shen et  al., 2006) to reduce the disturbance of the training on participants’ normal classroom learning. The sub-scale reliability of each part, namely Listening Part 1 and Part 2, and Speaking Part 1 and Part 2 of pre- and posttests, was over 0.96, indicating high reliability of using those items in the training (items in pre- and posttests were only differed in their order of presentation). The reliability of training items was over 0.95, indicating high reliability of practicing with those items in the training. Survey questions were also piloted on those 20 students. One question––what apps do you use to practice Chinese pronunciation––was deleted after getting no answer from three fourths of the students. This question was also less relevant to the training as compared to the other four questions in the survey (see Appendix D for the list of survey questions).

# Participants

The study adopted a convenience sampling by recruiting 44 undergraduate students in two Beginning Chinese classes at a private university in the United States. They majored in non-linguistic disciplines such as economics and biology. The purpose of recruiting students with non-linguistic majors was to reduce the influence of confounding variables related to Praat knowledge on the training. All of them were non-tonal language speakers (19 Americans, 14 Koreans, and 11 Mexicans) who had not learned Chinese before their registration for the course. Their ages range from 18 to 24. There were ten males and 12 females in the multimedia group. The control group had nine males and 13 females.

Although Koreans have pitch accents in some of their native dialects and are culturally closer to Chinese than English and Spanish speakers, Mann-Whitney U tests of mean ranks showed that their listening and speaking pre-test scores for monosyllables $\ U _ { \mathrm { l i s t e n i n g } } = \ 1 6 5 . 0$ , $p = . 2 5 4 , r$ $\ c = \phantom { - } . 1 5 3$ ; $U _ { \mathrm { s p e a k i n g } } ~ = ~ 2 0 0 . 0$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 8 0 0$ , $r = . 0 6 6 \AA$ ), polysyllables ( $U _ { \mathrm { l i s t e n i n g } } =$

156.0, $p = . 1 7 1$ , $r = . 2 0 1$ ; $U _ { \mathrm { s p e a k i n g } } = 1 7 5 . 5$ , $\textstyle P = . 3 8 1$ , $r = . 1 1 8 ^ { \cdot }$ ), and the total test $\prime U _ { \mathrm { l i s t e n i n g } } = 2 0 3 . 5$ , $p = . 8 7 0$ , $r = . 0 3 5$ ; $U _ { \mathrm { s p e a k i n g } } = 1 7 8 . 5$ , $p = . 4 2 5$ $r = . 0 9 5 )$ were not significantly different from those of other participants. Their individual posttest scores for monosyllables, polysyllables, and the total test were also within interquartile ranges away from corresponding medians. Those data indicated the comparativeness of Korean and non-Korean participants in the training.

# Instruments

The study comprised a four-week tone training and a post-training survey. Test and training items were presented in the form of Pinyin to diminish the influence of extraneous variables such as character recognition on the training. Pinyin is an alphabetic spelling system for Mandarin Chinese pronunciation with four diacritics denoting four tones, for instance, mā, má, mǎ, mà (the monosyllable ‘ma’ is used to display the four tones). The study was focused on tones at the word level, for participants were still learning Pinyin and had not acquired any conversational phrases at the time of data collection. Test and training items were different in order to examine the transfer of tone skills gained in the training to the pronunciation of untrained items––an analogy to the application of what students learned in class to foreign language use in natural settings.

Exercises C of Lesson 6 to Lesson 9 in the Pinyin textbook were selected as training materials, with exercises in each lesson being practiced in each week. The reasons for choosing Exercise C were as follows: (1) it was used in class assignments, which caused minimal disturbance on participants’ course learning; (2) it covered all the phonological units of Mandarin Chinese syllables with four tones (see Appendix A for more information). Pre- and posttests were also derived from course materials: the tone section of the first monthly Pinyin test was designated as the pre-test, and the same test with a different randomized item order composed the posttest.

Table 1 displays the 60 monosyllables and 40 polysyllables in Exercises C of the four Pinyin lessons. All of them are realistic Mandarin Chinese syllables instead of fabricated consonant-vowel combinations with balanced allocation of four tones. This was done to ensure the practical impact of the training on participants’ Chinese learning. The distribution of four tones within training items was checked against that in the Contemporary Chinese Dictionary (Da, 2010; Liu & Ma, 1986) to verify their alignment with each other at the word level (see Appendix B for more details). While dictionary statistics indicate mostly the situation of written Chinese, it can be reference for tonal combinations in general.

Tests were divided into two sections: the listening section for tone perception had 25 monosyllabic items and ten polysyllabic items. The speaking section for tone production also had 25 monosyllabic items and ten polysyllabic items. Same as the design of training materials, test items are realistic Chinese syllables with four tones dispersed across a variety of consonant-vowel combinations. A sample test paper is shown in Appendix C.

The post-training survey addressed participants’ tone issues, their perceptions about Praat-aided feedback in the training, and their future plans for tone learning. Owing to its exploratory nature, the survey contained four open-ended questions to elicit detailed descriptions and reflections on the training experiences from participants. Questions were developed in the following steps to ensure the credibility of the survey: first, three topics––foreign language experiences, training feedback, and future learning plans––were selected as the focus of inquiry with example questions employed by previous research on Praat-aided foreign language pronunciation training (Chun et  al., 2013; Chun et  al., 2015; Jiang & Chun, 2021). Second, specific wording was added to tailor questions to the training in this study (Dörnyei & Taguchi, 2009), for instance, ‘what tone issues do you have?’ and ‘which part(s) of Praat-aided feedback do you like best?’ Drafted questions were then discussed with other language teachers regarding their practical relevance to students’ tone learning. These questions were also piloted on another 20 students who were enrolled in the same course level as participants were. Final revision for question items and their wording were made based on piloting results before the training.

# Procedures

The study was incorporated into course schedule. The pre-test was conducted after participants finished learning consonants, single vowels, and tones by the end of the first month. The training was carried out as weekly tutoring in the second month, with Lesson 6 and Lesson 7 for compound vowels, and Lesson 8 and Lesson 9 for nasal vowels. Participants took the posttest when they completed the last training session. Surveys were sent out after the posttest. All except two participants sent their answers back one week later. The response rate was $9 5 . 4 5 \%$ .

Figure 1 illustrates the training operations for one participant within each group on a weekly basis, including what the course instructor, the researcher, and participants did before the training, how long a training session lasted, how the researcher provided feedback for each group, and in what manners participants practiced tones in the training. Participants in both groups were asked to tighten or loosen their vocal cords to adjust pitch height and movements; for example, if their 1st tones were lower than corrected 1st tones, they were suggested to tighten their vocal cords to raise the pitch. If they mistakenly produced a 2nd tone for a 4th tone, they would be asked to find a high point within their pitch range and quickly loosening their vocal cords while dropping the tone. Figure 2 shows the interface of visual tonal feedback in Praat.

Operational procedures were designed in the following ways to reduce the impact of confounding variables on the training: (1) the researcher, who did not know participants before the study, was not the course instructor, who was not notified of what participants did in the training but continued with normal classroom instruction with human feedback on tone practices in class; (2) the same researcher carried out the training for both groups; (3) both groups received audio and visual feedback with the only difference in delivery modality (digital vs. human) hypothesized to affect the training effect. Nevertheless, a few issues still existed to complicate the interpretation of training results; for example, participants’ differential class performance caused by the training may make the instructor change tailored feedback to them in class, leading to a mixture of training and class feedback differences among participants. The modality of training feedback may or may not coincide with participants’ preferred learning styles due to randomized group allocation, which might affect their motivation in the training. Although the same researcher handled the training for two groups, efforts might be more spared in the multimedia group as a novel way of offering tonal feedback.

# Data analysis

Data analysis began after all the training and tests were completed. Errors that did not belong to tones were not counted. For listening tests, one point would be assigned to participants if they wrote down the correct tone of a syllable. For speaking tests, one point would be assigned to participants if they pronounced the correct tone of a syllable. As the results of speaking tests were subjectively assessed by the researcher, another Chinese language teacher was invited to grade speaking tests for data reliability. The inter-rater reliability reflected by Cohen’s kappa coefficient $( \kappa )$ was 0.988 $\left( p < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . Discrepancies were resolved by the two raters’ discussion on divergent items.

To answer the first research question, non-parametric tests were conducted after obtaining significant results for the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality as well as checking Q-Q plots and histograms for the listening posttest ( $W { = } 0 . 8 9 8$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p = { } . 0 2 7 . } \end{array}$ ), speaking pre-test ( $W { = } 0 . 8 9 0$ , $p = . 0 1 9 ,$ ), and speaking posttest $W { = } 0 . 8 3 5$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 2 ,$ in the multimedia group: Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were first conducted to examine whether participants in each group improved their tone perception and production skills during the training. Mann-Whitney $\mathrm { U }$ tests were then conducted between the two groups to see which group made larger progress. For the second research question, participants’ perceptions about tone learning and Praat-aided tonal feedback were summarized by the researcher reading their answers to each survey question.

Effect size for each hypothesis testing was assessed for the magnitude of the training effect and its practical significance. The correlation coefficient $r$ was used to index the estimates due to the dichotomous feature of independent variables (pre-post contrast in Wilcoxon matched pairs tests and digital vs. human feedback in Mann-Whitney U tests) and the ordinal nature of the dependent variable, namely pre- and posttest scores (Rosenthal et  al., 2000). Correlation coefficients were calculated in standardized units to allow for comparison of results across studies (Tomczak & Tomczak, 2014), which was also adopted by most previous research on foreign language education (Andujar et  al., 2020; Javan & Ghonsooly, 2018; Teng & Zhang, 2020). Its formula is shown below:

$$
r = \frac { Z } { \sqrt { N } }
$$

$Z$ is the standardized value of test statistics. $N$ denotes the amount of observations $Z$ is based on. The threshold of small, medium, and large effect size is .25, .40, and .60 suggested by the meta-analyses of foreign language studies, particularly those with pronunciation instruction and educational technologies (Lee et  al., 2015; Plonsky & Oswald, 2014; Tamim et  al., 2011).

# Results

# Test scores for tone training

Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the total test, monosyllables, and polysyllables in the listening and speaking sections of pre- and posttests.

Wilcoxon matched pairs tests revealed that both groups improved their tones during the training, suggesting an overall training benefit regardless of feedback modality. For the multimedia group, posttest scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores regarding the total test for listening $\scriptstyle ( Z = 4 . 0 1 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 8 5 6 ,$ ) and speaking $( Z = 4 . 0 1 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 8 5 5$ ), monosyllables in listening $\scriptstyle \left( Z = 3 . 0 9 8 \right.$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $r = . 6 6 0 \AA$ ) and speaking $( Z = 3 . 1 7 6$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 6 7 7 .$ ), and polysyllables in listening $\scriptstyle { Z = 4 . 0 2 9 }$ , $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 8 5 9 _ { . }$ ) and speaking $( Z = 4 . 0 8 1$ , $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1$ , $r \ =$ .870).

a Due to limited space in the table, test names are simplified as follows: Pre-L for the listening section in the pre-test, Post-L for the listening section in the posttest, Pre-S for the speaking section in the pre-test, and Post-S for the speaking section in the posttest.

For between-group comparisons, Mann-Whitney U tests of mean ranks instead of medians were carried out as the score distributions of the two groups were not always similar (some of them diverged from normal distribution, as were mentioned above). Table 3 shows the descriptive data of mean ranks regarding total scores, monosyllabic scores, and polysyllabic scores in the listening and speaking sections of pre- and posttests.

No significant differences were found between the two groups for total pre-test scores in listening ( $U { = } 2 4 1 . 5$ , $\textstyle p \ = \ . 9 9 1$ , $r = . 0 0 2 ,$ and speaking ( $U { = } 2 3 8 . 5$ , $ { p } = . 9 3 4$ , $r = . 0 1 3 \mathrm { \AA }$ ), monosyllabic scores in listening ( $U { = } 1 7 7 . 5$ , $p \ = \ . 1 2 8$ , $r = . 2 3 2 $ ) and speaking ( $U { = } 1 9 0 . 0$ , $p \ = \ . 2 2 0$ , $r = . 1 8 7 $ ), and polysyllabic scores in listening $U { = } 2 3 9 . 5$ , $ { p } = . 9 5 3$ , $r = . 0 0 9 \mathrm { \cdot }$ ) and speaking ( $U { = } 2 3 8 . 0$ , $\textstyle p \ = \ . 9 2 5$ , $r = . 0 1 4 ,$ ). These results indicated that the starting levels of tone perception and production for the two groups were similar. By contrast, posttest scores of the multimedia group were significantly higher than those of the control group regarding the total test for listening $U { = } 1 1 0 . 0$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $r = . 4 7 4 $ ) and speaking ( $U { = } 1 1 4 . 0$ , $p = . 0 0 3$ , $r = . 4 5 9 )$ ), monosyllables in listening ( $U { = } 9 8 . 5$ , $p = . 0 0 1$ , $r = . 5 1 9 _ { . }$ ) and speaking ( $U { = } 1 3 0 . 0$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 8$ , $r \ = \ . 4 0 3$ ), and polysyllables in listening ( $U = 1 2 5 . 0$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 6$ , $r = . 4 2 2$ ) and speaking ( $U { = } 1 1 7 . 0$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 3$ , $r \ =$ .451), indicating that Praat-aided feedback was more beneficial than human feedback to participants’ tone practices in the training.

# Post-training survey

For self-reported tone issues, both groups focused on specific tones, for instance, difficulties in distinguishing the 2nd tone from the 3rd tone. Two participants from the multimedia group and one from the control group described their struggles with the transfer of what they heard differently into distinct pitch movements in production. Another participant from the multimedia group mentioned her inability to articulate single tones consistently in phrases and sentences.

As for Praat-aided feedback in the training, all the participants from the multimedia group found it helpful to have audio input together with visual tones for practice. Special commitments were credited to the audio feedback in their voices:

I really liked hearing my own voice say it back to me and had visualized tones at the same time. Hearing just my voice or seeing the tones would not have been as helpful (Participant 7 in the multimedia group).

Another advantage of the digital feedback was that it raised participants’ awareness of particular tone errors:

I liked it fixes my tones with my voice from the recording because I could shadow the specific tones more easily and friendly with my voice (Participant 9 in the multimedia group).

A third benefit was the highlighted differences between participants’ tones and corrected tones by displaying them simultaneously on the screen:

It was nice to be able to hear and see the differences between what I was doing and what was the standard pattern for the tone. I felt like I could more accurately replicate the correct sound (Participant 8 in the multimedia group).

Nevertheless, three participants from the multimedia group and a majority of participants from the control group expressed their concerns about the maintenance of gains from computer-aided feedback after the tutoring––one 15-minute weekly session was too short for sustainable improvement. They also pointed out the importance of humans when implementing digital feedback in the training; for example, the researcher manually manipulated Praat for tone correction and directed their attention to the differences between their tones and corrected tones. Two participants from the multimedia group and five from the control group stated that they still preferred human feedback, which was how they acquired other foreign languages.

Regarding future plans for tone learning, two thirds of the participants recommended Praat-aided feedback for time-saving and effective practices in a low-pressure learning environment. However, the complexity of Praat manipulation, if being used by students, and the contextualized use of training materials should be considered before promoting it to a wider audience. Responding to the last question about a Praat-aided tone learning app, nearly half of the participants showed their reluctance to try it for a variety of reasons––proficiency levels they would like to reach, self-practice time they could commit to, and the budget for subscribing learning apps, to name a few.

# Discussion and conclusions

The results of the training corroborated two claims made by the cognitive theory of multimedia learning for foreign language pronunciation: (1) the combination of audio and visual feedback promotes tone learning (Chun et  al., 2015; Mushangwe, 2014), and (2) computer-assisted multimedia teaching is more helpful than human instruction (Jiang & Chun, 2021; Mahdi & Al Khateeb, 2019). The first claim was evidenced by significant differences between pre- and posttest scores in both training groups. This may be attributed to dual-channel coding activated by the synchronous illustration of audio and visual feedback, regardless of whether participants received those feedback from computers or humans. The simultaneous presentation of audio and visual tones strengthened the connections between audio and visual representations in participants’ minds, which facilitated them to integrate cognitive resources from multiple channels for tone perception and production (Mayer, 1997, 2002, 2005). Such benefits could not be realized by single or sequential display of audio and visual materials (Mayer & Moreno, 2002), which was also pointed out by Participant 7 from the multiple group in the survey.

The second claim was supported by the superior posttest performance of the multimedia group who received digital feedback over the control group with human feedback. This finding was different from multimedia advantages reported by previous research (Ainsworth, 1999; Yenkimaleki & van Heuven, 2019) because the control group in this study also received both audio and visual feedback from the researcher. Combined with participants’ survey answers, this advantage may be a result of active processing promoted by constructive teaching: the parallel visual display of original and corrected tone contours gave additional clues for participants’ tone errors. They could thus identify those errors more easily by themselves rather than being pointed out by the researcher, as Participant 8 from the multimedia group elaborated in the survey, leading to more learner-initiated reflection on the gap between their tones and corrected tones. Corrective audio feedback in participants’ own voices, as Participant 9 from the multimedia group reflected in the survey, also raised their awareness of the ultimate level they were expected to reach for certain tones while feeling less stressed to practice by trial and error because of the affectively appealing voices of their own (Kymissis & Poulson, 1990). All of these benefits rendered

Praat-aided feedback more cognitively salient than human feedback, which in turn motivated participants to actively construct their tone perception and production skills rather than passively receive guidance from the researcher in the training.

The findings of the study also brought up the transfer issue of foreign language skills. Despite the focus of tone production in the training, positive transfer effect occurred between tone perception and production skills from training items to different test items, which is not in line with the skill-specificity assumption of skill acquisition theories––the automatization of a skill only occurs through the exercises of that skill (DeKeyser, 1997, 2001, 2007). The existent literature also has controversial findings about the skill specificity of foreign language (Allen, 2000; Farley, 2001; Li & DeKeyser, 2017), particularly with oral production when the output can function as auto-input, that is, learners’ own words are part of the input they receive from the environment (Ellis, 1994; Levelt et  al., 1999), such that listening and speaking skills cannot be mutually exclusive (Byun, 2009; Taie, 2014). A modest correlation between perception and production skills has been verified by previous phonetics studies as well (Flege, 1999; Wang et al., 2003). Therefore, more investigation is worth conducting on the conditions for this positive transfer.

Limitations of the study are mostly related to the scope of the training and the operation of group treatments. Delayed posttests were not included to track the sustainable impact of Praat-aided feedback on participants’ tone perception and production. The training duration was also short as compared to their overall acquisitional processes of Mandarin Chinese tones. The background knowledge of Praat in the two training groups could have been more homogenous if participants in both groups had used Praat-aided feedback before the training. The skill transfer effect between tone perception and production should have been more informational by analyzing the training data for particular tones and designing treatment groups in terms of which skill they were trained on. Tone correction in Praat still relied on the researcher’s manual alignment with traditional tone transcriptions rather than being normalized according to the fundamental frequency of each participant’s pitch.

Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of Praat-aided feedback on tone learning in Chinese as a foreign language. Digital tone contours and pitch transformation techniques in Praat also indicate promises for the automation of tonal feedback for students’ self-regulated learning, if the multimedia feedback on longer tone combinations and the endurance of human perception for non-standard pronunciations, namely the gap between intelligibility and accuracy, can be resolved in computer-aided pedagogy in the future.

# Appendix D. Questions in the post-training email survey

1. What problems or concerns do you have when you perceive and produce Mandarin Chinese tones?

2. Do you think the Praat-aided tonal feedback is effective? Which part(s) do you like best? Which part(s) do you like least?

3. Will you recommend other students who are learning or want to learn Mandarin Chinese tones to use this kind of computer-assisted tonal feedback? Why or why not? 4. Now we are working with computer programmers to automate the adjustment processes of Mandarin Chinese tones in Praat. Our goal is to develop an app that students can use at home to practice tones by themselves (just like digital tuners in the vocal training or guitar training for music instruction). You do not need a teacher to help you adjust your tones; the computer will do the job. If this kind of product is put into the market, will you buy it (30 days free trial, and later on perhaps several dollars each month for use)?

# Appendix E. Operational procedures of creating Praat-aided tonal feedback

First, select the “To Manipulation…” function under the “Manipulate-” category on the main interface of Praat to generate the original tone contour of a training item produced by a participant.

Second, the participant’s original tone contour of the training item jiàoshì which means classroom in English is displayed on the screen. It can be seen from the figure that the participant mistakenly pronounced two 3rd tones for two 4th tones for the training item.

Third, select all the tone points and click the “Pitch” drop-down menu to remove all of them.

Fourth, add new pitch points to form corrected tone contours according to the five-point-scale method for tone transcription (Chao, 2006).
