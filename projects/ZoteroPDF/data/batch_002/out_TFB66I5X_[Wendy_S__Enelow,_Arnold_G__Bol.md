About the Authors.. 237

If you’re currently in the job market, we’ve got some great news for you! According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( ), total employment in the United States is expected to increase by 14.7 percent between the years 2004 and 2014. What’s more, not only is the number of opportunities expanding, but the composition of the workforce is also changing. Service-producing industries such as healthcare, technology, engineering, transportation, social services, and others are growing at a much stronger pace (nearly 20 percent over the same period of time) than goods-producing industries such as manufacturing and construction.

As the numbers indicate, it’s a great time to be looking for a job, whatever your particular situation (for example, graduating college student, skilled tradesperson, mid-level professional, senior-level executive, return-to-work mom, or military veteran). Opportunities are everywhere, and your challenge is to position yourself in the best way possible to capture those opportunities and land a great new job.

The first and perhaps most vital step in preparing yourself for a successful job search is to create a powerful resume that will open doors and generate interviews. Bottom line: That’s the real purpose of your resume. Resumes do not get jobs; people do. Your resume is simply your calling card, designed to clearly communicate you are,  you can do, and  you do it. If you’re equipped with a who what how wellpowerful resume, you will instantly give yourself a measurable advantage over your similarly qualified competition.

To help you achieve that competitive edge, we’ve created a one-of-a-kind resume book that clearly and concisely guides you through the resume-writing process. To be sure that this book is easy to use, we’ve cut through all the confusion and gotten right down to brass tacks—hence our  approach. We’ve given you the information you need, provided you with the worksheets to assemble all your information, demonstrated how and where to use that information, and given you close to 100 resume samples to review. When you’re finished with this book, you should have a resume that is well-polished, well-positioned, and powerful—a true  resume.

# Simple Truths About

# Resume Writing

Professional resume writers know that resume writing is a unique combination of art and science; careful attention to detail and creative use of language; substance and style; and strategy and implementation. They understand that resumes are not just listings of past work experience and educational credentials, but rather they are documents designed to  job seekers into their next jobs.

As professional resume writers ourselves, we follow a very systematic, nononsense approach to resume writing that has opened the doors to new opportunities for tens of thousands of job seekers. Now, we’re going to share that information with you in the first-ever, no-nonsense guide to resume writing that gives you insider secrets to writing well-polished, well-positioned, and powerful resumes. If you follow the steps, activities, and strategies outlined in this book, you’ll be able to craft a resume that is sharp, distinctive, on-target, and effective in generating interviews and offers.

# The Six Simple Truths About Resume Writing

e Six Simple Truths About Resume WritingBefore you begin to write your resume, there are six strategic concepts you must understand. Professional resume writers live by these truths and understand how critical they are in positioning a candidate for the opportunity.

Truth #1: Write to the Future   
Truth #2: Know  You Are   
Truth #3: Strategy and Positioning Are Key   
Truth #4: Sell It; Don’t Tell It   
Truth #5: Keywords Rock!   
Truth #6: There Are No Rules for Resume Writing

If you can truly grasp what these concepts mean and how they apply to your particular job-search situation, you will be able to write a strong and effective resume that will open doors and generate interviews. Let’s explore each of these simple truths.

# Truth #1: Write to the Future

Resume writing is about writing toward your next job; it’s not about rehashing your past experience. That is, perhaps, the single most important strategy for resume writing. If you understand it, then you’ll be well prepared to write your resume. If you do not, you’ll find that your resume-writing process becomes much more difficult than it needs to be.

To best illustrate this concept, let’s examine the resumes of two sales professionals with similar backgrounds, but very different objectives. The first candidate, Sam, has been in sales for 12 years and now wants to move into a sales management position. To write toward his new career goal, Sam is going to place a heavy emphasis on activities such as sales recruitment, sales training, region/territory management, product positioning, sales budgeting, forecasting, and all the other management-related functions he has performed. These items, in combination with his sales achievements, become the foundation on which Sam’s entire resume is written. He needs to put a heavier emphasis on his sales management qualifications, as opposed to his field sales experience, to better position himself as an individual who is already well-qualified for his targeted management position.

Our other sales candidate, Leslie, wants to transition from her 12-year fieldsales career into an accounting position, and her resume will be totally different from Sam’s. To write toward her future career goals, Leslie is going to highlight her experience in budgeting, forecasting, revenue planning, profit projection, cost control, and other related skills. Most likely, these functions were not Leslie’s primary job responsibilities as a field sales representative; however, they were ancillary responsibilities that she managed. As such, she needs to bring them to the forefront of her resume so that she is able to effectively position herself to make her desired transition into her future accounting career.

To further demonstrate this concept, let’s examine the resume-writing process for an insurance agent who now wants to work as a crisis intervention counselor. Employed in the insurance industry for more than 15 years, Jim has also been an active volunteer in several community-based counseling organizations. He’s been doing this for more than 10 years, although he’s never been paid for his time and expertise in this area. Because Jim’s goal is to transition into a counseling career, the primary focus of his resume will be the skills and experiences he’s acquired through his volunteer efforts, with just a brief mention of his insurance career at the very end of his resume. The terms you’ll see on his resume will include crisis intervention, one-on-one counseling, group counseling, treatment planning, inter-agency relations, and more. If prepared effectively, Jim’s resume will communicate that he is a well-qualified counselor and not an “insurance guy.” In turn, he will have created a document that appropriately positions him for his desired career move.

This concept is what is referred to as re-weighting, or shifting the emphasis of your resume from one set of skills to another in order to support your current career objectives. Decide what it is you want to do at this point in your career and then highlight all of your relevant skills, experiences, and qualifications— whether from paid work experience, training, volunteer activities, or community service. Each of these experiences is important, because each equipped you with different skills that may be pertinent to your current career goals.

Re-weighting is an acceptable practice in resume writing. It’s what gives you the power to transform yourself into who you want to be to successfully pursue your new career goals. A word of caution, however: Don’t overstate your qualifications. If you are granted an interview, you’ll discover that you’re neither adequately prepared nor qualified for the job. Rather, always write with our motto in mind: Stay in the realm of reality!

# Truth #2: Know Who You Are

It’s not possible to write a truly effective resume without knowing what your objective is—the type of position you’re interested in or the industry in which you want to work. This concept ties directly into Truth #1—Write to the Future—and in order to do that, you must have a job goal in mind. This goal may be as specific as a network engineering position or it may be more general, such as a position in marketing, public relations, or corporate communications. Either way, in order to write toward your future goals, you must know who you are and how you want to be perceived by prospective employers and recruiters.

Many people reading this book may, indeed, already have a particular job objective in mind, or at least a good idea of the types of positions in which they’re interested. If this describes your situation, you may want to jump to Truth #3, starting on page 15.

For others of you who may be uncertain as to where you’re headed next in your career, we recommend you take some time to explore your core skills and competencies, the things you enjoy doing and the things that motivate and inspire you. It’s also important to have a clear awareness of the things you truly dislike doing. If you assemble a list of these items, you should begin to see patterns of interest that will help you in identifying your career goals.

To help you with that process, we’ve designed a few simple exercises that should guide you in further clarifying your career goals and highlighting particularly relevant strengths. Take your time when completing these exercises and think carefully about your responses.

# Capturing pturing Your Corour Core Skillse

Directions: Think about all of your skills—work-related and otherwise—and include them in the column “What I Do Well.” Maybe you’re great with organizing things, good with numbers, effective in staff training, successful in increasing revenues; the list goes on and on.

In the column, “What I Don’t Do Well,” list all the things you’re not so good at (dealing with irate customers, interpreting written instructions, or maybe researching data). Be honest with yourself; no one but you is ever going to see this list.

<html><body><table><tr><td>What I Do Well</td><td>What I Don&#x27;t Do Well</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# Identifying Identifying Your Optimal our Working Environment

Directions: In the left-hand column, list all the things you enjoy about your current job. If you’re not currently employed, think back to your last job. This column might include things such as flexibility, autonomy, decision-making responsibility, and people interaction.

Then, in the right-hand column, list all the things you did not like about that job. These items might include a difficult boss, an isolated working environment, or poor staff communication.

#

#

<html><body><table><tr><td>What I Love About My Job</td><td>What I Hate About My Job</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# Identifying Identifying Your Key Intery Interests and Motiests Motivators

Directions: Forget about work for a few moments and focus on your personal interests and activities. In the left-hand column, list things you enjoy doing outside of work (for example, baseball, cycling, or stamp collecting). Then, in the right-hand column, list things you dislike doing outside of work, such as household chores, errands, and volunteering.

<html><body><table><tr><td>What I Like Doing Away From Workd</td><td>What I Don&#x27;t Like Doing Away From Work</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Once you’ve completed the previous three exercises, you should immediately begin to see certain patterns and be able to identify four distinct areas:

$\blacktriangleright$ Things you do well and like doing.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Things you do well, but dislike doing.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Things you enjoy, but don’t do well.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Things you dislike and don’t do well.

Take a look at the following chart to better understand how this works.

<html><body><table><tr><td>&lt;Skilled </td><td> Unskilled&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Things I Like to Do and Things I Do Well (1)</td><td>Things I Like to Do and. Things I Don&#x27;t Do Well (2)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Things I Don&#x27;t Like to Do and Things I Do Well</td><td>Things I Don&#x27;t Like to Do</td></tr><tr><td>(3)</td><td>and Things I Don&#x27;t Do Well (4)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

To help you interpret your results, we’ve labeled the sections in the chart 1 through 4:

Box #1: These are your “proficiencies.” They’re the things you’re really good at doing and you also particularly enjoy. Perhaps you’re a purchasing agent who is excellent at negotiating with vendors. You take pride in this capability and genuinely enjoy the interaction with each supplier. This type of skill definitely belongs in Box #1.

Box #2: Things listed here are “development opportunities.” You really enjoy these activities, but aren’t very “proficient” at them. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to be a master woodworker and cabinetmaker, but have little skill or experience. With extra training, you might be able to develop this skill and transform woodworking into one of your “proficiencies.”

Box #3: These are your “burnout skills.” You’re probably very good at doing these things, but don’t enjoy doing them. At work, you may be repeatedly asked to perform a task that you do very well, but that you perceive as unchallenging and unrewarding. Exploring career opportunities that move you away from these tension points is probably a smart choice.

Box #4: “Avoid like the plague.” You hate doing these things and you’re not good at doing them. For example, many bank tellers were hired at a time when the valued skills for that job were accuracy, attention to detail, and a friendly demeanor. In today’s banking world, many tellers are now expected to sell products and are evaluated on their sales performance. Gradually, the nature of the job changed, and many tellers felt they were being forced to do something they didn’t enjoy. If you find yourself in this situation, or a similar one, the best thing to do is start looking for a different position more suited to your proficiencies.

Once you identify what you do well, what you truly enjoy, and what motivates you to do a good job, you will have a better understanding of who you are. With this enhanced self-awareness, you’re much better prepared to put together a resume that tells an employer what’s unique and valuable about you, and how you can contribute to the bottom line.

If, after doing the previous exercises, you’re still uncertain as to your next career move, we recommend you consult with a career coach or career counselor who can offer more comprehensive career assessment and testing services. Some of the more well-known career assessment tools are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), DISC, ${ \bf O } ^ { * } { \bf N } { \bf E } { \bf T }$ , Keirsey Temperament, and TypeFocus. To find a qualified career professional who can administer these assessments and help you set your career direction, check out these resources:

# Truth #3: Strategy and Positioning Are Key

Your resume needs to present you as the best candidate for the position you are applying for in order to capture job interviews and offers. You can achieve this by using the right strategy to communicate who you are and by positioning yourself as you want to be perceived. Think of resume writing just as you would portrait painting; the only difference is you’re using words on the page instead of paint on a canvas.

In no-nonsense terms, your resume must portray the best you for the position you seek. If you’re targeting a senior management position, you need a resume that looks sharp and upscale, clearly highlights your achievements and contributions, and demonstrates the depth of your management and leadership experience. If you create a resume that is less sophisticated in its presentation and wording, you will not have positioned yourself effectively for the seniorlevel positions you are pursuing.

The opposite can also happen. If you’re a recent college graduate who is anxious to land your first professional position, don’t overdo it! Your resume should reflect the fact that you are a graduating student (with great skills, training, and internships) and not misrepresent you in any way. If a company is recruiting recent college graduates, it wants college-graduate resumes and not resumes for CEOs! Here are a few more examples that will help show you how to accomplish this:

If you consider yourself an up-and-coming candidate ready for your next big step, your strategy should be to emphasize the significant responsibilities and achievements of your last few positions, and how you have responded successfully to the demands of increased responsibility.   
If you’re an older worker with management experience who wants to “smell the roses” and pursue a job with less pressure, then your approach might be to create a resume that highlights your people skills, your capacity to work independently, and the diversity of your experience over the course of your career (while shifting the focus away from all of your hard-core management experience).   
If you were a stay-at-home mom who is now ready to re-enter the workforce, a resume that features the skills you gained from your earlier work experience and volunteer activities, along with your educational credentials, will be the foundation on which you build your resume.

Every job seeker’s situation is different and, as such, every resume is unique. You must be certain to create a resume that strategically positions you for the type of job you are seeking. The words, the format, the design, and the presentation are all key factors that we’ll explore in greater depth as we move through this book.

# Truth #4: Sell It; Don’t Tell It

When it comes right down to it, resume writing is really all about sales, marketing, and brand positioning. Think of yourself as a unique and special product that’s just the right solution for employers who desperately need the features and benefits you have to offer. Your goal is to develop the best plan for marketing yourself to those employers who have a demand for the skills and qualifications you offer. If you think about it, this is the fundamental principle that drives our supply/demand economy—buyers with a need (in this case, the employer who needs skilled workers) and a seller with a solution (in this case, you!).

When you submit your resume to a prospective employer, think of it as a piece of direct-mail advertising. We’ve all received direct-mail ads—they’re the envelopes that say, “You May Have Already Won!” Truly effective direct-mail campaigns get your attention and prompt you to act—namely, by opening the envelope and reading the enclosed material.

The no-nonsense approach to resume writing is more subtle than the cliched slogans used by mass advertisers in direct-mail campaigns. However, the underlying strategy is the same: specifically, prompting the recipient to read and respond to the material. In the case of a job search, you must prepare a resume that markets your unique skills and encourages the reader (HR director or hiring manager) to decide, “I’ve got to talk to this candidate!”

A humdrum listing of job duties doesn’t accomplish this. Your resume needs to highlight accomplishments that show your value to the company you work for now (and the companies you’ve worked for in the past), and how these accomplishments make you a potential asset to a new employer.

Using the “Sell It; Don’t Tell It” concept is a great way to communicate your value and the benefits you bring to the workforce. And it’s a relatively easy thing to achieve. Compare the two statements that follow—one that tells what you did; the other that sells what you did—and you’ll easily see what we mean.

# Telling It

Responsible for managing sales and customer service throughout Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.

# Selling It

Planned, staffed, budgeted, and directed regional sales and customer relationship management programs for $2 0 0 +$ corporate accounts in the $\$ 35$ million Midwestern sales region. Increased product sales by $4 5 \%$ in two years, captured 22 new accounts, and exceeded performance goals by $3 0 \%$ .

Can you see the difference in the impact of these two examples? It should be obvious that the second example is a much better representation of that individual’s talents and responsibilities and, in turn, a more compelling statement of the value he or she brings to a new employer.

Unfortunately, job seekers often don’t believe they have real successes that translate into benefits they can sell to a prospective employer. For example, many assembly-line workers think their most notable achievement is reliably showing up for work every day. Not true! If you’ve ever worked in manufacturing, did you suggest to your supervisor that a safety guard be added to the line to prevent accidents? Did you figure out a way to reduce scrap by making a change that prevented pieces from being damaged on the line? Even if the company didn’t formally acknowledge your suggestion, you know what your contribution was and it’s legitimate to mention it on your resume.

Now, think about your accomplishments—small and large—and how they positively impacted a company’s operating efficiency, productivity, customer satisfaction, or overall profitability. Including these types of noteworthy attributes and achievements on your resume will identify you as someone who brings immediate value to an organization and is well worth hiring.

# Truth #5: Keywords Rock!

Let’s start our discussion of keywords with a clear definition of what they are and why they’re so important. If you’ve ever used a search engine on the Internet to find something, then you’ve used keywords. If you were to type in “Chicago Cubs $+$ Wrigley Field $+$ Box Seats,” you’d probably find a link that would take you to a Website where you could buy tickets for the next time the Mets are in Chicago. Now imagine you’re searching a database of job candidates. You type in “Process Engineer $+$ Lean Manufacturing $+$ Six Sigma Black Belt.” When you click on “Search,” you should come up with a list of process engineering candidates with lean manufacturing and Six Sigma experience. Your results will be ranked by how many times the search engine found those particular keywords in each person’s resume.

Simply put, keywords are those buzz words found in each and every profession. They identify the essential skills, knowledge, and expertise that distinguish someone in a particular field. You probably know what they are for your job—you use them every day—but they’ve become so second nature to your day-to-day activities that you might not recognize their importance. If your resume is entered into one of a variety of scanning systems, or the electronic version of your resume gets uploaded to a database, the potential employer will use specialized software, which functions as a search engine does, to scour the database looking for keywords that are relevant to a particular position.

In the early days of the Internet (way back in 1995!), it was common to see a “Keyword Summary” at the beginning or end of a resume intended for posting on the Internet. This approach was designed to improve the chances that a search tool would hit on the job seeker’s resume and identify him or her as a qualified candidate. As technology has become more sophisticated, it’s become much less common (or necessary) to have a distinctly separate keyword summary. Today, you can incorporate your keywords into various sections throughout your resume; scanning technology will identify them in any location. To help you get started, here are a few examples.

# Example 1: Keywords included in summarluded in summary:

# CAREER SUMMARY

Ten years of progressively responsible experience in Accounting, Auditing, and Finance with Dow Chemical Company. Excellent qualifications in:

\* General Accounting \* Financial Analysis \* Cost Accounting \* Financial Reporting \* Internal Auditing \* Budget Administration \* Expense Reduction \* Information Technology \* Investor Reporting \* Staff Training & Supervision

# Example 2: Keywords integrated into job description:Keywords into job description:

Social Studies Teacher – Brooks High School, Midland, MI 2002 to 2006 Teach European History, Political Science, and Government to junior and senior high-school students. Develop course curricula, design instructional materials, select textbooks, write student exams, evaluate academic performance, and train student teachers.

# Example 3: Keywords integrated into accomplishments:Keywords

# Sales Representative

2004 to Present

IBM, Menlo Park, CA

C Closed $\$ 22.8$ million in sales in 2004 and $\$ 32.6$ million in 2005 through solid performance in new account development and territory expansion.   
C Negotiated and closed a $\$ 4.8$ million sales contract with UCLA, the company’s first-ever sale into the academic market.   
O Built academic market to $68 \%$ of total revenues for the region ( $2 2 \%$ over projections).   
O Led sales presentations and executive briefings to major corporate accounts throughout the western U.S.

Although we have put the keywords in bold in the examples so you could easily identify them, we do not recommend that you bold them when preparing your resume.

Don’t be concerned if you don’t have experience in the career field you are targeting. You can still benefit by incorporating some of the most important keywords from that field into your resume by using a Career Objective. Here’s an example:

# CAREER OBJECTIVE: Investigative Research

Desired job emphasis to include the following: Background Checks / Fraud Investigations / Insurance Claims Fact-Finding / Investigative Report Writing / Legal Research

This is one of the few instances when we recommend an objective (see Truth $\# 6$ , below, and a more in-depth discussion in Chapter 3). Note that in the previous example it is clearly communicated that this candidate is looking for a position that will include those specific functions. Nowhere does it state that this individual already possesses those skills and qualifications. Rather, this is simply a strategy to allow you to integrate appropriate keywords into your resume to meet the needs of scanning technology, so that a real person will eventually look at your resume.

Believe it or not, in this age of technology and electronic-based job search, individual human beings still do read resumes! In fact, many have trained themselves to scan the document with their eyes, looking for keywords that will identify candidates who meet the company’s search criteria. Whether a conscious process or not, when readers see the right keywords, there is instant recognition that this is a well-qualified candidate.

Keywords can be powerful in another way. With a single keyword or keyword phrase, you communicate that you possess a broad range of skills in a particular area of expertise. The keyword phrase “customer relationship management” conveys to the reader that your skills and experience most likely encompass sales, customer service, lead generation, account management, order processing, customer satisfaction, customer retention, and more. A few simple words can truly communicate a wealth of information.

# Truth #6: There Are No Rules for Resume Writing

The fact that there are no rules for resume writing is both an advantage and a potential obstacle. On the one hand, because you aren’t bound by a prescribed set of rules, you have tremendous flexibility in what information you include in your resume, how you include it, why you include it, and where you include it. On the other hand, without a prescribed set of rules, you may find yourself floundering, uncertain of how and where to start and what to include.

Have no fear! Although there aren’t hard and fast rules, there are generally accepted guidelines you should follow to ensure that you’re preparing a resume that will meet the needs and answer the questions of prospective employers. These guidelines are outlined here.

1. Include a work experience section on your resume. Your resume must include your work experience, if for no other reason than to demonstrate to prospective employers that you have, in fact, held a job at some point in your life. It may be that you’ve been working for 20 years and most, if not all, of your work experience is related to your current career goals. On the other hand, it may be that you haven’t worked in 10 years or what you did in the past is not what you want to do now. Either way, it is expected by employers that you will include your work experience, but how that experience is included may differ widely from one job seeker to another, depending on the particular situation. Use the sample resumes in this book to find a format for work experience that best suits you. (The only circumstance in which you would not follow this guideline is if you have never worked before.)

2. Include an education section on your resume. Just as with your work experience, a prospective employer will expect to see an education section on your resume. Sometimes, that section will have a great deal of information about college degrees, professional training, licenses, and certifications. Other times (for example, if the training is not relevant to your current career goal), that section may be very sparse with just a brief mention of high-school graduation, a few courses at a community college, or a technical certification. Whatever your level of education, this section is an important component of a well-prepared resume.

3. Highlight your technical skills and qualifications. Whatever type of position you’re pursuing, the majority of jobs these days require an individual to be technology-savvy. For some professions, for instance an IT manager, network analyst, or technology sales representative, this is a primary requirement, and you should include your technology skills in detail. For most other professions, basic computer knowledge is expected so be sure to include a brief listing of your specific hands-on skills.

4. Start your resume with a career summary. Believe it or not, most resumes these days (and most of the samples you’ll see in this book) don’t have what you might consider a traditional “Career Objective.” With the exception of special cases, such as career changers who are trying to refocus and re-weight their qualifications (as with the example from earlier in this chapter), objectives have been replaced by career summaries. Typically, an objective will state the type of position and/or industry a candidate is seeking. Basically, the objective states what the job seeker wants from the employer.

In the modern resume, chances are you’ll see a “Career Summary” at the top, highlighting a job seeker’s key skills, qualifications, competencies, and achievements. The summary may be as brief as a few short sentences or a list of bulleted items, or it can be as long as most of the first page. Whatever the length, the purpose of the summary is to communicate the value a job seeker brings to a prospective employer; namely, the benefits the employer will gain by hiring that candidate.

5. Write in the first person. At the risk of sounding like your gradeschool English teacher, first-person pronouns are I, me, we, and mine. In your resume, you should never include these pronouns, yet every sentence you write should be constructed as if it started with the word “I.” These examples should help you to understand this concept:

<html><body><table><tr><td>What you should be thinking as you write:</td><td>How these phrases should appear in your resume:</td></tr><tr><td>I supervised a team of 12 clerical employees.</td><td>Supervised a team of 12 clerical employees.</td></tr><tr><td>I achieved 127% of my sales quota for the third quarter of 2007.</td><td>Achieved 127% of sales quota for the third quarter of 2007.</td></tr><tr><td>I reduced production costs. by 20% year-over-year by implementing Lean Manufacturing principles.</td><td>Reduced production costs by 20% year-over-year by implementing Lean Manufacturing principles.</td></tr></table></body></html>

6. Beware of absolutes! Here’s a great example: Have you ever been told that a resume MUST fit on one page? In decades past, that was sage advice, but in today’s job search market, that “golden rule” is obsolete. The no-nonsense truth is an emphatic “it depends”—in fact, that’s the answer to many resume questions. It all depends on your particular situation.

The answer to the question, “How long should your resume be?” is that your resume should be as long as it needs to be in order to tell your story. For recent college graduates or skilled trades people, that may be one page. For a mid-level professional, it’s likely to be two pages, and for a senior executive, it may be three or four pages.

# Top 10 Critical Mistakes to Avoid

Now that we’ve outlined the most important strategies and concepts for writing powerful resumes, let’s explore the things you should never do when writing and distributing your resume.

1. Never overstate the truth on your resume. If you do, you’ll find that you’ll have to defend yourself and your resume in an interview. Even if you get past the interview, your resume may become part of your permanent employee record, if you’re hired, and inaccurate information could come back to haunt you.   
2. Never include negative information on your resume. Your resume is not a job application, nor a life history. Only include information that is positive, and save any negatives for discussion during the interview. Don’t give a prospective employer a reason to immediately exclude you from consideration by including information that may reflect negatively on you, such as layoffs, incarceration, or being fired.   
3. Never include salary information on your resume. It is not the appropriate place. If you’re responding to an advertisement that asks for your salary history (what you have earned in the past) and/or your salary requirements (your current salary expectations), and you choose to provide that information, put it in your cover letter instead. However, countless surveys have shown that if a company is interested in you, you will be contacted, regardless of whether or not you have included the requested salary information.   
4. Never present a resume with errors. Your resume is your personal calling card, and chances are a prospective employer is going to “meet” your resume before actually meeting you in person. If your resume has errors—spelling, punctuation, wording, and so forth—it immediately communicates a negative message to an employer. Who wants to hire someone who produces important documents that contain careless errors? The answer? No one!

5. Never include reasons for leaving a job on your resume. This is information that should be shared during an interview, and only during an interview. Whether you left your last position on a positive note or a not-so-positive note is information that should only be shared in a one-on-one discussion during your interview. Note that prior to or immediately after your interview, you’ll probably be asked to complete an employment application. Most applications will include a section that asks why you left each position. Be sure to complete this information with a brief response (for example, “seeking better career opportunities,” “seeking increased management responsibilities,” or “company downsizing”). If you were fired, we recommend that you do not include that on the application; rather, include a statement that reads, “To be discussed during interview.”

6. Never submit a resume that is difficult to read. If you do, no one will read it! Be sure to use a font and type size that are easy to read, and select a format and design that are attractive and leave lots of white space to enhance readability.

7. Never include a vague or unclear objective on your resume. We discussed objectives and career summaries earlier in this chapter. If, after reading that information, you choose to include an objective on your resume, make certain it is specific—for example, “Position as a Chemical Engineer”—and not simply a vague statement such as “Seeking a position offering training and advancement opportunities.” The latter is useless information and only detracts from the rest of your resume.

8. Never send a resume with handwritten comments. Believe it or not, this happens all the time: A job seeker takes a nicely designed resume, jots down a few notes about a change of address, a change in employer, or some other update, and then sends it to a prospective employer. There is never any time when this is acceptable. If changes or updates are necessary, edit the resume and print a fresh copy before you send it!

9. Never send along supporting documentation with your resume. You may think it will give you a competitive edge, but sending excess documentation such as college transcripts, performance evaluations, awards, letters of recommendation, customer testimonials, and the like is not recommended. Unless you have been specifically asked to supply this information, simply send your resume along with a cover letter. You don’t want to overwhelm someone with a stack of papers that they have to go through to learn about you. That becomes a project and, on many occasions, projects get set aside, and you certainly don’t want your resume set aside! Save all of that additional information to share during your actual job interviews.

10. Never send a resume without a cover letter. Whatever the position you’re applying for, always send a cover letter. It’s expected and, more importantly, appropriate job-search etiquette. Cover letters are powerful tools that, when well written, can give you a competitive edge within the market. Let your cover letter complement your resume and sell you into your next position. (For more information on cover letters, refer to our companion book, No-Nonsense Guide to Cover-Letter Writing, due to hit the market in December 2006, or Cover Letter Magic by Wendy Enelow and Louise Kursmark, available at www.wendyenelow.com).

# Simple Truths About

# Resume Formatting and Design

Two of the most important decisions you’ll make when writing your resume have to do with formatting and design. Begin by asking yourself these key questions:

What resume format am I going to use? Chronological, functional, or hybrid?   
What resume design am I going to use? Standard and conservative? Unique and avant-garde? What do I want my resume to look and feel like?

One huge advantage you can give yourself is to have a resume that doesn’t look the same as everyone else’s. You want to write, format, and design a document that stands out from the crowd and gives you a serious competitive edge.

Now that doesn’t mean you want to do anything “over the top”; rather, you simply want to make your resume look sharp, professional, and distinctive. As you review all the resume samples in this book, you’ll see dramatic differences in presentation, from resumes that are very conservative to ones that are quite distinctive. Later in this chapter, we’ll help you decide where on that continuum—from conservative to very unique—it’s best for your resume to be positioned.

# Resume Formats

With very few exceptions, resumes are produced in one of three distinct formats: chronological, functional, or hybrid. Each has its own unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages; which is best for you will depend entirely on your current career goals.

Following is a detailed discussion of each of these formats and how they are best used. Read all three sections carefully before deciding which format is right for you.

# Chronological Resumes

The chronological resume is the most commonly used resume format and the simplest to create. In fact, chronological resumes are probably what come to mind when you think of a traditional resume. And it may be the way you were taught to write resumes when you were in high school or college.

Chronological resumes are ideal for candidates who want the emphasis to be on the strength of their work experience, particularly if they’ve had a linear career. In other words, this resume format and structure works best if you’ve followed a logical progression from one job to the next, with no serious detours or lengthy gaps in between. This also assumes that your goal is to obtain a job that is either a lateral move (similar duties and responsibilities) or a vertical move in the same field (move up to the next “rung on the ladder”).

When writing a chronological resume, you want to list your jobs in reverse chronological order, starting with your current or most recent position and then working backwards. Your goal is to write comprehensive job descriptions that clearly communicate the responsibilities and achievements of each of your positions. Then, as you move further back in time, you can shorten and summarize your job descriptions, being sure to highlight any notable contributions, projects, responsibilities, and/or awards.

The infrastructure of the chronological resume consists of two distinct sections:

$\blacktriangleright$ Work experience Education

There are, of course, other sections you may include, but these two are the most important for a chronological resume. You’ll learn much more about each of these sections and all the other possible resume components in Chapter 3.

It should be noted that recruiters and human resources professionals often prefer chronological resumes because they are systematic, easy to follow, and easy to interpret. However, before you make the decision that a chronological resume is the right resume for you, be sure to read the section on hybrid resumes, which have many similar characteristics.

The following page features a chronological resume.

# Functional Resumes

The true advantage of the functional resume is that it places a greater emphasis on skills, qualifications, and accomplishments than on your chronological work history. You may want to consider a functional format if:

$\blacktriangleright$ You’re changing careers and want to highlight your transferable skills— those skills that can easily transfer from one industry to another, or from one position to another.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Your most recent job is not the most relevant to the position you are targeting. With the functional format, you can emphasize your skills and accomplishments from a position you held years ago, and not have to bury that information at the end of your resume as you would with a chronological format. You’re a stay-at-home mom who’s ready to return to work. You may have been away from the workforce for an extended period of time, but you can use a functional resume format to highlight skills from your previous work experience, your volunteer activities, and your education.   
( You’re an older worker $5 5 +$ years) and want to de-emphasize your age, while focusing on your skills and qualifications that are most related to your current career objectives.   
$\blacktriangleright$ You’ve been out of the workforce for a year or more, for reasons such as unemployment, illness, or incarceration, or you’ve had a non-linear career in which you moved around without a clear pattern of advancement or consistent employment in a single industry or job function. This scenario seems to occur more and more often in today’s labor market with frequent layoffs, downsizings, and mergers/acquisitions.

The structure of the functional resume consists of three distinct sections:

$\blacktriangleright$ Summary: the longest and most detailed section in the resume; used to highlight your skills, experiences, qualifications, and accomplishments as they relate to your current career goals. Work experience: very brief; generally only a listing with no detailed information. Education.

There are, of course, other sections you may include, but these three are considered the foundation of every functional resume. You’ll learn much more about each of these sections and all the other possible resume sections in Chapter 3.

It should be noted that some recruiters and human resources professionals are less receptive toward functional resumes. In the past, these documents gained a reputation as the format of choice for a candidate who was trying to hide something (usually age or employment gaps). However, if you load your resume— at the beginning—with great skills and accomplishments that meet the employer’s needs, and follow that with a brief but complete work history, the functional resume can be very effective in grabbing attention and getting interviews.

The following page is a good example of a functional resume.

# Hybrid Resumes

The hybrid resume gives you the advantages of both the chronological and the functional formats, and is our preferred resume format for most job seekers. As the chronological resume does, the hybrid emphasizes your work history, responsibilities, and accomplishments, combining these elements with the powerful skills focus of the functional resume. This offers you the best of both worlds, allowing you to highlight your notable work history along with your core skills, competencies, and qualifications.

Hybrid resumes can be effectively used in a variety of job-search situations. Most notably, they’re an excellent format if:

( You’re looking for a position similar to the one you hold now, or held most recently. Use the summary section to highlight your skills and qualifications that are most applicable to your targeted position. You’re looking to advance within your established career track. Use the summary section to highlight all the skills and qualifications gained throughout your work history that demonstrate success within your chosen career, industry, or profession, and have prepared you to advance to the next level of responsibility. You’re looking to change careers. Use the summary section to highlight all the skills and qualifications that are transferable from your previous position into your new, targeted career field.

The structure of the hybrid resume consists of three distinct sections:

Summary: a high-impact summary of your most notable skills and competencies as they relate to your current career objective. Work experience: detailed, with an emphasis on key   
responsibilities and notable achievements.   
Education.

There are, of course, other sections you may include, but these three are considered the foundation of every hybrid resume. You’ll learn much more about each of these sections and all of the other possible resume sections in Chapter 3.

The hybrid format is currently the resume style preferred by most recruiters and human resources professionals because of its dual emphasis on both employment history and skills. Someone can read the summary section of your resume and quickly understand what you offer to an employer. That information is then immediately followed by a strong presentation of your work experience, which should clearly support the skills and qualifications you’ve highlighted in your summary section. In essence, you’re stating, “This is what I do best” (summary) and “This is the proof I know how to do it” (experience). If you can accomplish this with your hybrid resume, you will definitely have made the recruiter’s or human resource professional’s job much easier in identifying you as a quality candidate.

# Resume Designs

Now that you’ve decided which resume format is right for you, it’s time to start thinking about resume design and visual presentation. At this point, you might be asking yourself whether or not design is really a key consideration of the resume process. Shouldn’t design concerns be limited to job seekers in artistic and creative career fields? The answer to that question is a resounding no!

Design is important because it gives you competitive distinction. Put yourself in the shoes of someone looking to hire a purchasing manager. You advertised the position on several major online job boards and in several regional newspapers. Within a week, you’ve collected more than 200 resumes for the position, all of which are sitting in a pile on your desk. Most likely, you’re going to flip through the resumes very quickly, selecting those that catch your eye. As a job seeker, to catch someone’s eye without being over the top, you want your resume to be sharp and clean, but distinctive enough to stand out from the crowd and get you noticed, not passed over.

Now, don’t misinterpret what we’re saying. We are not recommending that you prepare a resume in an unusual font or print it on purple paper. Such choices definitely qualify as over-the-top and are not recommended. Rather, we’re recommending that you take the time necessary to prepare a resume that doesn’t look quite the same as everyone else’s.

One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is by using a font or typestyle other than Times New Roman (the most widely used typestyle in business and on resumes). For every 100 resumes we see, more than 80 of them are in Times New Roman and, as such, they all look very similar. Consider some of the following fonts to help distinguish your resume from the rest of the pack. They’re still clear and easy to read, common to most word processing software, but subtly different from Times New Roman:

Georgia GeorgiaTahoma Arial

Garamond Verdana Schoolbook

Once your resume is written, try placing it in several different fonts to see which one looks best, fills the page best, and most accurately reflects your profession. There are some cautions about using these different fonts if you are planning to send your resume electronically, which will be thoroughly addressed in Chapter 4.

The most commonly used design enhancements are bold, italics, and underlining. When used appropriately, these elements can effectively highlight section headings, job titles, employer names, college degrees, notable achievements, and other information you want to draw special attention to. However, be forewarned: These enhancements only work to your advantage when they’re not overused. For example, if you put half of your resume in bold print, you’ve defeated the purpose, because nothing will stand out.

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Comparison of Common Resume Typestyles and Sizes</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>Roman</td><td>Bold</td><td>Italic</td></tr><tr><td>10 pt.</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td></tr><tr><td>10.5 pt.</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td></tr><tr><td>11 pt.</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td></tr><tr><td>11.5 pt.</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td><td>Arial Bookman Old Style Garamond Tahoma Times New Roman Verdana</td></tr></table></body></html>

Other design enhancements you might consider using to give your resume a distinctive look include lines, boxes, columns, and other graphics. You’ll see many of these design enhancements used in the sample resumes at the end of this section and in Chapters 5–16. However, be careful if you decide to utilize graphics. “Cute” does not work on a resume! Rather, your graphics must be appropriate to your profession and your industry, and enhance the overall presentation.

That’s twice we’ve mentioned that the design must match your profession. To better understand this concept, consider the resumes of two unique job seekers—an accountant and a fashion designer.

The accountant’s resume, as you would suspect, should be on the conservative end of the design spectrum. The font should be very easy to read, such as Tahoma or Arial, only simple lines or boxes should be used to offset any text, and the paper should be white, ivory, or light gray. Anything else would be overstated and inappropriate. The accounting profession is straightforward and conservative, and the resume should represent that.

On the other hand, the fashion designer’s resume should look entirely different and demonstrate the designer’s artistic capabilities. Fonts can be less conservative, such as Century Schoolbook or Garamond, and designer lines, boxes, columns, and/or graphics can be used throughout. Paper should be unique, such as blue, dusty rose, or even pinstripe. The reader should be just as impressed with the visual presentation as with the content of the resume.

The various ways you can design your resume to give yourself a competitive advantage within the market are infinite, limited only by your imagination. Take a look at the three resumes on the following pages to get an idea of what you can do creatively to capture a reader’s interest and entice him or her into action— offering you an interview.

Example #1 on page 35 is a fairly conservative, straightforward approach used by an accountant; Example #2 on page 36 is a “middle-of-the-road” approach, which incorporates some design elements, in this case for a marketing executive; Example $\# 3$ on page 37 shows how you can use graphic design elements, columns, text boxes, and more to create a really eye-catching design.

# Top 10 Critical Formatting and Design Mistakes to Avoid

1. Don’t let your resume fail to present you in the most positive light because it’s prepared in the wrong format. If you haven’t taken the time necessary to determine which format is right for you, based on your background and current career objectives, chances are that you may make a poor selection. If this happens, you’ve immediately short-changed yourself and have not put your best foot forward.

2. Don’t make your resume difficult to read because there is not enough white space, the text extends from margin to margin, and there are no blank lines between sections, paragraphs, or bullets. No one is going to struggle through your resume. Instead, if they have difficulty reading it, they’ll discard it and move onto the next candidate.   
3. Don’t make your resume difficult to read because the font is too small or too fancy. Again, no hiring manager is going to spend the time that is necessary to review a document that is difficult to read. Better to let it run onto two pages and improve its readability.   
4. Don’t use design enhancements that are inappropriate for the targeted profession or industry (for example, lines, boxes, columns, and graphics). Refer to the previous discussion about resume design to be sure you’re preparing a document that is appropriate for your career track.   
5. Don’t overuse bold, italics, and underlining, which clearly defeats the purpose of these design enhancements. They only work if used sparingly throughout the document so that they can have the most impact.   
6. Don’t smudge your resume with fingerprints or coffee stains, or let it be otherwise untidy. This includes folding the resume unevenly or stapling pages together in a haphazard manner. What do you think this communicates about you to a prospective employer? Nothing positive, we can assure you.   
7. Don’t let your resume look poorly reproduced. With the electronic resources available today, there is no excuse for circulating a resume that is not well produced. If you don’t have access to your own printer, visit your local library or copy center so you can print original-looking documents. Always use a laser printer to print your resume.   
8. Don’t make handwritten changes to your resume. There is never a situation in which this is acceptable! If you have to make a change to your resume, do it in the electronic computer file and then reprint the document.   
9. Don’t produce your resume on odd-sized paper. Although many job seekers may perceive this as a competitive advantage, believe us when we tell you it’s not. If you’re looking for a position in the United States, be sure to print your resume on $8 ~ 1 / 2 ^ { \circ \circ } \mathrm { { x } ~ 1 1 ^ { \circ \circ } }$ paper. If you’re looking for a position outside the United States, research that country’s resume preferences and recommended paper size.   
10. Don’t submit a resume with typographical errors. Again, this is never acceptable. Do you want a prospective employer to think you are careless about your work, or that you’ll send out business correspondence, proposals,

and reports with errors? We think not! If necessary, enlist the help of a friend with strong English skills to proofread your documents before printing them and sending them out.

# Simple Truths About

# Writing Your Resume

As discussed in Chapter 1, resume writing is a unique combination of art and science, allowing you to use a creative approach to present factual information about your career. A resume is no longer a single sheet of paper that simply lists your work experience. Rather, today’s resume is a sales document that should be designed to promote the very best you have to offer to a new employer in such a way as to encourage that employer to want to meet you. Bottom line: that’s the only goal of your resume—to grab someone’s attention and get you job interviews!

In this chapter, we’re going to introduce you to the strategies and techniques that we, as professional resume writers, use to simplify and streamline the resume-writing process while still creating unique, customized, and one-of-akind resumes. Follow these instructions and you too will be able to craft a resume that will portray your very best you!

# Step-by-Step Process

Just as many other business-related activities are, resume writing is a process. In many ways, it’s much like writing a technical report, in that the final document (1) has a very specific purpose, (2) must clearly and concisely convey a particular message, and (3) must appropriately communicate that message to its target audience.

With that in mind, it’s easy to understand that resume writing is not at all similar to creative writing (for example, novels, short stories, and poems), in which you stare at a blank piece of paper waiting for inspiration. Rather, resume writing is closer to following an outline or connecting the dots. With our nononsense approach, you’ll be able to connect your dots and write a resume using a very methodical and logical process.

# The Key Resume Elements

As discussed in Chapter 2, resume format and design will vary from job seeker to job seeker depending on each individual’s career goals and target audience. However, all resumes tend to share certain common elements: contact information, skills summary or career summary, employment experience, and education/training. Beyond that, there are numerous other sections you may or may not include in your own resume, depending on how relevant that particular section is to you, your experience, training, and current career goals. Those sections include: honors and awards, licenses and certifications, professional memberships, community memberships, volunteer experience, personal information, publications, and public speaking.

# Contact Information

The very first thing you’re going to include on your resume is your contact information—name, mailing address, phone number(s), and e-mail address. Here are three standard formats you can select from:

# Format #1: Standard

<html><body><table><tr><td>MARISSA M. MASTERS</td></tr><tr><td>1234 Mockingbird Circle</td></tr><tr><td>Henrietta, New York 14467.</td></tr><tr><td>Home (585) 555-2937 / Cell (585) 555-0972 / mmm3@msn.com</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Format #2: Modified

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">LEON J. MARKUS</td></tr><tr><td>112 Monroe Parkway</td><td>(585) 555-9038</td></tr><tr><td>Rochester, NY 14618</td><td>Ijm22922@aol.com</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Format #3: College StudentFormat Student

# MARTIN E. YOUNGMAN

youngmanme@msn.com

Permanent Address: 122 Commodore Parkway Rush, New York 14543 Cell (909) 555-2837

Although including your contact information should be a snap, sometimes there are unusual circumstances or special considerations. Pay close attention to these recommendations:

( If you have a gender-neutral name, consider using one of the following formats so that anyone knows how to address you: Mr. Lynn F. Gundersen Ms. Tracey S. Simpson

If you have a first name that’s difficult to pronounce, or go by a call name other than your first name, consider using one of the following formats so that anyone knows how to address you:

Ranguswamy “Roger” Abdellah

Melissa C. “Chris” Miller

Human resources people and hiring managers are human, and this approach helps put them at ease in contacting and communicating with you and gives them one less reason to screen you out.

If you don’t yet have a personal e-mail address, get one! Today’s job search market has gone electronic and many prospective employers will want to communicate with you via e-mail, and it is inappropriate to use your current work e-mail account to conduct your job search. Rather, get a free e-mail account with Yahoo!, Hotmail, or any one of a number of other providers that will allow you to access your e-mail account from any computer with an Internet connection. When setting up your account, be sure to use a professional-sounding screen name (for example, AJSmith13 $@$ hotmail.com) and not something cute (for example, HoneyBear@yahoo.com).

Be very careful if you decide to include your work phone number on your resume, and only do so if you have a direct number. Even in that situation, it’s preferable to have people contact you on your private cell phone or at your home number. You’re not at your current job to spend your days conducting your job search!

While we’re on the topic, make certain that your outgoing voice mail message, whether on your cell phone or home answering machine, is professional-sounding. For example, “You have reached 555-1234. I’m unable to take your call right now, so please leave a message at the tone,” is much more acceptable than, “Hey, dude! You know the drill—if you’re a telemarketer, drop dead.” One person’s humor is another person’s poor taste.

If you have an online version of your resume (see Chapter 4 for more information on Web-based resumes), be sure to include the Website address (URL) in the contact information section of your resume so people can go online to read more about you and your career.

# Career Summary

Your career summary can be the most important part of your resume and therefore may be the section that takes the longest to write. Consider the following critical information as you write your career summary:

For the most part, the career summary has replaced the career objective on modern resumes. Over the years, objectives have proven to be either too specific, and thus limiting to your job search (for example, “Position as an Electrical Engineer with a Fortune 100 company”), or at the other extreme, so general that they’re meaningless (for example, “Seeking a professional opportunity with a wellestablished company”). What’s more, objectives tell companies what you want from them; not what you can offer to them. The career summary immediately communicates who you are and the value (skills, knowledge, and experience) you offer to a company. This makes it much easier for a recruiter to understand your resume and make an immediate determination that you’re qualified and worth interviewing. Your career summary needs to be front-end loaded with information that will distinguish you from other candidates. This might include your strongest skills and qualifications, notable achievements, professional licenses and credentials, honors and awards, and anything that will set you apart from the crowd. Remember that most prospective employers only review a resume for 10 to 20 seconds on the first screening. Make those few seconds count!

Your career summary can take many forms, with a variety of titles and formats. The examples that follow demonstrate four of the most common approaches many professional resume writers use when they’re writing the career summary sections of chronological resumes.

These are just a sampling of some of the many formats the summary section of your resume can take when you’re writing a  resume. Carefully chronologicalreview the format, design, style, and wording of the summaries on the sample resumes in later chapters of this book to find one that fits your needs.

If, on the other hand, a  resume format is best for you and your functionalspecific career objectives, then use the format that follows as a guide for writing your career summary. Remember: when using a functional format, the career summary section will be the most detailed portion of your resume and, in fact, will probably make up more than two-thirds of the entire document. This is where you’re going to put the majority of your skills, experience, and accomplishments.

# Professional Experience

If the career summary is the  of your resume, then the professional sizzleexperience section is the . You’ve grabbed the attention of the reader with steaka powerful summary that promises the skills and experience that make you the perfect candidate for the position you are pursuing; now you need to deliver on that promise by documenting where and how you obtained those skills and experience.

The most important thing to consider when writing each of your job descriptions is that you want to communicate three distinct things about each position: (1) your responsibilities, (2) the skills you acquired, and (3) specific highlights of that job (for example, accomplishments, awards, and special projects). In essence, you want to say, “This is what I was responsible for and this is how well I did it.”

The format examples that follow, along with the many resume samples in the later chapters of this book, demonstrate some of the ways you can organize the professional experience section of your resume if you’re using a resume format.

If the  format for you is a  resume, writing your professional right functionalexperience section is easy, because it’s usually just a short listing of your job titles, employers, and dates. With a functional resume format, the majority of your experience will have already been presented in your career summary section, so there’s no need to repeat it under professional experience.

Here’s a perfect example of the professional experience section of a functional resume:

# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

RN – Emergency Room, Elks Health System, Elm, IA (2004-Present) RN – Intensive Care, Shore Memorial Hospital, Elm, IA (2001-2004) Staff RN – Trauma Center, Case Hospital, Stockton, IA (1997-2001) LPN, Turner Nursing Home, Fresco, IA (1992-1997)

# Menu Selection: Professional Experience Headings

(Select one of these as a title for the experience section of your resume.)

Professional Experience Employment Experience Work History Career Highlights Experience Summary Job History Career Progression Executive Experience Experience

You’ll note that two of the previous professional experience examples included brief descriptions of the companies; the other two did not. Here’s the rule of thumb you can use: If the company is well-known, it is not necessary to include descriptive information. On the other hand, if you’re concerned that the company is not recognizable, then we do recommend a brief description.

# Education

The education section generally comes after the professional experience section on a resume. However, there are several large groups of job seekers for whom the exact opposite is most appropriate. If you’re a recent college graduate, a career changer who has just earned a new degree, an educator, or anyone else for whom your educational qualifications are more important to your search than your employment background, then you’ll want to position your education section immediately after your summary, and then follow up with your employment experience.

In the education section, include your college degrees, professional licenses, and certifications, as well as continuing education. If you attended college, but have not yet earned a degree, be sure to include that information. If you’re a skilled-trades person or blue-collar worker, you may want to call this section “Training & Education” and include both your classroom and hands-on training related to your apprenticeship.

Examples that demonstrate several approaches to organizing information in this section follow, with many more presented in the sample resumes in later chapters of this book.

# Does

e  MatterIf you’re under the age of 50, you may want to skip this section. The following information is only pertinent to job seekers who are 50-plus years of age and may be faced with some form of age discrimination in their job search (or at least perceive that they are encountering age discrimination). It would be naïve to say that ageism doesn’t exist, but trends are changing and the labor outlook may be brighter than you think.

Let’s begin with a discussion about how the employment market has changed over the past decade. In generations past, people tended to stay with one or two employers throughout their entire careers. Many of us have fathers or grandfathers who put in their 30 years at the local mill or assembly plant and then retired. Even now, there are still some workers out there who went right from high school or college to their first job and are still working for that same company today.

The decade of the 1990s changed that for the majority of the workforce. With the advent of downsizing, rightsizing, corporate mergers, and massive layoffs, today’s workers are on the move—from one job to another, from one career track to another, from one industry to another. The old model of employment longevity is long gone. Today, change and volatility in the employment market are the status quo. Likewise, workers are more mobile themselves. Recognizing that employers are more likely to lay people off during a business down-turn, they are much more willing to shop their skills and talents, test the market to see what they’re worth, and jump ship when a better offer comes along.

As a result, companies have changed how they hire, realizing that they are not hiring for life. Rather, they are hiring employees they need today with the knowledge and understanding that in years to come, they may no longer need them. In this environment, older employees actually offer certain advantages. They often bring substantial experience and a unique expertise that can solve problems, reduce expenses, generate revenue, and even start up new companies. To the astute hiring manager, an older worker represents someone who’s not necessarily looking for a long-term position but, rather, may be happy to work for a company for three to five years as a bridge to retirement.

In the context of writing your resume, it’s appropriate to consider some of the traditional stereotypes of the older worker if only to better understand and dispel them. A few of the common ones include:

Older workers are near the top of their pay scale and would be dissatisfied in lower-paying positions.   
Workers older than 50 have outdated skills compared to more recent graduates.   
Older workers aren’t motivated to acquire new skills or   
knowledge.   
Older workers are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with technology, and therefore unable to function effectively in the electronic age. Workers older than 50 are inflexible and set in their ways.

By creating a resume that demonstrates your flexibility, eagerness to learn new skills and accept new challenges, and familiarity with technology as it relates to your particular career path, you can overcome most of these stereotypes and present yourself as a vibrant, engaged, and valuable candidate.

We strongly recommend that you focus on your most recent experiences and be judicious in how you display dates on your resume. Concentrate on your last 10–15 years of employment experience and summarize highlights from your earlier positions without necessarily including the exact dates. And, if you are older than 50 and earned your college degree in your early 20s, we suggest that you do not include your date of graduation. Not all employers discriminate, but why give an employer a reason to possibly exclude you from consideration? Of course, if you completed your degree within the past 10 years, then include the date and let potential employers draw their own conclusions.

It’s not unethical or dishonest to prepare your resume in a way that best portrays your true capabilities. It is perfectly acceptable to leave out information that’s a tip-off to your age. Remember, a resume is not an autobiography. Rather, it’s a document designed to sell you into your next position. Use your resume wisely to get interviews. Then, once you’re in the door, you will have the opportunity to sell prospective employers on just how dynamic, knowledgeable, and adaptable you can be in contributing to their success.

# Streamlining Your Writing Process

reamlining Your Writing ProcessJust as with any other activity, resume writing gets easier and faster the more often you do it. We recognize that it’s not something that most job seekers do on a regular basis, so here are a few tricks of the trade that should make writing your resume easier and faster.

Professional resume writers know they have a certain time each day when they’re freshest and do their best work. For one of us, it’s first thing in the morning. For the other, it’s late at night. Determine when your prime time is and be sure to write your resume then.

You’ll find it will be much easier to work on your resume Write alone.if you do it when it’s quiet and you have no distractions. Bottom line: you’re going to need to think—and think hard—about what information to include, how to include it, and where to include it. The less noise around you, the better. Ignore the phone, ignore your e-mail, and focus 100 percent of your energies on writing.

easier stuff There are certain sections in your Write the  first. resume—contact information, education, professional memberships, community memberships, publications, and public speaking, for example—that are generally straightforward and factual. These sections usually include simple listings of information. As such, it should be easy to complete these sections of your resume first and use them as the foundation on which to build.

Writing your job descriptions can seem to be a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. The easiest thing to do is first type in your job titles, employers’ names, and dates of employment for each position. Next, fill in the essential duties and responsibilities of each job, along with any factual information about the company (for example, revenues, locations, line of business). Then, go back and write your key accomplishments, project highlights, and contributions for each position. Now all that’s left to do is to consolidate the information that you’ve already written and integrate appropriate action verbs and keywords to boost the resume.

while The easiest way to write your career summary is to begin writing it as you’re writing the rest of your resume. Whether you’re writing job descriptions, listing educational credentials, or completing any of the extra resume sections, as you encounter thoughts, ideas, words, and concepts that will be important to include in your career summary, write them into that section. Then, once you’re finished writing the rest of the resume, you’ll see that your career summary is already half written! A few more minutes of work, and then you’re all finished and ready to launch your search.

Refer to Appendix A for resume worksheets you can use to collect all the information you will need as the foundation to write your resume. Feel free to make copies if you need more forms than we’ve provided.

# Simple Truths About

# Electronic Resumes

By now, you’ve probably spent a great deal of time writing and designing your resume. In Chapter 1, you more clearly defined who you are professionally by identifying the core skills and competencies you offer to a new employer. In Chapter 2, you explored different strategies, designs, and formats to find just the right approach to present your unique skills in a compelling way. And, finally, in Chapter 3, you wrote your resume, step-by-step, carefully organizing the details of your career summary, professional experience, education, and other sections into a document that represents you well and sells you to a prospective employer.

What you have created through this process is a “conventional” printed resume, which is what you most likely imagine when you think about resumes. Even though it probably exists as an electronic, word-processed document, this is the version you will mail or fax to prospective employers and recruiters, take with you to job interviews, and use as an introductory and networking tool. In fact, we like to call it the human-eye version because the style, overall format, presentation, and paper choice are all designed to appeal to readers as they hold the document in their hands, making that all-important, attention-grabbing, first impression.

Although your printed resume is essential, there are other versions of your resume that you’ll most likely need during the course of your job search. In today’s job market, employers and recruiters are relying more and more on email and other online methods of transmitting and tracking information about you, the job candidate. It’s vital for the soon-to-be successful job seeker (you) to have the proper electronic versions of your resume—in addition to that attention-grabbing printed resume—to cover all your bases.

# Electronic Resumes

The importance of the electronic resume is really twofold. First, using the latest technology allows you to get your job-search documents into the hands of the appropriate hiring authority quickly and efficiently. There’s no need to wait for “snail mail” when you can immediately transmit your resume electronically and have it in the hiring authority’s hands within minutes. What’s more, that individual can then share your resume with others throughout the organization. For example, a human resources manager can quickly and effortlessly forward your resume to the manager who will ultimately be making the hiring decision. E-resumes have streamlined the process of resume distribution and provided all of us with the ability to job search in real time.

Beyond the convenience factor that e-resumes allow, employers often use the electronic submission process as a subtle way of testing your comfort level with technology. As an executive recruiter once told us, “If a candidate isn’t savvy enough to quickly e-mail me his resume [without any glitches], then he’s probably not someone we really want to talk to.” That doesn’t mean you have to be a technological whiz, but it does mean you need to have a reasonable familiarity with the basics of electronic resume design and distribution. Therefore, it’s key to understand how to create the four different electronic versions of your resume, integrate them into your job search, and efficiently transmit them to potential employers or recruiters. These four versions are:

E-mail attachments   
$\blacktriangleright$ ASCII text files   
$\blacktriangleright$ Scannable resumes Web resumes

# E-mail Attachments

Chances are, whatever your profession or your industry, you’ll be e-mailing resumes to prospective employers and recruiters on a routine basis. In fact, you’ll find that e-mailing is probably your most frequently used method of resume distribution.

The e-mail attachment you send should be the word-processed, print version of your resume. We strongly recommend that you prepare your resume in Microsoft Word because it is the most commonly used word-processing software, and you can be relatively certain your resume will download at the other end in the same format and presentation style as the original document you prepared. If you do not use Word as your word-processing software, chances are your resume will not transmit well and will lose much of its presentation value. Even worse, it can arrive in an unreadable format. As such, we suggest you either purchase a copy of Microsoft Word, use a friend’s computer with an up-to-date version of Word loaded on it, or consider sending your resume in a

Rich Text Format, Portable Document Format (PDF), or as an ASCII text file. (More information follows about each one of these options.)

To prepare your resume for e-mail transmission, there are several precautions you’ll want to take to ensure that it arrives in an attractive and readable format. In light of the wide variety of software and operating systems currently in use (including multiple versions of Word), your attractively formatted resume document may appear quite differently when viewed and printed by the intended recipient. This potential problem is compounded by the vast array of printers on the market, each with its own printer driver. For example, a tightly formatted two-page resume can wind up on four pages because of different default margins on the printer at the other end, or because of the use of an unusual type font. It’s difficult to totally eliminate these potential problems, but here are some guidelines for minimizing such complications:

Use .75-inch margins on all four sides of the page. Choose a common font. Times New Roman and Arial are virtually universal to most versions of Microsoft Word currently in use. That doesn’t mean you can’t use other typestyles for your printed resume, but for the best chance of compatibility with those reading your emailed resume, use the recommended fonts. If you use word-processing software other than Microsoft Word, consider saving the file in Rich Text Format (.rtf). In most wordprocessing applications, this is a choice from the “Save As” menu, and the .rtf suffix generally appears at the end of the file name when the document is saved. This is a more universally accepted file format by most software and overcomes many compatibility issues. Consider sending your resume attachment as a Portable Document Format (.pdf) if your resume has unique design elements (potentially corruptible by software compatibility issues) and if design skills are key to the position(s) you are pursuing. PDFs are viewed as graphics and are not editable. For this reason, they cannot generally be downloaded and stored in searchable databases. However, a PDF resume can be advantageous if your resume has unique design characteristics, because this format allows you to preserve your attractively designed resume the way you intended it to appear. Send the e-mail attachment to yourself and to several friends who are aware of your job search. This way, you have the opportunity to see how your resume looks when downloaded and opened, and enables you to make any adjustments and correct any problems prior to sending your resume to an employer or recruiter. Once your resume has been prepared for electronic transmission, you send it just as you would any other attachment. Simply open your e-mail program, create a message, attach your resume, and send the e-mail message with the document attached. It’s that easy and only takes a minute. You do, however, want to pay special attention to what you include in the subject line and the body of the e-mail message.

A quick rule of thumb for the subject line is to include the title of the position for which you are applying (and the job/vacancy announcement number, if applicable). In addition, we recommend that you include the words “Resume of” followed by your name. This format immediately alerts the recipient that you’re responding to a specific job announcement and have forwarded your resume. Here’s an example:

# VP of Manufacturing (#45893) – Resume of Jonathan Johnson

If you’re not responding to a specific job announcement and are simply emailing your resume to a prospective employer or recruiter in anticipation that they may have an opening for a candidate with your qualifications, use a headline similar to what you may have used in the summary section of your resume. This clearly identifies who you are and the type of position you are seeking. For example:

# Vice President of Sales / Director of Business Development

When writing the body of your e-mail message, you can do one of two things:

1. You can include a text version of your cover letter as your e-mail message, referencing that your resume is attached as a Word file.   
2. You can include a brief statement in the body of your e-mail that states, “Please see the attached resume and cover letter in response to your recent job announcement for a (position title).”

Either option is perfectly acceptable. You make the decision based on the length and visual presentation of your cover letter. If your letter is short and succinct, we recommend you include it in the actual e-mail message. If your letter is a bit longer, has more information, and/or has certain design characteristics, you’ll want to include it as an attachment.

An example of a Word resume ready for electronic submission is shown on page 64.

# ASCII Text Files

Some recruiters and employers may insist on receiving an ASCII text version of your resume. There are certain advantages for the recipient, most notably the fact that Internet viruses and worms can’t hide in an ASCII text file. As a matter of policy, some businesses simply do not accept any e-mails with attachments. If this is the case, pasting your ASCII text resume into an e-mail message is the only way to send it electronically to those organizations.

ASCII text files are also useful when you are required to paste your resume into an online job application. By having the text version of your resume open on your computer at the same time you are viewing the online job application, you can click back and forth between the two documents to copy and paste sections of your resume into the application. This is a huge time-saver and makes an ASCII text version a valuable tool for every job seeker.

You may also rest assured that an ASCII text file will, by its very nature, be a scannable resume, and can serve double duty in that regard. We’ll further explore the value of scannable resumes later in this chapter, but be certain that if someone asks for a scannable version of your resume and they do not open attachments, an ASCII text version of your resume is the document to submit.

To ensure that you create an ASCII text resume that is readable and correctly formatted, follow these simple steps (for Microsoft Word and similar wordprocessing programs):

With your resume document open on the screen, choose “Save As” from the File menu.   
Select “text only,” “ASCII,” or “plain text” as your choice in the “Save As” option box. You may want to give the file a slightly different name to differentiate it from your word-processed version. When you click “Save,” you will get a message warning you about losing content or formatting by saving the file in ASCII format. Ignore the message and click on “Yes” or “OK” (whichever your computer displays).   
Close the file and then reopen it. You will see that your resume has been stripped of all formatting and appears as left-justified text in the Courier font.   
Now set both the left and right side margins at two inches. This will center the text on the screen and optimize its readability when the file is reopened at some later time. This will also allow you to recognize any unusual line breaks that lead to awkward changes in format, which you can easily fix.   
Carefully proofread the resume for any “glitches” that may have occurred during the file conversion. You may wish to print the resume and proofread from a “hard copy”—many people find it easier to spot errors on the printed page. You may see that many characters, such as quotation marks, dashes, or apostrophes, now appear as question marks or some other character. Simply replace these by typing in the appropriate character from your keyboard.   
Make any other adjustments you feel improve the readability of your text resume (for example, adding line returns and creating horizontal dividers to separate sections).   
Be sure to save the corrected version of your resume document.

Proofread again, preferably after some time has passed, to ensure that you haven’t missed anything.

An example of an ASCII text resume is shown on pages 65–66.

# Scannable Resumes

You could say that the scannable resume is the ultimate no-nonsense resume. All the fancy fonts, use of bold and italics, and any other graphics such as borders, underlining, or unique symbols, are stripped away to create a plain-Jane version of your resume. The goal is to make your resume able to be easily read and interpreted by scanning software that many employers and recruiters use to upload and file your resume in a database for later retrieval. To maximize the likelihood that this will happen smoothly, follow these guidelines to prepare a scannable version of your resume:

Choose an easy-to-read font such as Times New Roman or Arial.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Avoid using bold, italic, or underlined type.   
$\blacktriangleright$ Stick to type sizes of 11 pt. or larger (12 pt. is probably optimal). Make sure that only your name appears on the top line of the first page, followed by your contact information. At the top of each subsequent page, type your name on the first line, your telephone number on the second line, and your e-mail address on the third line. All of the text should be left-justified with a “ragged-right” margin. Be careful about using abbreviations. Widely used acronyms, such as B.A. for Bachelor of Arts or OSHA (Occupational Safety & Health Administration), are fine to use, but if you have any doubts about the proper interpretation, you should spell it out in full. Eliminate borders or graphics, including horizontal or vertical lines, tables, and columns. Use common keyboard symbols (such as: $^ * , \cdot , > )$ in places where you would use a bullet in your printed resume. Instead of using characters such as $\%$ or &, spell out the words (“percent” or “and”). If slashes $( / )$ are used, make sure you leave a space before and after each slash to ensure the scanner won’t see it as a letter and misinterpret the word or phrase. Use a laser printer and print your document on smooth, white paper, rather than paper with any kind of texture, color, or pattern. White photocopy paper that you can purchase at any office supply store is fine for this purpose.

Always use a paper clip; never staple the pages together.

$\blacktriangleright$ Mail the resume flat in a $9 \times 1 2$ envelope, so it won’t be folded.

Scannable resumes are becoming less and less necessary as technology continues to evolve, but they are still requested by some recruiters or employers, and should be an available tool in your job search toolbox. As previously mentioned, ASCII text resumes can also double as scannable resumes, but if you’d prefer to see your document in a typestyle other than Courier you may wish to create a separate scannable document using Times, Arial, or one of the other most common fonts available.

An example of a scannable resume is shown on pages 67–68.

# Web Resumes

One of the newest innovations in electronic resumes is the Web resume. As the popularity of the Internet continues to grow, more and more job candidates are establishing their own Websites where employers can view their resumes online. To create a Web resume, you will want to have your own URL (Website address), which you can set up on your own or with professional assistance.

Web resumes vary tremendously in their presentation. Some candidates merely have an electronic representation of their printed resume, which the employer can access to download and print; others have a fully designed Website that functions as an online professional portfolio. You can include a link to your Web resume in any correspondence you send out electronically, allowing a prospective employer or recruiter to view your resume with just one click.

Technology professionals, and others who are techno-savvy, can use their online portfolio to highlight a broad range of skills and achievements that are not practical to include on a conventional resume because of page-length restrictions. Consider including a complete listing of your technology skills and competencies, a complete listing of your technical training and certifications, and/or a complete listing of all the technology projects on which you’ve worked. E-resumes and e-portfolios are also golden opportunities for these professionals to actually demonstrate their technical prowess by designing the Website themselves.

The electronic portfolio concept can also be a compelling option for nontechnical job seekers. Perhaps you’re a marketing executive who wants to include successful marketing plans or advertising storyboards as pages on your Website. Or, maybe you’re a professional designer and want to include several pages of your designs as evidence that you are creative, innovative, and well-qualified. It’s even possible to have a video clip introducing yourself and directing the viewer to other pages on the site. The opportunities you have to develop a powerful Web presentation are limited only by your imagination.

If you’re adequately techno-savvy, creating an online portfolio can be both advantageous to your job search as well as great fun. For most of the rest of us, whose core skills do not include technology, consider hiring a professional to help you design your Website. You’ll be surprised at how affordable this can be. To get a sense of what e-resumes and e-portfolios are all about, we suggest visiting these Websites:

www.blueskyportfolios.com www.brandego.com www.portfoliovault.com

Transmitting an e-mail message that references your Web-based resume is easy to do. Instead of attaching a Microsoft Word document to an e-mail message, you simply include the link that will take the reader to the Website where your resume may be viewed, enlarged, printed, and evaluated by prospective employers and recruiters. What’s more, it’s easy to make changes to your Webbased resume if you need to update it.

# Resumes for

# Government Careers

Each and every industry and profession presents unique resume writing and design challenges. If you are interested in pursuing a career within the government, be certain to incorporate these important success factors:

# S Success Factor #1

When writing your resume for a government position, carefully read the job posting to be sure that your resume explicitly answers all the requirements listed. Make sure you comply with the requirements for contact information, which will most likely be different and more detailed than on a private-sector resume.

# S Success Factor #2

Be thorough and complete in documenting your education. In the private sector, it’s not unusual to leave out dates of graduation and other details, but on resumes for government positions, the hiring agency will want to see a comprehensive list of degrees with graduation dates, plus any special training programs. Even if you didn’t graduate, show college courses you completed.

# S Success Factor #3

Make certain that your work history is listed in reverse chronological order, with complete details for the past 10 years. This may need to include employers’ addresses and phone numbers, and the names of supervisors, if requested.

# S Success Factor #4

If Key Skill Areas (KSAs) are part of the application, make sure to respond with narratives (stories) that clearly demonstrate the skills

requested. Use the “CAR” format to describe the you faced, Challenge the you took, and the measurable that demonstrate your mastery of the skill in question.

# Keywords and Keyword Phrases

Keywords and keyword phrases are a critical component of every successful job seeker’s resume. By using just one or two words, you’re able to communicate a wealth of information about your skills, qualifications, and experience. What’s more, keywords are the basis for resume-scanning technology and are therefore critical to any job seeker’s campaign in today’s electronic-based job search market. For more information on keywords, refer back to pages 17–19 in Chapter 1.

Following are the top 20 government keywords, some of which may reflect your skills and some of which may not be appropriate for you at this time. Use these words as the foundation for developing your own list of keywords on the Professional Keyword List form in Appendix B.

# Top 20 Keywords

Briefings and Trainings Liaison Affairs   
Budget Planning and Allocation Lobbying   
Congressional Affairs Press Relations and Media Affairs   
Cross-Cultural Communications Procurement and Acquisitions   
Cultural Diversity Program Design and Management   
Foreign Government Relations Public Advocacy

Hours per week: $4 5 +$ Supervisor's name and phone number. Ms. Janice Corinth, DSN 555.4444

# What my responsibilities are:

I do extensive, highly classified forensic analysis for my primary customer: the US Army 39th Military Intelligence Group Technical Support Element. I also give them the adv anced technical guidance they need every day to support their missions, including very sensitive investigations and deployments. My work spans every aspect of software, hardware, and LAN security, including updating and installing these components. In addition, I make contributions that help US and allied law enforcement and intelligence agencies reach their goals. I must also be completely current on any new forensic technology as well as the ever changing regulations and laws that touch on my field. Nearly all my work is at or above SECRET because it helps analyze the capabilities and intentions of foreign intelligence services and terrorist organizations.

Examples of contributions I've made (described within the tight restrictions that apply to classified information):

Met a daunting challenge as soon as I arrived: we had one computer- and no standard operating procedures, no network, no methodology, no experienced staff, only a limited budget, and a rapidly growing backlog of critical projects. Did it all, from writing the required vendor requests for proposals to producing all our written procedures, to finding. recruiting, training, and retaining our staff. Outcomes: Transformed a general concept into a fully functioning, critical mission capability. Turnaround times to meet our customers' needs dropped from months to just a few weeks. Since customers no longer had to outsource this function, we saved two man-years of labor costs by the end of the first year.

Rationalized the varied and sometimes incompatible formats our customers used to document their requirements. By speaking with users, fashioned a compromise that serves them well and allows us to build in speed, efficiency, and effectiveness. Outcomes: Soon, we were translating raw data into information our customers could use almost intuitively. Our customers got much better products much faster. Thanks to my protocols, users now can do trend analysis better and faster than ever before.

Accelerated the flow of critical information and hedged against liability at the same time.   
Educated our staff and users about the benefits of a strong chain of evidence custody; then, designed, coordinated, and implemented the new system that got our work to headquarters.   
Outcomes: Users had complete confidence their hard-won evidence would hold up in court.   
My new system made it faster and safer to get evidence to those who needed it.

Relieved key planning concerns that computer forensics was "too hard to do." Once I analyzed what they needed, I persuaded the operations officer to grant me a training day. Outcomes: My briefings and demos showed what computer forensics is, how it works, and why it's valuable. As operational success rose, I used what customers found to tailor my training even more closely to their needs.

Took the initiative to draft a counterintelligence special operational concept (CisOc). That document tied priority intelligence requirements to immediate force protection measures. I made it easy to use by providing computer support. Outcomes: Even recognized experts saw the value of my work immediately.

# Resumes for

# Healthcare and Social Service Careers

Each and every industry and profession presents unique resume writing and design challenges. If you are interested in pursuing a career in the healthcare or social services fields, be certain to incorporate these important success factors:

# S Success Factor #1

Show your diverse experience by including the different types of patients/ consumers you have treated or served. Including this information demonstrates your versatility and sensitivity to individuals with varying needs.

# S Success Factor #2

Be sure to mention what procedures you can perform or equipment you can operate. Don’t assume that your job title equates to the same job duties in a new organization. By documenting your skills, you ensure that your next employer will see what you can do and how you can add value to their company.

# S Success Factor #3

List your credentials right at the top of the resume. Include either the appropriate initials after your name, or spell out your licenses or certifications and place them right after your contact information. Identifying the types of positions you’re eligible for will make it much easier for HR to direct your resume to the correct hiring authority.

# S Success Factor #4

Highlight your participation in any research projects or introduction of new procedures or techniques. Even though you may believe your role was relatively minor, your exposure to leading-edge treatments and protocols could be a point of interest for a new employer.

# Keywords and Keyword Phrases

Keywords and keyword phrases are a critical component of every successful job seeker’s resume. By using just one or two words, you’re able to communicate a wealth of information about your skills, qualifications, and experience. What’s more, keywords are the basis for resume-scanning technology and are therefore critical to any job seeker’s campaign in today’s electronic-based job search market. For more information on keywords, refer back to pages 17–19 in Chapter 1.

Following are the top 20 healthcare and social service keywords, some of which may reflect your skills and some of which may not be appropriate for you at this time. Use these words as the foundation for developing your own list of keywords on the Professional Keyword List form in Appendix B.

# Resumes for

# Hospitality and Food Service Careers

Each and every industry and profession presents unique resume writing and design challenges. If you are interested in pursuing a hospitality or food service career, be certain to incorporate these important success factors:

# S Success Factor #1

If you’re in food service, mention the types of cuisine with which you have become familiar. Was the restaurant a four-star establishment? Likewise, what kind of guests does your hotel cater to, and what types of facilities do you have (for example, spa, golf course, tennis club)?

# S Success Factor #2

Do you plan, prepare food, or set up for banquets or large-scale receptions and parties? How many people attend these events? As you well know, a banquet for 500 people is much different logistically from day-to-day dinner or lunch in a medium-sized restaurant.

# S Success Factor #3

If you have studied or worked under a famous chef or at a renowned restaurant, hotel, or resort, be sure to mention it prominently, including documenting any particular training that was involved.

# S Success Factor #4

Include any administrative functions for which you have been responsible, such as purchasing, inventory control, and managing food costs. As a hotel manager, is there a sales component to your job such as calling on corporate accounts or networking with tourism industry professionals? Don’t forget to include these important roles and the contribution they represent to your employer’s success.

# Keywords and Keyword Phrases

Keywords and keyword phrases are a critical component of every successful job seeker’s resume. By using just one or two words, you’re able to communicate a wealth of information about your skills, qualifications, and experience. What’s more, keywords are the basis for resume-scanning technology and are therefore critical to any job seeker’s campaign in today’s electronic-based job search market. For more information on keywords, refer back to pages 17–19 in Chapter 1.

Following are the top 20 hospitality and food service keywords, some of which may reflect your skills and some of which may not be appropriate for you at this time. Use these words as the foundation for developing your own list of keywords on the Professional Keyword List form in Appendix B.

# Top 20 Keywords

Back-of-the-House Operations Inventory Planning and Control Catering Services Labor Cost Controls Conference and Meeting Planning Menu Planning and Pricing Corporate Dining Room Operations Multi-Unit Operations Customer Service Management Occupancy Management Food & Beverage Operations Portion Control Front-of-the-House Operations Property Development Guest Service and Satisfaction Resort Management Hospitality Management Revenue Planning and Reporting Housekeeping Operations Special Events Planning

# WHAT I CAN OFFER TOPLINe

Proven track record in maximizing ROI...in people, software, stock levels, and policies   
Documented skill at finding and fixing inventory and logistics problems with solutions that work over the long haul.   
Practiced ability to train others in best practices.

RECENT WORK HISTORY WITH EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMS SOLVED

Independent Logistics Contractor, McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas Ju1 03 - Present   
Logistics Contractor, Airside, Inc., McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas Dec 02 - Jun 03 Helped support a full-service outpatient clinic employing 300 profe sionals who serve a population of 41,000.

More than 10 years of increasingly responsible logistics experience on active duty with the United States Air Force including these most recent assignments:

Promoted by name at the request of the Chief of Medical Logistics to serve as Medical Logistics Manager, Yigo, Guam Nov 00 - Oct 02 Served as direct reporting official for eight professionals including an assistant chief of medical logistics, an acquisitions manager, a warehouse manager, and purchasing specialists. Took on additional responsibilities as the Director of the Logistics Disaster Team. Built, defended, and managed an annual budget of $\$ 960 K$ .

Inherited an organization that had needed improvement in accountability and inventory control for two years. Others tried adding more people, but that approach failed. Soon uncovered the real problem: improper training. Outcomes: Designed, built, and delivered solid training without spending an extra dime. We went from near the bottom of more than 15 organizations right to the top-- and we stayed there.

Found a much better way to get management the logistics reports they needed to support our mission. Replaced cumbersome text format with an easy-to-use, concise PowerPoint presentation. Outcomes: The leadership liked the reports so much, my format became the corporate standard. What once took 40 hours a month to compile now done in an hour.

Asked to build one of the very first logistics plans in support of homeland defense-- after $\$ 250 K$ worth of material had already arrived. My baseline audit, done single-handedly, corrected dozens of errors in five weeks of nights and weekend work. Outcomes: By redistributing several line items, support improved quickly. Saved $\$ 10 K$ a year.

# Inventory Manager

816.989.3827 (Cell)

Did the work of 2 people to get our $\$ 1.10$ inventory back under control. Outcomes: My new policies brought these advantages: accuracy rose to 99.9 percent (nearly 5 percent above the corporate standard); inventories increased from 1 to 4 times a year; time to complete each inventory fell from 6 man weeks to 12 man hours.

Trained the staff to transition to a much more responsive inventory control- even though I had no experience or training in that system. Mastered the subject so well, I soon trained 54 customer representatives. Outcomes: Organization's average delivery time fell from 65 to 8 days.

Sought out for promotion by senior management to serve as Quality Assurance Manager, United States Embassy, Cairo, Egypt Nov 98 - Oct 00 Helped support 200 directly assigned staff and an additional 40 contractors at four sites spread over Iumdreds of miles of empty desert in four countries.

Restored accountability measures to the system used to evaluate contractors' performance. Outcomes: Miscalibration rate fell from 12 percent to 0; \$10K saved in transportation costs, availability of parts rose 25 percent-- and all this done in 60 days.

Recovered value from expired stock by finding a market for those products. Outcomes: Recovered $\$ 75 K$ in one line item category alone.

Promoted to Medical Systems Analyst and Section Training Manager, McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas Sep 94 - Nov 98

Chosen by the most senior management to lead a team that did breakthrough work on usage rates. With nothing but the broadest guidance, recruited an interdisciplinary team of 12. Outcomes: Our software test produced such flawless results that it's still in use today. Brought in this 90-day project 20 days early. Decorated for this achievement.

# Teaching and Education Careers

Each and every industry and profession presents unique resume writing and design challenges. If you are interested in pursuing a career in teaching and education, be certain to incorporate these important success factors:

# S Success Factor #1

List your credentials/certifications prominently, possibly right after your contact information. Principals and administrators want to see right away what subject areas or grade levels you are qualified to teach and/or administer.

# S Success Factor #2

Mention the classes you have taught, including grade levels and subjects. Include any information about special lesson plans or field trips related to a particular subject area to illustrate your ingenuity and creativity in bringing the subject matter alive for your students.

# S Success Factor #3

Highlight any committees you have been a member of or student activities for which you have served as an advisor (for example, Science Curriculum Committee; Olympics of the Mind Advisor).

# S Success Factor #4

Include travel or other enriching activities that provide you with added perspective in the classroom. A social studies teacher who has spent extensive time exploring Europe or Native American cultures in the Southwest can be a much more fascinating candidate than someone who hasn’t had similar experiences.

# Keywords and Keyword Phrases

Keywords and keyword phrases are a critical component of every successful job seeker’s resume. By using just one or two words, you’re able to communicate a wealth of information about your skills, qualifications, and experience. What’s more, keywords are the basis for resume-scanning technology and are therefore critical to any job seeker’s campaign in today’s electronic-based job search market. For more information on keywords, refer back to pages 17–19 in Chapter 1.

Following are the top 20 teaching and education keywords, some of which may reflect your skills and some of which may not be appropriate for you at this time. Use these words as the foundation for developing your own list of keywords on the Professional Keyword List form in Appendix B.
