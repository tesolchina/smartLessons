# The Effect of Peer and Teacher Feedback on Student Writing

TRENA M. PAULUS Indiana University

Although teacher and peer feedback, together with required revision, is a common component of the process-approach English as Second Language (ESL) writing classroom, the effect that the feedback and revision process has on the improvement of student writing is as yet undetermined. The researcher analyzed 11 ESL student essays in detail: categorizing the types and sources of revisions made according to Faigley and Witte's (1981) taxonomy of revisions, evaluating the first and final drafts of the students' essays, and recording students' verbal reports during revision. While the majority of revisions that students made were surface-level revisions, the changes they made as a result of peer and teacher feedback were more often meaning-level changes than those revisions they made on their own. It was also found that writing multiple drafts resulted in overall essay improvement.

# INTRODUCTION

Teaching writing as a process of discovery aims to raise student awareness of the recursive nature of the composing process while allowing teacher and peer collaboration and intervention during the process as they negotiate meaning (Susser, 1994; Reid, 1994). Brainstorming, journal writing, multiple drafting, fedback practices, revision, and final editing are all steps in this process during which the teacher and students can read and respond to the writing as it develops into the final product. Since the composing practices and needs of English as Second Language (ESL) writers are different from those of native English-speaking writers (Krapels, 1990; Silva, 1993), research is needed that specifically examines the impact of multiple drafting, revision, and the role of teacher and peer review feedback on both ESL student revisions and the overall quality of their writing.

Researchers in recent years have stressed the need for ESL writing instruction to move to a process approach that would teach students not only how to edit but also to develop strategies to generate ideas, compose multiple drafts, deal with feedback, and revise their written work on all levels (Chenowith, 1987; Raimes. 1985, 1987). While students can be forced to revise their work, revision in itself does not necessarily improve the quality of the writing. Faigley and Witte (1981) asserted that it is only when a revision in some way improves the text's quality can it be considered successful. They designed a taxonomy to distinguish between those revisions that affected the text's meaning (meaning-level) and those that did not (surface-level). They found that inexperienced writers made only surface-level changes to their writing, while the expert writers made changes that affected the ideas and meaning in the text. Successful revision was found to depend on the writer's ability to read a written text as communication, to compare his or her intentions and goals for the writing with the actual text produced, and, finally, to reconcile these two facets of writing by making all of the necessary adjustments (Faigley & Witte, 1984; Flower et al., 1986).

ESL writers have been found to revise mostly on the surface-level (Gaskill, 1986; Hall, 1990; Tagong, 1991). Research in this area is limited and inconclusive, however, because other studies such as Belcher (1989) have found ESL writers revising on both the meaning and surface levels (see also Lam, 1991).

# Teacher Feedback

The way that teachers structure the writing classroom and the type of feedback they give will no doubt determine how their students approach the writing process, view feedback, and make revisions to their writing (Hedgcock & Lefkowitz, 1996; Lockhardt & $\mathbf { N g }$ , 1995; Mangelsdorf & Schlumberger, 1992). Zamel (1983), Cohen (1987), and Raimes (1985, 1987) identified the lack of ESL students' writing and revision strategies, attributing the problem in part to writing instructors who focused on primarily the form of the writing without addressing the actual ideas and meaning conveyed by the text. The shift to a focus on the writing process has not, however, eliminated the difficulties of providing effective feedback. Writing instructors themselves are often uncertain of the best way to provide feedback to their students (Leki, 1990; Susser, 1994; Reid, 1994; Winer, 1992).

Research on teacher feedback has been focused primarily on its ineffectiveness in both the L1 (Hillocks, 1986; Sommers, 1982) and the L2 contexts (Semke, 1984; Zamel, 1985), blaming either the vague, "rubber-stamp" quality of the comments or the reliance on error correction as the primary feedback type (Semke, 1984; Truscott, 1996) that has resulted in negative student attitudes toward and inattention to the feedback (Robb et al., 1986; Semke, 1984). The lack of positive, encouraging comments (Cohen & Cavalcanti, 1990; Leki, 1990; Hillocks, 1982) has also been given as a reason for student inattention to the feedback, although Nelson and Carson (1998) recently found that students actually preferred negative comments that showed them where their problems were. Research has even suggested that while re-writing does facilitate writing improvement, teacher intervention may not play a significant role (Fathman & Whalley, 1990; Polio et al., 1998; Robb et al., 1986).

However, when teachers provide more specific, idea-based, meaning-level feedback in the multiple-draft context, it can be more effective in promoting student revision in both the L1 (Hillocks, 1982; Ziv, 1984) and L2 contexts (Hyland, 1990). Ferris (1997) and Kepner (1991) both found, in the L2 context, that longer, text-specific teacher comments did lead to substantial student revisions that positively affected the writing. Makino (1993) found that detailed cues, not correction, can even improve learners' abilities to self-correct grammatical errors.

As teachers have moved toward providing more specific, text-based feedback as part of the process-approach classroom, an understandable "mismatch" between the type of feedback that students expect and the type of feedback actually given has been found (Cohen, 1987; Cohen & Cavalcanti, 1990; Leki, 1991; Radecki & Swales, 1988; Saito, 1994), with students still expecting the error-correction approach from which teachers have begun to move away. However, recent studies have shown students with a more positive attitude toward teacher feedback (Enginarlar, 1993; Ferris, 1995; Hedgcock & Lefkowitz, 1996, 1994), possibly as teachers begin to more clearly justify and explain the rationale behind the process-approach classroom.

Written teacher feedback remains an important component of the ESL academic writing classroom. Identifying the type of teacher feedback that is most appropriate and effective remains a key research question (Ferris, Pezone, Tade & Tinki, 1997; Reid, 1994). Also needed are more studies examining whether feedback that teachers provide in a multiple-draft, process-approach classroom can have a positive impact on revision and writing improvement.

# Peer Review Feedback

Peer review is now commonplace as one part of the feedback and revision process of ESL writing classes. Research has begun to address the effectiveness of peer review for ESL writing instruction. The oft-cited advantages of using peer review are that it brings a genuine sense of audience into the writing classroom (Keh, 1990; Mittan, 1989), helps develop students' critical reading and analysis skills (Chaudron, 1984; Keh, 1990), and encourages students to focus on their intended meaning by discussing alternative points of view that can lead to the development of those ideas (DiPardo & Freedman, 1988; Mangelsdorf, 1992; Mendonca & Johnson, 1994). Peer feedback and teacher feedback can complement (without contradicting) each other, with students at times being more adept at responding to a student's work as truly being in progress than the teachers, who tend to judge the work as a finished product (Caulk, 1994; Devenney, 1989).

The peer review process is extremely complex, requiring careful training and structuring in order for it to be successful in both the L1 (McGroarty & Zhu, 1997) and L2 contexts (Stanley, 1992; Villamil & deGuerrero, 1996). Lockhardt and $\mathbf { N g }$ (1995) outlined various stances that readers could take during peer review, suggesting that the collaborative stance would be the most effective for shaping meaningful revision. However, Mangelsdorf & Schlumberger (1992) found that most students adopted a "prescriptive" rather than "collaborative"' stance as they responded to their peers, reinforcing the necessity for teachers to train students in successful peer review techniques and also to construct opportunities for effective peer interactions. As with teacher feedback, it is difficult but essential to find an effective way to incorporate peer review into the classroom in order for it to be successful.

Unfortunately, the very real potential for peer review to become a disastrous, unproductive experience can discourage teachers from using it in the classroom. Especially in the L2 context, students from different cultural backgrounds often have varying expectations for small-group work and for the role of the teacher. If students are defensive, uncooperative, and distrustful of each other, or primarily trying to avoid conflict, little productive work will occur in the classroom (Carson & Nelson, 1996; Nelson & Murphy, 1993). Students may not feel their peers, who are also still themselves learning the language, are qualified to critique their work and may distrust their recommendations (Allei & Connor, 1990; George, 1984; Mangelsdorf, 1992; Nelson & Murphy, 1993). For this reason, students may prefer teacher feedback to peer feedback, which is not particularly surprising (Nelson & Carson, 1998; Saito, 1994; Zhang, 1995), but this does not mean students find peer review a waste of time. Mangelsdorf (1992), in her study of the attitudes that advanced ESL students had toward peer review, determined that $69 \%$ had positive reactions to peer reviews. Mendonca and Johnson (1994) found, through interviews, that all the students in their study found peer review heIpful in regard to audience perspective and idea development.

Do students use the peer feedback in their revisions? Nelson and Murphy (1993) found that students did incorporate their peers' suggestions into subsequent drafts, but the amount of incorporation greatly depended on a cooperative environment among the group members. Mendonca and Johnson (1994) found that $53 \%$ of revisions made in students' essays were a result of peer comments being incorporated into the essays. Stanley (1992) found that when students were coached in effective peer response tactics, the number of revisions made increased.

In examining the impact of peer feedback compared to teacher feedback, Chaudron (1984) found that, while the scores on all the revised essays, which students wrote after receiving peer review feedback, were on average higher (though not significantly so), there was not a significant difference between the amount of improvement resulting from peer feedback and that resulting from teacher feedback. Hedgcock and Lefkowitz (1992) found that the final drafts of those essays receiving only peer feedback resulted in higher overall scores than those receiving only teacher feedback. The researchers established that written teacher feedback alone resulted in more changes on the grammatical level, while oral peer feedback alone resulted in more changes in content, organization, and vocabulary.

Connor and Asenavage (1994) examined the impact of peer response and teacher response on the revisions of university freshman ESL students as they wrote and revised an essay. The revised drafts were analyzed to determine which revisions were made as a result of the teacher feedback, group peer response, or another outside source. The researchers then categorized the revisions by type, using Faigley and Witte's (1981) taxonomy to determine the types of revisions influenced by the feedback sources.

Interestingly, the Connor and Asenavage (1994) study revealed that most revisions did not result from the suggestions given by either peers (influencing $5 \%$ of total revisions) or teachers (influencing $35 \%$ of revisions), but from some other source (influencing $60 \%$ of revisions). Seventy percent of the peer-influenced changes and $22 \%$ of the teacher-influenced changes were found to be meaninglevel changes based on the Faigley and Witte (1981) taxonomy, with $52 \%$ of the changes made from an outside source being meaning-level changes. The Connor and Asenavage (1994) study did not examine how many of the teacher and peer comments influenced changes, nor did they determine whether the third drafts improved in quality over the initial drafts as a result of the feedback and revision process.

# Significance of the Study

Teachers continue to wonder to what degree the process of writing, provision of feedback, and revision are actually helping students as they become independent writers, and seek empirical evidence that their own feedback or peer review feedback can contribute positively to this process. Further studies are needed in the ESL academic writing context to explore this interaction among teacher response, peer response, and the revision process and its impact on writing improvement. If research can determine the effectiveness of feedback in the context of a multiple-draft classroom, it can influence the way that teachers incorporate such practices into their classes.

This classroom-based study, like the Connor and Asenavage (1994) study, analyzed the revisions made by students to their essays according to the type and source of each individual change. It then went one step further, by evaluating the first and third drafts of the essays to determine whether the revision process resulted in higher quality writing.

# Research Questions

Two specific research questions are addressed in this study:

1. How do peer and teacher feedback affect student revisions in a multipledraft, process-approach writing classroom?

2. Does required revision through multiple drafts of an essay improve the overall quality of written work in a classroom situation?

# METHOD

# Participants

The study was conducted with 11 undergraduate international students enrolled in a pre-freshman composition writing course at a public university.I Eight of the 11 students had taken English classes in the university's intensive English program (IEP) prior to enrolling in this course. The three remaining students tested into the course based on a holistically-graded essay exam administered by the IEP along with the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).

Table 1 summarizes the ages, language background, lengths of residence, and year at university of the seven males and four females who participated in the study. Two of the students had taken writing courses at other American universities, six reported having had previous experience with the peer review process, and all but one student had been exposed to the multiple-draft process approach to writing in a previous course.

# Setting

The participants in this study were students enrolled in a course entitled "Fundamental Usage Skills" for international students. This course is designed for those students who need further development of their academic writing skills before enrolling in the freshman composition course required for graduation from the university. The researcher was also the teacher of this course. This course met 4 times a week for 10 weeks, with each class session lasting 50 minutes. The objectives of the course, as outlined by the curriculum documents, are to build student confidence in academic writing abilities, develop vocabulary, generate ideas, encourage communication through ongoing writing, encourage self-correction of communication errors, encourage re-writing, and remediate grammatical errors.

Note: Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

These objectives are reached by the following recommended activities: critical reading and discussion, summary writing, journal writing, in-class writing, revision, and development of the traditional five-paragraph academic essay. While the course focuses on the ability to develop ideas and communicate meaning through writing (meaning level or global concerns), a portion of the course also emphasizes the ability to self-edit writing for syntactical and mechanical errors (surface level or local concerns).

Typically, this 10-week course begins with paragraph-level work and ends with the production of the "traditional' five-paragraph essay. In terms of overall essay quality, the goal of the course is for students to be able to produce an essay that would rate between a 6 and a 7 on the Essay Scoring Rubric that was used to evaluate the essays in this study.

The revision processes of these students were analyzed by carefully studying three drafts of a persuasive essay written during the seventh and eighth weeks of the 10-week quarter. This essay was the third one written by the students for this course. This persuasive writing assignment began when, during the sixth week of the quarter, students participated in reading, discussion, and pre-writing activities in preparation for writing a persuasive essay. This particular assignment involved developing an essay on a topic of their choice with the purpose of persuading their chosen audience to agree with their point of view. The class followed a portfolio assessment approach, allowing and encouraging, but not requiring, students to revise and submit as many drafts as they liked before their writing assignment was graded as a final draft. Only the first three drafts of the essays, however, were analyzed for this study.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether actual classroom practices with feedback and revision are effective. Thus, feedback was given, drafts were written, and the data were collected in the order of the usual classroom situation. Students received written and oral feedback from their classmates on the first drafts of the essays, after which they revised and wrote a second draft. They then received written teacher feedback on this second draft. Finally, they revised again and wrote a third draft.

# Peer Review Session

After writing their first drafts, students participated in a guided peer review session to give each other feedback on their writing that could be used to revise their work. The teacher/researcher assigned students to work together in pairs because, as Mittan (1989) has suggested, pairs of students have greater opportunities for intensive discussion about their writing. Students who had worked well together in the past, who were at similar levels of oral and writing proficiency, and who had different first languages were paired when possible. Only one peer review pair had the same first language (Japanese). The resulting pairs were: Abdul and Toshi, Adam and Kazuko, Ahmad and Ichiro, Daijiro and Kozue, Hafizah and Kiyoko, Nobu and Wong.

This was not the students' first experience with peer review. They had participated in peer review sessions twice before during the course, each time with different partners. Appropriate language and techniques for providing feedback on each other's work had been modeled and discussed at the beginning of the quarter and were reviewed before each peer review session that was held. The purpose and potential benefits of receiving feedback from other students in the class were discussed, as was the importance of focusing on the ideas and organization of the essay.

During a peer review session earlier in the quarter, the students' discussions were audiotaped, enabling the teacher/researcher to give extensive written feedback to students regarding the effectiveness of their interactions. All the students in the class took the peer review sessions seriously and were able to stay on task and to interact in mutually acceptable ways.

As suggested by Mittan (1989), the peer review procedure for this third essay involved students exchanging essays during one class session and being given until the next class session to carefully read the essay and provide written feedback in accordance with a feedback form (see Appendix) that was explained and discussed in class. This form allowed students to begin by writing positive comments about the essays, followed by identifying the position statement and analyzing the supporting arguments. Then students were asked to indicate which areas of the essay they found confusing or felt could use further development. Finally, students had an opportunity to make specific suggestions for improvement.

The peer review session was held during the next class. Students were recorded as they discussed their reactions to the essays. Usually their discussion followed the provided feedback form, which focused on the development of ideas and the organization of the essay. Following the peer review session, students were asked to write a second draft of their essays and to turn in the peer review forms with the second draft. The second drafts of the students' essays were collected three days after the peer review session.

# Teacher Feedback

The teacher/researcher wrote some comments directly on the second drafts, in addition to typing out longer comments and questions about the essay. The teacher feedback addressed both the content and the form of the writing. The teacher provided each student with the amount and type of feedback deemed appropriate and necessary for his or her development as a writer. The students were then asked to write a third draft based on the teacher's feedback. The third drafts of the essays were collected four days later.

# Think-aloud Protocols

All of the students tape-recorded two think-aloud protocols (TAPs): the first as they revised their essays based on the peer review discussion and the second as they revised based on the teacher feedback. While fears that the use of such verbal reports as a research tool is too intrusive and may subsequently yield inaccurate data (see Cohen, 1994, for a discussion of these limitations), especially when being reported in a second language, they remain the only method of identifying the use of learning strategies at, or near, the moment they are being used, thus allowing access to information that would otherwise remain hidden. The purpose of the TAPs in the current study was to encourage students to talk through their ideas as they revised, identifying aloud the sources of and reasons for the revisions made. One way to substantiate the findings of TAP data is to carefully model the procedure for the students and then combine the results with other selfreport data such as questionnaires and interviews. In this study, the TAPs were used in addition to a careful examination of the feedback given and revised written drafts to help with identification of the source of the revisions made.2

The procedure for the TAP was modeled for the students during the fifth week of the quarter by the teacher/researcher, who demonstrated the procedure by thinking aloud to herself as she revised an essay on which comments had been written. This demonstration was followed by playing a TAP of a former student as she was revising an essay. Finally, students were given back their own marked essays (not the essays used for the current study) and asked to work in pairs as they. practiced thinking aloud while they read the teacher's comments and thought about what they would revise.

# DATA ANALYSIS

# Taxonomy of Revisions

Using Faigley and Witte's (1981) taxonomy of revisions, each revision made to the first and second drafts of the essay was categorized as either a surface change (formal change or meaning-preserving change) or meaning change (microstructure change or macrostructure change) (see Table 2). The unit of analysis was either graphical, lexical, phrasal, clausal, sentential, or multi-sentential (Bridwell, 1980; Faigley & Witte, 1984).

I. Surface Changes (Do not affect the meaning. No new information is brought to the text.)

A. Formal changes (editing) (1) Spelling/capitalization (2) Tense/number/modality (3) Abbreviations/contractions (4) Punctuation (5) Formatting (6) Morphological changes

B. Meaning-preserving changes (Paraphrase the original concepts in the text by making them implicit or explicit, without altering the meaning. No new information is brought to the text. Primarily syntactical or lexical changes. All information is recoverable by inferencing.)

(11) Additions (information was previously inferred but is now explicit)   
(12) Deletions (information was previously explicit but now must be inferred   
(13) Substitutions (elements are traded)   
(14) Permutations (elements are rearranged)   
(15) Distributions (a single unit becomes more than one unit)   
(16) Consolidations (multiple units are combined into one unit)

I. Meaning Changes (Affect the concepts and meaning by bringing new information to the text.)

A. Microstructure Changes (Simple adjustments or elaborations of existing text. Do not affect the overall summary, gist, or direction of the ideas in the text. Do not affect the overall! interpretation of the text. May involve the use of cohesive ties, causing sentence sequences to be understood as consistent and parallel connected discourse.) (21) Additions (22) Deletions (23) Substitutions (24) Permutations (25) Distributions (26) Consolidations   
B. Macrostructure Changes (Alter the text's overall direction and gist. Will affect the way a text would be summarized. If the concepts involved in a particular change affect the way other parts of the text are read, it is a macrostructure change. May affect the text's overall global meaning and coherence, influencing the summary and interpretation of the text. Coherence factors may include the focus of the text, relevance to the topic, consideration of audience, overall purpose, and pragmatic unity.) (31) Additions (32) Deletions (33) Substitutions (34) Permutations (35) Distributions (36) Consolidations

At the heart of the taxonomy is the distinction between those changes that affect the meaning of a text (meaning changes) and those that do not (surface changes). Faigley and Witte (1981) base this distinction on "whether new information is brought to the text or whether old information is removed in such a way that it cannot be recovered through drawing inferences" (p. 402). Surface (or local) changes made to a text are those that do not bring new or delete old information from the text, but only alter the surface structure. Meaning (or global) changes are those that do affect the information present in the text, by either adding, deleting, or rearranging the ideas.

Surface changes are divided into two categories: formal changes, which are copyediting or proofreading changes in areas such as spelling, tense, and punctuation, and meaning-preserving changes, which paraphrase existing concepts in a text but do not alter the essential meaning from one version to the next. Meaningpreserving changes are always recoverable by inferring the information. Both types of surface changes affect the text on a local level.

Meaning changes are also divided into two types, both of which affect the text on a global level. Microstructure changes are those that do alter the information structure but do not affect the overall gist (essence) or direction of the text. These are minor changes that elaborate existing ideas or give additional supporting information. Macrostructure changes, the second type of meaning changes, are major changes that affect the overall meaning of the text to the extent that they would affect the way one would summarize the given information. Such changes made to one section of a text would affect the way a reader would read another section of the text. These macrostructure changes are the most in-depth changes that could be made to a text.

In order to establish reliability in categorizing these types of changes, the teacher/ researcher, after first marking on the revised drafts where changes had been made, asked an independent rater to analyze $14 \%$ of the data according to the taxonomy. The researcher also analyzed the data sample. The two raters reached $9 5 \%$ agreement, after which the researcher analyzed the remaining data herself.

# Source of Revisions

The source of each revision made to the first and second drafts of the essays was determined by comparing the revisions made with the peer and teacher feedback given to the student. Each revision was coded as either resulting from the peer review session (peer), the teacher feedback (teacher), or some other source such as the writer's own ideas (self/other).

A revision was considered to be the result of the peer review session if the change was traceable to either the comments on the peer review form, the comments written on the essay by the peer reviewer, or the discussion during the peer review session as manifested in the peer review transcript. If, during the TAP, the student specifically attributed a change to the peer review, it was also coded as peer.

The source of a revision was determined to be the teacher if the change could be traced back to the written feedback given by the teacher, either in the typed comments or in the comments written directly on the essay, or if the student attributed the change to the teacher during the TAP.

If the revisions were not traceable to either the peer or teacher feedback (as described in the preceding paragraphs), they were coded as self/other.

This research design did not allow statistical analysis to identify possibly significant relationships between the type and source of revisions made. This is because the two types of feedback were given at different stages in the revision process in order to reflect what often happens in a classroom setting. This unfortunately confounds the source and the time of the feedback, precluding any statistical determination of which feedback source influenced which types of revisions.

# Essay Scoring Rubric3

The first and third drafts of the essays were scored by independent raters using the Essay Scoring Rubric to determine whether the overall quality of the essays improved as a result of the feedback and revision process. The rubric requires assigning a score from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) for each of six features of the writing: organization/unity, development, cohesion/coherence, structure, vocabulary, and mechanics. The scores received on the six categories were then averaged to calculate the overall score of the essay.

To assure reliability in the rating, five experienced composition instructors participated in a calibration or "norming" session using the Essay Scoring Rubric. Immediately following the calibration session, anonymous copies of the first and third drafts were distributed to the raters in such a way as to ensure that no rater would read both the first and third draft of the same student's essay. Drafts were also distributed to ensure that each rater read some of the first drafts and some of the third drafts being analyzed for the study.4

Each draft was read by two different raters and the average of the two scores was used as the final score. If the two scores varied by less than two points, this average score was accepted as the draft's overall score. If the scores varied by more than two points, the draft was given to a third rater who had not yet read either draft written by that student. The third score was then averaged with whichever of the first two scores was the closest to it.

The difference between the score received on the first and third draft of the student's essay was determined to be the amount of improvement made on the essay. To determine if there was significant improvement made from the first to the third draft of the essay, a repeated measures t-test was performed.

In order to determine whether there was a significant correlation between the amount of improvement and the number and/or types of changes made to the essays written by the 11 subjects, a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated between: (a) the amount of improvement and the total number of changes made to the essays; (b) the amount of improvement and the percentage of meaning changes made to the essays; (c) the amount of improvement and the percentage of macrostructure changes made to the essays; and (d) the amount of improvement and the percentage of surface changes made to the essays.

# RESULTS

# Types of Revisions

The 11 students made a total of 843 revisions to their essays (see Table 3). Of these revisions, 527 $6 2 . 5 \%$ of total revisions) were considered surface changes. Formal changes accounted for 185 $( 2 1 . 9 \% )$ of these surface changes and 342 $( 4 0 . 6 \% )$ were categorized as meaning-preserving changes. The remaining 316 changes $( 3 7 . 5 \% )$ were meaning changes, categorized as either microstructure changes, which accounted for 183 of these changes $( 2 1 . 7 \% )$ , or macrostructure changes, which accounted for 133 of these revisions $( 1 5 . 8 \% )$

Of the total number of revisions made to the essays, 347 $( 4 1 . 2 \% )$ were made to the first drafts of the essays, and 496 $( 5 8 . 8 \% )$ were made to the second drafts. The greatest percentage of changes made to both the first and second drafts were categorized as meaning-preserving changes, accounting for $40 . 3 \%$ of first draft revisions and $4 0 . 7 \%$ of second draft revisions (see Tables 4 and 5). Only $1 5 . 3 \%$ of first draft changes and $1 6 . 1 \%$ of second draft changes were determined to be macrostructure changes.

# Source of Revisions

A total of $6 5 . 4 \%$ of the revisions made to the first drafts of the essays resulted not from peer or teacher feedback but from some other (self/other) source (see Table 6), $8 2 . 4 \%$ of which were surface changes. Peer feedback resulted in $3 2 . 3 \%$ of the first draft revisions, and $6 3 . 3 \%$ of these peer-influenced changes were meaning changes. (Teacher feedback resulted in $2 . 3 \%$ of the revisions to the first draft. Abdul was the only student to receive teacher feedback on the first draft of his essay. Unfortunately, as the teacher/researcher was monitoring the peer review session, she noticed some elements of Abdul's essay had been plagiarized. Due to the serious nature of this action, it was necessary to ask him to be sure to cite his sources in the next draft. This resulted in eight changes being made to Abdul's essay.)

On the second drafts, $56 . 7 \%$ of the changes made were a result of teacher feedback (see Table 7), and $5 9 . 4 \%$ of these were meaning changes. Self/other sources resulted in $4 2 . 3 \%$ of the changes, $8 3 . 3 \%$ of which were surface changes. Only $1 \%$ of the changes made to the second drafts resulted from students' actually going back to comments made during the peer review session to influence their third drafts.

Of the 843 revisions made to both drafts of the essays, peer feedback influenced 117 $( 1 3 . 9 \% )$ of these changes (see Table 8). Teacher feedback influenced 289 revisions $( 3 4 . 3 \% )$ . Four hundred and thirty-seven changes $( 5 1 . 8 \% )$ were attributed to some other source besides peer and teacher feedback (self/other).

A total of 113 peer comments were given to the 11 students, with all but five of the changes that were made as a result of these comments occurring in the first draft revisions. Of the 113 peer comments received by the student writers, 58 $( 5 1 \% )$ resulted in revisions being made to the subsequent drafts. Of the 199 teacher comments, 174 resulted in revisions, meaning that $8 7 \%$ of the teacher comments influenced a change. It was often the case that one peer or teacher comment would cause more than one revision to be made to the essay.

Note: A maximum of ten points were possible. A third rater was required if the first two scores varied by more than two points. The third score was then averaged with whichever of the first two scores was closest to it.

# Essay Scoring Rubric Evaluation

The first and third drafts of the essays were each scored by two of the five independent raters using the Essay Scoring Rubric. Two essays (both third drafts) required a third rater, as the first two rater scores varied by more than two points (see Table 9).

The mean score of the essays increased by .75 from the first to the third draft. The repeated-measures $t$ -test was found to be $- 2 . 6 9$ , significant at $p = . 0 2 3$ $( d f = 1 0 )$ , indicating a statistically significant improvement in the essay scores from the first to the third drafts.

No significant Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was found between the amount of improvement and the total number of revisions made to the essays. However, a weak positive correlation was found between these two factors $( r = . 3 7 0 9 )$ . A moderate positive correlation, also not significant, was found between the amount of improvement and the percentage of macrostructure changes made to the essays $( r = . 5 8 0 8$ ). No significant Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was found between either the amount of improvement and the percentage of meaning changes made to the essays $( r = - . 0 1 9 6 )$ or between the amount of improvement and the percentage of surface changes made to the essays $( r = . 0 1 9 6 )$

# DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The most common type of revision students made to their essays were meaningpreserving changes that paraphrased and essentially re-worded concepts present in the text. This finding is consistent with Tagong (1991), who studied the expressive and argumentative essays of Thai writers of English and found most changes to be meaning-preserving changes as defined by the Faigley and Witte taxonomy (1981). Hall (1990) also categorized $51 \%$ of his L2 writers' revisions as equivalent to these meaning-preserving changes. Surface-level changes, including both formal and meaning-preserving changes, accounted for $63 \%$ of the revisions made in the present study. Gaskill (1986) also found most revisions that his Spanish writers of English made in their argumentative essays to be primarily surface changes.

Despite the high percentages of surface changes, students in the current study were able to make some global-level changes to their work. While the current study did not find students made more meaning than surface changes, as Belcher (1989) found with her Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Spanish ESL writers, the findings support Lam's (1991) claims that her ESL students were able to revise on both the surface and meaning levels.

The results also indicate that students did use both the peer and teacher feedback to influence their revisions. While Connor and Asenavage (1994) were discouraged to find that only $5 \%$ of total revisions made resulted from peer comments, the present study found nearly three times that number, with $14 \%$ of total revisions made as a result of the peer review feedback. While a majority of revisions $( 5 2 \% )$ resulted from neither the peer nor the teacher feedback but from some outside source, the revisions made as a result of the peer and teacher feedback were more often meaning-level revisions than those made as a result of the outside source.

Even more encouraging and relevant, however, is that $32 \%$ of the changes made to the second draft of the essay, written immediately after receiving only peer feedback, were a result of peer feedback. Notable as well is the fact that a majority $( 6 3 \% )$ of these second draft peer-influenced revisions were meaning changes, showing that not only do students take their classmates' advice seriously, but they also use it to make meaning-level changes to their writing. The results of this study should reassure those who were discouraged by Nelson and Carson's (1998) claims that students do not find their classmates' advice particularly useful.

Teacher comments were approximately as influential as those in the Connor and Asenavage (1994) study $( 3 5 \% )$ , accounting for $34 \%$ of the total revisions in the present study. More relevant again is that $5 7 \%$ of the revisions made to the second drafts were a result of the teacher feedback, and $59 \%$ of these were meaning changes. This is quite different from the findings of Connor and Asenavage, where $78 \%$ of the teacher-influenced revisions were surface changes. The type of teacher comments provided undoubtedly influenced the types of revisions students made. While the results of this study would indicate that teacher feedback can result in meaning-level changes being made to the students' work, more research is needed along the lines of Ferris's (1997) study comparing the type of feedback given with the types of revisions made.

Another interesting aspect of the present study, which was not addressed by Connor and Asenavage (1994), was the comparison of the number of peer and teacher comments given and the number that influenced at least one change. Fifty-one percent of peer comments given to students resulted in changes being made, whereas $87 \%$ of teacher comments influenced at least one revision. These numbers more clearly show that students are indeed using the feedback given, especially by the teacher, to make changes to their work.

While the weak, positive correlation that was found between those essays that improved the most and those that had the most revisions made to them was not a significant relationship, it would seem that there could be at least a trend toward essay improvement as a result of revising. To support Faigley and Witte's (1981) view that expert writers are those who make more macrostructure changes to initial drafts, there may also be a trend in the moderate positive correlation $( r =$ .5808) found between the percentage of macrostructure changes made to the essays and the amount of overall improvement. These meaning-level changes may be more likely to be the ones that improved the essays most drastically.

An issue that deserves attention is that of the individual variations in the types of revisions made and in their use of peer and teacher feedback. On first drafts of their essays, for example, Daijiro and Ahmad each made only four changes, while Kazuko made 63 and Hafizah made 57. On the second drafts, Kozue made the fewest changes, 20, and Nobu made the most, with 84 revisions. This variation clearly shows that students use the drafts of their essays differently, some choosing to revise much more than others.

Students vary quite significantly in their use of the feedback. While both teacher and peer feedback was used, teacher feedback was clearly prioritized more. The range of revisions made based on peer feedback is illustrated by Hafizah's $9 \%$ to Kazuko's $25 \%$ of total revisions. Compare this with the higher percentage of revisions made based on teacher feedback: $3 5 \%$ of Nobu's revisions to $60 \%$ of Kozue's changes. Students varied as well in how many of the comments they attended to when making the changes. Ahmad used only $22 \%$ of his classmate's comments, but Kozue used $86 \%$ of the peer comments she received. Teacher feedback was clearly used more often than peer feedback: Daijiro, who was influenced the least, still paid attention to the vast majority $( 7 1 \% )$ of the teacher's comments in his revisions. Kazuko actually used $100 \%$ of the teacher's comments to revise her essay.

Individual results did not always reflect the expected (and hoped-for) relationship between revision and essay improvement. Kiyoko, who made the greatest improvement on her essay, also made the second highest percentage of meaning changes $(4 7 \% )$ and the highest percentage of macrostructure changes to her essay $( 2 6 \% )$ . Her results could lead us to believe that meaning-level revision results in writing improvement. This hope is soon dashed, however, by the fact that the two students whose overall essay scores decreased, Daijiro and Wong, also made quite a few revisions based on teacher feedback: Daijiro with $57 \%$ and Wong with $45 \%$ of revisions coming from the teacher feedback. Daijiro was even the student who made the greatest percentage of meaning changes to his essay $(4 8 \% )$ ---so obviously revision in and of itself is not necessarily beneficial, as Faigley and Witte (1981) have cautioned. The student who made the greatest number of revisions to her essay, Hafizah, fell in the middle of the class in terms of how much her essay improved over the course of writing multiple drafts. However, since $48 \%$ of her changes were formal (copyediting) surface changes, this may not be surprising. Ahmad, who made the lowest percentage of macrostructure changes, made the third greatest improvement in the class, improving his essay score by 1.25 points.

Obviously, students need to develop individualized strategies for incorporating feedback in an effective and positive way before their writing will improve. A closer analysis of individual student revision practices is needed before any explanation can be given for the variation in revision strategies found in this study. In fact, the TAPs and a revision strategy questionnaire were used to examine this issue in more depth. However, the analysis of this data, due to its complexities, is outside the scope of the findings presented here.

In answering the research questions, then, it can be stated that: (1) both peer and teacher feedback contributed to the revision process, with teacher feedback influencing more changes and being prioritized more by students and (2) required revision did significantly improve the essay scores of the class.

# CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR SECOND-LANGUAGE WRITING INSTRUCTION

The results of this study should reassure writing instructors that their written feedback can be used by students to make meaning-level revisions to their work. In addition, writing instructors can integrate peer feedback into the writing classroom with confidence that this feedback can be effective and can be used by many students in their revisions.

The fact that the multiple-draft process did result in better essays should encourage teachers to make revision and re-writing, combined with meaningful peer and teacher feedback, an integral part of the writing classroom. These results also show the importance of analyzing not only what kinds of changes students are making to their work, but what effect these changes might have on the overall improvement of their essays.

# LIMITATIONS TO THE STUDY

The classroom-based study provides a detailed analysis of the revision practices of one class of students as they revised in the context of a multiple-draft, processapproach classroom. Only 11 university-level ESL students were analyzed for this study, which limits the generalizability of the results. Also limiting generalizability is the order and the type of the feedback given. Feedback and peer review training and techniques undoubtedly vary from teacher to teacher and from student to student.

The fact that the researcher was also the teacher of the class may have affected the objectivity of the study to some extent. The teacher/researcher conducted class and provided feedback in her usual manner, yet the knowledge that a research study was in progress may have influenced her teaching in some way. The students were also aware that a research study was in progress but did not have any information about the focus of the study. Regardless, it is possible that they may have behaved differently than they normally would have had they not been participating in the study.

The lack of a means to statistically establish inter-rater reliability with the Essay Scoring Rubric may be considered a limitation. However, every attempt was made through the calibration session, the random distribution of the essays, and the third rater procedure to ensure that the scores reached were reliable ones. Future studies could also be designed, as the current study was not, to allow identification of a possible relationship between the type and the source of the revision made.

Despite these limitations, the combination of data collection and analysis procedures used in this study provides some insight into one example of a typical ESL classroom feedback and revision process that can add to the current understanding of how feedback influences student revision and its effect on writing improvement.

# NOTES

1. Data were initially collected from all 12 students enrolled in the course, but one student (Toshi) was dropped from the study because he did not provide sufficient data. This student's peer review feedback form and transcript were, however, maintained for use in the study to enable an analysis of his peer review partner's essay.

2. The TAPs, in combination with a revision strategy questionnaire, were also used to identify revision strategies used by individual students. The results of the analysis of these strategies are, however, beyond the scope of this article.

3. The Essay Scoring Rubric is an adaptation of descriptors developed as part of an internal study of the composition section of the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB) (Hamp-Lyons, 1991). MELAB compositions are scored holistically (Briggs & Dobson, 1994); however, in order to better understand that holistic system, a study was conducted that involved creating a set of analytic descriptors. These analytic descriptors were adapted by the researcher for use in this study in order to reflect what was taught in the course and the goals of this particular persuasive essay. Copies of the Essay Scoring Rubric can be obtained by contacting the author.

4. Due to this random distribution of both drafts of all the essays among the five raters, there was no way to calculate inter-rater reliability using, for example, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.
