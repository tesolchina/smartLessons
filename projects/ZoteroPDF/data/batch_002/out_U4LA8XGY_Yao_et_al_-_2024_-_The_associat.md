Keywords: Growth mindsets The ideal L2 writing self L2 writing enjoyment Gender differences

Recently, researchers are paying increasing attention to the influence of second language (L2) writers' personal beliefs on writing learning experiences and outcomes. Drawing on the Positive Psychology approach and from a gender difference perspective, this study investigates the relationships among two important motivational factors (i.e., growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing self) and L2 writing enjoyment, as well as the impacts of these three positive mentalities on English writing performance with 679 12th grade high school students in mainland China. Independent sample t-tests results indicated that female students had significantly better English writing performance and higher levels of the three mentalities, although the effect sizes of the differences were small. Our multi-group structural equation model reported positive associations among the three mentalities for both male and female students. Growth mindsets were more influential for male students, whereas the ideal L2 writing self more influential for female students. In terms of the influence of the three mentalities on English writing performance, only the ideal L2 writing self was a significant predictor for female students. Pedagogical suggestions are provided based on the findings.

# 1. Introduction

Second language (L2) writing is a cognitively high-demanding task that comprehensively tests students' diffrent linguistc abil. ities. L2 writers ften encounter various dificulties and challenges in the learning proces, consequently leading to anxious feelings and negative mentalities. This holds particular merit for East Asian students hailing from a culture that prioritizes examination-based assesment. Sice the seond decade of the 21s entury,  eduction rearchers have pad incresin atntion to the fed of Positive Psychology which focuses on how people thrive and flourish" and aims for \*the development of tols to build positive emotions, foster greater engagement, and boost the appreciation of meaning in life and its activities" (Dewaele et al., 2018, p. 676). In positive psychology, enjoyment is viewed as a positive emotion experienced during satisfying, interesting, or fun activities (Dewaele & McIntyre, 2014; Li & Wei, 2022). It i one of the key factors in promoting motivation, engagement, and perstence in activities, contributing to personal growth and achievement. Specifically, in the context of L2 learning, Dewaele and McIntyre (2014) maintained that enjoyment is "a complex motio captring interacting dimensions of challenge and pereived abilit that reflects human drive for success inthe face of difficult tass" (p. 216). For L2 writers, enjoyment is akind f positive emotion and an important motivator when facing the ups and downs in the learning process. Recently, researchers have documented the critical role of enjoyment in sustaining L2 writing learning and bringing about desirable writing performance (Cheong et a., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2022). Therefore, it is necessary to explore possible means to promote L2 writers' enjoyment in the learning process. Two positive psychological factors, growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing elf, may contribute to the enjoyment of L2 writing.

The language mindsets framework receives increasing research attention in L2 education recently (Lou & Noels, 2017, 2019a, 2019b, 2020a). Simply put, L2 learners may believe that their L2 abilites can be improved through appropriate strategies and sufficient effot (growth mindsets), or they may regard 2 competence as an innate trait that canot be developed (fixed mindsets) (Lou & Noels, 2019a). Compared to fixed mindset, growth mindsets are a more positive mentality in L2 learning. Recent empirical studies confirm that growth mindsets can lead to enjoyment in general English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) education in Iran (Teimouri et al., 2022; Zarrnabadi t al., 2022). However, the asociation between growth mindsets and enjoyment in L2 writing education should be verifie, as Lou and Noels (2019b) proposed the "domain-specificity of language learning" and maintained that the motivational power of growth mindsets in general L2 learning should be generalized into the specific areas (e.g., writing) with caution (p. 550)

Meanwhile, the ideal L2 self, which refers to L2 learners possible future selves as successful L2 users, is the most important motivator in the L2 motivational self system (L2Mss) (Dornyei, 2005, 2009). Researchers have constantly afirmed that the ideal L2 self is reated to enjoyment in general L2 education (e.g., Pan & Zhang, 2021; Papi & Khajavy, 2021). In L2 writing education, the ideal L2 writing self i also asociated with enjoyment in tertiary education in Iran and China (Guan et al, 2023; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021; Zhao et al, 2023; hu et al., 2022). Nevertheless extremely limited reearch has investigated secondary school L2 writers ideal L2 writing selves and enjoyment. Ryan (2009) once observed differences between tertiary and secondary students ideal L2 selves in general L2 education. Therefore, more research is warranted to further investigate the relationship between the ideal L2 writing self and L2 writing enjoyment with participants from diverse educational levels.

Another noteworthy issue is the gender difference in L2 writing education. Female students always outperform male students in different aspects of 2 writing learning, such as les errors in lexicon (Saeed et al., 2011) and higher fluency and bettertext quality (Al-Saadi, 2020; Troia et al., 2013). esides, motivational factor (e., the L2 writing ef have also been found to account for the gap between male and female writers (Cheong et al. 2022). Existing literature indicates that gender may influence growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self in geneal L2 edcation (You et al., 2016; arrinabadi et al., 2021). It is expected that this ender difference may also exist in L2 writing education and can lead to diverse learning experiences and outcomes between male and female students.

Following the Positive Psychology approach, this study examines the associations among growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing elf, and L2 writing enjoyment, as wellas their impacts on English writing performance in the context of secondary education in mainland China. Specifically, the role of gender is analyzed. Thstudy connects the two popular motivational fcors i.., growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self in L2 writing education. Pedagogical sugestions are provided to foster L2 writing enjoyment among Chinese high school students that are facing the enormous pressure caused by the various examinations.

# 2. Literature review

In this section, we first discss the associations among the primary variables in this study, and propose that growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self are theoretcall connected in L2 writing education research. We then ilustrate the necessity of examining gender difference of L2 writers. Based on the findings in existing literature, we put forward the research questions and the theoretical model of this study.

2.1. The relationships of growth mindsets, the ideal writing L2 self, L2 enjoyment, and L2 writing performance

Within the framework of mindsets (Dweck, 1999, 2006), Mercer and Ryan (2010) started analyzing L2 learners' language mindsets. Following this line of inquiry, Lou and Noels developed a valid scale for measuring L2 learners' language mindsets (2017) and proposed the language mindses meaning system" (2019), thus drawing substantial research attention to this emerging are and guiding a series of empirical studies around the globe (e.g., Bai & Wang, 2023; Xu & Wang, 2022; Yao et al., 2021a; Yao et al., 2021b; Yao & Zhu, 2022). Since the beginning of the research on language mindsets, a considerable amount of attention has ben devoted to L2 writing. To name a few, researchers have observed that gowth mindsets can lead to higher learning motivation (Waller & Papi, 2017; Yao et al., 2021a, 2021c), positive perceptions toward feedback (Wallr & Papi, 2017; Ya et al., 2021a; Yao et al., 2021c), and more self-regulated strategies in L2 writing learning (Bai & Wang, 2023; Xu & Wang, 2022). These studies have broadened our perspectives on L2 writers emotional and behavioral responses in the leaning proces, and confirmed that growth mindset are a positive mentality which can promote favorable learning experiences and bring about desirable writing performance.

Growth mindsets and positive emotions are theoretically corrlated in L2 learning (Lou & Noels, 2019a, 2019b). Students with growth mindsets exhibit positive atitudes throughout the larning proces, perceiving challenges as opportunities fr growth and viewing setbacks as valuable learning experiences. This wl guide learners to dedicate themselves to working hard, thereby producing a significant inluence on learning outcomes. Consequently, these students are predisposed to derive greater enjoyment from their learning experiences. The learning processes and outcomes align with the principles of positive psychology that emphasize personal growth and self-improvement. Recent empirical studies have confirmed the correlation between growth mindsets and L2 enjoyment in general L2 education (Teimouri et al., 2022; Zarrinabadi et a., 2022). For instance, with a sample of 21 Iranian intermediate EFL learners, Zarrinabadi et al. (2022) observed that growth mindsets can contribute to several positive emotions, such as enjoyment. In addition, growth mindsets have long been observed to correlate with academic achievement (Yeager & Dweck, 2012), although Sisk et al. (2018) found in a recent meta-analysis that this correlation is weak $( r = 0 . 1 2 )$ . While these studies are not in the field of L2 writing education, they have established foundations for the present research. It is possible that students' growth mindsets toward writing ability are also related to L2 writing enjoyment and performance. Empirical research is warranted to extend theasociations between growth mindsets and enjoyment and academic performance to L2 writing learning.

In addition, despite the extensive research on the ideal L2 self in general L2 education, it is only in recent years that researchers began to investigate its motivational mechanisms in L2 writing lerning (Cheong et al., 2022; Guan et al., 2023; Tahmouresi & Papi 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2022). The ideal L2 self represents the leaners'vision of their potential in language learning. As posited by Higgins (1987), the discrepancy between an individual's actual self and their deal self can engender dejection-related emotions. Conversely, progression towards the attainment of the ideal self can evoke elation-related emotion (e.g, enjoyment). Akin to the findings in general L2 education (e.g., Papi & Khajay, 2021; Pan & Zhang, 2021; Yung & Chiu, 2020), L2 writers, who have positive future images as successful L2 users, tend to have more joyful lening exprience i L2 writing lening. For instance, with a sample of 85 EFL writers at an Iranian university, Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) found that the ideal L2 writing self can positively predict L2 writing enjoyment and motivation. With regard to the relationship betwen the ideal L2 writing self and writing performance, exising literature reports inconsistent findings. With 239 Chinese undergraduate EFL writers, Zhu et al. (2022) reported that the ideal L2 writing self can only indirectly predict English writing performance through the mediation of writing enjoyment. However, Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) observed that the ideal L2 writing self can directy predict both writing enjoyment and performance. Given the discrepancies, it is necessary to carry out more research on the relationships among the ideal L2 writing self, writing enjoyment, and writing performance, which can establish \*the foundations for the design and development of interventions that would potentially promote positive motivational and emotional experiences in L2 writing classes" (Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021, p. 2).

# 2.2. Connections between growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self

As the two popular motivational factors in existing L2 education research, growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self are closely connected. Conceivably, people who endorse growth mindsets are likely to foresee the enhancement of their L2 competence and imagine themselves as successful L2 users in the future. Within his L2Mss framework, which address idividual dferences in L2 acquisition, Dornyei (2005) indicated that \*ideal self-guides have a promotion focus, concerned with hopes, aspirations, advancements, growth, and accomplishments" (pp. 100-101). Moreover, Lou and Noels (2019b) also argued that learners with growth mindsets are likely to see a clearer image of their ideal self and take action to approach their ideal L2 self, and indicated that the linkage between growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self is a future research direction (p. 551).

The theoretical relationship between growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self has been confirmed by several recent empirical studies in general L2 English education in Iran (Sadoughi e l., 2022; Zarrinabadi e l., 2022; Zhang et a., 2022). Researchers consistently observed the close association between growth mindses and the ideal L2 elf To the best of our knowledge, there is only one empirical study in this regard within the feld of L2 writing research. With 362 undergraduate L2 English writers from a Chinese university, Xu and Wang (2022) found that growth mindses toward writing ability indee can directly inluence the ideal L2 writing self, which in turn leads to self-regulated writing strategies.

While the extant studies provide a preview of the association between growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self, more research is warranted to further examine the relationship between these two important motivational factors in different contexts. The amal. gamation of growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self has the potential to close the divide between the two prevalent theoretical frameworks in contemporary L2 education research. This willprovide more insights into the analyses of students' motivation and positive emotions, especially in L2 writing leaning where "students wl encounter various difficulties in this process and only those highly motivated could effectively manage the plight with a more positive mentality'" (Yao et al., 2021c, p.11).

2.3. Gender difference in growth mindsets, the ideal L2 self, and L2 enjoyment

Similar to the situation with academic achievement, gender difference has been found to exist in L2 learners personal belefs and mentalities. Henry (2009) argued that gender i a crtical factor that inluences self-perceptions, and thus for research conducted within the self-system paradigm, gender must be regarded as a fundamental differentiating factor and a central determiner of L2 self-concepts" (p. 179).

Gender has long been an important issue in research on mindset in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, where female students are commonly les competent in academic achievement and have lower levels of growth mindsets than male students (e.g., Blackwell et al., 2007; Degol et al., 2018; Dweck, 2007). In L2 learning, however, female students often outperform male students, particularly in L2 writing learning. Is it possible that females have higher levels of growth mindsets than males? Empirical research in this regard is extremely limited. With a sample of 320 intermediate Iranian EFL learners and in the context of grammar learning, Zarrinabadi et al. (2021) observed that female students had significantly higher levels of growth mindsets than male students, despite the small effect size (Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 1 3$ ). As grammar plays a significant role in L2 writing, it is

In terms of gender difference in the ideal 2 elf existing literature generall reports that fmales have significantly higher levels of ideal L2 self than males in general L2 education (Ryan, 2009; Yashima et al., 2017; You et al., 2016). This is probably because female students have stronger visionary capacity (You et al., 2016), which is conducive to the imagination of successul L2 users in the future. Note that the effct i f gnder differce in the idel2 self were mall in existing studies pecially in scondary ecation. For instance, Cohen's d was only 0.26 in a research with secondary school EFL students in Japan (Ryan, 2009). The author atributed this finding to the examination-oriented culture, claming that ll Japanese secondary student focus on pasing examinations and neglect the usage of English i real-life communications, consequentl resulting in the small dfference in the ideal L2 self between male and female students. This study reminds us that education context may be an issue in analyzing gender difference in the ideal L2 self. Despite the insightful findings, Al-Hoorie (2018) indicated that the attention to gender is sil insufficient in existing reearch on the ideal L2 self, particularly in the field of L2 writing learning. Therefore, more research is required in this line of inquiry.

Lastly, gender difference also exists in L2 enjoyment and female students are more likely to have joyful learning experiences than male students (Dewaele & Macntyre, 2014; Dewaele et al., 2018). For instance, with 189 high chool L2 learners in Britain, Dewaele et al. (2018) observed that female students scored significantly higher on L2 enjoyment items in the questionnaire, however, the effect size of this difference is small (Cohen' $d = 0 . 5 4 \AA$ . The authors concluded that female students "were more emotionally involved in FL (foreign language) learning than male students (p. 691). In summary, i L2 learning, female students have significantly higher levels of growth mindsets, the ideal L2 elf, and L2 enjoyment than male students; however, this gender difference is small in terms of the effect size in statistical analyses.

# 2.4. Overview of the literature and the present study

Upon reviewing the literature, three primary findings have emerged. Firstly, growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self, as two pivotal positive psychological factors in L2 education, re closely intertwined (Dornyei, 2005; Lou & Noels, 2019b). These two variables have the potential to contribute to students positive learning experiences and improved academic performance, which aligns well with the principles f Positive Psychology (Dewaele et a., 2018). Secondly, whilexisting literature has documented the asociations between growth mindsets, enjoyment, and academic performance (Yeager & Dweck, 2012; Zarrinabadi et al., 2022), there is a need for empirical research to ascertain whether these observations can be replicated within the context of L2 writing education. Additional, due to the inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between the ideal L2 writing selfand writing performance (Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021; Zhu et al., 2022), further research is required to examine this ssue, particularly involving participants from diverse contexts. Thirdly, gender differences present an intriguing aspect when analyzing L2 leaners' academic performance and psychological responses such as growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self (Al-Hoorie, 2018; Ryan, 2009; Zarrinabadi et al., 2021). While some researchers have delved into this area within 2 writing education (Cheong et l., 2022), there is a need for more empirical reearch to further investigate the gender differences among L2 writers.

In the present study, we examined thre positive mentalities (growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing self, and L2 writing enjoyment) and English writing performance in the secondary education in China. Particularly, the role of gender in this process was explored. The following two research questions (RQ) guided the whole study:

(1) What are the differences between male and female students in growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing self L2 writing enjoyment, and English writing performance, respectively?   
(2) What are the differences between male and female students in the associations among growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing elf, and L2 writing enjoyment, as well as their impacts on English writing performance?

To answer RQ2, we developed a multi-group structural equation model (Fig. 1) to capture the relationships among primary var iables. All paths in the model were added based on existing iterature. As growth mindsets were found to relate to the ideal L2 self (Sadoughi et al., 2022; Xu & Wang, 2022; Zarrinabadi et a., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), L2 enjoyment (Cheong et al., 2023; Teimouri et al., 2022; Zarrnabadi et al., 2022), and academic performance (Sisk et l., 2018; Yeager & Dweck, 2012), we added three direct paths from growth mindsts t the the variable, repectively. Further, ince the ideal L2 self can also led to enjoyment (Guan et al., 2023; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021; Zhao et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2022) and academic performance (Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021) in L2 writing education, we added these two paths in the model. Finally, as Zhu et al. (2022) observed that enjoyment can influence L2 writing performance, we added a direct path between the two variables.

# 3. Research method

# 3.1. Research context and participants

English is a compulsory course for primary and secondary level students in contemporary education system in mainland China. For senior high school students, English writing weights approximately 1/4 in the English test on the national college entrance examination and thus is an important part in the curriculum.

Participants in this study were 679 12th grade students (Mean $\mathsf { a g e } = 1 7 . 6 2$ $S D = 0 . 5 1$ $5 8 . 9 1 \%$ female) recruited from three senior high schoos in a major cit in eastern China. ll students were native Chinese speakers and studied English as a foreign language for approximately 12 years. Allstudents had signed consent forms before data collction. Participation in this study was voluntary and was not compensated. Procedures for the study were approved by the Research Ethics Board of a university in Hong Kong.

# 3.2. Instruments

The questionnaire used in this study consisted of two sections. The first section collcted information about age, gender, and student ID number. The second section measured students' growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing self, and L2 writing enjoyment on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree to 5(strongly agree) (Appendix A). The six-item growth mindset scale was developed based on Bai and Wang (2021). Example statement included: \*If I try hard, I can write English compositions well. The six-item scale that measured the ideal L2 writing self was adopted from Tahmouresi and Papi (2021). Example satement included: I imagine a day that I am easily writing emails in English'. The five-item L2 writig enjoyment scale was also adopted from Tahmoures. and Papi (2021). Example statement included: \* really enjoy writing in English'. As our participants were native Chinese speakers, we first translated the questionnaire into Chinese, and then invited an expert to translate it back into English. No information was lost during translation. Afterwards, we also invited classrom teachers from the participating schools to review the wordings of the questionnaire. Some minor revisions were made based on their suggestions.

The English writing task was developed based on the English test syllabus of the national college entrance examination. Student were required to write atwo-paragraph, 150-word narrative composition after reading a short text titled \*Sarah needs a new coat'. An opening sentence was provided at the beginning of each paragraph. Ten keywords were underscored in the reading text and students should use at least five of them in their writings. To prepare for the upcoming college entrance examination, ll participants had undergone considerable practices and were familiar with this kind of writing task. Classroom teachers from the participating schools confirmed that the format and difficulty level of the writing task were equivalent to the real writing task on the English test of the college entrance examination.

# 3.3. Research procedures and data collection

Data were collected in the natural teaching environment. Students firstrceived instructions on the procedure from their classroom teachers, and then completed the writing task $4 0 \mathrm { m i n } \mathrm { , }$ and questionnaire ( $2 0 \mathrm { m i n } )$ in paper-and-pen format, with a 10-minute interval.

Two research asstants with extensive experience in language learning research independently rated participants compositions. The marking scheme was adopted from Shi et al. (2020) and was i concordance with the asessment criteri of the English test of the college entrance examination. The two raters provided holistic ratings (ranging from 0 to 100) based on students writing performance in the following aspects: content alignment with the given text and opening sentences, overall qualit of content, linguisic competence, and coherence throughout the text. Prior to formal rating, a training sesson was organized to familiarize the raters with the marking scheme. We then provided five examples of writing of ifferent quality for trial marking. The Pearson corrlation cofficient for the scores assigned by the two raters indicated an acceptable inter-rater reliability $( r ( 6 7 9 ) = 0 . 7 5 2 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . The average scores given by the two raters were used to denote students' English writing performance.

# 3.4. Data analysis

IBM SPss version 22.0 was used for preliminary analyses, including descriptive statistics Cronbach's alpha coeficients, and bivariate correlations between primary variables. Mplus version 8.3 (Muthen & Muthen, 2017) was then used to perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multi-group SEM. Specificall, items for gowth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing sef, and 2 writing enjoyment were loaded onto their respective factors. Students' writing scores were used as a measured variable in the sEM model. Maximum likelihood estimators were used for all analyses. Several fit indices were checked, including the Chi-squared statistic $( \chi ^ { 2 } )$ , comparative fit index (CFI; acceptable ${ > } . 9 0 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ , root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; good ${ < . 0 6 }$ , acceptable $< . 0 8$ , and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; acceptable $< . 0 8$ ) (Meyers et al., 2016).

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Preliminary analyses results

Preliminary analyses results, including descriptive statistics Cronbach's alpha cofficients, and bivariate correlations between primary variables, are displayed in Table 1. The absolute values of skewness and kurtosis for al four variables were within or close to one, indicating that they generally met the assumption of central tendency for data analysis. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for growth mindset, the ideal L2 writing self, and L2 writing enjoyment were all above 0.85, suggesting high internal consistency of the scales. Further, the three positive mentalities were significantly and positively correlated with each other, whereas only growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writingself were weakly related to writing performance. Notably, the mean score of L2 writing enjoyment was only 2.53, lower than the mid-point (i.., 3) on a five-point Likert sale. This indicated that a majority of students had a relatively low level of enjoyment in L2 writing learning.

The information concerning the preliminary analyses in the two groups are also presented in Table 1. The resuls are akin to those for the full sample, except for one aspect. For female students, growth mindses, the ideal L2 writing self, and L2 writing enjoyment were all positively correlated with writing performance. However, these correlations were not evident for male students.

We then proceeded to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. CFA with the pooled data $( N = 6 7 9$ ) indicated that the three-factor model reached an acceptable fit to the data: $x ^ { 2 }$ $^ 2 \ ( 1 1 6 ) = 9 3 2 . 7 5 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ 3 $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 2 9$ , and $\mathbf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5 9$ . However, the RMSEA value (0.102) was larger than the recommended threshold. Therefore, we added two corrlations between residuals (growth mindsets: items 1 and 2 and items 5 and 6) according to the modification indices provided by Mplus. The modified model fit the data well: $x ^ { 2 } \left( 1 1 4 \right) = 4 7 8 . 4 0 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 6 8$ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \% \mathrm { C I } ] = 0 . 0 6 9 [ 0 . 0 6 2 , 0 . 0 7 5 ]$ , and $\mathbf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 4 7$ As shown in Table 2, factor loadings of al items were significant and ranged from 0.610 to 0.932, with most hovering around 0.80 and 0.90. In terms of the factor correlation, growth mindsets were positively associated with the ideal L2 writing self $( r = 0 . 6 1 9 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and L2 writing enjoyment $( r = 0 . 6 2 6$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . The ideal L2 writing self was also positively related to L2 writing enjoyment $( r = 0 . 5 6 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . Finally, the correlations between growth mindsets items 1 and 2 and between items 5 and 6 were 0.699 $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ and 0.328 $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , respectively. The CFA results provided construct validity evidence for the three mentalities in the questionnaire.

# 4.2. Gender difference in the four variables

To answer RQ1, we performed independent sample t-tests to examine differences between male and female students in growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing slf, L2 writing enjoyment, and English writing performance. The results are displayed in Table 3. Significant differences were evident for all four variables (al $p s < 0 . 0 1 $ ). We further examined the effect sizes (Cohen's d) of the t-tests results. According to Plonsky and Oswald (2014), Cohen's $d$ statistics close to 0.40, 0.70, and 1.00 were classified as small, medium, and large, respectively, in L2 research. Therefore, compared to male students, female students scored slightly higher on the three mentalities (all Cohen's ds below or close to 0.30), and had better performance on the writing task (Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 2$

# 4.3. Multi-group SEM results

To answer RQ2, we performed multi-group SEM analysis to investigate the associations of the four variables. We first checked measurement invariance of the three mentalities across the two groups. Following empirical L2 research (Cheong et al., 2023), we tested configural, factor loading, and item intercept invariance by examining thre models sequentially. The firt model (or baseline model) allowed factor loading and item intercet to vary across groups, the second model constrained factor loading to beequal (weak invariance), and the third model constrained factor loading and item intercept to be equal (strong invariance). When comparing a given pair of two models, a change les than 0.002 in the CFl indicates that constraining factor loading or/and item intercept does not significantl change the model-data fit (Meade et al., 2008). The model fit indices in Table 4 provided strong evidence of measurement invariance on the constructs of the three mentalities across the two groups.

For both groups, the three mentalities were positively associated with each other (all $p s < 0 . 0 1 \AA$ . Plonsky and Oswald (2014) suggested that rs close to 0.25, 0.40, and 0.60 should be considered as small, medium, and large, respectively. Associations among the three mentalities generally reached the medium or large level for both groups. Wald chi-square tes identified significant difference in the path from growth mindsets to the ideal L2 writing self (0.68 for males vs. 0.52 for females): $x ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 4 . 4 9 5$ $p < 0 . 0 5$ , and the path from growth mindsets to L2 writing enjoyment (0.53 for males vs. 0.38 for females), $x ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 4 . 0 5 6$ $p < 0 . 0 5$ . It appeared that, compared to female students, male students benefited morefrom holding growth mindsets, given its sronger associations with the ideal L2 writing self and L2 writing enjoyment.

In terms of the effct from the ideal L2 writing self to L2 writing enjoyment, the path coeficient for female students (0.35) was significantly larger than that for male students (0.20): $x ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 4 . 0 3 7$ $p < 0 . 0 5$ In addition, among the three mentalities, only the ideal L2 writing self was asignificant predictor of writing performance for female students, and the standardized path coefficient was small (0.13). Notably, the $p$ value for this path coefficient was 0.071, larger than the common 0.05 significance level but still within the 0.10 threshold in L2 research (Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021). With regard to the indirect effct on writing performance, we only found one significant indirect path for female students from growth mindsets to writing performance via the ideal L2 writing self: $\beta = 0 . 0 6 7$ , SE $= 0 . 0 3 8$ $p = 0 . 0 7 5$ Obviously, female students benefited more from the ideal L2 writing self, as it not only had stronger relation to L2 writing enjoyment but also contributed to writing performance.

# 5.1. Gender difference in L2 writing learning

We observed that female students had slightly higher levels of growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing self, and L2 writing enjoyment in this study, in line with the rearch findings in different educational contexts round the gloe (Dewaele et l. (2018); Yashima et al. (2017); Zarrinabadi e l. (2021). Moreover, female students also had significantly better L2 English writing performance than male students, echoing existing literature (Al-Saadi, 2020; Saeed et al., 2011; Troia et al., 2013). Of note is the low level of L2 writing enjoyment for all students. The mean scores of L2 writing enjoyment for both groups were below 3, the mid-point of the five-point Likert scale. This low level of enjoyment may be attributed to the high demands of L2 writing which consequentl lead to negative emotions. Particularly, the high pressure incurred by the examination-oriented culture may also play an important role in shaping students' feelings about and personal beliefs toward their English writing learning experiences.

Participants in this study were 12th grade students who were under extensive trainings to prepare for the upcoming national colle entrance examination. Getting higher scores and outperforming others were the primary goals of English learning. Female students higher levels of growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing self may be atributed to their long-term advantages over male students in writing performance. Itis reasonable that female students perceived themselves to be more capable of writing in English than male students. This higher self-perception of writing competence may further strengthen their growth mindsets toward writing ability, as corroborated by literature indicating a positive correlation between growth mindsets and self-peceived 2 competence (Lou & Noels, 2020b; Yao et al., 2021b). For instance, Yao et al. (2021b) observed that Chinese secondary school students with growth mindsets exhibited a higher level of self-perceived English competence. In addition, perceived competence is part of the L2MSS framework and contributes to "a significantly higher level of L2 intrinsic motivation' (Dornyei, 2005, p. 79). Empirical research has also confirmed the positive correlation between perceived competence and the ideal L2 self (Ghasemi, 2018). Thus, female students also had higher levels of ideal L2 writing selves than male students in this study.

Notably, the difference in the ideal L2 writing self between the two groups was sight, given the smalleffect sizes of statistical analyses. This result is in ine with the findings inthe secondry ducation in Japan Ryan (2009) aributed this slight iffernceto the examination-oriented culture and indicated that emphasis on the passage of examinations can impede students' imagination of using the language in the future, consequently leading to the minimized difference in the ideal L2 self between male and female students. English writing accounts for approximately 1/4 of the total score of the English test on the national college entrance examination in China. Conceivably, our participants pay substantial atention to getting higher scores on the writing task and neglect the usage of English writig in future acadmic and/or profesional seting. As a result the ifference in the ideal writing elf is small between male and female students. In addition, the dfference in growth mindsets between male and female students is also smal in this study, which has not been explicitly llustrated in existing litrature. Future qualitative research is warranted to provide in-depth explana tions to the nuances between male and female students in their malleable beliefs toward writing ability.

# 5.2. Gender difference in the associations among primary variables

Our multi-group structural model reported positive associations among the four variables for both male and female students. Especiall, we confirmed that growth mindsets were indeed related to the ideal 2 writing sef, echoing existing literature (Dornyei. 2005; Lou & Noels, 2019b; Xu & Wang, 2022) and providing additional evidence to bridge the gap between the two popular motivational frameworks. Moreover, growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing self were positively related to L2 writing enjoyment for both female and male students. These findings corroborate the theoretical underpinnings of the correlation between these variables (Higgins, 1987; Lou & Noels, 2019a, 2019), as well as the empirical findings i the literature (e., Teimouri et al., 2022; Tahmoures) & Papi, 2021; Zarrinabadi et al., 2022). Notably, gender difference existed in the associations among the three mentalities.

While both growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing self could lead to L2 writing enjoyment, the former was more predicative for male students and the latter more predicative for female students. These interesting findings may be attrbutable to the following reasons. On the one hand, growth mindsets are a powerful motivator for students with low academic achievements (Dweck, 199, 2006). For instance, Lou and Noels (2020a) observed that growth mindsets greatly supported low-competence L2 learners' intercultural communications by reducing their anxieties in using English. Owing to male students' poorer English writing performance, growth mindsets played a more substantial role conducive to L2 writing enjoyment. On the other hand, female students have higher visionary capacity (You et al., 2016), which may inspire their imagination of writing in English in future academic and/or professional settings. Consequentl, aclearer future image f successful English writer accounts for the stronger asociation between the ideal L2 writing self and L2 writing enjoyment for female students.

In terms of the influence of the three mentalities on English writing performance the predictive roles of growth mindsets and L2 writing enjoyment were not evident. Dweck (2018) indicated that growth mindsets may be more predictive to a general course grade which is an overall performance index of many different tasks. This is because students' academic performance on a single task (e., the English writing task in this study) may be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, more indices should be included in future research to provide a stable evaluation of L2 writing performance. In addition, while Zhu et al. (2022) found that L2 writing enjoyment was directly related to L2 writing performance, participants in that study were undergraduate students who had successflly passed the college entrance examination and were under les presure compared to high school students. Inthis study, students generall had low level f 2 writing enjoyment regardes of their writing performance, which may result in the insigificant relationship between L2 writing enjoyment and performance. Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) indicated that L2 writing enjoyment can indirectly influence writing performance via motivated learning behavior. Thus, future research may consider including behavioral variables such as learning engagement, as mediators when examining the relationship between L2 writing enjoyment and performance with students who are under high academic pressure.

Finally, whereas Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) reported that the ideal L2 writing elf can directly influence writing performance, this effect was only evident for female students in this study, and the standardized path coefficient was small. The weak association between the ideal L2 slf and academic achievement has long been documented. L2 leaners personal trais could only explain no more than $\boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \cdot } \boldsymbol { \cdot } \%$ of the variance in academic performance' (Dornyei, 2005, p. 21). Moreover, the gender difference in the relationship between the ideal L2 writing self and English writing performance may be atributable to the following reasons.

Dewaele et al. (2018) observed that female students are more emotionally involved in L2 learning, experiencing not only higher levels of enjoyment but also higher levels of anxiet in the learning proces. Female students in this study may be sensitive to the feedback from parents and teachers on their performance in English examinations, as academic pressure caused by feedback from parents and teachers is ubiquitous for Chinese secondary school students (Yao et al., 2021b). The sensitivity to outside comments, or expectations, contribute to the formation of the ought-to L2 self which is the other important motivator in the L2Mss framework. Therefore, i is likely that the combination of both the ideal and the ought-t L2 writing selves motivates female students to transcribe their study intentions into real learning behaviors. On the contrary, male students may exhibit attitudes of levity and insensitivity towards extrnal exptations. though this i conducie to ougher mentality against adversities in the nig proes, it results in the insignificant association betwen motivational factors and actual learning behaviors. Notably, as anxiety and the ought-to L2 self were not examined in this study, future research may include these two factors to provide a more comprehensive view of gender difference in the associations among the two possible future selves, emotions, and L2 writing performance.

# 5.3. Pedagogical suggestions

We have the following pedagogical suggestions based on the findings in this study. First, teachers should try to cultivate growth mindsets and the ideal L2 witing self among 2 writer. These two positive mentalitie, although cannot guarantee immediate writing performance improvement, contribute to the joyful experiences in L2 writing leaning. This is an important trat, as L2 writing learning is a long-term proces. Students with positive mentalities are tough and more likely to continue writig learning in face of the challenges and setbacks. This holds particular merit for secondary school students within an examination-orientated context, such as the 12th grade students in the present study. In academic subject teaching or counseling sessions, teachers should guide students to view writing challenges as opportunities for improvement rather than as insurmountable obstacles. For instance, if students struggle with idea development during the writing process they are encouraged to adopt the mindsets of I need to work harder on this", rather than holding the belief that I'm innately not good at this. In terms of fostering the ideal L2 self, teachers can encourage students to imagine themselves as successul L2 authors. This vision serves as a powerful motivator, inspiring students to work harder on their writing learning journey with strong resilience and persistence. With these strategies,teachers can guide students to maintain a positive outlook and stay motivated even in high-stakes examination environments, which can positively influence students' learning

processes and academic performance.

Second, teachers should take into account gender difference in L2 writing learning and use different approaches that best fit male and female students. For example, teachers can praise male students' postive beliefs about their malleable English writing compe. tence, given that growth mindsets have more influence on them. Nevertheles, teachers should also remind male students that action speaks louder than words". Merely posessing growth mindsets is insufficient; it is imperative that malestudents musteffectively manifest their optimistic mindsets into concrete learning behaviors. For female students, teachers can expressappreciations of their aspiration toward the future, as well as their down-to-earth attitudes to current learning. As the ideal L2 writing self plays a more substantial role for female students, teachers can help them build a clearer fuure image as successful witers using the aforementioned methods.

# 6. Conclusion

Following the Positive Psychology approach, we examine the assciations among three positive mentalities (growth mindsets, the ideal L2 writing elf and L2 writing enjoyment) and their impacts on English writing performance with 12th grade students in China. Generall, female students have bettr writing performance and more positive mentalities than male students, although the gender difference is slight in terms of the three mentalities. Our multi-group structural model indicates that growth mindses are a more motivational factor for male students, whereas the ideal L2 writing self a more motivational factor for female students. This study contribute to the literature by (1) bridging the gap betwen the two important motivational frameworks in L2 research (growth mindsets and the ideal L2 self) and (2) exploring the positive mentalitie in 2 writing educatio from a gender difference perspective.

However, there are stil three limitations in this study that merit further research. First, participants in this study all came from a major city in eastern mainland China, an economically developed region. Caution should be taken to generalize the results to other contexts. Lou and Noels (2019a) indicated that social contexts may influence L2 leaners beliefs toward language ability and learning experiences. This has bn confirmed by Yao et al. (2021b) that Chinese secondary scho0 students in urban areas have higher levels of self-perceived English competence and growth mindses than their peers in rural areas. Therefore, future research may involve stu. dents from different regions and examine the social contexts differences in students' mentalities and L2 writing performance.

Second, owing to the cross-sectional design, the relationships among primary variables in this study may be bettr interpreted as association rather than prediction. Future research may adopt a longitudinal design over semester or an academic year to investigate whether mentalities at time one can predict writing performance at time two. Interventions that aim for the cultivation of growth mindsets and the ideal L2 writing self can also be included, so as to explore the changes of students beliefs i 2 writing learning and their impacts on learning experiences and outcomes.

Last, more variables could have been included to provide a more comprehensive view of the effects of mentalities on L2 writig learning. As the other side of the coin, fixed mindsets and the ought-to L2 self are important parts in the language mindsets and the L2MSS frameworks, respectively. These two relatively negative mentalities can lead to anxiety in L2 learning (Lou & Noels, 2019a; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021). As indicated in the discussion section, the significant association between the ideal L2 writing self and English writing performance for female students may be aributed to the higher levels of anxiety and the ought-to L2 self. Therefore, future research may involve fixed mindsets, the ought-to L2 self, and anxiety as mediators, and examine to what extent positive mentalities can counter balance the negative influence brought by these variables on L2 writing learning experiences and outcomes.
