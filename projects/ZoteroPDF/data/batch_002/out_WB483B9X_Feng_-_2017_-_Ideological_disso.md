# Ideological dissonances among Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong: A corpus-based analysis of reports on the Occupy Central Movement

William Dezheng Feng The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong

# Abstract

The Occupy Central Movement was the biggest protest in Hong Kong in decades and caused an unprecedented division of opinion in society. Reports about the event in local Chinese media were remarkably different in stance and attitude. To understand the ideological dissonances and their linguistic construction, this article analyzes a corpus of 120 reports on the Occupy Central Movement from four major Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, namely, Apple Daily, Ming Pao, Oriental Daily News and Ta Kung Pao, which cover the political spectrum from anti-Beijing to proBeijing. In total, 856 concordance lines of the two selected words ‘佔中’ (occupy Central) and ‘佔 領’ (occupy) were annotated using the Attitude framework. Analysis shows that their attitudes toward the event form a continuum from supportive, through neutral, to antipathic. The attitudes do not simply reflect the stances of the newspapers, but are strategically selected and designed to legitimize or delegitimize the event. The pattern of attitudes reflects the ideological divergence in Hong Kong society, and at the same time, the news reports also exacerbate the divergence by reinforcing the attitudes of their readers.

# Introduction

On 31 August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China announced the decision on Hong Kong’s electoral framework for Chief Executive, which stipulated that candidates need to obtain support from over $50 \%$ of the members of the nomination committee in order to be eligible. The decision that put a restrictive threshold on candidates was strongly opposed by the ‘pro-democracy’ camp and proponents of the Occupy Central Movement (hereafter OCM). The OCM was previously proposed by the ‘Occupy Central with Love and Peace’ campaign initiated by Dr Benny Tai, a law professor at The University of Hong Kong; Dr Chan Kin-man, a sociology professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong; and the Reverend Chu Yiu-ming in 2013. The objective of the campaign was to occupy important areas in Hong Kong’s business district to put pressure on the government if its proposal did not meet their expectation of a ‘genuine popular election’. On 28 September 2014, Benny Tai announced the official start of the OCM on the site of the student protests organized by the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) and Scholarism. He designated the areas around the government headquarters as the occupation site in the Central district. In the morning, tens of thousands of citizens flooded into Admiralty, the district where the government headquarters are located, to support the movement. At around $6 { : } 0 0 \mathrm { p } . \mathrm { m } .$ ., the police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The attempt only provoked more citizens to join the protests, occupying Causeway Bay and Mong Kok and later Tsim Sha Tsui. The protests gradually developed into a decentralized occupy movement that was largely organized by volunteers. On 25 November 2014 the Mong Kok occupation site was cleared, followed by Admiralty and Causeway Bay on 11 and 14 December, respectively, and thus brought the 78-day occupation to an end.

The event put Hong Kong under the spotlight of local and international media. Reports about the event in local media were remarkably divided, if not polarized, in stance and attitude. Some applauded it for the fighting for democracy; others condemned it for breaking law and order. The media representation of the event has attracted extensive attention from communication researchers and discourse analysts during the past 2 years, most notably the two special issues ‘Media communication and the Umbrella movement’ (Lee, 2015) and ‘Occupy Hong Kong: Historicizing protest’ (Flowerdew and Jones, 2016) in Chinese Journal of Communication and Journal of Language and Politics, respectively. Other studies include Bhatia (2015), who elucidates the discursive construction of illusion in the South China Morning Post; Mey and Ladegaard (2015), who analyze the different conceptualizations of ‘democracy’ in Chinese and Western societies using a pragmaticsbased intercultural approach; and Yu (2015), who compares the framing of the OCM in Hong Kong, American and British newspapers. These studies are exclusively concerned with English media, namely the South China Morning Post, and there has been no analysis of the reports in the Chinese-language newspapers, which are consumed by an overwhelming majority of Hong Kong citizens. This article analyzes news reports from four major Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, Apple Daily, Ming Pao, Oriental Daily News and Ta Kung Pao, which occupy the political spectrum from anti-Beijing to pro-Beijing. The four newspapers will be briefly introduced in the next section. After that, the method of corpus-based analysis of attitudes is elucidated, where claims of the stance of a newspaper are firmly grounded in the annotation of all attitudes within the Appraisal framework (Martin and White, 2005). Quantitative results are then presented and the patterns are interpreted systematically in the same section. Finally, the results are summarized and discussed in terms of how the language of news reports is shaped by the political stances of the newspapers, reflecting social divergence on the one hand and shaping the attitudes of readers and exacerbating the divergence on the other.

# Newspapers in Hong Kong

In this section, I will briefly introduce the four newspapers, especially their political stances, largely based on Lai’s (2007) book Media in Hong Kong, so that the analysis of news is grounded in its social historical context (cf. Fowler, 1991). The Hong Kong press has been intricately tied to politics since it first developed under British rule in the 1840s (Chan, 2002). The press mainly served the interests of the colonial and business elites, and later also catered to ideological interests of different groups – first rallying against the ruling Qing dynasty and then advocating either Nationalist or Communist interests (Lai, 2007). Before the transfer of sovereignty to China, the colonial government attempted to democratize the media so that it would not easily fall under the control of China. As a result, the press became increasingly independent and critical in the 1980s and 1990s (Lai 2007: 187), the climax of which was perhaps the founding of Apple Daily in 1995. Meanwhile, China was also mobilizing resources to take control of the press in post-handover Hong Kong, supporting not only the traditional pro-Beijing newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Pao, but also traditionally hostile ones such as Oriental Daily News and Sing Tao Daily by giving their proprietors prestigious political status (Lai, 2007). Such a struggle shaped the current landscape of the press in Hong Kong, where whether a newspaper is pro- or anti-Beijing government has become the most fundamental distinction (Liu, 2008: 42). The spectrum of political stance can be summarized as Beijing leftist (e.g. Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Pao), pro-Beijing (e.g. Oriental Daily News and Sing Tao Daily), liberal (Ming Pao and South China Morning Post) and anti-Beijing (AD and Passion Times). The four newspapers selected for this study, namely, Apple Daily, Ming Pao, ODN and Ta Kung Pao represent all the four stances.

Ta Kung Pao (hereafter TKP) is a state-owned newspaper, controlled by the Liaison Office of the Central Government of China in Hong Kong. The current TKP was established by the Communist Party of China after winning the civil war in 1948 to fight the ideological war with Kuomintang in Taiwan and the colonial government (Lai, 2007). In the post-colonial period, TKP continues to be the most unwavering ally of Beijing on all issues. Its credibility score, however, is one of the lowest among Hong Kong newspapers.

Oriental Daily News (hereafter ODN) is the highest selling paper in Hong Kong, with a daily circulation of over half a million. It adopts a pro-Beijing stance in general, but it also has negative news and confrontational editorials. Lai (2007: 52) classifies ODN as ‘critical and independent in terms of its political reporting, with a mix of tabloid-style reporting and sensationalism’.

Ming Pao (hereafter MP), founded by the famous Chinese wuxia novelist Louis Cha and his friend Shen Pao Sin in 1959, is the most respected Chinese-language newspaper in Hong Kong. It adopts a liberal stance and is considered a symbol of the cultural identity of Hong Kong (Lai, 2007: 52). In 2014, the appointment of a new chief editor Chong Tien Siong sparked controversy and internal revolt, due to Siong’s close ties to Beijing, and was seen as a major threat to the Chinese-language newspaper’s editorial independence (Lam and Lau, 2014). Nonetheless, it is still considered to be the most credible Chinese newspaper, upholding its professional standard for Hong Kong elites. Apple Daily (hereafter AD) is a tabloid-style newspaper founded in 1995 by Jimmy Lai Chee Ying, who is hailed as a ‘democracy fighter’ by some Western media. The publisher of AD, Next Media, is considered as the ‘rebel publisher’ (Lai, 2007: 160), and AD is one of the most critical newspapers in Hong Kong. In 2014, Jimmy Lai, then proprietor of AD, was an enthusiastic proponent of the OCM and personally participated in the movement.

The political stance of a newspaper is realized in the linguistic choices in its news reports. From the above information, we can speculate that the papers’ reports about the OCM would have clear differences in stance and attitude, although they all claim to be objective and impartial. The ideological positioning and subjective framing in news reporting have been extensively theorized in critical discourse analysis (CDA) and communication studies. In what follows, I will provide a brief overview of studies from different approaches and then introduce the framework adopted in this study.

# Recontextualization, framing and attitude in news

It is widely accepted that news reports are not value-free ‘reflections’ of reality, but a complex assemblage of signifying conventions in which a preferred ‘map of social reality’ is inscribed (Bell, 1998: 108; Caldas-Coulthard, 2003; Fairclough, 1992; Fowler, 1991; Van Dijk, 1995). In the classic example from Fairclough (1992: 180), the same event can be described by the following three clauses: (a) policemen killed 100 demonstrators, (b) 100 demonstrators were killed and (c) 100 demonstrators died. All of them are ‘faithful’ representations of the reality, but the attitudinal stance is clear: sentence (a) accuses the policemen, while sentence (c) attempts to downplay their responsibility. To explain the mechanism that gives rise to different versions of reality, various theories have been proposed. Among them, the notions of ‘recontextualization’ and ‘framing are two of the most frequently referred to concepts in CDA and communication research, respectively.

The concept of recontextualization was originally proposed by Bernstein (1990), who argues that ‘semantic representations selectively appropriate, relocate, refocus and relate to other discourses to constitute its own order and orderings’ (p. 184). Van Leeuwen (1993) introduces the notion to CDA and proposes that recontextualization involves various transformations, including substitution, deletion, rearrangement, addition and repetition of elements of a given social practice. The transformations may also include evaluation of the social practice, which is determined by their specific goals and preferences (e.g. ‘the election plan was vetoed by the legislative council’ can be evaluated positively or negatively). Moreover, discourses also involve legitimization, in which the authors explain and justify their representations (e.g. using the voices of experts and authorities). Therefore, ‘there is no direct and transparent relationship between social practices and discourses about social practices, and it is important to distinguish between them’ (Caldas-Coulthard, 2003: 276). The reality observed depends on the standpoint of the observer, that is, the goals, values and priorities of that communication (Caldas-Coulthard, 2003). In this sense, the news is not the event, but an ideologically driven, partial and subjective reconstruction of the event.

Linguists and discourse analysts have been attempting to systematically link structures of news discourse with structures of ideologies, especially in relation to bias and discrimination (e.g. Flowerdew et al., 2002; Teo, 2000; Van Dijk, 2006). One of the most straightforward discourse strategies is positive self-representation and negative other-representation. This may be shown not only in adjectives or nouns used to describe ingroups and outgroups and their properties, but also in the complex structures that relate these groups with specific actions, objects, places or events (Van Dijk, 1995). The discursive structures include macrostructures of topic selection (emphasis and downplay of certain topics), local meanings, ‘our’ positive/‘their’ negative actions (e.g. giving many details of their negative actions and our positive actions), lexical choices (e.g. positive words for ‘us’ and negative words for ‘them’), rhetorical figures, prosodic features and so on (Van Dijk, 2006). Another framework that has been developed to model the complex ways the author’s attitude is expressed in news is the system of Appraisal or evaluation in functional linguistics (e.g. Bednarek, 2006; Hunston and Thompson, 2000; Martin and White, 2005; White, 2006). The Appraisal framework is adopted in the current study and introduced in the next section.

A notion similar to recontextualization is ‘framing’, which refers to the selection of some aspects of a perceived reality and making them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described. (Entman, 1993: 52)

Derived from Goffman’s (1974) conceptualization of ‘frame’, framing has become one of the most influential theories in mass communication research (Scheufele and Iyengar, 2012). According to framing theory, all news reports ‘contain frames, which are manifested by the presence or absence of certain keywords, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of information, and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or judgments’ (Entman, 1993: 52). Framing can generate effects on the structure of the news reports as well as on the audiences’ attitudes and evaluations of the news events. For instance, studies of valence framing have shown that factually identical news stories may result in opposite evaluations, depending on whether the stories are framed positively or negatively (e.g. De Vreese, 2005; Iyengar, 1991). The valenced frames are realized through implicitly or explicitly highlighting either the positive (gain, legitimacy, popularity) or negative (loss, illegitimacy, opposition) aspects of the events, resulting in frame-cued evaluation among the audience (Yu, 2015: 9).

Communication researchers have extensively studied the framing of social protests in news reports (e.g. Ashley and Olson, 1998; Boykoff, 2006; Dardis, 2006; Gitlin, 1980; Xu, 2013). Gitlin (1980) finds that the framing devices used by the US media on the antiwar movement and protesters include trivialization (making light of protesters’ dress, appearance, age and language), marginalization (downplaying the representativeness of the movement), undercounting protesters, denying the movement’s effectiveness, and exaggerating the threat that the movement posed to mainstream society by emphasizing the presence of communists in the protests. Boykoff (2006) investigates the media coverage of the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999 and the World Bank/International Monetary Fund protests in Washington, DC in 2000 and identifies five major frames about the protests: violence, disruption, freak (focusing on the appearance and non-mainstream ideology of protesters), ignorance, and amalgam of grievances. Xu (2013) analyzes the framing strategies in reports of Occupy Wall Street and finds that lawlessness, official sources, show and ineffective goals are the most widely used delegitimization devices. The method used in the aforementioned studies is content analysis, in which the whole news article is the coding unit, and researchers identify the framing strategies in an article without analyzing how they are discursively constructed. Even when the texts are considered, these studies often ‘do no more than cite, summarize, paraphrase or merely comment on the content of the texts, as if they speak for themselves’ (Van Dijk, 2007: 6). As a result, basic properties of complex signifying practices are left only poorly articulated, which severely hinders the thorough understanding of the process and effect of news communication. The present study complements research in communication by providing an explicit model for analyzing the discourse semantics of framing in news.

# Analytical method: Corpus-based attitude analysis

As explained earlier, reporters’ attitudes and ideologies are realized through discursive semantic choices during the process of recontextualization. Among the wide array of discursive resources, evaluative concepts are the most common forms of expressing ideological content (Van Dijk, 1995: 260). White (2006) similarly suggests that ‘a key aspect of ideological functionality is evaluation – the text’s positioning of its audience to take either negative or positive views of the participants, actions, happenings and stateof-affairs therein depicted’ (p. 38). To model the evaluative concepts under a coherent framework, I draw upon the Appraisal system developed by Martin and White (2005).

The Appraisal system encompasses the three sub-systems of Attitude, Engagement and Graduation. Attitude is the most sophisticated system, which includes values of emotional response (Affect), values by which human behaviors are socially assessed (Judgment) and values that address the aesthetic qualities of objects and entities (Appreciation). Affect is about resources for construing emotional reactions, and it is further categorized into un/happiness, in/security, dis/satisfaction and dis/inclination. Un/happiness is to do with the extent to which we feel happy/unhappy. In/security deals with our anxious or assured feelings about the surroundings. Dis/satisfaction refers to our feelings of frustration and fulfillment relating to activities or states of events. Dis/inclination is to do with the desire for the condition of future events. Judgment is concerned with the assessment of human behaviors according to social esteem and social sanction. Judgment of social esteem involves the sub-categories of normality (how special someone is), capacity (how capable someone is) and tenacity (how resolute someone is). Judgment of social sanction is concerned with veracity (how truthful someone is) and propriety (how ethical someone is). Appreciation is the evaluation about things, which can be divided into reaction, composition and valuation. Reaction refers to the degree to which things catch our attention. Composition is concerned with the internal structure of things, such as balance and complexity. Valuation is to do with the value of things, such as how original or authentic things are. The Attitude system is represented in Figure 1.

Appraisal meanings are realized across different lexicogrammatical resources. Martin and White (2005) distinguish between inscribed attitudes (explicit) and invoked attitudes (implicit). Inscription means that an attitude is explicitly expressed by attitudinal lexis, such as ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘good’ and ‘bad’. Invocation refers to the implicit expression of attitudes through recounting events that elicit the attitudes (e.g. ‘she donated all her money to the orphanage’; ‘he went to college at $_ { 1 2 } ,$ ; ‘she found her long lost daughter’). In this case, the level of the speaker’s subjectivity (and hence attitudinal responsibility) is reduced as he or she is merely stating the fact and it is the listeners who infer his or her attitude. Such implicit expressions of attitudes are preferred in news reports for their seeming objectivity, and in these cases the attitudes are realized through what events are selected and how they are described.

Figure 1. The system of Attitude (based on Martin and White, 2005: 42–48).

This framework provides an effective tool for analyzing both explicitly and implicitly evaluative meanings in a systematic way. However, as with other approaches to discourse analysis, researchers tend to rely on the close reading of a small number of texts, which results in concerns about representativeness and generalizability. Corpus linguistic analysis, on the contrary, tends to focus on low-level lexical features and neglects the discursive nature of meaning. For example, in Brindle’s (2016) analysis of the representation of the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan, 13 collocations of ‘hurt’ and ‘Taiwan’ are found using a corpus tool. However, the result is meaningless until we know who hurts Taiwan, the Sunflower Movement or the trade agreement, and it is the agent that matters, which is not quantitatively analyzed. To overcome the weakness of both approaches, this study combines corpus-based research with manual text analysis, following Bednarek (2006). This is particularly important for attitude analysis as the realization of attitude ranges from single words to sentences and even paragraphs. As Van Dijk (1995: 262) argues,

semantic representation of opinions in attitudes or models needs to be analyzed in context: the mere use or application of a word such as ‘terrorist’ does not imply, as such, that the speaker believes that the word should be so applied and that a social group deserves to be called that way.

The current study therefore includes quantitative calculations of the distribution of attitudes based on manual analysis of the relevant concordances in the corpus, as well as qualitative explanations of the strategies for justifying the evaluations.

AD: Apple Daily; OCM: Occupy Central Movement.

This study adopts a concordance analysis approach to analyze the four newspapers’ attitudes toward the OCM. The corpus consists of 135,404 running Chinese characters, covering a total of 120 news reports with a major focus on the OCM. The data was selected by searching the keywords ‘佔中’ (occupy Central) and ‘佔領’ (occupy) in articles published from 31 August 2014 to 31 October 2014 in AD, MP, ODN and TKP. Then 30 articles were randomly selected from each newspaper. WordSmith 6.0 (Scott, 2011) was used to generate the concordance lines of the selected words ‘佔中’ (occupy Central) and ‘佔領’ (occupy). A total of 856 concordances were generated, with 183 from AD, 229 from MP, 222 from ODN and 222 from TKP. All the instances were manually annotated using the Attitude framework by two trained research assistants independently. When there was no clear attitude, or it was not clear whether the attitude was positive or negative, the instance was marked as ‘neutral’. To guarantee the accuracy of analysis, we not only focused on the sentences containing the keywords, but also considered the neighboring sentences and even paragraphs wherever necessary. The inter-coder agreement was above $90 \%$ and differences were resolved through discussion with the author.

# Analysis

In what follows, I will discuss the three questions derived from the analytical framework: (a) Whose attitudes are represented in each newspaper? (b) What are the attitudes? (c) What are the strategies for expressing the attitudes? As the attitudes do not just reflect the supportive/unsupportive stance of the newspapers but are designed to de/legitimize the OCM, the quantitative distribution of attitudes is complemented with a discussion of how they serve as de/legitimization strategies.

# AD’s representation of the OCM

The result of the analysis of the concordance lines of ‘佔中’ (occupy central) and ‘佔領’ (occupy) in AD is shown in Table 1. We can see that except for recounting events in which the OCM is not evaluated, the majority of the attitudes are positive. The positive attitudes not only reflect AD’s supportive stance, but are strategically designed to legitimize the OCM. The strategies involve whose voices are represented, what types of attitudes are chosen and how they are expressed. The sources of attitudes are deliberately chosen so that more voices of occupiers and supporters are represented, as shown in Table 2. Meanwhile, the reporters take a supportive stance whenever they comment on the OCM. Such choices serve to construct a version of ‘reality’ in which the OCM is supported and justified. In terms of expression, most of the attitudes ( $80 \%$ of all attitudes) are constructed implicitly by recounting facts that invoke attitudes. In this way, the newspaper maintains a respectable degree of objectivity.

AD: Apple Daily; HK: Hong Kong.

In terms of the distribution of attitudes, the most remarkable feature of AD is its highlighting of the occupiers’ positive attributes (i.e. Judgment), which accounts for $50 \%$ of all the positive attitudes (see Table 1). The positive attributes include three aspects: the determination and perseverance in fighting for democracy, the sacrifice for the future of Hong Kong and the quality exhibited during the OCM. Aside from recounting the occupiers’ behavior, the reports also ‘inscribe’ their Judgment using attitudinal lexis. For example, in Text 1 the determination of the occupiers is explicitly commended. The second most frequent type of attitude is Appreciation, in which the cause, nature, goal and value of the OCM are explained. It explains that the reason for the occupation is Beijing’s betrayal of Hong Kong people by the restrictive election plan. The OCM is moralized through the name of the campaign, which is ‘Occupy Central with Love and Peace’, and it is defined as civil disobedience, the goal of which is fighting for democracy and genuine universal suffrage. It also emphasizes that the OCM has already put pressure on the government and may force them to accept genuine universal suffrage. Third, in terms of Affect, the OCM is justified by two strategies: it reflects the dissatisfaction and frustration of Hong Kong citizens, and Hong Kong citizens are willing or even eager to join the movement. For example, Text 2 highlights citizens’ support both implicitly by recounting the behavior of the taxi drivers (who ‘took over the flags’) and explicitly by quoting their words that ‘they support the protesters’ fight.

Text 1: He points out that the government can wear away the physical energy of the protesters, but not their determination to pursue democracy. (Translated from AD, 11 October 2014)

Text 2: Some taxi drivers took over the flags and said that they support the protesters’ fight for universal suffrage. (Translated from AD, 1 September 2014)

# ODN’s representation of the OCM

The distribution of attitudes in ODN reports is summarized in Table 3. The stance of the newspaper is reflected in the choice of whose voices are represented and the types of attitudes represented. It can be seen from Table 4 that the reports are dominated by negative attitudes. In contrast to AD, no voice of the occupiers is represented and the newspaper draws upon authoritative voices of government officials, expert voices from anti-OCM scholars, and popular voices from citizens and business people from various sectors to delegitimize the OCM. In terms of expression, similar to AD, most of the attitudes are constructed implicitly by recounting facts that invoke attitudes.

It can be seen from Table 3 that ODN seldom makes negative Judgments of occupiers, which suggests that ODN tries to maintain its objectivity by focusing on the event, rather than judging those involved. The most salient feature of the attitudes, which is also the most important delegitimization strategy, is the negative Appreciation of the nature, purpose and consequence of the OCM. First, in contrast to AD, ODN defines OCM as an illegal activity that seriously undermines the rule of law in Hong Kong. Second, it points out that the purpose of OCM is to paralyze the functioning of the government and menace it into rejecting the proposal for universal suffrage. It even accuses the OCM of having the ulterior purpose of overthrowing the government and seeking independence. Third, the majority of the cases of Appreciation highlight the destructive impact of the OCM on business, traffic, real estate, tourism, social stability and the lives of Hong Kong citizens. For example, Text 3 recounts the ‘fact’ that the stock market slumped, the real estate market was frozen, mainland tourists stopped coming and schools shut down.

TKP: Ta Kung Pao; OCM: Occupy Central Movement.

These four areas are deliberately chosen to invoke negative attitudes as they are vital to Hong Kong society. Another important delegitimization strategy is the representation of negative emotions from citizens and business people from various sectors. The emotions include their reactions toward the OCM (e.g. anger, frustration, worry) and their desire to put an end to the OCM. These emotions are not represented in isolation; rather, they are usually preceded by an account of the serious impact of the OCM and followed by citizens’ actions that are motivated by these emotions. For example, in Text 4 the report starts by recounting the impact of the OCM on business, which leads to the businessmen’s complaint and their action of suing Benny Tai, the proponent of the OCM.

Text 3: The consequence of the OCM on Hong Kong economy and citizen’s daily life is getting more and more serious. The stock market slumped, the real estate market is frozen, the mainland stopped its tourist groups, and the schools and kindergartens in affected districts have been shut down for three days. (Translated from ODN, 5 October 2014)

Text 4: Since the beginning of the OCM, all trades and professions have been affected and shop owners are complaining. Two affected shop owners finally pleaded to Small Claims Tribunal to sue Benny Tai and demand compensation. (Translated from ODN, 9 October 2014)

While ODN represents only a few positive attitudes (e.g. mentioning that the OCM reflects the desire of Hong Kong people), TKP represents even less, as shown in Table 5. Similar to ODN, the negative attitudes mainly come from TKP reporters, government and citizens (Table 6), and the attitudes include people’s emotional reactions to the OCM, negative Judgments of occupiers and negative Appreciation of the nature, purpose and consequences of the OCM. However, different from ODN, the dominant attitudes in TKP are Affect, and the newspaper highlights the anger and frustration of people from all walks of life. For example, in Text 5 the reporter expresses his or her attitude that the violation of law is heartbreaking, and further explains the eliciting event (i.e. the law-enforcing the police being listed as wanted criminals by occupiers). TKP also makes more negative Judgment of the behavior and qualities of the occupiers (e.g. their foul language, irresponsibility, simple-mindedness, bad manners, etc.) than ODN. For example, in Text 6, the reporter accuses the politicians of ‘using students to achieve their despicable political purposes’.

TKP: Ta Kung Pao; HK: Hong Kong.

Text 5: The destruction of the law is the most heartbreaking. The police officers who enforce the law are listed as ‘wanted criminals’ by the occupiers. (Translated from TKP, 24 October 2014)

Text 6: Although the OCM politicians wear a coat, they cannot hide their intention of using students to achieve their despicable political purposes. (Translated from TKP, 26 September 2014)

In terms of realization, TKP uses more explicit expressions and provocations than other newspapers, which make it the least objective. First, negative attitudinal lexis is frequently used to describe emotional reactions (e.g. ‘disappointed’, ‘heartbroken’, ‘worried’ and ‘angry’), the occupiers (e.g. ‘despicable’, ‘shameless’, ‘vicious’ and ‘unfair’) and the OCM (e.g. ‘disastrous’, ‘illegal’ and ‘violent’). Second, for implicit expressions, instead of just representing factual information, TKP often uses various strategies to provoke negative attitudes. The most commonly used strategy is describing the OCM metaphorically as a fatal disease, poison and other dangerous things. Typical examples include ‘500 doctors denounce the OCM as cancer’, ‘the OCM is like a dangerous train that is out of control’ and ‘the OCM is like a slow poison that is corroding the core values of Hong Kong’. The metaphors do not just describe the nature of the OCM (e.g. cancer), but also compare the consequence of the OCM to related concepts in the metaphorical implications. For example, in Text 7 the road is compared to the blood vessel, and the road being occupied is compared to the disease of thrombosis which makes Hong Kong sick. It also compares the OCM to cancer and the destruction of core values to the invasion of cancer, which leads to death.

Another important resource for provoking attitudes is intensification (cf. Martin and White, 2005). This is typically realized by degree adverbs and adjectives, such as ‘enormous and profound damage’, ‘seriously threatened social order’, ‘completely ignored the law’, ‘unprecedented impact’ and ‘innumerable loss’. This strategy highlights the impact of the OCM to create fear in the readers. Aside from degree words, TKP also resorts to detailed descriptions of the damage to provoke attitudes (cf. Van Dijk, 1991, 1995). Text 8 is a typical example which describes the exact amount of financial loss as a result of the OCM. Such a detailed representation of the damage, as well as the use of intensification and metaphor, constitutes what Van Dijk (1991) calls ‘scare tactics’ and makes TKP’s reports the most attitudinal.

Text 7: The letter points out that roads are like blood vessels, and the OCM has been clogging the vessel and making Hong Kong sick. The civil disobedience advocated by the OCM is just like a rampant cancer cell and is corroding the core value of Hong Kong, that is, rule of law. (Translated from TKP, 29 October 2014)

Text 8: Since the OCM, the Hang Seng index has dropped over 2000 points, and over 500 billion Hong Kong dollars has evaporated in the Hong Kong stock market. In retail, some investment banks have estimated that the OCM causes 105 million loss daily. (Translated from TKP, 28 October 2014)

# MP’s representation of the OCM

The reports of MP are characterized by their neutral stance and impartiality. First, it can be seen from Table 7 that in over two-thirds of the concordances, no clear attitudinal stance can be identified. Second, Table 8 shows that MP reporters rarely express their attitudes (only in two cases), although in the two cases MP demonstrates a sympathetic stance by commending the determination of occupiers, as Text 9. Third, the newspaper is impartial in the sense that it represents the voices of pro-occupy and anti-occupy camps equally, as shown in Table 8, and thus the ratio of positive and negative attitudes is similar. The OCM is equally legitimized and delegitimized, but to a far lesser extent than the other newspapers. In terms of Affect, MP represents both positive and negative reactions from citizens (e.g. both support from citizens and antiOCM demonstrations). In terms of Judgment, different from AD and TKP, in MP the behaviors of the occupiers are seldom commented on. The few positive Judgments are from occupiers and the negative ones are from the government. In terms of Appreciation, MP seldom mentions the consequences of the OCM and only represents comments about the nature of the OCM from different positions. For example, the supporters define it as civil disobedience, a democratic movement and a peaceful protest, while the government denounces it as defiance of the central government, a color revolution and a serious socio-political event:

Text 9: It was raining heavily last night and this morning, even the amber signal was hoisted, but that didn’t waver the protesters’ determination. They stayed on the occupy site with the umbrellas they used against the pepper spray. (Translated from MP, 1 October 2014)

# Discussion and conclusion

Drawing upon the Attitude system, I have analyzed the choices that are made in the news reports of the OCM (i.e. whose attitudes are chosen, what attitudes are selected and how the attitudes are expressed). In this section I will first provide a summary of the attitudinal framings of the OCM in the four newspapers based on the previous analysis, and then discuss the framing choices in terms of the dialectical relation between the reports and the Hong Kong society. On the one hand, the attitudes reflect the divergent political stances of the newspapers and the social divide within Hong Kong society; on the other hand, they are strategically selected and designed to de/ legitimize the OCM and to influence the attitudes of readers, which in turn exacerbates the social divide.

Based on the analysis here, Table 9 provides a qualitative summary of the major frames of the OCM under the categories of Appreciation of the event, Judgment of occupiers and Affect of citizens. It is clear from the quantitative results in Tables 1 to 8 and the summary in Table 9 that the stances form a continuum from supportive, through neutral, to antipathic. This pattern is consistent with the respective political labeling of the newspapers as pro-democracy (AD), liberal (MP) and pro-Beijing (ODN and TKP) (e.g. Lai, 2007; Liu, 2008), as introduced earlier in the article.

From a CDA perspective, the attitudes in news are not random expressions, but are strategically selected and designed to exert power, that is, to influence the attitudes and behaviors of readers. As Wodak (2009: 46) points out, discourse exerts power because it conveys knowledge which is the basis for individual and collective actions. Van Dijk (2006: 365) also suggests that manipulating the minds of others – such as their knowledge, opinions and ideologies, which in turn control their actions – is a form of exercising discursive power. In this regard, the attitudes summarized in Table 9 serve to de/legitimize the OCM through rationalization (Appreciation of the event), moralization (Judgment of occupiers) and authorization (Affect of citizens) (cf. Van Leeuwen, 2007). These strategies influence readers by resorting to their logical reasoning, moral judgment and emotion, respectively, roughly corresponding to Aristotle’s (2007) terms of logos, ethos and pathos. For AD, the most remarkable feature, which is also the most important legitimization strategy, is the highlight of the occupiers’ positive attributes (moralization/ethos), which include their determination and perseverance in fighting for democracy, their sacrifice for the future of Hong Kong and the quality exhibited during the OCM. It also emphasizes the righteous nature of the OCM (rationalization/logos) and the support from citizens (authorization/pathos) to align its readers and to mobilize readers to join the movement. For TKP, the dominant attitudes are Affect, and the newspaper highlights the anger and frustration of people from all walks of life (authorization/pathos). It also highlights the disastrous damage caused by the OCM (rationalization/logos) and the selfishness of the occupiers (moralization/ethos) to strengthen readers’ antipathy toward the OCM. In terms of the construction of attitudes, TKP uses more strategies than other newspapers to delegitimize the OCM, including detailed representations of its damage, intensification and metaphor. For ODN, the most important delegitimization strategy is the negative Appreciation of the nature, purpose and consequence of the OCM (rationalization/logos). In comparison with AD and TKP, ODN avoids the Judgment of occupiers to maintain its objectivity. Finally, for MP, the reports are characterized by its neutral stance and impartiality. Compared with the other three newspapers, its reports are mostly factual and the OCM is not intentionally legitimized or delegitimized. Therefore, to varying degrees, the newspapers are not simply providing information, but are persuading readers to accept their biased version of reality through the strategic selection and design of attitudes.

To summarize, this study provides an analytical framework to elucidate how stance is realized through choices of attitude and how these choices construct and legitimize the stance. It enables us to understand the nature and extent of the ideological dissonances among Hong Kong’s major Chinese newspapers through explicit discourse analysis of a dataset of 120 reports. Although the coexistence of different opinions is normal in a democratic society, the polarized stances and the strongly biased reports among mainstream Chinese media in Hong Kong is unusual. The situation is not getting any better in the post-OCM Hong Kong, and voices of ‘autonomy’, ‘selfdetermination’ and even ‘independence’, terms which were previously considered off-limits, have appeared in the media (Flowerdew and Jones, 2016). ‘Only time will tell how the itineraries of discourse initiated by the movement will develop as Hong Kong’s political evolution and relationship with Mainland China continue to be debated’ (Flowerdew and Jones, 2016: 521). However, it is time that mainstream media be more neutral, impartial and objective to restore rationality, dialogue and harmony in Hong Kong politics and society.
