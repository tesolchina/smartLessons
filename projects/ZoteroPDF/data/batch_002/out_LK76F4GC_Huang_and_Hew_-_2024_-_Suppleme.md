# ABSTRACT

Over the past two decades, the Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH) has become a popular buzzword in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). Although applications of the ILH can improve students’ learning of productive vocabulary, this effect appears to be transitory. Students’ learning of productive vocabulary often fades over time, as shown in delayed productive vocabulary tests. To address this problem, the present study investigated the effect of supplementing the ILH with vocabulary-use knowledge on students’ productive vocabulary performance. We designed two WeChat applets, namely Applet 0.0 and Applet 1.0. The design of Applet 0.0 was based solely on the ILH, whereas Applet 1.0 was guided by the ILH supple mented with vocabulary-use knowledge, with the latter consisting of grammatical functions (the grammatical patterns that a word can fit into), collocations (other words that appear together with a word), and constraints on use (the situations in which a word is used). Fifty-one English foreign language undergraduates were assigned to a control group (CG) or an experimental group (EG). Both groups completed a weekly paragraph-writing task as they learned vocabulary with the applets (the CG used Applet 0.0 and the EG used Applet 1.0). The results suggested an advantage for the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge over the ILH alone for productive vocabulary performance. Moreover, mobile-assisted language learners’ language proficiency levels did not influence the effectiveness of the ILH (with or without vocabulary-use knowledge) on productive vocabulary performance. The EG students’ perceptions of the WeChat-mediated Mobile-Assisted Language Learning approach are also discussed.

# 1.  Introduction

Vocabulary learning is essential for developing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ English language competency (Teng & Zhang,

2023). According to Nation (2001), enlarging the size of a learner’s vocabulary is not the goal in itself, but it facilitates a learner’s acquisition of listening, reading, speaking, and writing abilities. In other words, adequate vocabulary enables a learner to communicate effectively using a specific language (Chen et  al., 2023). Although much effort has been devoted to helping students effectively acquire vocabulary, there is a lack of consensus on many issues. Vocabulary consists of numerous categories and subcategories (Laufer & Goldstein, 2004), and among the understudied issues of vocabulary are the topics of receptive and productive vocabulary (Heidari, 2019). This dichotomy divides vocabulary knowledge into words that are comprehended through listening and reading (receptive vocabulary) and words that are produced in writing and speaking (productive vocabulary).

Most research on the topic of receptive and productive vocabulary has shown that a learner’s productive vocabulary knowledge typically lags behind their receptive vocabulary knowledge (e.g., Webb, 2008; Zhong & Hirsh, 2009) because a learner’s ability to recall the meaning of a word usually surpasses their ability to apply it in context. The lack of productive vocabulary might thwart the ability of EFL learners to communicate effectively, either in oral or written form (Teng & Xu, 2022). Therefore, it is important to determine what instructional techniques can effectively improve the development of Second Language (L2) learners’ productive vocabulary knowledge (Sandberg et  al., 2019; Schmitt, 2019). This study explores how students’ productive vocabulary performance can be sustained. We investigate whether there is an advantage for the Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH) combined with vocabulary-use knowledge (consisting of grammatical functions, collocations, and constraints on use) over the ILH alone for productive vocabulary performance, by measuring the accuracy of the lexical retrieval in EFL learners’ output. Due to limitations in the classroom setting such as limited class time, we incorporated the ILH framework into a mobile application (WeChat applet) to provide L2 learners’ access to productive vocabulary knowledge anytime and anywhere. In this paper, we first illuminate the theoretical framework by discussing the literature on the ILH and vocabulary-use knowledge, followed by the rationale behind the use of WeChat applet. We then present detailed information on the method of the present study along with its findings.

# 2.  Theoretical background

# 2.1.  Involvement Load Hypothesis (ILH)

The early psychological research on L2 vocabulary acquisition has suggested that if learners paid more attention to the lexical features of words, they could acquire the words more strongly and retain them longer (e.g., Craik & Lockhart, 1972; Craik & Tulving, 1975; Hulstijn, 2001). These processes elicited the depth of processing theory (Craik & Lockhart, 1972), according to which memory is tied to levels of perceptual processing and deeper or more extensive processing of stimuli (for example, pictures and sentences) could lead to an improvement in memory. However, the depth of processing theory does not articulate how one learning condition elicits deeper processing over another (Yanagisawa & Webb, 2021). Consequently, it is difficult to use the theory to provide pedagogical suggestions for language learning (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001).

In response to this difficulty, Laufer and Hulstijn (2001) proposed the ILH, which provides a useful framework for instructors to design vocabulary learning tasks. It has three components: need (N), search (S), and evaluation (E). The need component is defined as the drive to accomplish a task related to unknown words. Need is absent (N−, 0 points) when an unknown word is not required to finish the task, moderate $( \mathrm { N } + , ~ 1$ point) when an external authority (e.g., a teacher) asks a learner to use the unknown word (e.g., to write a sentence), and strong $( \mathrm { N } + + ,$ 2 points) when learners develop their own desire to learn an unfamiliar word. For example, a strong need occurs when a learner consults a bilingual dictionary on their own initiative to find an unknown word for use in a writing task (Yanagisawa & Webb, 2021).

Search refers to the endeavor of finding the L2 form of a word or its meaning and can be either absent or present. Search is absent $( \mathsf { S } - , ~ 0$ points) when instructors provide the L2 form of a word and its meaning in a task, and it is present $( \mathsf { S } + , \mathsf { 1 }$ point) when learners must look for the L2 form or its meaning in external resources (e.g., dictionaries). Evaluation involves comparing the meaning of a given word with that of other words to choose the most suitable word for a specific context. Evaluation is absent $( \mathrm { E } \mathrm { - } , 0$ points) when learners do not need to decide which word or tense of a word to use, moderate $^ { ( \mathrm { E + } }$ , 1 point) when the context is provided (e.g., a fill-in-the-blank task in which the most appropriate word must be selected from several candidates), and strong $( \mathrm { E } + \cdot , \ 2$ points) when learners must use a word in an authentic context (e.g., when writing an essay using target words).

An Involvement Load (IL) can be calculated for each task by summing the points of the three components. Although empirical studies have suggested that tasks with higher IL can result in better productive vocabulary acquisition (e.g., Alavinia & Rahimi, 2019; Teng & Zhang, 2021), this effect appears to be transitory. A recent meta-analytic review of 42 empirical studies revealed that the ILH explained merely $5 . 1 \%$ of the variance in the effect size of delayed post-tests of vocabulary knowledge, compared to $1 5 . 0 \%$ in immediate post-tests (Yanagisawa & Webb, 2021).

This finding clearly reflects the difficulties involved in activating L2 learners’ productive use of words (Schmitt, 2019). Indeed, it seems natural for learners to forget some newly acquired words after several days. It is therefore necessary to ask: What can we do to make vocabulary learning stick? To address this question, this paper examines the role of vocabulary-use knowledge in promoting L2 learners’ productive vocabulary performance.

# 2.2.  Vocabulary-use knowledge

In accounting for the significant decrease of knowledge in delayed post-tests, Tang and Treffers-Daller (2016) suggested that reinforcement of newly learned words is critical to ameliorate the forgetting of vocabulary, regardless of the amount of IL incorporated into the vocabulary learning tasks. Tahmasbi and Farvardin (2017) interpreted reinforcement in this context as ‘attention’ or ‘learners’ awareness of the target words.’ Research findings have provided evidence that attention leads to reinforcement (Ouyang et  al., 2020). Attention can be regarded as visual selection, whereby some sensory inputs are processed at a deeper level than others and are thus more readily available for thought, memory, or application (Lamme, 2003). In the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), glosses have been commonly cited as an attention-driven technique (e.g., Boers et  al., 2017; Chen & Yuan, 2023; Jung, 2016; Ouyang et  al., 2020). Nation (2001, p. 272) defined a gloss as ‘a brief definition or synonym, either in First Language (L1) or L2, which is provided with the text.’ Although the most researched glosses have been those comprising L1 definitions only, there has been increasing interest in embedding other techniques in glosses to clarify vocabulary knowledge, such as cognates, phonetic transcription, and etymological information (Çekiç & Bakla, 2019).

Nation (2001) classified vocabulary knowledge into form, meaning, and use. Each of these aspects can be produced in receptive and productive forms, as shown in Table 1. Taking the word intervene as an example, if a Chinese EFL learner desires to acquire its productive vocabulary knowledge, he or she should at least understand the following: for knowledge of form, its spoken form (/intə’vi:n/), its written form (‘i-n-t-e-r-v-e-n-e’), and its word parts (intervention, etc.); for knowledge of meaning, its form and meaning of ‘介入’ (‘to involve oneself in a situation, especially to prevent conflict’), its use when describing ‘taking part in something to prevent or alter a result or course of events’ (concept and referents), and its possible associations (interfere, mediate, interrupt, etc.); for knowledge of use, that it is an intransitive verb and often appears with the preposition in (collocations), such that to ‘intervene in something’ is to ‘intentionally become involved in a difficult situation in order to improve it or prevent it from getting worse’ (grammatical functions), and that the word is neutral, as it can be used either in formal or informal language and in both American and British English (constraints on use).

# 2.3.  Mobile-assisted language learning: WeChat applet

According to a recent review (Liu & Reynolds, 2022), the majority of studies on ILH $( 8 2 . 0 5 \%$ , 64 of 78 reviewed studies) were conducted in classrooms. However, in real life, students often need more time and effort to increase their productive vocabulary knowledge. Unfortunately, the limited time and large group sizes of language classes do not allow for extensive practice of productive vocabulary knowledge or time-consuming elaboration of information processing activities (Bueno-Alastuey & Nemeth, 2022). Therefore, it is crucial to employ techniques that furnish L2 learners with opportunities for vocabulary self-practice that are not limited by physical classrooms.

Mobile technologies such as smartphones have become a part of people’s daily life (Okumuş Dağdeler, 2023) and have played a crucial role in facilitating the learning of the English language (Honarzad & Soyoof, 2023). According to Kukulska-Hulme et  al. (2017), smartphones make it possible for individuals to learn languages on an ongoing basis and in a range of settings based on their personal needs. Based on the theoretical construct of affordance, connectivity is a primary purpose of mobile learning as it affords learners the ability to interact with content devoid of spatial and temporal constrictions (Bernacki et  al., 2020).

This study explores the use of mobile-assisted technology in ILH studies. Specifically, the participants in the present study carried out Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) in the form of WeChat mini programs (or WeChat applets) that can be easily installed on users’ smartphones. The use of smartphones can help increase L2 students’ interest and satisfaction in learning vocabulary (Ko, 2019).

The WeChat applet is a type of application embedded in WeChat (a pervasive mobile instant messaging application in China). It allows users to enjoy similar functions of applications, without a need to be downloaded or installed for use, which makes it very convenient for users to access learning content anywhere and at any time. Compared with applications, WeChat applets can be easily used across Android and iOS platforms, with a lower cost and a shorter development cycle (Wan et  al., 2019). Moreover, it has been estimated that there are more than half a billion users on WeChat platforms, which reduces the cost of acquisition and promotion.

# 2.4.  Research gap

In summary, the literature has strongly suggested that the reinforcement of novel words (through deliberate attention to the lexical items) might be a useful supplement to ILH in improving productive mastery of vocabulary. Moreover, there is empirical evidence that the attention-driven technique of adding glosses benefits vocabulary acquisition, although challenges remain in selecting the content of the gloss. To the best of our knowledge, the multiple ILH studies (e.g., Jafari et  al., 2018; Keating, 2008; Mármol & Sánchez-Lafuente, 2013; Soleimani & Rahmanian, 2014, 2015; Walsh, 2009) have only included fundamental knowledge in glosses, such as the form knowledge and meaning knowledge of words, which may be insufficient to direct learners’ attention toward the target items. Meanwhile, research on the effects of including additional explanations other than word definitions in glosses has been scarce (Varol & Erҫetin, 2021). Accordingly, the current study attempts to fill this gap by providing glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge consisting of grammatical functions, collocation, and constraints on use to complement the ILH in facilitating mobile-assisted language learners’ productive vocabulary performance.

# 3.  Contributions of the present study

To recapitulate, there is evidence for the positive effects of the application of the ILH on productive vocabulary learning. However, one significant gap is the uncertain predictive power of the ILH on students’ delayed productive vocabulary performance. Therefore, the present study examines whether ILH could be supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge in enhancing productive vocabulary learning. The study thereby contributes to the perennial challenge of task efficiency with respect to improving productive vocabulary in the field of SLA.

# 4.  Research questions

The use of the WeChat applet was informed by the ILH theoretical framework. More specifically, the experiment group utilized a WeChat-mediated ILH framework with glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge (grammatical functions, collocations, constraints), while the control group utilized a WeChat-mediated ILH framework without the glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge. This study was thus guided by the following research questions (RQ):

RQ 1: Is there a difference in productive vocabulary performance between the students in the experimental group (utilizing a WeChat-mediated ILH framework with glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge) and those in the control group (utilizing a WeChat-mediated ILH framework without the glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge)?

RQ 2: Do students’ language proficiency levels affect their productive vocabulary improvement differently in each group?

RQ 3: What are the experimental group students’ perceptions of the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge model? For example, what do they perceive as its benefits and drawbacks and what suggestions do they have for its improvement?

# 5.  Method

We adopted a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to collect both quantitative and qualitative data (Creswell et  al., 2003). In the first phase, we implemented a quasi-experimental design to compare the effects of the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge versus the ILH alone on students’ productive vocabulary development. In the second phase, a questionnaire was administered to examine the experimental group students’ perceptions of how the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge influenced their productive vocabulary learning.

# 5.1.  Participants

The present study is quasi-experimental in nature. Two classes, altogether fifty-one undergraduate Chinese-speaking EFL learners, enrolling in a course called English Reading and Writing, were selected using convenience sample. We used convenience samples because these students were easily accessible to us. More specifically, the teachers and students of the two classes had expressed their willingness to participate in the study. Moreover, each class was randomly assigned to a control group (CG, $n = 2 6$ ) and an experimental group (EG, $n = 2 5$ ). Before conducting the experiment, we obtained ethical approval from the author university’s Human Research Ethics Committee. Students voluntarily gave their consents to participate in this study.

# 5.2.  Instruments and materials

In this study, we designed two WeChat applets, namely Applet 0.0 and Applet 1.0. The design of Applet 0.0 was based solely on the ILH, whereas Applet 1.0 was guided by the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge consisting of grammatical functions, collocations, and constraints on use. The experimental group used Applet 1.0 and the control group used Applet 0.0.

# 5.2.1.  Target words

We selected 40 words from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), for two reasons. First, according to Li and Hafner (2022), one challenge faced by Chinese college students is building up vocabulary for tests. As the participants in the present study were soon to take the IELTS test, selecting IELTS vocabulary would help to engage them in the experiment. Moreover, IELTS is one of the most popular international English examinations in China, and good scores are highly valued when applying to foreign universities. Consequently, 40 target words (10 verbs, 10 adjectives, 10 nouns, and 10 adverbs) at the IELTS level were selected. We also asked five experienced teachers from the university to check whether the difficulty of the selected vocabulary was appropriate for the participants. All disagreements were discussed until a consensus was reached. As the participants were expected to learn 10 target words every week, they finished learning all the 40 target words after four weeks.

# 5.2.2.  EFL reading text in Applet 1.0: experimental group

We adopted a sentence-context design because it provides high flexibility for choosing target words with different parts of speech (Bao, 2015). Specifically, we created four sets of 10 reading sentences with 10 target words embedded in each set (see Appendix). One set was presented each week. The sentences were selected or adapted from the Oxford Advanced Learner’s English–Chinese Dictionary (Hornby, 2009), Merriam-Webster

Dictionary, and Cambridge Dictionary. We also prepared a corresponding gloss for each sentence. For the experimental group, the gloss in Applet 1.0 included parts of speech, Chinese translations, and vocabulary-use knowledge—grammatical functions, collocations, and constraints on use (if any)—as collected from the above dictionaries. The learning interface of Applet 1.0 for the target word persevere is shown in Figure 1. In this example, the gloss on persevere provides its part of speech (a verb), Chinese translations (坚持, 孜孜以求), grammatical functions (it ‘is an intransitive verb, so no object can be added directly behind’), and collocations (‘persevere in sth/in doing sth,’ ‘persevere with sth,’ and ‘persevere with $s \boldsymbol { b } ^ { \prime }$ ).

# 5.2.3.  EFL reading text in Applet 0.0: control group

The same target words and sentences were presented in the same order in Applet 0.0 for use by the participants in the control group. However, the glosses contained only parts of speech and Chinese translations, following previous ILH studies (e.g., Tahmasbi & Farvardin, 2017). Figure 2 again uses persevere as an example target word to show its learning interface in the control group. In this example, the gloss on persevere provides its part of speech (a verb) and Chinese translations (坚持, 孜孜以求).

# 5.2.4.  Paragraph-writing task

Zou (2017) observed that the paragraph-writing task had an advantage over other tasks because it involved deeper processing of target words. Because the paragraph-writing task forces students to stretch their linguistic resources to produce the targeted linguistic items, it can lead to better learning. Accordingly, we required the students in both the experimental and control groups to compose a semantically acceptable and grammatically correct paragraph each week while using the 10 target words that they learned during that week. Moreover, the participants had access to both monolingual and bilingual dictionaries. According to ILH, a paragraph-writing task in which target words and their vocabulary knowledge are provided involves moderate need (1 point), no search (form and meaning are provided, 0 points), and strong evaluation (2 points), resulting in a total IL of 3 points. In both groups, the students carried out the tasks individually. By the end of the treatment, the students had each submitted four paragraph-writing tasks.

# 5.2.5.  Language proficiency and language proficiency level

The participants’ language proficiency were checked by their English test scores of Chinese College Entrance Examination (Gaokao). Gaokao is a Chinese version of the American SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) and British A-level (General Certificate of Education Advanced Level) exam that takes place in June every year. Generally, Gaokao’s English exam consists of five parts: listening, reading comprehension, cloze test, fill-in the blanks and writing. The exam lasts for two hours and the total score of the English test is 150 points in most provinces.

We obtained students’ Gaokao English test scores after consulting the Admissions Office of the University. Unfortunately, the English scores of three students from the experimental group were missing. Therefore, altogether 48 students’ Gaokao English test scores were analyzed. An independent $t { \cdot }$ -test was conducted to compare the groups’ language proficiency (control group: CG, experimental group: EG), CG: $M = 1 1 0 . 5 0$ , $S D = 1 1 . 9 4$ , EG: $M = 1 1 5 . 2 7$ , $S D { = } 9 . 4 3$ , $t = - 1 . 5 2$ , $p \ = \ . 1 4$ . Therefore, the language proficiency of two groups was similar.

We then divided the participants into two different levels of language proficiency. Within each group, the participants who obtained scores higher than the mean score were labeled as having high language proficiency, and those with scores lower than the mean were labeled as having low language proficiency. Altogether 21 students (CG: $n = 1 1$ , EG: $n = 1 0 \mathrm { \ : }$ ) were labeled as ‘lower level’, whereas 27 students (CG: $n = 1 5$ , EG: $n = 1 2$ ) were labeled as ‘higher level’.

# 5.3.  Assessment

# 5.3.1.  Productive vocabulary proficiency

We deemed as part of a student’s productive vocabulary any word that the student can use to generate a series of both semantically and grammatically correct sentences on their own. Two activities were used to gauge students’ productive vocabulary proficiency in paragraph-writing: first, the learners were asked to write down the L1 translations of 10 target words; second, they were asked to write a paragraph (of around 100 to 150 words) that used these target words as many as possible. We carried out the paragraph-writing test three times: pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test, unexpectedly. The four tasks (Task 1, 2, 3, 4) and three tests (pre-test, post-test, delayed post-test) had the same grading criterion. One point was given if the learner accurately applied a word in a sentence with a correct L1 translation even if other parts of the sentence were wrong (Tahmasbi & Farvardin, 2017). Accordingly, the maximum score for each test was 10.

Blind scoring was used with two trained graders (the first author and an experienced IELTS instructor) scoring independently. The results were compared, and all disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached. Students’ writing was assessed across the ‘hits’ (i.e. the collocations with the proper target word produced). Specifically, the assessment took into consideration spelling (within the collocations), lexical aspects of grammar (within the collocations, i.e. part of speech, number and tense) and collocations. Taking collide as an example, if a student wrote ‘He collides with the boss over salary, because he thought it is too low,’ he or she would be awarded one point; although the student made a tense mistake in the latter part of this sentence, an accurate understanding of the meaning, form, and use of the target item was demonstrated. If there was a discrepancy between the raters, the item was reviewed until an agreement was made. Students from both groups did not receive any feedback from the tests.

# 5.3.2.  EG students’ perceptions of Applet 1.0

A self-report questionnaire was used to measure the EG students’ perceptions of the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge training. They were first asked to select ‘yes,’ ‘no,’ or ‘not sure’ for the following three items: ‘Do you think the training has helped you learn how to apply the target words?’ ‘Do you think you can still remember how to apply the target words after some time?’ and ‘Are you satisfied with the training?’ They were then asked to answer two open-ended questions: ‘What do you think are the benefits and drawbacks of the present training?’ and ‘Do you have any suggestions for the present training?’

# 5.4.  Procedure

One week before the experiment, the researcher gave instructions and explained the research purposes and research procedures to the two class teachers whose students were selected as participants. As the teaching schedules differed, the pre-test $( 3 0 \mathrm { m i n } )$ was carried out in class sessions on separate days of the same week (the post-test and the delayed post-test followed the same pattern). The researcher was present with the teachers during the pre-test and described the learning requirements to the participants. Over four subsequent weeks, the students in the CG learned with Applet 0.0 and the students in the EG with Applet 1.0. Furthermore, the students were required to finish a paragraph-writing task every week. A class monitor (i.e., an individual appointed by the teacher as the representative of the classroom) from each class collected all the tasks by the end of every Friday afternoon. A post-test was administered after the four-week trial. A delayed post-test was given two weeks later, following the practice of previous studies (e.g., Keating, 2008; Kim, 2008; Soleimani & Rahmanian, 2014, 2015). EG and CG followed the same procedure as above, with one exception: a questionnaire was distributed to the EG after the delayed post-test.

# 6.  Data analysis

We adopted two analytic approaches to answer the three research questions. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the quantitative data (pertaining to the first two research questions). An independent $t { \cdot }$ -test was conducted to compare the prior knowledge of the two groups. In the absence of significant differences in students’ language proficiency (assessed by Gaokao English test scores) and prior knowledge on the target words (checked by pre-test), a mixed $3 \times 2 \times 2$ Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted, with time (pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test) as a within-subject factor and group (CG and EG) and language proficiency level (lower and higher) as two between-subject factors. This test was conducted to identify (1) whether there was any difference between the groups in terms of productive vocabulary performance directly after the treatment (post-test) and two weeks after the treatment (delayed post-test) and (2) whether the students’ language proficiency level might have affected the improvement of productive vocabulary in either group. An independent t-test was run to compare whether there was a significant difference in the students’ four tasks. The alpha level was set at .05 for all tests and tasks. A thematic analysis was conducted to help us interpret the qualitative data for addressing the third research question. Braun and Clarke (2006) provided a detailed description of a trustworthy thematic analysis and a pragmatic, step-by-step approach for conducting such an analysis. The process of our qualitative analysis was as follows. First, we familiarized ourselves with the depth and breadth of the data by reading through the entire data set three times. Second, we noted our initial ideas. Specifically, we coded any interesting features in a systematic fashion, collating the raw data relevant to each code. Third, we kept detailed notes about the development and hierarchies of concepts and themes. We reviewed these potential themes, ascertaining whether they worked in relation to the coded extracts and the entire data set. Fourth, we confirmed the labels of the themes and generated clear definitions for each.

# 7  Results

# 7.1.  Research question 1

Is there a difference in productive vocabulary performance between the students in the experimental group (utilizing a WeChat-mediated ILH framework with glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge) and those in the control group (utilizing $^ a$ WeChat-mediated ILH framework without the glosses of vocabulary-use knowledge)?

The results of the pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Overall, we found that:

a. the productive vocabulary proficiency before the treatment was similar, EG: $M = . 2 8 .$ , $S D = . 8 4$ ; CG: $M = . 1 9$ , $S D = . 4 9$ , $\mathrm { t } = - \ . 4 6$ , $p = . 6 5$ ;   
b. both treatments led to effective word learning in the post-test (EG: $M = 7 . 5 2$ , $S D { = } 2 . 0 6$ ; CG: $M = 4 . 6 9$ , $S D { = } 2 . 5 7 $ ) and delayed post-test compared to the pre-test (EG: $M = 7 . 0 8$ , $S D { = } 2 . 1 0$ ; CG: $M = 4 . 1 9$ , $S D { = } 1 . 7 0 \rangle$ ), $F ( 2 , 8 8 ) = 2 5 4 . 0 1 $ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 8 5 ,$ ;   
c. there was a significant main effect of group, $F ( 1 , 4 4 ) = 4 4 . 8 3 , p <$ .001, $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 5 1$ ;   
d. there was a significant interaction between time and group, $F ( 2 ,$ $8 8 ) \ : = \ : 1 7 . 7 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 9$ , indicating that the EG significantly outperformed the CG in terms of improvement in productive vocabulary proficiency.

The effect size for mixed ANOVA was assessed by the partial eta squared (Pallant, 2020). The following benchmarks proposed by Plonsky and Oswald (2014) were adopted to interpret the practical significance: small $\ c = \ . 4 0$ , medium $\ c = . 7 0$ , and large $= 1 . 0 0$ . Therefore, the results suggested an almost large effect size for time $( \eta ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ . 8 5 )$ and a small to medium size for group $( \eta ^ { 2 } = . 5 1 )$ .

Moreover, the pairwise comparison of time within the groups (see Table 4) suggested a significant improvement of the two groups from the pre-test to the post-test and the delayed post-test (all $\hbar <$ .001), and substantial knowledge retention from the post-test to the delayed post-test (all $p > ~ . 0 5 )$ . Table 5 further confirmed that (a) there was no significant difference between groups in the pre-test $\left( p \ : = \ : . 6 5 \right)$ ; (b) EG students performed significantly better than CG students in the post-test and in the delayed post-test (all $ { p }  { < } \ . 0 0 1 )$ . To facilitate statistical comparison across groups, Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the clear superiority of the EG in the post-test and delayed post-test. For example, as Figure 4 illustrates, approximately $7 5 \%$ of the students’ scores in the CG were more than three points higher in the delayed post-test. By contrast, roughly $7 5 \%$ of students’ scores in the EG were more than six points higher, with some students achieving a perfect score of 10 points.

Table 6 shows the scores for the four assignment tasks across groups (all $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ ). From Table 6, we can conclude that when learning productive vocabulary with WeChat, there is an advantage for the ILH combined with vocabulary-use knowledge over the ILH alone for productive vocabulary performance.

# 7.2.  Research question 2

Do students’ language proficiency levels affect their productive vocabulary improvement differently in each group?

Table 3 shows no significant effect of level, $F ( 1 , \ 4 4 ) \ = \ 1 . 3 0$ , $p \ = \ . 2 6 .$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ , no significant interaction effect between group and proficiency level, $F ( 1 , \ 4 4 ) \ = \ . 2 2$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 6 4$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 1$ , no significant interaction effect between time and proficiency level, $F ( 2 , 8 8 ) = . 9 0 $ , $p = . 4 1$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2$ , and no significant interaction effect between time, group, and proficiency level, $F ( 2 , 8 8 ) = 1 . 1 9$ , $p = . 3 1$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ . These results indicate that there is no significant difference between students of different proficiency levels in the effects of the treatment on students’ productive vocabulary performance. In other words, the productive vocabulary improvement was generally similar between students of lower and higher language proficiency levels.

# 7.3.  Research question 3

What are the experimental group students’ perceptions of the ILH supplemented with vocabulary-use knowledge model? For example, what do they perceive as its benefits and drawbacks and what suggestions do they have for its improvement?

As mentioned above, the questionnaire contained three self-report items and two open-ended questions. We analyzed 25 questionnaires returned by students in the EG, with the following results. Eighty percent of students $\left( n = 2 0 \right)$ thought the present training helped them apply the target words better, and the other five were unsure. No students deemed the training useless. Interestingly, 18 students were unsure whether they could still remember how to apply these words over time, although the remaining seven students were confident that they would retain these productive vocabularies. No students considered it impossible that they would be able to apply the words. Finally, approximately $9 0 \%$ of the students $\scriptstyle ( n = 2 2 )$ were satisfied with the training, with three students selecting ‘not sure.’ There were no unsatisfied students.

Table 7 lists the students’ responses to the main benefits of the training. The most cited advantage was that it expanded their vocabulary size and helped them to efficiently acquire productive vocabulary knowledge.

Table 7. S ummary of the main benefits of the training from student responses.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Benefits</td><td>Descriptionse</td><td>Number of participants who. mentioned</td></tr><tr><td>Expands the vocabulary size</td><td>Enlarges students&#x27; vocabulary size</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Broadens the productive</td><td>Helps to apply the words and rectify</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>vocabularye Improves writing</td><td>some erroneous uses Enhances writing ability with.</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>advanced vocabularies Builds up students&#x27; confidence; Strengthens knowledge output</td><td>Each  3</td></tr></table></body></html>

As one student wrote, ‘The selected words are useful and are a little beyond my level, which makes me enjoy the training.’

Consistent with our prediction, another frequently mentioned benefit was that it helped the students to understand the proper use of vocabularies, increasing accuracy and rectifying misuse. A typical response was, ‘The glossed vocabulary knowledge helped me better apply the words rather than merely recognizing the words as before. I thought it was instrumental since it helped me retain the words longer.’

Some students mentioned that the training improved their writing, perhaps because of the initial selection of target words. Some advanced words were substitutes for simpler counterparts. For example, susceptible was provided with its fixed collocation be susceptible to, and the students noticed that this target word could appear in situations in which they had previously used effect. Hence, some improvement in their writing was plausible.

Other mentioned benefits included building up the students’ confidence and strengthening their knowledge output through immediate training. In summary, we concluded that the present training was a pleasant experience and was conducive to the students’ productive vocabulary performance.

Some drawbacks were also noted by the students (see Table 8). We found that the most often mentioned drawbacks were retention-related: six students reported that they still lacked confidence in knowledge retention while simultaneously acknowledging the benefits of the training. One student wrote, ‘I may forget them soon if I do not practice regularly.’ Additionally, four students remarked that the target words were demanding, complaining that the process was ‘painstaking.’ Another four students felt that the provided vocabulary knowledge was deficient and that they expected teachers to explain more related knowledge, such as derivative words or phonetic symbols. Two students also addressed problems with ‘short-term training.’ As one student wrote, ‘I think the present training is beneficial. However, it was too short, and I hope to learn all the important words this way.’

The students also provided some pertinent suggestions (see Table 9). Most of the students highlighted the notion of repetition. For instance, they expected teachers to test them frequently to give them cause to retrieve the words more often. Other students recommended the use of mnemonics, using the examples of some prevailing mnemonic styles, such as pictorial mnemonics (using animated pictures to describe a word) and keyword mnemonics (e.g., using homophonic words of L1 to memorize its L2 equivalents).

# 8.  Discussion

# 8.1.  Quantitative data (RQ1 and RQ2)

The first research question sought to determine the extent to which vocabulary-use knowledge, as measured through composition-writing tests, could complement the ILH in facilitating productive vocabulary performance, when learning productive vocabulary with WeChat. Our results indicate that both groups improved significantly after the treatment. Therefore, the findings add empirical strength to the claim that to reach productive mastery, EFL learners must practice vocabulary productively (Schmitt, 2019).

The findings presented here contradict those of some previous studies (e.g., Tahmasbi & Farvardin, 2017) that have observed a decline in productive vocabulary knowledge in the delayed post-test when students conducted paragraph-writing tasks (i.e., tasks with high IL). This discrepancy may be explained by the time-on-tasks variable. In Tahmasbi and Farvardin (2017) study, participants were asked to finish paragraph-writing tasks in $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . However, in the present study, time was not controlled. Controlling for time-on-tasks diminishes the effect of more involved vocabulary learning tasks (Webb, 2005). According to Hulstijn and Laufer (2001), time should not be considered as a separate variable but rather as an inherent property of a task. Therefore, we made no attempt to control for time, instead allowing students to use as much time as they needed to complete the paragraph-writing tasks.

Moreover, our quantitative findings strongly support the effectiveness of vocabulary-use knowledge, as we observed significantly superior performance of the EG over the CG in the post-test and delayed post-test and across the four tasks. The higher performance of the EG might be attributed to the extra attention given to the target items through more comprehensive glosses. Glosses accompanying the text not only improve text comprehension but also promote learners’ acquisition of the glossed words. A recent meta-regression analysis (Yanagisawa et  al., 2020) demonstrated that glossed reading led to significantly better vocabulary acquisition $( 4 5 . 3 \%$ and $3 3 . 4 \%$ on immediate and delayed post-tests, respectively) than non-glossed reading $( 2 6 . 6 \%$ and $1 9 . 8 \%$ ). This may be because glosses draw attention to words that might otherwise be overlooked by L2 learners (Boers et  al., 2017). When a more comprehensive gloss is provided, the number and duration of fixations on target words (as proxies of the amount of attention given to these words; Rayner, 1998) increases, resulting in better vocabulary acquisition and longer knowledge retention.

Table 9. S ummary of the main suggestions of the training from student responses.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Suggestions</td><td>Descriptions</td><td>Number of participants who mentioned</td></tr><tr><td>Repetitive tasks in the future</td><td>Teaches&#x27; frequent dictations or other compulsory tasks to help them retrieve the words</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Interesting mnemonics.</td><td>regularly Effective ways to memorize the words</td><td>4</td></tr></table></body></html>

In the more comprehensive glosses provided to the EG, explicit instructions were given to demonstrate the use of the target words. Consequently, the students in this group would have paid more attention to the grammatical functions, collocations, and constraints on the use of the target words. Given that most words have no constraints on use (Nation, 2001), we primarily elaborated on the importance of grammatical functions and collocations to facilitate productive vocabulary acquisition.

One of the conclusions reached by Nation (2001) was that knowledge of grammatical functions is often associated with language use because it is essential to know the grammatical category of a word to apply it accurately. For example, learners need to know that adhere is a verb and adherence is a noun to avoid an ungrammatical utterance, such as ‘We should adherence to the regulations.’ In the present study, we also provided basic ‘part of speech’ knowledge to the CG, but the productive vocabulary proficiency of this group still lagged that of the EG group. A possible explanation is that learners must understand, either implicitly or explicitly, the role that each part of speech plays in a sentence (Sasao, 2017). As novice learners might not be aware of how words are combined into a sentence, it is crucial to provide explicit instructions on the grammatical functions of words, especially to low-level learners. For instance, when we introduced adhere in Applet 1.0, we explicitly told learners that it ‘is an intransitive verb, so no objects can be added behind directly.’ By raising students’ awareness of the grammatical functions of the word, this information could help them to apply it accurately in free writing.

Collocation knowledge also plays a key role in the fluent production of language (Lu & Dang, 2023; Nation, 2001; Wu et  al., 2010). To move from receptive to productive vocabulary, students must learn a wide range of ways that words collocate. If learners memorize the collocations, they do not have to think about what words come next, at least for the words within the collocations (Sasao, 2017). Moreover, studies have indicated that collocations make utterances sound more natural or native-like (e.g., Boers et  al., 2006). For example, when students learned aptitude in Applet 1.0, they were made aware of the fixed collocation have an aptitude for. This knowledge will make it easier for them to produce both semantically and grammatically correct sentences.

With respect to the second research question, we found no significant difference between students of lower and higher language proficiency levels in the effects of the treatment on students’ productive vocabulary performance. It seems that the effect of the ILH (with or without vocabulary-use knowledge) on promoting productive vocabulary acquisition is not influenced by a learner’s language proficiency level. This finding also partially supports Hulstijn and Laufer (2001) assertion that less proficient learners can partake in the same involved tasks as higher-level students and in doing so can experience similar benefits for learning new vocabulary. Provided that a learner has reached a level of proficiency sufficient to complete basic tasks, they are likely to make progress by conducting tasks with high IL (Kim, 2008). In summary, our quantitative findings provide evidence that adding glosses regarding vocabulary-use knowledge can be a useful supplement to ILH and help students efficiently acquire productive vocabulary.

# 8.2.  Qualitative data (RQ3)

When reporting their progress in productive vocabulary, the students were most concerned about retention. They suggested that frequent tasks should be assigned to help them retain productive vocabulary. These findings support the idea that repetition (the number of times learners encounter an unknown word) affects how likely it is that students will learn a word successfully (Uchihara et  al., 2019; 2023). This kind of learning is usually incremental, beginning with form knowledge and gradually building to knowledge of form–meaning connections as a function of repetitions in various contexts. However, several empirical studies (e.g., Mohamed, 2018) have suggested that repeated exposure is not the only factor determining students’ learning performance. Therefore, future studies should examine how repetition interacts with the IL of various tasks (Yanagisawa & Webb, 2021).

We suggest some caution when interpreting this finding because of the possible effects of the difficulty of the materials. In the present study, the difficulty level of the target words was controlled by teachers who were familiar with their students’ vocabulary proficiency. One way to help low-level students understand difficult words is to relate them to familiar synonyms: for instance, when introducing the word spectacular, the instruction can inform the learners that the word functions similarly to great.

The students also mentioned that the provided gloss was still not enough. It is critical to underscore that we focused on the ‘use’ category of vocabulary knowledge in the present study. Future studies could consider using Nation’s (2001) complete framework by providing glosses on vocabulary meaning, form, and use. Moreover, as the students suggested, it is worth exploring mnemonics, which connect new learning to prior knowledge using visual or acoustic cues (Fasih et  al., 2018). Therefore, a pedagogical suggestion for instructors might be to introduce appropriate and interesting mnemonics to engage EFL learners during the dreary process of memorizing productive vocabulary. Finally, the students mentioned the short duration of the present study as another drawback. Hence, we recommend that future studies test the ILH with vocabulary-use knowledge in a longitudinal study spanning at least one year to observe the trends of student productive vocabulary performance over a longer period.

# 9.  Limitations and implications for future research

First, the quasi-experimental nature of the study might limit the generalizability of the findings (Ünal, 2023). In other words, participants in the present study were relatively homogeneous in terms of vocabulary proficiency, age, educational level, and cultural background. We suggest that future studies replicate our experiment by exploring how the ILH combined with vocabulary-use knowledge might affect the productive vocabulary proficiency of students with different background demographics. Furthermore, the sample size of the present study was relatively small, and future studies could consider obtaining more robust and reliable findings by using a larger sample.

The present study did attempt to reiterate one crucial stipulation of the ILH: that of ‘other factors being equal’ (Laufer & Hulstijn, 2001). When other factors, such as the provision of vocabulary-use knowledge, are manipulated differently across tasks, learning gains might not be consistent with the predictions of the ILH. Therefore, one way forward may be to reconsider the relationships between the ILH and other potential constructs. We suggest three directions that such a reconsideration might take.

First, as we suggest above, more encounters with the words might increase the likelihood of novel words being learned (Teng, 2023b). Future studies could therefore consider ascertaining how the number of times that learners meet or use the words in the ILH context contributes to productive vocabulary proficiency. Another noteworthy direction might be to explore a learning situation with a strong need $( \mathrm { N } { + } { + } )$ .

Although previous studies (e.g., Tang & Treffers-Daller, 2016; Yanagisawa & Webb, 2021) have demonstrated that the need component might significantly contribute to the effects of the ILH, there has been a paucity of research investigating a learning situation with a strong need. Given the far-reaching claims of the ILH, its theoretical implication for SLA research, and its pedagogical relevance for instructors, we suggest that more research be devoted to this domain.

Third, according to Nation and Webb (2011), Technique Feature Analysis (TFA) could be useful to expand ILH. Our present study focused on the ILH as it is the more established method than TFA. The findings of previous studies regarding the comparison of ILH and TFA models are inconclusive, and the dilemma of which of the two can better predict vocabulary learning remains (Ehsani & Karami, 2022). This is affirmed by notable figures in vocabulary learning studies as well (e.g., Laufer, 2019; Nation, 2013; Nation & Webb, 2011). Gohar et  al. (2018) concluded that both ILH and TFA were good predictors of vocabulary gains for the significant differences. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore how TFA can be used to enhance ILH in future studies.

# 10.  Conclusion

The practical value of ILH in productive vocabulary performances has been called into question many times, particularly its effect on students’ delayed post-test performance. It seems from the literature that the ILH is no longer the sole instrument for boosting productive vocabulary performance. The present study concludes that applications of the ILH can be bolstered with vocabulary-use knowledge (i.e., grammatical functions– the grammatical patterns that a word can fit into; collocations—other words that appear together with a word; and constraints on use—the situations in which a word is used) to significantly increase mobile-assisted language learners’ productive vocabulary knowledge for a longer period. We encourage future studies to examine other methods to improve and sustain students’ productive vocabulary performance.

Moreover, qualitative analyses (e.g., interviews) can enable researchers to discover facts that cannot be directly demonstrated, and thus yields a deeper understanding of a phenomenon from the participants’ point of view (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1993). Since only a limited number (e.g., Zou, 2017; Zou & Teng, 2023) of the extant ILH studies have included interview data, future studies could consider including these qualitative analyses to obtain a clear picture of the effectiveness and limitations of the treatment.

Last but not least, the present study found that glosses concerning vocabulary-use knowledge might direct learners’ attention to the target words, which resulted in better knowledge retention. Some other techniques, for example, captioned videos may also capture learners’ attention to unknown words (Teng, 2023a). Therefore, future ILH studies may consider including captioned videos or other attention-driven techniques in glosses to assist in productive vocabulary knowledge retention.

Moreover, we would thank the participants and teachers who have made valuable contributions to the present study. Last but not least, we would like to thank the editors of the CALL and all the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments in improving this research paper.
