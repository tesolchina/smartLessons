Negation L1 and L2 PhD theses Rhetorical functions Thesis writing

PhD theses have received considerable attention over years, playing a crucial role for PhD students to represent external realities and create writer-reader relations. To engage with alternative voices in textual interaction, PhD students produce their texts through the use of negation along with other interpersonal devices. Additionally, negation as an important rhetorical device performs both interactive and interactional functions. Nevertheless, little research has systematically investigated the use of negation in PhD theses across sections. Drawing on two corpora of students' theses, we therefore analyse the differences in the frequency, distribution, and function of negation between L1 and L2 PhD students. Results showed that both L1 and L2 PhD students tended to employ various negative markers across sections, especially in the results and discussion, literature review, methodology, and conclusion sections. However, L2 PhD students employed fewer negative markers than L1 PhD students. Additionally, in terms of functional uses, L2 PhD students employed fewer negative markers in both interactive and interactional dimensions across sections. The findings of this study enable a better understanding of the rhetorical functions of negation and provide some pedagogical implications for the instruction of PhD thesis writing.

# 1. Introduction

Central to sccessl reearch writing in a discilinary context i connecting what is said with readers, so writer seek to address the community's current topics of interest expresa credible voice on research findings, and craft a social alignment with who is addressed. Therefore, a convincing argument is the result of writers efforts to control the level of personality in their texts, therey "claiming solidarity with readers, evaluating their material, and acknowledging alternative views" (Hyland, 2005, p. 173). The rhetorical abilit to achieve this social interaction is now seen as both a key feature of research writing and an important element of advanced academic literacy (Jiang & Ma, 2018; Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Milton, 1997; Koutsantoni, 2006; Loghmani et a., 2020).

As a consequence, a growing number of studies examine the way research postgraduate students draw on linguistic resources to provide a compelling display of knowledge clams and findings in thesis writing (Wang & Jiang, 2018; Loghmani et al., 2020; Su et al. 2022). For example, Geng and Wharton (2016) compared the way Chinese and English PhD writers engage with other voices through the use of evaluative language while Dong et al. (2023) invesigated the epistemic stances made by science PhD students in academic writing. One important feature which remains underexplored, however, i the use of negation by PhD students to build disciplinary interaction in thesis writing. As presenting something nonexistent in physical reality, negation is a marked linguistic option, \*projecting a mental world in which users anticipate a likely response from an interlocutor' (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, p. 61). Through negation, therefore, we can see how student writers introduce \*the alternative positive position into the dalogue, and hence acknowledging it, so as to reject it' (Martin & White, 2005, p. 118).

Therefore, this study sees to remedy the oversight by exploring the form and function of negation by L1 and L2 PhD students and analysing the usef nation across neric sctions oranistional chapters in ther thesis writing. he contrastive lingistic analysis across the writer groups wil provide pedagogical implications for the teaching of English for academic and research purposes.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. PhD thesis writing

There is increasing scholarly interest given to the disciplinary linguistic features of PhD thesis (e.g., Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Paltridge & Starfield, 2020a; Qiu & Ma, 2019; Wu & Palridge, 2021). Working with such a key genre of academic writing, PhD students are expected to present their arguments in a way the readers find credible and persuasive (Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022b). However, PhD students are found to grapple with a plausible presentation of research work (Bitchener & Basturkmen, 2006), confronting it as one f the concretised peformance hurdes' in their learning of the academic ropes (Cadman, 2002, p. 88). Therefore, PhD students and the instructors of thesis writing wil benefit from a beter understanding of the way an inclusive rlationship with readers is crafted and a clearer awareness of how negation contributes to this rhetorical work.

Linguistic analyses of PhD theses are mainly concerned with aspects of metadiscourse resources such as metadiscursive nouns, engagement, and stance (e.g., Abdollahzadeh, 2019; Dong et al., 2023; Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Jiang & Ma, 2018; Loghmani et al., 2020; Qiu & Ma, 2019; Wu & Palridge, 2021). The literature also tends to focus on a specific generic section, such as the abstract (Hyland & Tse, 2005), itroduction (Samraj, 2008; Sun & Crosthwaite 2022a), discussion (Geng & Wharton, 2016; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022b), and litrature review sections (Kwan, 2006; Thompson, 2009; Xie, 2016). However, the rhetorical complexity of linguistic choices can be best unraveled if examined across the generic sections, since each represents a local communicative context with distinctive propositional intention and content. A cross-sectional comparison can reveal the paterns in the way students make meaning and craft interpersonal relationships.

Another salient feature of the literature on PhD thesis writing is the comparative approach adopted. On the one hand, PhD and MA students are compared in order to see the developmental pattern of rhetorical language use by postgraduate students. For instance, Hyland (2004) compared the distribution and functions of metadiscourse markers in MA and PhD theses, and demonstrated that PhD students employed more discourse-organising forms but fewer interactional markers (such as hedges, boosters, and attitude markers) than MA students. Qiu and Ma's (2019) comparative analysis concurred with thi overal dierence, but a more rcent study by Wu and Paltridge (2021) showed that PhD students employed more stance expressions in their theses than MA students.

On the other hand, however, a more viable comparison is typically made between L2 and L1 PhD student writers since Xu and Nesi (2019) suggest that native language culture exercises an impact on the position the writer takes towards propositions and the readers. To illustrate, Geng and Wharton's (2016) investigated the use of evaluative expressions in the discussion section of PhD theses and found certain difference between L1 Chinese and L1 English PhD students. Whil comparing the use of hedges and boosers between Chinese PhD students and published writers, Dong et al. (2023) indicated that the confucious culture influences the rhetorical investment made by Chinese PhD students in academic texts.

# 2.2. Negation in academic writing

Expressig "semantic opposition, negation marks \*the opposite of something or an absence of something" (Sinclair et al, 2017, p. 648) and typiclly take i either affixal and non-afixal forms (Tottie 191). The former is marked by the presence of a negatie affix (e.g., non, dis, un-), while th atter is attained either by negating the exical verb or auxiliary (1), or by negating non-verbal constituents (2). There theentire proposition is denied or rejected, with the negative scope extending from the negative form to the end of the clause. hus the ltter i rfered o s clasal ation, which prents  dirt way f expressing anegatie sttment ier t al., 1999; Tottie, 1991).

(1) The temporal measure results did not show a rate increase between Xu's failed and passed performances. L1 PhD thesis)) (2) It would be a much more accurate reflection of what Chomsky terms competence, but not a reflection of communicative competence.(L2 PhD thesis)

There has been a wealth of research on clausal negation, either from a typological (Miestamo, 2005), argumentative (Apotheloz et al., 193) or natural language rocessing persective (Morante & Blanco, 2021). While the literature reveals aspects of propositional logic, structural and pragmatic use of negation, more studies are warranted especiall in terms of the discourse semantic functions it performs (Don, 2017; Jiang & Hyland, 2022), taking negation as "a dialogic contraction resource for introducing altenative positions into dialogue so as to deny or reject them" (Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, p. 3).

As a dialogic resource, negation serves to negotiate interpersonal meanings and build academic persuasion while presenting writers' arguments in writing (Herriman, 2009; Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023). Jiang and Hyland (2022) examined the frequency, forms, and functions of negation in research abstracts across disciplines over the recent decades. The use of negation was shown to decrease in research abstracts diachronicall, although sugesting significant disciplinary differences even betwen soft knowledge fields of linguistics and sociology. Investigating negation used by linguists in academic prose, Webber (2004) found that negative expressions function in both intra and extra textual dimensions to introduce writers opposing views. Taken together, the findings of these studies showed the importance of negation in presenting their arguments and authorial voices.

Moreover, the rhetorical use of negation is also found pertinent to social and cultural contexts. Sun and Crosthwaite (2022a) suggested certain disciplinary variation, but it is more interesting that Herriman (2019) showed Swedish advanced learners used negation more frequently than British students while Geng and Wharton (2016) found an insignificant difference between English and Chinese thesis writer in the use of isclaim markers including negation. Both of them attributed the variation to a different degree of engaging with other voices between L1 and L2 student writers. On the other hand, Xu and Nesi (2019) pointed out variations between Chinese and British writers in the way that writers disclaim alternative positions, proclaim authors stances and entertain possible voice. Therefore, more data-supported analys can help to unpack the different use f ngation y L1 and 2 writers to achieve certain rhetorical purposes.

Overall, despite the increasing interest in negation in academic writing as aforementioned, almost no study has systematically investigated the use of negation in L1 (English) and L2 (Chinese) PhD students' thesis writing to date. Therefore, this study sets out to explore how neation i used by 1 and 2 PhD students in their thees across sections, and specifially, answer the following research questions.

1. What forms and functions of negation characterise PhD thesis writing?   
2. How does the use of negation vary across generic sections?   
3. To what extent does the above use of negation differ between L1 and L2 PhD students?

# 3. Data and analysis

# 3.1. Corpora

To compare the use of negation between L1 and L2 PhD theses in terms of frequency, distribution and functions, two corpora were built of a total of $2 0 \mathrm { P h D }$ theses in applied linguistics completed in the years of 2018-2021, half written by Chinese students collected from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) PhD thesis database and the other by American students from ProQuest Dis. sertations & Theses.Considering the potential influence of research topics and paradigms on the interpersonal language use in applied linguistics papers (Hyland & Jiang, 2022), we included half of the theses primarily using a quantitative approach and the other using a qualitatie approach, and our judgement was made with reference to the abstracts, research questions and methods stated in the theses.

We identified students as Chinese or American by referring to their full names, educational plus other general background information which can mostly be found in the acknowledgements sections of PhD theses. Our identification is further confirmed by two native speakers from each language background. Furthermore, we only included the theses wrtten in English by Chinese PhD students given the fact that it is optional for PhD students in applied linguistics in China to complete their theses in either English or Chinese.

Under the intitutional requirements of Chinese universties, PhD candidate in applied linguistics must have passed either the Test for English Majors Band 8, the College English Test Band 6 (with a score higher than 590), TOEFL (higher than 100), IELS (higher than 7) or GRE (higher than 280),2 and the required language proficiency is roughly equivalent to the C2 level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages in terms of writing aessment (Wang et al, 2017), so the candidate could be considered to be at an upper level of English proficiency. We therefore regarded both groups of authors as sharing \*comparabledisciplinary expertise" (Tribble, 2017, p. 34).

The selected theses were then converted into plain texts using AntFileConverter (Anthony, 2022), with the tables and figures, acknowledgments and appendices removed. Following Paltridge and Starfield (2020b), we divided each thesis into the generic sections f abstract, inroduction, literatre review, methodology, reults and discussin, and conclusion with refeence to the (sub-heading of each section. The descriptive corpus statistics are summarised in Table 1. English theses by Chinese PhDs in applied linguistics are normally not required to be prooread by anative peaker (Xie, 2005), so the two corpora are plausibly representative of the language use by two groups of student writers.

# 3.2. Data analysis

Using AntConc (Anthony, 2020), we searched for 17 typical negative markers (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023) in the corpora (see

Table 1 Description of the corpora.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>L2 PhD Corpus</td><td>L1 PhD Corpus</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>489825</td><td>457520</td></tr><tr><td>Abstract</td><td>7822</td><td>3120</td></tr><tr><td>Introduction</td><td>41925</td><td>37303</td></tr><tr><td> Literature Review</td><td>155044</td><td>123777</td></tr><tr><td> Methodology</td><td>89329</td><td>66585</td></tr><tr><td>Results and Discussion</td><td>162444</td><td>166865</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusion</td><td>33261</td><td>59870</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2), and then manually checked each concordance to ensure that the rerieved instance was functioning as negation (according t the model above), excluding extraneous cases (such as yes and no questions).

Following Jiang and Hyland (2022), we categorised each instance of negation as to an interpersonal model of academic interaction. This model ees the rhetorical use of negation in both interactive and interactional dimensions as shown in Fig. 1. More pecifically, the former focuses on the coherence of text elements, which divides negative expressions into comparison, addition, and consequence, while the later concerns the writer-reader relations, which divides negative expressions into hedging, boosting, and affect.

In the interactive catries, comparison means making a contrast between elements in the text (e., sth is . but ot), \*ddition means adding elements in an argument (e., not only .. but also), and "consequence means showing something is not the outcome of a study (e.g., not show) (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, p. 62-63). In the interactional categories, \*hedging means limiting the force of a statement (e few), oostin means emphassing the expressieforce (eg, never), andffect means preenting writers attitudes" (e.g., not clear) (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, p. 63). Writers are likely to use these negative expressions to show the opposite meaning of a proposition, make their arguments, and present their persuasive goals..

The authors worked separately and coded the instances of negation in the two corpora acording to the interpersonal model Jiang & Hyland, 2022), and achieved a high inter-rater agreement of $9 7 \%$ in the interactional uses and $9 8 \%$ in the interactive uses of negation. To compare the use of negation in L1 and L2 PhD theses, the raw frequencies of negative markers were normalised to 10,000 words, and we used the log-likelihood (LL) test to determine statistical significance (Rayson, 2016).

# 4. Results

This section presents the frequency, distribution, and functions of negation identified in L1 and L2 PhD theses within the inter. personal model of negation.

# 4.1. Forms and functions of negative markers

On the whole, there are a total of 5766 cases of negation in L1 and L2 PhD theses, amounting to 60.87 cases per 10,000 words. The result shows that both 1 and L2 PhD students tend to employ numerous negative markers in their theses. Table 3 presents the distribution of the negative markers used in the corpora, and demonstrates that not, no, few, litl, never are the five most frequent.

The result largely concurs with what Jiang and Hyland (2023) found in research abstracts. Not and no are the default options of negative statments (Biber et l., 199; Carter et al., 2011), and few and ittl help to express what Larsen-Freman and Cece-Murcia (2016) refer to as reduced intensity and non-prominent pitch' towards the accompanying message, and \*mitigate disagreement presumably with the goal of maintaining social harmony" (p. 198). This functional usage may suggest the frequent use of these four negative markers.

However, the relatively high frequency of never in the corpora is striking. Never is typically used \*to say that something was not or will not ever be the case", and \*emphasize the negatie aspect of a statement (Carte e al., 2011 p.656). Such a boosting marker was reported to rarl occur in the abstracts f rearch articles (Jiang & Hyland, 2023), so the frequent occurrence in our corpora indicates a dfferent discursive practce by the novice reearchers in the field. While ffering writers certain sytactc flexibilit f usage(Carer et al., 2011), this propositional emphasis may pose the risk of making an overstatement and shut down the negotiating voices from readers as seen in examples (3) and (4).

(3) When the behavior of system is defined by a strange attractor, the trajectory of the system never repeats and thus the samestate is never assumed twice. (L1 PhD thesis) (4) However, up till now, intercultural and cultural theories has never been taken into consideration.(L2 PhD thesis)

Table 4 shows the frequency of interactive and interactional uses of negation in the overall corpus. As shown in Table 4, negation o interactive uses is the most frequently used by L1 and L2 PhD students, accounting for $6 4 . 5 7 \%$ of the total functional uses, showing a focus on the flow of coheret discourse. Inrestingly, the oportion of ntion f intrctional us is les than intractive nes, only comprising $3 5 . 4 3 \%$ of the total functional uses. This result indicated that both L1 and L2 PhD students are likely to employ more interactive features than interactional ones in their theses, functioning to construct discourse more coherently.

As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2, the most frequent sub-category in the corpus is consequence, which constitutes $4 3 . 4 4 \%$ of all interactive uses, eflecting the importance f aserting the effct or outcome in academic writing (5) and (6). There is also a great deal of hedges in the corpus, comprising $2 1 . 0 2 \%$ of all interactional uses, helping writers make their arguments more acceptable (Jiang & Hyland, 2022) as shown in (7) and (8). The least commonly used negation is affect, accounting for only $4 . 5 3 \%$ of all interactional uses, indicating that writers are less likely to express their attitudes about propositions as shown in (9) and (10).

# 4.2. The use of negation across generic sections

Table 5 shows the distribution of negative markers in L2 and L1 PhD theses across generic sections. The normed frequency suggests that the sectional sequence in the use of nagation relative to each corpus i the results and discusson, conclusion, literature review, methodology, introduction and abstract, but the percentage shows the sectional ratiof occurrence to the total use of negative expressions and thus ffers a better presentation of how students manoeuvre the interpersonal resources across the different local communicative contexts. As shown by the percentage f the total in Tables 5 and in the L2 PhD theses, negative markers were the most frequently used in the results and discussion, sequentiall followed by literature review, methodology, conclusion, inroduction and abstract. However, L1 PhD students used negative markers most frequently in the results and discussion, and then in literature review, conclusion, methodology, introduction and abstract.

These findings are in line with previous studies (e.g, Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, 2022b), which found that negative markers were frequent in the results and discussion, literature review, conclusion, and introduction sections, whereas they were les frequent in the abstract. Nevertheless the proportional use of negation was also highly evident in the methodology section in the current study, especily by the L2 PhD students. Aseen i examples (11) and (12) this suggsts theforts students tend to invest to elaborate the approaches and analyses used in their studies as much as possible (Dong et al., 2023.

(11) Data analysis is not asimple description of the data collected but a proces by which the researcher bings hs own interpretation to the data. (L2 PhD thesis)   
(12) The level of complexity and completeness of data sought i ths study could not be adequately addressed by Q sorting alone. (L2 PhD thesis)

Additionally, Table 6 shows the functional uses of negation acrossections employed by L2 and L1 PhD students. Both L2 and L1 PhD students made the most use of interactive and interactional negations in the results and discussion, sequentiall followed by literature review, methodology, introduction, conclusion, and abstract sections. The findings of this study are in line with previous studies in which interpersonal markers were highly distributed in the discussion and iterature review sections (e.g., Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; 202b). Nevertheless it i surprising to find the functional uses of negation are highly evident in the methodology section.

# 4.3. Differences in the use of negation between L1 and L2 PhD students

In all there are total of 2457 cases of negation in L2 PhD theses, amounting to 50.16 cases per 10,000 words, whereas there are a total of 3309 cases of negation in L1 PhD theses, averaging 72.32 cases per 10,000 words. The log-likelihood test shows that there was a significant difference in the use of negation between L2 and L1 PhD theses $( L L = 1 9 1 . 1 9 $ A $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). The results indicate that L1 PhD students are likely to use significantly more negation in their theses than L2 PhD students.

We found similar patterns in the use of negation in L2 and L1 PhD theses acros generic sections. Compared withL1 PhD students

L2 PhD students employed significantly fewer negative markers in the introduction, literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and conclusion sections (introduction: $L L = 2 1 . 1 9$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; literature review: $L L = 7 6 . 1 8$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; methodology: $L L =$ 17.84, $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; results and discussion: $L L = 4 0 . 1 0 , p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; conclusion: $L L = 1 3 . 2 0$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ , although the low frequency in the abstract section is not significant. The results demonstrate that 1 PhD students made far more use of negation than L2 PhD students.

Table 7 shows the distribution of functional uses of negation in L2 and L1 PhD theses. L2 PhD students employed significantly fewer negation of intractive uses, and slightly fewer negation of interactional features than 1 PhD students. Specificall, in the interactie categories, L2 PhD students employed significantly fewer comparisons and consequences, whereas they made slightly more use of additions. In the interactional categorie, 2 PhD students employed fewer hedges and afect, whereas they used more boosters in their theses. The finding of this results indicated that L1 PhD students were likely to make more functional uses of negation in terms of subcategories.

Furthermore, the functional uses of negation were diffrently distributed across generic sections in L2 and L1 PhD theses as shown in Table 6. In the abstract L2 PhD students only employed more additions compared with L1 PhD students. In the introduction, L2 PhD students employed more additions and bosters, whereas L1 PhD students made far more use of comparisons, consequences, hedges, and affects. In the literature review, L2 PhD students employed more boosters, whereas L1 PhD students made far more use of comparisons, additions, consequences, hedges, and affects. In the methodology, L2 PhD students employed more boosters and affects whereas L1 PhD students used more comparisons, additions, consequence, and hedges. In the results and discussion, L2 PhD students employed more aditions, boosters, and affects, whereas 1 PhD students used significantly more comparisons, consequences, and hedges. In the conclusion, L2 PhD students also used more additions, boosters, and affcts than L1 PhD students. These results demonstrate that L1 PhD students were likely to make more functional uses of negation in terms of subcategories. Additionally, it seems that L2 PhD students were likely to use more boosters in their theses.

# 5. Discussion

This study investigates the frequency, distribution, and functions of negation in L1 and L2 PhD theses. Drawing on the interpersonal model of negation proposed by Jiang and Hyland (2022), this study found that there were ignificant differences in the use f negation between1 and L2 PhD theses. More specifically, 1 PhD students were inclined to employ significantly more negative markers than L2 PhD students across sections, especiall in the results and discussion, literature review, and methodology sections. Furthermore, the results indicate that both L1 and L2 PhD students were likely to make more interactive uses of negation than interactional ones. Additionall, L1 PhD students tended to use more negation in both interactive and interactional dimensions than L2 PhD students. The following section discusses some potential reasons for less use of negation in L2 PhD theses.

In response to our first research question, this study found that both L1 and L2 PhD students tended to make aremarkable use of negation in their theses. The finding of this study is in line with previous studies (e.g., Loghmain et al., 2020; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; 2022b). Additionally, our study revealed that both L1 and L2 PhD students employed more interactive negation than inter. actional ones, helping them focus more on the coherence of text. The result supports the findings of an overrliance on interactive features in academic writing (e.g, Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023). While previous studies have focused on different academic genres and types of metadiscourse markers, all studies indicate that writers made far more use of interactive markers than interactional ones.

In terms of subcategories, more interactive than interactional negative markers were used, with the most frequent use to construct consequences in the thees. According to Jiang and Hyland (2022), \*consequenes refer to something th i not an outcome or effect of an argument (p.63) functioning to represent student writers attempts to build their arguments. Also, hedges are also frequently used in both 1 and L2 PhD theses, reflecting the importance of limiting the force of propositions (Jiang & Hyland, 2022) and the preference for presenting the information as an opinion rather than a fact (Hyland, 1998). Additionall, the more use of hedges in both L1 and L2 PhD theses indicates that PhD students prefer to make their arguments more aceptable. Then, dditions, comparisons, and boosters are frequent in both L1 and L2 PhD theses. The findings of this study support previous research by Wang and Jiang (2018) in which Chinese PhD students were likely to use more hedges and boosters in their reearch articles than expert writers indicating that they would like toassert their certainty or uncertainty about aproposition. Additionall, a greater use of additions and comparisons helps writers construct coherent discourse and understand textual connections (Jiang & Hyland, 2022). Finally, afects are not frequently used in both L1 and L2 PhD theses. The result is consistent with the findings of Jiang and Hyland's (2022) study. This might be explained by writers' preference for presenting their arguments more implicitly (Martin & White, 2005).

Our second research question investigates the use of negation across generic sections. The results show that both L1 and L2 PhD students were inclined to employ more negative markers in their thees across eneric sections, especialy in the reults and discussion and literature review sections. The findings of this study are in line with earlier studies which also found a considerable amount of negation in the results and discussion and itrature review sections (e.g., Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; 2022b). The preference for the use of negation within these two sections may be attributed to two possible reasons.

On the one hand, the mean lengths of these two sections are longer than the other sections, suggesting a greater use of negation. On the other hand, these two sections are more characterised by a strong interaction with the disciplinary literature than the other sections, and tend to redres or extend what previous studies have claimed and suggested. Both L1 and L2 PhD students, therfore are likely to use nation more frequenly in the results and diussion and literure reie ections. Addioaly, it i intresting to find that negation is also frequently used in the methodology section. The methodology section ofen presents caveats about writers methods through the functional uses of negation (e.g., consequences and hedges) asserting the proposition to convince readers and strengthen the certainty of the proposition. The use of negation, therefore is also evident within the methodology section of L1 and L2

PhD theses.

In response to our third research question, this study found asignificant difference in the use of negation between 1 and L2 PhD students. It is also not surprising to find that L1 PhD students made far more use of negative markers in their theses than L2 PhD students, such as not, no, few, itl, and never. This finding is in line with previous studies which focused on other types of meta discourse markers (e.g., Hyland, 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Su et al., 2022; Wu & Paltridge, 2021). L1 PhD students employed varied metadiscourse markers more frequently in their theses than L2 PhD students, helping them represent external realities and create writer-reader rlations (Hyland, 2005). As noted above, negation as an unfamiliar rhetorical devicealso plays a critical role in making writers arguments and introducing authorial voices (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023). Moreover, a greater use of metadiscourse markers in theses is thought to represent language development (Hyland, 2004). Therefore, L1 PhD students with higher language proficiency levels and more academic experience are ikely to use significantly more negative markers in their theses than L2 PhD students.

Our findings also showed that there was no significant difference in the interactional uses of negation between L1 and L2 PhD students, indicating that these students were also concerned with creating writer-reader interaction. To summarise, both L1 and L2 PhD students made frequent use of negation in their theses, helping them produce coherent discourse, make their arguments, and project persuasive goals.

Furthermore, this study found that L1 PhD students tended to employ more negative markers than L2 PhD students in their theses across sections, such as the inroduction, literature review, methodology, resuls and discussion, and conclusion sections. As noted above, negation plays a key role in making writers' arguments and introducing authorial voices (Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023). Therefore, 1 PhD students with higher language proficiency levels are likely to use significantly more ngative markers in thir theses than L2 PhD students, helping them make their arguments, introduce authorial oices, and create writer-reader relations. To sum up, given the differences in language proficiency levels and academic writing experience, i is not surprising to find that there is a sig nificant dffernce in the use of ngation between1 and 2 PhD students. Adtionally, this study indcates that nation is frequently used to present unexplored grounds in the literature review, results and discussion, methodology, and conclusion sections.

Finally, our study found that there were significant ifferences in some subcategories of negation across generic sections between L1 and L2 PhD theses,especilly in the results and discussion, litrature review, methodology, and conclusion sections. The finding may be explained by the fact that 1 PhD students tend touse numerous negative markers within these sections to support their claims and compare results to earlier research. However, L2 PhD students used slightly more comparisons, additions, consequences, and hedges in the abstract. This result demonstrated that L2 PhD students used fewer functional uses of negation in their theses across sections than L1 PhD students. Therefore, L2students need to be more aware of the rhetorical role of negation in shaping a persuasive PhD thesis.

# 6. Conclusion

This study investigated the diffrences in the frequency, distribution, and functions of negation between L1 and L2 PhD students. The findings of this study showed that both L1 and L2 PhD students were likely to employ negation in their theses across sections, especially in the results and discussion, iterature review, methodology, and conclusion sections. Furthermore, L1 PhD students used far more neation compared with L2 PhD students in their thees acros generic sections. As for functional use of negation, while both L1 and L2 PhD students were likely to use interactive and interactional negation in thir theses, L1 PhD students made more use of negation in both interactive and interactional dimensions. Finll, L2 PhD students were more likely to employ more boosters across sections compared with L1 PhD students. Our findings indicate that L2 PhD students were likely to underuse negation in their theses across sections compared with L1 PhD students.

This current study makes several important contributions concerning the use of negation i students theses produced by L1 and L2 PhD students. First, the findings of the present study enable a comprehensive understanding of the use of negation in postgraduate theses across sections. In particular, previous research investigated the use of negation within speific sections of research artices or students' theses, whereas this study found that both L1 and L2 PhD students were likely to make more use of negation in their theses across sctions to make ther arguments and present authorial voies. Second, this study support the findings of previous studies (e., Jiang & Hyland, 2022, 2023; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, 2022b), which found that negation was frequently used in academic writing. This finding suggests that negation may be a prominent linguistic resource for presenting writers authorial voices. Third, the present study reports that the frequency and functional uses of negation are far more frequent in L1 PhD theses compared with L2 PhD theses suggesting that L2 PhD students underuse negation during postgraduate education. In summary, the present study investigates the differences of negation in frequency, distribution, and functions betwen 1 and L2 PhD theses, which will make it easier for teachers and learners to identify the current knowledge of negation uses in postgraduate theses. Additionall, ths study offers a better un. derstanding of the distribution of negation in L1 and L2 PhD theses acrossections, providing some implications for the practice of negation during thesis writing instruction.

These findings also have several implications for academic writing instruction. Teachers should focus more on the use of negation because an increase in the use of rhetorical devices is thought to represent language development (Hyland, 2004). First, teachers should offer more varied negative markers and ass students in understanding the functional uses of negation in academic writing (Jiang & Hyland, 2022). Second, teachers should guide students in using more negative markers in their theses to make their argu. ments and perform persuasive goals. To conclude, this study suggests that teachers should focus more on the use of negation during thesis writing instruction.

Although this study provides important findings for the use of negation in L1 and L2 PhD theses, this study also has several limitations. First, this study only collected a smal sample size of L1 and L2 PhD theses to investigate the use of negation in PhD theses. It would be informative to investigat the usef negation in PhD thees with a larger sample sie. Second, this study merely compared the differences in the use of negation in PhD theses in applied inguistc. It would be useful to compare the differences in the use of negation in PhD theses across disciplines, since this would unveil the influence of disciplinary cultures on the way that alternative positions are engaged and rejected in the production of knowledge In addition, apart from language proficiency, cultural and social factors may aloplay a role in shaping the way ngation is used in reech writig. Future rerch that full addresses the concens, therefore, will shed more light on the area of negation research in academic writing.
