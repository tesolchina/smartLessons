# Abstract

There are abundant studies of second/foreign language learning motivation. However, there appears to be insufficient research into how language learners’ discourses mediate the construction of their learning/motivation. This paper investigated the discursive construction of two English language learners’ motivation in a comprehensive university in the People’s Republic of China. Employing a critical discourse analysis framework, this paper illustrated how learner motivation was discursively constructed in the constant interaction between the individual and the social environment, and through a complex process involving learners’ interpersonal relationships, their imaginative projections about the future, and an alignment with social discourses. The paper argues for more discourse-based studies that view motivation as a social and historical construct dynamically emerging from individual learners’ interaction with contextual conditions and construed in learners’ language in use. This paper starts by locating this study within the L2 motivation literature and then provides an interpretation of the interview and diary study texts in light of the sociocultural context where the investigation occurred.

# 1. Introduction

English language learning motivation, often assumed to be a vital factor in determining learning effect, constitutes an important topic for exploration in the context of Mainland China. China’s Reform and Open Door policy propelled the country into an era of widespread English language learning and teaching, and its successful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games and entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2000 have fueled the English learning fever even further. Since the 1980s, China has been home to the largest number of English language learners in the world, a number now estimated at between 200 and 350 million, almost equal to the total number of English speakers in the USA (Yang, 2006). English has accelerated and strengthened the process of social reform and cultural assimilation; its spread and penetration into the Chinese context has been intimately linked to individuals’ development and career prospects (Thøgersen, 2002; Zhang, 2003).

Second language learning motivation is believed to be one of the most important determinants in L2 learning. Motivation is viewed as a dynamic, situated and social construct (e.g., Do¨rnyei, 1998; Norton, 2000), and closely related to learners’ identity construction (e.g., Do¨ rnyei, 2005; Gardner, 2000; Noels et al., 2001; Norton, 2000; Gao et al., 2007). Therefore, China, a country that has a national enthusiasm for learning English and is currently experiencing dramatic economic, social and cultural changes, becomes an ideal place in which to investigate the social and dynamic nature of English language learners’ motivation and identity formation.

This paper draws on a qualitative case study of the English language learning experiences of two Chinese college students, and investigates how the learners construct their differing motivations as they interact with different levels of contexts such as the immediate learning community and the broader social milieu. A critical discourse analysis framework, founded upon ‘‘the assumption that language is an irreducible part of social life, dialectically interconnected with other elements of social life”, and cognizant of the fact that ‘‘social analysis and research always has to take account of language” (Fairclough, 2003, p. 2), is utilized to explore the mediating role of language in motivation construction in this study. It is important to note that discourse, a notion widely used across different disciplines, in this paper refers to a ‘‘[way] of signifying experiences from a particular perspective” (Fairclough, 1993, p. 138), and is an important form of social practice that ‘‘both reproduces and changes knowledge, identities and social relations including power relations, and at the same time is also shaped by other social practices and structures” (Phillips and Jorgensen, 2002, p. 65).

# 2. Literature review

Second language motivation has attracted much research effort. The social–psychological and cognitive approaches focus on the relationship between learners’ individual traits or internal factors within L2 motivation and the learning outcomes (e.g., Gardner and Lambert, 1972; Gardner, 1985, 2000, 2001; Gardner and MacIntyre, 1993a,b; Noels et al., 2000). To establish the relationship between motivation and specific learning contexts, researchers working with situated approaches have examined the contextual influences of classroom language learning on motivation (e.g., Do¨rnyei, 1994, 2002; Do¨rnyei and Otto, 1998; Do¨rnyei and Csizer, 2002; Oxford and Shearin, 1994; Williams and Burden, 1997). In an effort to highlight the relationship between individual learners and the social context, sociocultural and poststructuralist researchers (e.g., Gu, 2008; Norton, 2000; Norton and Toohey, 2001; Pavlenko and Norton, 2007; Ushioda, 2001, 2007) have addressed the social influences on motivation and particularly the interaction between the individual and the social in learners’ motivation development.

Norton (2000) argues that motivation needs to be understood with reference to the social context as well as learners’ multiple and changing identities. Norton (2000) defines identity as ‘‘how a person understands his or her relationship to the world, how that relationship is constructed across time and space, and how the person understands possibilities for the future” (p. 5). The notion of identity helps reveal the relationship between the language learner and the social world, and the learner’s changing motivation in learning a second/foreign language. Drawing on the concept of ‘imagination’, researchers (Kanno and Norton, 2003; Norton, 2001) further argue that a language learner’s imagined membership in the L2 community might produce a related imagined identity. According to Norton and Gao (2008, p. 114), L2 learners’ imagined community not only ‘‘offers possibilities for an enhanced range of identity options in the future”, but may also be ‘‘a reconstruction of past communities and historically constituted relationships”. Therefore, a learner’s imagined communities and identities shadow his/her relationship with English and influence his/her motivation.

The above review indicates that some aspects in motivation research could be developed further. To compensate for the perceived weaknesses of the social psychological perspective, in which motivation is regarded as ‘an individual trait’ and the identified sub-components of motivation tested for their accuracy, correlations and causal relationships (e.g., Spolsky, 2000; Ushioda, 2001), researchers adopting sociocultural and poststructural approaches have made efforts to investigate the contextual and social dimensions of L2 learners’ motivation. However, as a mechanism by which social and cultural factors impact individuals through language (Fairclough, 2003), the notion of discourse has not yet been given sufficient attention in motivation research. Kalaja and Leppa¨nen’s (1998) theoretical paper argues the case for a discursive social psychological approach to L2 motivation in order to gain insights into the ways in which L2 learners ‘‘display and negotiate in speech or writing their understandings and orientations towards L2 learning‘‘ (p. 166). In contrast to the focus on the specified sub-components of individual minds in the social-psychological approach, the current study, underpinned by a critical and discursive approach, represents an empirical attempt to investigate how motivation is discursively constructed in learners’ comments about English learning experiences, having regard to the rapidly changing sociocultural context of China and the global domination of English allied to the spread of English language instruction. An emphasis on the discourse might help to explain better the relationship between the individual and learning context in the process of motivation development.

This paper reports on a qualitative case study of two college English language learners’ motivation by examining their interpersonal relationships in a department community, their imagined identities and their personal struggles in, and alignment with social norms and requirements. With an interest in investigating the mediating role of learners’ language in motivation and identity construction and in establishing the link between motivation and language in use, I employ Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis framework, as explained in the methodology section, below. Rather than providing a description of the various components that contribute to the subjects’ motivation and identifying the correlation between motivation and learning outcomes as in social-psychological or cognitive approaches to L2 motivation, this study aims to address the issue of motivation through the following question:

In what ways is English L2 learners’ motivation constructed as they engage with the immediate learning community and broader national educational contexts, and form their imagined identities?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The research site and participants

The Chinese informants both attended a leading Chinese university, located in a municipality directly under the control of the central government. The English Department in which the participants studied is part of the College of Foreign Languages and Literature, one of 22 colleges in the university. There are some 120 students enrolled in the four-year English language and literature program. This study is part of a larger project investigating English language learners’ motivation development and identity formation, in which a total of five students from the English Department and four students from Bioscience Department volunteered to participate. Jocelyn’s and Lisa’s (pseudonyms) stories are the focus of this particular investigation since their sharply contrasting processes of motivation construction and identity formation develop within essentially similar learning experiences and learning contexts. The two participants were both in their junior year in the English Department when the study started. To anchor the following comparative analysis between the two participants, their profile is provided in Table 1.

My own experiences have helped me understand the participants, both as an insider and an outsider. The university from which I graduated is adjacent to the university in which the participants were studying. The two universities, both among the most prestigious in China, are closely related through both academic and extracurricular activities. Therefore, I am quite familiar with the ‘local’ culture and was able to identify with the participants’ many experiences. However, my further education, my academic knowledge and my developing analytic ability all helped me to explore beneath the surface of the participants’ experiences, to ‘‘plumb the depths and get to the bottom of things,” and try ‘‘to analyze, to advance explanations, and to represent material in ways that might not otherwise occur” (Woods, 1996, p. 62).

# 3.2. Data collection

The study was a two-year longitudinal case study. Interviews and diary studies were the main instruments employed in the data analysis. Altogether twelve individual interviews of about 1.5 hours duration each were conducted; 30 diary entries with an average length of some 350 words per entry were completed by Jocelyn and 20 by Lisa. In addition, I possessed a total of 18 email exchanges, 9 with Jocelyn and 9 with Lisa. The data collected during this project are summarized in Table 2.

The interviews, conducted every four months, were semi-structured with open questions. Questions focused on the subjects’ English language learning history, their future expectations, their motivation at different stages of their college life and the factors that influenced their motivation. The interviews, all conducted in Chinese, offered opportunities to confirm and check emerging themes. Diary entries enabled the participants to introspectively and/or retrospectively observe their experiences (Allwright and Bailey, 1991). They were encouraged to note any critical incidents they encountered around English learning in daily college life. Diaries entries were expected to be completed every three to four weeks; Jocelyn appeared to write more frequently than expected. During the course of the research project, when I needed to elicit more information about themes emerging from a preliminary analysis of the data, I would email them and ask them to write further on these matters in their diaries. To compensate for the physical distance between myself and the participants during most of the study, and to establish a rapport between us, our email topics were not limited to English learning but touched on such other areas as their experiences of growing up, interpersonal relationships, future concerns and so on. However, rapport requires balance. I always kept in mind that ‘‘ethnographers are expected to maintain a polite distance from those studied and to cultivate rapport, not friendship; compassion, not sympathy; respect, not belief; understanding, not identification; admiration, not love” (Tedlock, 2003, p. 168).

Interview transcription was an important and difficult process in this study, partly due to the CDA analytical tool and partly because of the inherent differences in the nature of speech and writing. As Atkinson (1992, p. 23) notes, ‘‘there is no such thing as a ‘natural’ mechanism for the representation of speech”; transcribers, therefore, need to resolve the tensions between accuracy, readability and the politics of representation (Mehan, 1993). When transcribing the interviews, I first listened carefully to one segment of speech, and then translated and transcribed it in English. I strove to reproduce each utterance as exactly as possible, translating it verbatim to maintain the original flavor. However, I have not attempted to represent pauses, fillers and vocatives in the translated version as precisely as would be expected in a conversation or psychological analysis (Kvale, 1996). Essentially therefore, I am using CDA to explore the construction of the social in language. Consequently, I did pay strict attention to preserving and recording grammatical and language features (tense, use of modality, hedges, subjunctive moods, etc.) in translating the interviews, as these represented features critical to my analysis. $7 5 \%$ of the diary entries were written in English, although I indicated to the participants that they could use whichever language they felt comfortable with. A similar translation procedure was used when translating diary entries originally written in Chinese. The translation of key passages was checked by other researchers who have expertise in both English and Chinese.

# 3.3. Data analysis

Data analysis was a gradually evolving process. During the early stages, an initial analysis of data from different sources was conducted. Diary entries, interviews and data from the email correspondence were treated together to cross-reference the various contributing data sources. Unless otherwise indicated, all excerpts in this paper are translations from the original Chinese. A range of key themes related to the learners’ construction of motivation emerged. Fairclough’s (1992, 1993, 2003) framework of CDA subsumes a complex of three dimensions: text, spoken or written; discursive practice (text production and text interpretation); and social practice.

At the level of text, my focus was on grammatical features associated with modality. Modality expresses the speaker/writer’s degree of affinity with or affiliation to a proposition or a text participant (Fairclough, 2003). At the level of discursive practice, how, why, when and where a text was produced was considered (Fairclough, 2003). Here strategies of legitimation and logics of equivalence outlined by Fairclough (2003, p. 87) are of relevance, Legitimation is the strategy used by the speaker or the text producer to justify his/her own beliefs. For example, in Jocelyn’s statement ‘‘the idea that people should have national responsibility was advocated by Chinese scholars centuries ago, like Confucius”, she is referring to authority or tradition to legitimate her own view. The logic of equivalence, which is established by placing words of similar ideological import throughout one’s text to strengthen a particular ideological effect (Laclau and Mouffe, 1985), was also considered. Laclau and Mouffe (1985) theorize the construction of antagonistic relations in political processes through the logic of equivalence, which ‘‘consists in the dissolution of the particular identities of subjects within a discourse by the creation of a purely negative identity that is seen to threaten them” (Howarth, 2000, p. 107). For example, in Lisa’s statement, ‘‘we don’t spend much time sitting at a desk and studying English” but ‘‘they are like bookworms and isolate themselves in the classroom”, she constructed the opposition between ‘we’ and ‘they’ and established two different identities and attitudes towards English learning. The strategies of legitimation and logics of equivalence play important roles, both in establishing and cultivating belief systems and in justifying the elements related to social structures (Fairclough, 2003). At the level of social practice, I considered the following questions: to what kind of discourse network does the text belong? What are its ideological and hegemonic effects on ‘‘systems of knowledge and belief, social relations, and social identities” (Fairclough, 1992, p. 238)? For example, in Lisa’s case, when she experienced incongruence between her Chinese and English speaking identity, which to a great extent influenced her motivation, we may understand this to be a reflection of the conflict between the discourses of globalization and nationalism in China. Other examples are discussed in the findings section. In the following three such sections, the data for individual participants are presented according to a time sequence in order to capture the developmental processes regarding motivation over time.

# 4. The findings

# 4.1. L2 Motivation and Interpersonal Relationships

Asked about what had influenced their English learning motivation, Jocelyn and Lisa both identified interpersonal relationships, including student–teacher and peer-to-peer relationships in their department, as one important factor. Jocelyn’s interpersonal relationships in the learning community related to the discordance between her values and beliefs and those of the department’s mainstream discourse community, and to the fact that only students close to the teachers were offered opportunities, such as on-site interpretation and entry into English contests. Asked about the overall atmosphere in the department, Jocelyn portrayed the beliefs of many students in the community negatively and commented that her own values and ideals stood in sharp contrast to those in the mainstream:

Most students don’t have high life objectives and don’t study English hard although it is their major. Making more money is what they are most concerned with. I have little in common with most classmates and I cannot win respect from others. I dream of being successful but I hope my dream will benefit not only myself, but (the) others. . . I think young people should not be selfish, but should try to play a role in advancing the nation. So I work hard on English not merely for myself. (Interview 3, month 12)

By negatively evaluating the life philosophy of those around her, she also differentiated herself from them. With her statement ‘‘I have little in common with. . . I cannot get respect from others”, Jocelyn set up a kind of polar opposition between two value systems to life, i.e., between her classmates’ focus on individual success and enjoyment, and her desire to benefit the whole nation, through which her own life objectives and English learning motivation were legitimated.

Responding, during an interview in her senior year, to a question about learning opportunities, Jocelyn again voiced her disappointment that only those students who had close relationships with influential teachers were granted more opportunities:

Nothing is open and transparent in our department. Information about chances such as internships and English contests has never been made public. Everything seems to be carried out unjustly and unfairly.. . .. It is so different from the American educational institutions where I think that everything is fair and open. Teachers treat students equally and students have opportunities to learn all kinds of information (Interview 4, month 16)

Here relations of equivalence between ‘secretly choosing students’, and a ‘nontransparent selection system’ served as hyponyms for ‘an unjust and unfair education institution’. Similarly, relations of equivalence regarding ‘teachers treat students equally’ and ‘information is openly available to students’ represented hyponyms of ‘an open and transparent education institution’. Jocelyn set up a binary opposition between the Chinese and American educational systems using the logic of equivalence and made clear her preference for the latter. Although Jocelyn construed interpersonal relationships as ‘undesirable’ in the learning context, she gradually developed stronger motivation to study English. Instead of passively waiting for chances to practice, she sought out companies that temporarily needed interpreters and then invited her classmates to come with her. She documented her feelings in a diary entry from her senior year:

What I want to do now, is just to work hard on English, and to create opportunities by myself. I would not expect anything from my professors. Whenever this idea came into my mind, I have summoned up my strength and my morale has been lightened. I think I can earn respect from others through my own efforts. (Diary 26, original in English, month 22)

Lisa’s interpersonal relationship with the English Department community was constructed differently than Jocelyn’s. Lisa didn’t detect any great sense of dissonance with the department’s mainstream beliefs and values, as reflected in her use of legitimating strategies to justify these, and, likewise, in her use of logic of equivalence to construct oppositions between the mainstream and the marginal in the department. For example, Lisa established the binary oppositions between two kinds of identities among the students in the English department:

I never feel marginalized at university. We don’t like people who isolate themselves in the classroom and we call them bookworms. They concentrate too much on study. We adore people who are versatile and who know how to play the game of life hard. (Interview 2, month 8)

Two kinds of opposing identities were constructed here. They ‘‘isolate themselves in the classroom” and were regarded as ‘‘bookworms”, whereas we were ‘‘versatile” and knew ‘‘how to play the game of life hard”. Through this discursive strategy, Lisa constructed an ‘otherization’ of ‘them’ when talking about students who didn’t belong to her community and who ‘‘concentrate too much on study”. Lisa located herself as sharing beliefs with classmates in the mainstream discourse by continuously using ‘‘we”, as opposed to Jocelyn’s frequent use of ‘‘I”. Although they were in the same learning community, Lisa found her beliefs to be more in congruence with the mainstream discourse than did Jocelyn. One possible explanation for Lisa’s working less on English than Jocelyn may be that Lisa’s constructed identity emphasized ‘play’ in the discourse of the community, and unlike Jocelyn, didn’t rely on high English proficiency to ‘gain respect’ and to empower her in interpersonal relationships.

# 4.2. Motivation and imagined identities

As I will show in this section, the analysis of the participants’ accounts revealed that their imagined identities, which affected their motivation, were constructed in the interaction between individual learners, historical process and social practice. The textual analysis of identities is based on Fairclough’s (2003) assumption that speakers’ self-identification is, to a large extent, reflected in what they are committed to in text. Asked about her imaginations for the future, Jocelyn responded:

My imaginations are always changing. Since childhood, my parents told me many stories about the lives of successful people, such as politicians, scientists, musicians and writers. Inspired by my parents’ encouragement, I dreamed of being a successful person in the future and of leading a meaningful life. In primary school, I dreamed of being a successful woman in the business world because I heard some exciting stories about some businesswomen. I dream that I can speak fluent English when doing business with westerners. In senior high school, I thought that I would become a politician like Madam Thatcher. I read different versions of her biographies in English. . . In senior year, I dreamed of becoming a simultaneous interpreter because I heard that the postgraduate program in our department is planning to set up a simultaneous translation major and will select outstanding students for it. (Diary 19, original in English, month 16)

Jocelyn used conjunctions like ‘‘because” (three times), ‘‘after” and ‘‘so” (twice) to establish the link between her imagination and social narratives and discourses. She used positive terms (‘‘great”, ‘‘successful” and ‘‘outstanding”) to characterize her imagined identities, and frequently attributed positive terms to the identities she embraced to legitimate her choices. A detailed look at her various imagined identities revealed how they had been constructed through interactions between the personal and the social shifts over time. For example, Jocelyn was in primary school in the late 1980s and early 1990s, at a time when China was in the midst of an economic revolution that shifted it from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy; working in the business world was popular then, and this may explain Jocelyn’s desire to become a ‘‘successful” businesswoman. While Jocelyn was in middle school in the mid 1990s, stories of the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were frequently featured in newspapers and TV reports, and ‘Madam Thatcher’ was thought of by many girls as a role model; it was not surprising, therefore, that Jocelyn dreamed of becoming a politician during that period. Overall, Jocelyn’s multiple and changing imagined identities reflected her strong desire to construct a socially recognizable identity. It was interesting to see that Jocelyn linked all her imagined identities to a good command of English, be it speaking, reading, writing or interpreting. Why can Jocelyn continuously modify her own imaginations? In addition to the influence of societal change and Jocelyn’s proactive exploration of new possibilities, Jocelyn’s family had a significant effect in moulding her imaginations, which might be reflected in her answer to my prompt about her family’s influence on her learning trajectory: ‘‘my parents have very high expectations of me, hoping that I can be No1 in all examinations and have a prosperous career in the future, and to a certain extent I have been working very hard so as not to make them feel disappointed” (Interview 4, month 16). According to her reflection, the many inspiring stories told her by her parents together with their high expectations of her had pushed her to strive for a successful and meaningful life, an indication that her motivation was also historically constructed.

Like Jocelyn, Lisa documented her imagined future path:

When I was very young, I dreamt of becoming an advertiser because being an advertiser places/has high demand on ones’ creativity, sense of art as well as fashion, which I think I have talent in. . . In high school, the cartoon series from Japan were very popular among us. I read a lot of cartoon books and find them fascinating. So I dreamt of becoming a illustrator/drawer of cartoon books and gaining recognition from young people. After I entered university, many books and movies I can get access to indicate that France is a beautiful country with the most beautiful language in the world. . .I am deeply impressed. So I imagine that studying design or drawing or advertising in France must be full of fantasy and it is the perfect combination of my dreams. (Diary 15, original in English, month 15)

Conjunctions of ‘‘because” and ‘‘so” were used to semantically bridge Lisa’s imaginations drawn from her own social experiences and/or the views held by the people around her. Lisa’s imagined identities were not as closely related to English learning as were Jocelyn’s. Either the dream of becoming an arts designer or her appreciation of French language had distanced her considerably from English and had restricted her learning behavior, as was reflected in one further interview:

Researcher: Do you think your interest in French culture influences your English studies?

Lisa: Yes, very much. I think that my appreciation of French culture is fundamentally at odds with my role as an English major. I am crazy about the French arts, history and its language and I feel that English is faraway from me now. (Interview 5, month 20)

# 4.3. L2 Motivation and Alignment with Social Discourses

The influence of the social context of mainland China on motivation gradually became salient in the later stage of this investigation when Jocelyn and Lisa started to consider future careers after graduation. The participants’ discussions of the social influences on English learning implied that their motivations were related to their understanding of social requirements. Asked if there were reasons for working hard on English other than benefiting society, Jocelyn admitted, perhaps reluctantly, that learning English might well help her be recognized, and commented negatively on the ways in which ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ were defined in China:

Losers face tremendous pressure. It is believed that exams and high marks will bring fame and reputation while low ones would deserve contempt and the cold shoulder. . . I have been working hard on English and striving to be the student with the best academic achievement, to gain respect, or in other words, for fear of being disregarded and laughed at. (Diary 16, original in English, month 16)

Jocelyn’s statements revealed her ambivalence towards the value the social discourse placed on ‘‘fame and reputation” – despite finding it unreasonable, she herself was keen to gain recognition. Jocelyn imbued ‘‘fame and reputation” and ‘‘contempt and cold shoulder” with contrasting meanings, indicating the reception given to people who achieved high and low scores, respectively. Social norms influenced her motives for studying hard at English, i.e., ‘‘to get respect” and ‘‘for fear of being disregarded and laughed at”. This impinged negatively on another strong motive for her to study English, which was, ‘‘to do something beneficial to the country” (Interview 4, month 16).

In a later interview, I further explored to what extent such social norms had influenced Jocelyn’s Englis learning:

Researcher: could you tell me why some aspects of the social norms that you initially disliked finally influenced you in your English studies?

Jocelyn: let me think. . .. I guess the experience of being marginalized and ignored, and the pressure from relatives and family were the main reasons. I have come to realize that in this society, if I want to be respected and do something meaningful, I must achieve a higher social status. English is a key. (Interview 5, month 20)

The apparent tension in Jocelyn’s remarks represented the dialogic relationship between the individual and the social. It seemed that, although Jocelyn stated several times that she disliked the overwhelming pursuit of wealth associated with many people in China, its social values had nonetheless influenced her motivation. She oscillated on a continuum with the pursuit of material wealth at one end and a highly meaningful life at the other - both of which influenced her.

Lisa interacted with the social context in China in different ways from Jocelyn. Asked why she didn’t want to pursue a higher degree in the US, Lisa responded, in a diary entry:

In our society, nowadays, the standard for evaluating a successful university graduate is whether he/she has been given an offer from a famous university in the USA. I would say that merely succeeding in the eyes of others is not attractive to me. I love the art and culture in France more. Why should I have to take TOEFL and GRE after such long-time preparation in pursuit of an objective which I don’t really like? If Chinese were the core language of globalization, the Chinese language would be just like English and become a powerful language. (Diary 10, original in English, month 10)

Lisa established her own personal values, which were in opposition to the social standards that ‘‘evaluate a successful university graduate”, by stating the differences between the two positions. Difference was constructed through the use of ‘‘not attractive” when referring to studying in the USA, and in the use of ‘‘love” when she indicated her affection for/towards French art and culture. Her question about having to take exams ‘‘for an objective which I don’t really like” was rhetorical, and indicated the strength of her feelings well. Lisa’s sense of agency could be seen in her continuous use of first person pronoun ‘I’ in the above excerpt. The last sentence indicated Lisa’s resistance to, and her opinions regarding the dominant status and popularity of the English language in the world, and partly explained why she bucked convention by not going to the US to study further.

# 5. Discussion

Previous studies have sought to investigate the intricacy of motivation from different perspectives. Researchers explored the relationship between individual attitudes and achievement, (e.g., Gardner, 1985; Gardner, 2000); or they investigated how the internal factors sustained language learning (e.g., Noels, 2001; Noels et al., 2000); or they examined the influences of specific learning situations on motivation (e.g., Do¨rnyei, 1994; Oxford and Shearin, 1994; Ushioda, 1994, 1996); or they looked at motivation as a social and ideological construct and addressed the social and political impacts on it (e.g., Norton, 2000; Ushioda, 2001; Ushioda, 2007). Building upon the studies that identify and examine the social aspects of L2 motivation (e.g., Norton, 2000; Ushioda, 2001), this study is intended to provide an integrated view of both individual and societal practice in examining motivation development. Taking a critical and discursive approach, this study has examined the construction of motivation through the interaction between the individual and the social by employing the notion of discourse (Fairclough, 1992, 2003; Laclau and Mouffe, 1985; Phillips and Jorgensen, 2002) and by focusing on its constitutive effects on the social reality, that is, the interpersonal relationship, the intrapersonal identity and the systems of knowledge and belief. It is through discourse that the individual engages with the social and it is also through discourse that the social is expressed by the individual. As such, motivation is constructed in the discursive interaction between the social and the individual. Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis model provides useful analytical tools within a principled method that is in alignment with the theoretical orientation of this study. Through understanding individual learners’ formative and English learning experiences, exploring their situated environment, and taking into account the broad social milieu, motivation has been presented in an integrative model, which views it as individually, historically, and socially constructed (diagrammed in Fig. 1 below).

As illustrated in Fig. 1, we find that interpersonal relationships in an educational community do not exist only as external resources for learners but also as influences on their motivated behaviors. Both the peer relationships and the teacher-student relationships affect learners’ position in the community and their access to learning opportunities. The historical nature of motivation can be found in the informants’ discursive accounts of their imagined future existence at various stages, presenting both a discursively constructed and a self-reflexive process. The informants continuously construct imagined identities that tend to be socially recognizable, and their explorations of new possibilities enrich their experiences, which in turn assist them to reexamine and reframe their imaginations and shape their motivation. English learners interact with both the local and the academic society using their own values, and in the meanwhile show their ability to align motivation with prevailing cultural and social norms. Overall, the research findings support the sociocultural and poststructuralist researchers’ view (e.g., Norton, 2000; Thorne, 2005; Ushioda, 2001) that motivation is not a static element, but is shaped by previous and ongoing activities, and changes corresponding to the broader social context. However, by employing a discursive approach, the individual dimension of L2 motivation and how individual learners interact with the social milieu has been further explored.

Fig. 1. Discursive model of L2 motivation.

It is important to note that different factors influencing motivation operate simultaneously rather than separately. The social conditions in China have influenced an English-learning educational community at the different levels of peer relationships, teacher-student relationships, and learners’ imaginations, which all play a part in their motivation to learn, or not to learn, English. The findings indicate that Jocelyn is a complex girl greatly influenced by British and American cultures; for example, she treated Madam Thatcher as a role model, and favored American educational institutions over her own department, which she characterized as unfair. However Jocelyn’s values and ideals also reflected the altruism emphasized by Chinese culture, both in classical Chinese Confucian philosophical works and in the current research literature (e.g., Jones, 2005; Liu 2002), when she stated that success meant not only gaining recognition and respect, but also being able to benefit the society as a whole. However, typical Chinese values concerning work ethics and national responsibility were not popular in the English Department, and because her views diverged from those of ‘‘self-centered” and ‘‘materially-oriented” classmates, Jocelyn’s voice was not heard. Jocelyn, a high-achieving student, could neither become a legitimate member in the community of her fellow students, nor could she enjoy good relationships with her teachers, who wielded institutional power within that community. Jocelyn thus lost many opportunities for advancement. This seems to contradict research findings that, in China, teachers tend to favor students with high academic achievements (Gao, 2008, Zhao and Guo, 2002) 1 . As indicated in the analysis, Jocelyn’s experience of being marginalized and ignored in the department, and the values held by people around her, made her realize that achieving a higher social status was a prerequisite for being respected and recognized in the current society. Perhaps to her own chagrin, Jocelyn was forced to acknowledge that the prevalent social trend of pursuing individual wealth and success had gradually percolated into her motivation. Jocelyn regarded English proficiency as a tool for its realization. Jocelyn’s case shows that in the PRC, where social, cultural and political processes are experiencing rapid changes, the conventional view of Chinese society as collectivistic and harmonious may no longer explain current social practices, and that changing social processes and exposure to western ideology and cultures jointly complicate learners’ English learning motivation.

The other informant, Lisa, seemed to be more in step with the mainstream learning community. However, she nonetheless decided to do something other than conform to the mainstream practice of studying for a higher degree in the US. Exploring the underlying reasons, we may find from her discursive comments that Lisa had developed a certain resistance towards the perceived domination of English throughout the world (Diary 10). In addition, her imagined identities focused on developing a career in creative arts and fashion in France and drove her to question the socially constructed role of English for young people in China. Finally dismissing her previous relationship to the symbolic meanings associated with English, Lisa chose to invest in French and attempted new endeavors unrelated to English language learning.

The two participants in this study are both English learners from the same department. In spite of their seeming homogeneity in gender, cultural and linguistic backgrounds, they appeared to have distinctly different processes of motivation construction. A similar discursive approach to the motivation of the other participants in the larger project, on which this study is based, might present some different findings. Therefore, it would be preferable if a greater number of learners with different backgrounds could be examined over a period longer than two academic years in order to construct a more reliable picture of English language learners in China. Despite such reservations, however, this study suggests the existence and operation of interesting phenomena that merit the attention from researchers interested in language learner motivation.

# 6. Conclusion

This study has specifically investigated how L2 learners’ motivation is constructed through their discursive comments on their learning experiences. L2 motivation, in this study, appears to be multiple and changing and varies among individual learners, and is socially and historically constructed. The motivation construction process is also one of constant interaction between the individual and the social, as construed in the learners’ discourse. The learners’ position in the learning community, their past, present and imagined selves, and their alignment with social norms and requirements together exert influences on motivation construction. This study presents the complexity of the negotiation between the informants’ motivation and the current social and economic changes in China.
