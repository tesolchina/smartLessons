# Abstract

For years, personal and social voices have been the issue of discussion on voice construction in written discourse (e.g., Elbow, 1999; Flowerdew, 2011; Hyland, 2002, 2010a, 2012b; Mauranen, 2013; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999; Tardy, 2005). However, there is a lack of an integrated examination of the dimensions which determine voice construction in writing from personal and social perspectives. This article re-examines the issue of voice construction through a critical review of previous literature on identity in written discourse. It is argued that there are five major dimensions for the construction of voice in written discourse. How writers appropriate their voice according to such five dimensions as genre, transition, culture, discipline and audience will be discussed. This paper lends further support to the view that voice in written discourse is both personal and social. As it is known, good writing expresses both personal and social voices. However, based on the dominant dimension(s), voice construction should be adjusted. Sometimes personal voice is boldly expressed; sometimes social voice is; and some other times the boundary between the two is unnoticeable. The study provides an integrated framework as well as pedagogical implications for the teaching of academic writing within L1 and L2 contexts.

# 1. Introduction

The relationship between writing and identity has been closely studied (e.g., Cadman, 1997; Hirvela & Belcher, 2001; Hyland, 2010a, 2012b; Ivanič, 1998; Tardy, 2005). No matter how identity and its associated concepts such as hedging, voice, metadiscourse, stance, and engagement are defined, their connection to writing is viewed as fundamental. Some scholars view identity in more personal terms (e.g., Elbow, 1999) and some in more social orientations (e.g., Prior, 2001). However, the juxtaposition of identity’s two perspectives, namely, personal voice and social voice, has been the subject of controversy (e.g., Chiu, 2016; Elbow, 1999; Prior, 2001; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999; Tardy & Matsuda, 2009; Tardy, 2005).

This research explores the identity issue theoretically based on the previous identity studies of written discourse including empirical studies of social voice (e.g., DressenHammouda, 2008; Hyland, 1994, 1995, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c; Hyland & Milton, 1997), personal voice (e.g., Cadman, 1997; Ivanič & Camps, 2001; Starfield & Ravelli, 2006; Tang & John, 1999; Zhao & Llosa, 2008), theoretical studies of social voice (e.g., Hyland, 1997, 2005b), and personal voice (e.g., Elbow, 1999; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999; Ramanathan & Kaplan, 1996). Throughout the paper, the term identity is used as a much broader concept than voice, which is defined as identity constructed and negotiated in written discourse (see Ivanič, 1998; Matsuda, 2015; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007). In other words, voice is a subset of the larger concept of identity and is considered part of identity. Voice will be particularly approached in this study. In view of the complex nature of the identity issue involved in shaping written discourse (Cadman, 1997; Casanave, 1998; Hyland, 2012d; Matsuda, 2015; Matsuda & Jeffery, 2012; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Tardy, 2012), this study examines the dimensions which are related to the writer’s voice construction. The issue of the writer’s voice construction will be explored from both personal and social perspectives.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1 Personal and social voices in writing

Writers bring personal aspects of self to their writing (Hyland, 2012b). However, they are bound to the perceived norms of the community. Writers’ sense of audience is critical, and there is an actual frame of reference that is created between writers and readers to facilitate their communication (Hyland, 2015). There is also an interwoven nature between community expectations and the individual writer (Hyland, 2015). In the meantime, the production of text represents the production of self. This indicates that the better use of community discourses can help claim or resist “own experiences, purposes, and conceptions of self” (Hyland, 2010a, p. 162). It may suggest that through the use of community discourse, membership of social groups is claimed (Hyland, 2010a). As it is known, academic writing includes personal aspects as well as social aspects, and this implies conforming to the values of the community while making one’s own contribution and claims. To be a professional writer does not necessarily mean to merely express the social side of self. Moreover, showing the personal side may reveal the experienced personage of the writer as well.

In the writing pedagogy of North America, the notion of individualism or personal voice is pursued within the four principles of voice, peer review process, critical thinking and textual ownership (Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999). Being the reflection of the individual self, personal voice is promoted to a great extent in the North American educational system. However, L2 writers of English are motivated to follow the same fashion, and this is often problematic, as is already discussed in the writing literature (e.g., Elbow, 1999; Hyland, 2002; Hyland & Guinda, 2012; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999). Focusing on the issue of personal voice, Elbow (1999) does not promote the idea of teaching individualistic voice to L2 writers who practice writing in contexts other than L1. He exemplifies China and Japan as the non-individualistic cultures in which writers may not benefit from the pedagogy of individualism. He points to the complication in applying personal voice for some L2 students and in his final note stresses that U.S. writing pedagogy can carry with it individualism, which may be problematic for ESL students.

Matsuda (2015) divided writers’ voice into three categories: Personal, social-constructionist, and social-constructivist, where he refers to the former, personal or individual, as “traditional conception of voice that sees voice as an expression of unique individuality” (p. 146). In this sense writing to reflect “personally preferred sense of self” (Jwa, 2012, p. 325) is not learned in the classroom but comes from within and is the reflection of writers’ inner feelings and experiences (Blanton, 2003). Personal and social-constructionist are two extreme ends of the personal-social continuum. Social-constructionists believe in the construction of voice within the provided social repertoire and do not motivate writers to be creative outside of the given conventions (Le Ha, 2009) because they are concerned that it is impossible for writers. Socialconstructivists take personal voice to a different dimension, where personal and social voices are co-existing and being negotiated with each other. Therefore, social-constructivists lean toward the social side of voice. They consider the writer’s creativity as a base and encourage writers to be creative and emphasize the co-construction of voice between the writer and the audience. In arguing the importance of personal and social voices in identity studies, Hyland (2012b) presumes that both assimilation and disconnectedness from a community are fundamental in building up identity and this is how academics accomplish credibility as insiders and status as individuals. Writers reflect their voice in writing as an inevitable factor. In the next section, it will be demonstrated how the process of coming to a right voice makes complications for writers and how attending to the issue of personal and social voices can be beneficial to the rhetorical awareness.

# 2.2 The complexity of the voice issue in shaping written discourse

The issue of constructing voice in writing from the point of view of personal and/or social perspectives has been examined in various studies (refer to Table 1 for a summary of the studies). The complex nature of selection between personal and social voices has been reflected in the literature as well. For instance, Kawase (2015) shows how research writers strive to project conformity with more usage of metadiscourse devices in the introductory part of their research papers. However, they use less metadiscourse in their Ph.D. dissertation introductions. The reason for such a variation stems from the differences of genre. Dissertation is an educational genre while a research article serves as a professional genre, which writers are required to publish passing through intense competition (Kawase, 2015) by choosing a whole different identity. There are also some significant variations due to discipline. The study indicates how both genre and discipline are at work to shape the construction of personal and social identities.

The interpersonal relationship between the writer and reader is also accountable for the construction of voice. Chase (1988) focuses on the senior report writing of three student writers using the three categories: accommodation, opposition, and resistance, to explain the complications. Writers in the study were dominated by their supervisor/discourse community and were told to follow the conventions without much criticality.

The three mature research students in the study of Hirvela and Belcher (2001) also experienced some complications when they brought their already possessed professional voice from L1 to their L2 English writing throughout the course of their Ph.D. education in an Anglophone university. Eventually, they went through the struggles and managed to get to the right voice by compromising their L1 writing voice with L2 English writing culture, their discipline, and the discourse community. Their voice was shaped out of the combined challenge of discipline, discourse community and their voice in the process of transforming from novice L2 to professional writers.

Building a personal voice in academic writing is the concern of many authors with a nonnative English background. Therefore, encouraging L2 writers to express a personal voice helps them progress further in the course of academic writing (Cadman, 1997; Shen, 1989) and gain reputation as an individual. Meanwhile, it is inherently difficult to avoid using social identity markers and still expect to maintain credibility as an insider since knowledge is socially created. This is particularly important to research students and novice writers.

# 3. Research method

# 3.1 Data

This study consists of an analytical literature review, based on two research questions: RQ1: What complexities does voice bring to writers in shaping writing? RQ2: What factors are involved in the construction of voice? Searching was inductive. Keywords alleged to have the potential to generate appropriate results were detected as follows: (teaching) voice, personal/ social identity, voice in writing, written voice, stance, personal pronouns, personal/social voice, attitude, academic writing, language learning, genre, written discourse, writing, and metadiscourse. Initial searches were conducted using multiple databases and limiting the results to the English language. Some of the databases were Elsevier Science Direct, Journal Storage (J-STOR), SAGE, Google Scholar, Taylor & Francis, Wiley, WOS, ERIC, and EBSCO. Selection of journals was processed by disciplines of applied linguistics, and writing and composition because the exploited databases or platforms were multidisciplinary. Altogether, 1,302 research articles were retrieved and initially assessed before deeper investigation.

Literature relevant to voice construction in writing was identified by the following five criteria: a) The paper conveys main keywords such as voice, identity, authorial presence, individuality, and conformity; b) The focus should be on written discourse only; c) Some additional studies that are recognized by us should be retrieved as well; d) Printed between 1980 and 2018 in a peer-reviewed journal; e) Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies written in English. We read the abstract of each article applying the said criteria and once we identified them, we consulted the full text to verify probable inclusion or exclusion. A sum of 85 papers met the criteria so were included in this study through the classification of materials in Qiqqa. Qiqqa is widely used by researchers and academics as a research and reference manager. It helps to search, read and annotate pdfs.

# 3.2 Analysis

All articles were read by the two researchers independently to ensure that the aim was in line with the focus of this study. Furthermore, the main results were summarized. On regular occasions, we met for every single phase of the process from selection to evaluation and extraction. The references were read and categorized based on the fact that there are two voices namely personal and social. Then for each research work, the core encircling the whole research content was recognized. Based on our analysis we found five dimensions of constructing personal and social voices and our conceptualization was driven accordingly.

We employed Hsieh and Shannon’s (2005) content analysis to inductively analyze the data aiming to address the research questions focusing on the issues of voice construction in written discourse. We started by reading each article to grasp the overall concept. Then we separately determined different parts of each study as to participants, purposes, methods, results and major findings. After re-examining the major findings of each study corresponding to our research questions, we surveyed whether or not they can respond to them. We created different libraries in Qiqqa for all our research questions and we added every article holding findings that relate to the research questions, plus a citation to our paper. We resolved disagreements via regular short meetings. To ensure or modify our initial findings, the first author systematically repeated each phase in another comprehensive analysis together with consulting with the second author, if needed, to refine the analysis.

In the next section, the issue of personal and social voices and the five determining dimensions will be discussed (briefly mentioned in Table 1). First and foremost, the study does not propose that writers merely display either a personal or social voice in written discourse. But it maintains that in the context of writing, the dimensions work together in shaping the writer’s voice. In most cases, two sides of voice, personal and social, co-exist. Hyland (2012a) considers that all forms of identity act together and influence one another in shaping identity in every particular context and in building up who we are.

# 4. Five dimensions of voice construction in written discourse

# 4.1 Audience-oriented voice construction

In scholarly texts and particularly for blind reviews, writers are reluctant to show their true voice so as not to be judged by the audience. Writers often act upon the reader’s expectancy to take on a successful technique in situating themselves as part of the community (Jwa, 2012). Consequently, impersonal writing is much favored so as to avoid any negative effect on the message that writers want to transfer apart from the real findings or data reflected by their research (Elbow, 2007). There are several studies unveiling how audiences constructed the writers’ voice (e.g., Jeffery, 2011; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Morton & Storch, 2019; Tardy & Matsuda, 2009), and they show the amalgamative effect of the discursive and non-discursive features in the manuscript (Matsuda, 2001) in the process of blind review. Flowerdew and Wang (2015) call the author-and-gatekeeper relationship a power relationship. They state that L2 academic writers may find themselves in less powerful positions, as they have to conform to the expectations of gatekeepers who are often native speakers (or to nonnative speakers, who nonetheless apply native-speaker norms).

The concern expressed in the literature is that satisfying the expectations of the audience in written discourse is important to the success of academic writing as a result of displaying a right voice or identity in anticipation of the response by the future reader(s) (Burgess & Ivanič, 2010; Hirvela & Belcher, 2001; Hyland, 2001). As is documented in the literature, the writing act would be easier when writers and readers are known to each other (Fu & Hyland, 2014). However, this is not always possible. Using the interactional metadiscourse model proposed by Hyland (2005a) and Hyland and Tse (2004), Fu and Hyland (2014) surveyed two newspaper genres of popular science and opinion articles in which the audiences were unknown. Results show that there is a significant difference in the employment of interactional features in the latter genre, demonstrating that writers put a lot of effort into connecting with their readers; to convince them of their claims and ideas which might be opposite to theirs. Therefore, using such an interactive strategy is genre-based and reflects the sensitivity rate of the readers. The opposite views of writers need a suitable groundwork to prepare readers to accommodate. In fact, the use of engagement markers, boosters, and self-mentions can assist writers to effectively present their opinions and engage with the audience.

As is known, writers are not always required to reflect the social aspect of their voice. It is true that North American culture requires students to strongly voice their ideas as the prerequisite of their writing, which is assessed along with rhetorical, lexical and grammatical features. However, in the Southeast Asian culture, having a direct personal voice in writing is not encouraged by the teachers and supervisors (Lu, 1987; Shen, 1989).

# 4.2 Culture-oriented voice construction

Voice construction from the point of view of culture has been extensively investigated particularly in the context of L2 writing. Hyland (2012d) observed that several Chinese students in Hong Kong, China prefer taking a community-familiar stance rather than risking applying the personal one to cope with the standard of writing required by the discipline when composing their final report. The students are compelled to reduce the markers of explicit personal involvement due to their cultural bounds (Hyland, 2002). They assume that by weakening their voice reflection their writing will be perceived sophisticated and wellcomposed by the supervisor. There is a strong interwoven relationship between culture and voice. Some cultures, such as the North American one, favor individualism. However, some other cultures may not value the skeptical and individualistic views as much (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 1996). Yet, Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and Indians are not clear on individualism in writing (Shen, 1989). Therefore, writing in English is becoming more difficult for those who were brought up by ignoring the use of personal voice (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 1996) where even highly advanced writers like Shen (1989) felt challenged in assuming an appropriate voice in their writing. As an example of many ESL learners who were still struggling between Chinese and English cultures, Shen highlighted his own culture-specific issues involved in academic writing. To Hyland (2013), such differences between writers’ L1 and L2 cultures may not always cause faulty writing, but the lack of English proficiency is at work. For him, culture is not really the reason for mistakes and incompetence in L2 writing.

Having surveyed the negative experiences of her non-English native students, Cadman (1997) asserts the necessity of creating a safe space for students to connect their inner self to outer cultures. Thus, she suggests helping non-native student writers to develop their personal voice by encouraging them to construct a more confident English language identity in their respective discourse community. Hirvela and Belcher (2001) make a similar recommendation in assisting ESL students to accommodate to the norms of English writing by appropriating a complementary self-presenting voice rather than simply replacing the owned identities. Overall, academic writing is culture-specific and bringing any type of culture which does not conform is judged inappropriate and faulty by L1 culture, something which often occurs to L2 writers (Hyland, 1995).

# 4.3 Genre-based voice construction

Voice expression also depends on the nature of genre as writers are expected to observe the generic conventions in writing. For example, in the genre of personal statement which helps students get admission into university, students are supposed to follow the values of the target discourse community to show certain aspects of identity in writing (Chiu, 2016). Similarly, citation practices of grant proposals which used to denote the authorial presence of grant writers are now constructed socially and manifest the scholarly identity of writers (Fazel & Shi, 2015). Also, due to similar moves in writing doctoral research proposals, namely, claiming knowledge, seeking support, claiming importance, establishing territory and claiming competence, the same conventions as grant proposals are deployed (Fazel & Shi, 2015). Likewise, Kawase (2015) reported that in the genre of research article introduction selfmention is applied less and cited works are deployed more and all that explains the necessity of emphasizing social conventions to indicate academic integrity. Meanwhile, by exploring identity construction of a group of immigrants, Aleandri and Checchi (2015) observed that developing personal identity in the genre of autobiography can assist immigrants to settle more rapidly.

In the genre of medical discourse, writers choose such noun hedging expressions as doubt and possibility to put on a social mask to better engage with the audience (Hyland, 2006). In the context of L2 undergraduate argumentative genre, the positive correlation between voice intensity and writing quality demonstrates the importance of constructing an authorial voice in writing (Zhao & Llosa, 2008). In addition, the inclination to reveal personal voice is evident in the personal homepage genre of academics. Through investigating the voice construction in a genre other than academic, Jwa (2012) surveyed fanfiction discourse based on Ivanič and Camps’ (2001) framework. In the investigation, she assessed the three features of intertextuality, dialogic interaction, and electronic texts in the course of voice construction. Jwa (2012) concluded that writers of this genre manipulate the resources to project their inner selves. Therefore, expression of the writers’ voice, to some extent, depends on the type of genre.

# 4.4 Transitory voice construction

Writing scholars accentuate the altering voice and identity over time (e.g., Burgess, 2012; Ivanič, 2006; Lemke, 2000). In his survey of the two professional writers, John Swales and Debbie Cameron, Hyland (2010a) asserts that by the rhetorical choices these writers make over time, they manifest who they are in different manners. The study indicates that even though the two sophisticated writers observe the social conventions, they have their exceptional way of exhibiting voice over time.

Tardy (2005) also explored the transition of writers’ identity with the claim that “although I have focused to a lesser extent on the ways in which a writer’s projected identity may change with time, it is important to keep in mind such a dynamism” (p. 334). Through the examination of voice from the perspective of time, it is found that the disciplinary voice changes over time and experienced writers tend to use more disciplinary-based linguistic and rhetorical features. With the employment of standard deviation (SD) and situated genre analysis, DressenHammouda (2014) investigated how the voice of disciplinarity continues to change after the Ph.D. dissertation in geology major writers. In a case-study, Dressen-Hammouda (2008) assessed how student writers’ voice changes from undergraduate to doctorate in the course of study. Accordingly, the student writer endeavors to master the target voice employed by efficient writers of the discipline so as to be accepted by the discourse community. Burgess (2012) surveyed the temporal aspect of writers’ discourse identity in her case-study. By using Burgess and Ivanič’s (2010) framework, she analyzed a literacy student’s text and conducted interviews with the student and her teacher. Ultimately, she traced the mediatory factors in the creation of the student writer’s autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self and socially available possibilities for selfhood. Her study explored transitory dimensions of the writer’s voice development. As illustrated in previous research, writers’ voice is inclined to undergo transition over time.

# 4.5 Discipline-oriented voice construction

Disciplinarity in writing determines to what extent the writer is consistent and belongs to the social community. Members of various disciplines make their arguments or craft meanings differently which is due to the different nature of knowledge and the diverse epistemological fashions (Hyland, 2015). The following is how Hyland (2005a) articulates the point in particular:

It is clear that writers in different disciplinary cultures represent themselves, their work and their readers in different ways, with those in the humanities and social sciences taking far more explicitly involved and personal positions than those in the science and engineering fields. (p. 187)

According to the conventions, authors of the soft sciences tend to employ a higher portion of self-mentions to highlight their authority and emphasize their own contribution, while on the opposite side, authors of the hard sciences choose the passive voice, dummy ‘it’ subjects, and the attribution of agency to inanimate things to tone down their self and keep objective judgments toward their findings (for the details see Hyland, 2015). The significant influence of discipline on the construction of writers’ identity in medical contexts stems from the way that the researchers operate their work together with the manner of reporting findings and the substantially structured texts of medical articles which go beyond culture (Dahl, 2004).

As it is recorded, mastery of the implicit propositions or discoursal silences in the academic contexts helps novice writers of the discipline create a disciplinary identity. Through referring to and citing the shared knowledge and specific academic literacies (Hyland, 2009), writers are identified and accepted as insiders by experienced writers (Dressen-Hammouda, 2008). Morton, Storch and Thompson (2015) conducted a longitudinal case study in Australia concerning three multilingual student writers (Canagarajah, 2013). Results show the significant impact of the discipline and the speech community on the one hand and a “questioning, critical stance” on the other in constructing identity in written assignments (Morton et al., 2015).

Adhering to the conventions of the field is essential for individuals who are writing within a particular discipline, especially those on the bridge to be socially admitted to voice their findings. Members of different disciplines employ disciplinary-specific language with the particular disciplinary discoursal features such as citation, reporting verbs, hedges, selfmention, directive and lexical bundles, in making their arguments like the credible members to persuade the readers to engage with the writer and the text itself (Hyland, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2008d, 2009). As it is known, such a dimension as discipline in voice construction indicates that one should write within the norms of his/her discipline simply to be understood and accepted by the members of the particular disciplinary community.

# 5. Discussion

The five dimensions involved in personal and social voice construction are displayed in Figure 1, in line with the above-mentioned detailed review.

![](img/5a3d65c9d5513708c426e45260b285e366f80f25eefb4038386892368f6f4e7e.jpg)  
Figure 1. Dimensions of personal and social voice construction in written discourse

It can be noticed from Figure 1 that the notions of personal and social voices are dependent on the five dimensions, namely, discipline, culture, genre, transition, and audience. As it shows, the boundary between the five dimensions is blurred and sometimes crossed in the process of constructing voice. What is more, the projected voice in most cases is both personal and social. Writers may display the two sides of voice based on the context of writing and the set priorities. For instance, Chiu (2016) and Jwa (2012) maintain that writers project a social voice as well as a personal voice according to the genre and dialogic relationship. The study shows how Ph.D. applicants attempt to impress the reviewers equally by expressing themselves and their social side. A schematic picture is drawn through Figure 2 to further illustrate the points concerned.

![](img/a196b62d733d5d115f3013a94f66589d9ad74abdca403ba53ab9c411c339a419.jpg)  
Figure 2. Conceptual framework of voice construction

The five dimensions are integrated from the extensive literature review and are also related to Ivanič’s (1998) framework of writing and identity. Culture is “the identity which people bring with them to any act of writing” (p. 24). In constructing writing, a transitory dimension is associated with writing which tends to be “constantly changing as a consequence of their (the writers’) developing life story” (p. 24). These two dimensions are mentioned as the “autobiographical self” of the author, using Ivanic’s term. The other three dimensions, namely, genre and the discipline, are parts of “a writer’s discoursal self … often multiple, sometimes contradictory which they consciously or unconsciously convey of themselves in a particular written text” (Ivanič, 1998, p. 25) and “relate to values, beliefs and power relations in the social context in which they were written” (Ivanič, 1998, p. 25). At the end of the process of voice construction, there is audience and the writer’s impression of “self as author” that co-construct the personal and social voices projected in the text. This is well elaborated by Ivanič (1998) as follows:

Some attributes all the ideas in their writing to other authorities, effacing themselves completely; others take up a strong authorial stance. Some do this by presenting the content of their writing as objective truth, some do it by taking responsibility for their authorship. (p. 26)

The overlapping nature of the five dimensions for constructing the writers’ voice complicates the issue of writers’ identity studies. As for the use of a very frequent model for analyzing the writing voice, Stock and Eik-Nes (2016) comment that:

Many studies build on Hyland’s (2008b) interactional model which has contributed to insights into voice-related issues in academic writing. However, the overemphasis on linguistic features, such as the use of first person pronouns, entails the risk that research on voice ignores content-related features that might be more relevant in the construction of voice. In addition, this review emphasizes the need to relate voice features to the specific context where the writing occurs. (p. 89)

There is a need in designing unified and extensive models of personal and social voices where both writing form and content should be taken into account which seems to be lacking in the literature somehow. Hereby an integrated framework is presented which draws on the five dimensions of writers’ voice construction discussed above.

Table 2. The framework of personal and social voices in constructing writer’ voice

What needs to be mentioned is that the list of instances for voice expression does not end in the above table. Besides, in different contexts, writers are supposed to select a social voice over another and vice versa. This means that writers do not have to avoid one completely and apply the other all the time because the social-personal voice ratio depends on the five dimensions in one way or another. For instance, in the context of a Western country with the culture of individuality, when someone writes a piece for the university academic homepage the represented voice might better be social (Hyland, 2012b). Another example is when your discipline is Biology (which is a hard science) but you are writing a popular science article for a newspaper, the greater use of hedging devices should be encouraged in order to better project the writer’s particular personal voice.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

# 6.1 Existing research of the area

Voice in writing can change over time (transition) in the process of becoming (Prior, 2001) and also can vary across cultures, genres, disciplines and power relations (audience). This paper seeks to contribute to the discussion of voice in written discourse by expounding how the five multi-faceted aspects that come into play in the construction of writing are involved in the appropriation of personal and social voices since the boundary between would be fuzzy. Writers, we assume, do not have to stick to the single side whenever they approach any written discourse. Under different circumstances, perhaps writers are apt to construct and share their desired voice. Experienced writers tend to be more confident in manipulating the norms to express their personal voice (Hyland, 2010a). On the other hand, it is unlikely for student writers to directly express their personal voice (Hyland, 1995, 2002). According to social constructivists, writers should not indiscriminately adhere to the norms of their discourse community. The study lends support to the view. Moreover, as it is discussed in the study, genre is a determining factor for writers’ voice projection. For example, in the two genres of personal statement and personal homepage of the university website, writers are required to adapt to the social norms and lower the indicators of personal voice. However, in the genre of autobiography and fanfiction (Jwa, 2012) writers are not obliged to interiorize their real self. Dialogic relation between writer and reader (audience) is another factor involved in expressing voice or “making an identity claim” (Hyland, 2015, p. 36). Specifically, authors of scholarly papers would rather adhere to the reviewers’ standards that can help them better publish, since publishing is the critical means of academic accomplishment and tenure (Belcher, 2007; Hyland, 2012c, 2013). It might not be unrelated to quote Tardy and Matsuda (2009) here as they state that “reader construction of voice within contexts of assessment and gatekeeping certainly does have the potential to serve as a mechanism for cultural reproduction, with readers favoring texts and writers who uphold established disciplinary norms” (p. 46). Satisfying the reviewers’ demands might be a Hobson’s choice; yet, it cannot be generalized to all the academic writers. Some scholars have challenged the route other scholars went through to become who they are now (Bhatia, 2001; Le Ha, 2009; Viete & Le Ha, 2007). For student writers, selection of voice may depend on culture. As for North American student writers, they are supposed to pick up an appropriate personal voice which distinguishes them from others. Presence of a strong authorial voice is considered as part of their writing assessment (Zhao & Llosa, 2008). The opposite is the Eastern culture. Students from an Asian background are expected to show their respect by observing the norms of their superiors such as their teachers and supervisors (Hyland, 2010b). Moreover, discipline also determines some norms which any single author may adequately appropriate in order to be accepted by peers, readers and community members (Ramanathan & Kaplan, 1996).

As is extensively discussed in the literature, the writer’s voice is both personal and social (e.g., Matsuda, 2015). This study displays what might affect the writer’s selection of one over the other. The preference of the writer’s voice should be subject to the features of genre, discipline, culture, transition and audience. The writer’s voice, particularly in academic writing, can be both personal and social. As Table 1 shows, drawing a line between the five mentioned dimensions is complicated as they appear to interact with each other in shaping the writer’s voice to balance the force that affects the writer’s selection of a social/personal voice. Vassilaki (2017) discusses how, in building a student teacher’s argumentative writing, many factors such as culture, audience, genre, and the timing during which the texts are composed interplay in the construction of writer identity. In most cases, setting a boundary for the selection of either the social or personal writers’ voice is almost impossible. Rather, priorities can be set to balance their existence in academic writing. Good writing, we trust, expresses both personal and social aspects, but based on the dominant dimension(s) the selection would vary. Sometimes the personal voice is boldly expressed; sometimes the social voice is; and some other times the boundary between seems to be blurred. Matsuda (2015) argues that voice maturity in writing depends on the field knowledge, the awareness of the audience and the power relations. Other scholars have equally pointed out the critical importance of considering self as well as the community. Academic writing has a fashion of asking writers for the reflection of their personal stance while requiring them to remain loyal by expressing a voice that accords with the social conventions. It results in alienating scholars of respective cultures from one another (Hyland, 2012d). There are several reports of the successful teaching of voice (e.g., Mancina, 2005; Spalding, Wang, Lin, & Hu, 2009) in deploying strategies to raise awareness on voice construction in written discourse.

# 6.2 Implications

The present study offers some pedagogical implications for the practice of academic writing. In teaching academic writing, the students’ need should be recognized before designing the teaching syllabus. Students should be made aware that having a strong voice and projecting a personal authorial self in writing seems to be appropriate if the writer is established in the field or when the cultural norms let him or her do so (Bhatia, 2001; Dressen-Hammouda, 2008; Hyland, 2010a; Le Ha, 2009). Otherwise, encouraging novice L2 writers, especially those aiming to publish in high-stake journals, to deviate from the rules and conventions set by communities would make them devastated and discouraged. Elbow (2007) rightly puts it this way:

…the impersonal conventions of scientific publications (e.g., blind reviews and APA citations that omit first names) testify to the recognition that unobtainable goals such as objectivity and impersonality are sometimes worth aiming toward. That is, for scholarly work, we don’t want reviewers and readers judging validity on the basis of the reputation or even the gender of the writer—nor on the basis of the blandishments of “human” rhetoric. It’s understandable that impersonality conventions such as those in APA are widely used in the natural sciences, the social sciences, and even education. (p. 12)

Therefore, we need to define the context of writing for students before prescribing any advice for them. This is in line with Johns et al. (2006), who suggest that students should explore various genres of different contexts and audiences. For novice writers, we propose a less personal projection of voice. This is because they will be capable enough to come with their right choice of voice to reflect their voice or “(stylistic) signature” over time (Deng, 2012; Hyland, 2010a; Kobayashi & Rinnert, 2013). However, if student writers’ discipline or culture requires them to express their personal authorial voice to make a point such as in Humanities (Hyland, 2010b; Le Ha, 2009), it would be the teachers’ job to raise the students’ rhetorical awareness and consciousness of displaying their right voice according to the specific writing context.

# 6.3 Suggestions on future research

In view of the ongoing discussion over the issue of the writer’ voice construction in shaping written discourse, what contributes to the two sides of writers’ voice in reality needs to be probed further. Voice is a complicated issue and is projected in written discourse in several ways. We need to estimate what the criteria are for assessment of voice. What makes a piece successful? We know that the right voice is perceived differently as to genre, discipline, audience, culture, and status of the writer as an expert or a novice. Then what does it exactly mean to write a better text according to these criteria and how can a writer have a stronger personal and/or social voice or weaker voice based on the five mentioned specifications? To what extent is it appropriate to represent a personal and/or social voice? Further research can investigate how a broad array of voice-related aspects under various terms such as metadiscoursal features, attitude markers, necessity modals, self-mentions, personal and reader pronouns, informality markers, stance markers, form voice potency and writing quality so that we can broaden our view of potential paradigms for automatic essay scoring systems and overall writing assessment, suggested by Yoon (2017) as well. In doing so we recommend a measurement range to be representative of quality writing so that we can compare the obtained results of the specific rubrics which differ on account of different genres, disciplines, and cultures. Furthermore, we need to determine who is writing the piece and for whom the writing act is performed. Therefore, we perceive, specifications of the audience and the author should both be considered in measuring the quality of writing. Recently, empirical diachronic studies (Hyland & Jiang, 2016a, 2016b, 2017, 2018) reveal that there are extraordinary evolutions in academic writing of different disciplines as to the projection of voice. Scholars of hard disciplines subscribe to the use of more informal language, using such indicators as personal pronouns and reader mentions, which has led to a stronger personal voice, while there is an opposite trend in soft disciplines. Likewise, more empirical investigations remain to be done around personal and social voices in L1/L2/multilingual writing contexts from the perspectives mentioned in this study to let more theoretical theories of voice be formulated based on such robust research. Moreover, how writers’ voice changes over time across the disciplines needs to be further explored as well. In so doing, a better understanding is likely to be gained of the complicated picture of voice construction involved in written discourse.

# 作者身份构建回溯：学术书面语篇中的立场、话语、自我和身份

李映 邓鹂鸣 武汉大学 327

近年来学术语篇研究揭示写作与作者身份构建之间有着紧密联系，然而，有关作者身份研究常见术语不仅往往不加区分互为使用，而且在使用中造成误解。有鉴于此，本研究旨在梳理有关作者身份研究常见的四个关键术语，即立场、话语、自我和身份，从而区分它们在学术书面语篇各自不同的作用以及彼此之间的相互关系，因此可为学术语篇教学与研究及学术语篇作者身份构建探讨提供启示。

# 重新审视书面语篇中的个人声音与社会声音

法特梅·巴格里 邓鹂鸣 武汉大学 . 345

近几十年来，声音一直是学术语篇讨论的议题。然而，对于影响作者个人或社会声音构建的维度尚缺乏统一的审视。本文通过对相关文献进行批判性回顾，提出声音构建的五个主要维度，即语体、过渡、文化、学科以及读者。该研究进一步佐证了声音既是个人的也是社会的，同时研究提出了综合性分析框架并为学术写作教学提供了启示。

# 中国硕士学生引用行为身份构建

刘庆荣 邓鹂鸣 武汉大学.. 365

本文以Burgess和Ivanič’s（2010）的作者身份话语构建框架为基础，探讨了中国英语学习者在硕士论文写作中引用行为和身份构建的交互关系。研究采用文本分析与访谈相结合的混合研究法，考察中国英语学习者的硕士论文引用特征及其通过引用选择所构建的身份。研究发现，学生的引用选择反映了其语言身份、学术和学科身份以及新手身份，其引用行为给读者展示了不同的话语身份。通过调整参考文献的数量和相关性，学生试图构建一个博学、可信的自我。而无效引用和无效参考文献的使用不仅给读者留下负面印象，而且表明学生对作者身份的缺乏。本研究对学术英语教学和论文指导有着重要启示。

# 基于语料库的中国英语学习者和国际学者学术写作立场概括性对比研究

刘应亮 柳加英 武汉理工大学外国语学院 386

作者立场方面的研究大多聚焦于学生学术写作的确定性特点，但鲜有研究关注学生学术立场中的概括性特征。本研究采用语料库研究方法，通过与国际学者对比，旨在探讨中国学生学术写作立场中的概括性特征。研究发现，中国学生在学术写作中使用的概括性标记显著多于国际学者，而国际学者明显使用了更多的限制性概括标记。此外，尽管对概括性特征的功能偏好相似，中国学生和国际学者在概括性标记的关注点和限制性概括标记的分布方面存在明显差异。研究结
