# 1 INTRODUCTION

ChatGPT is a generative AI-enabled chatbot that can generate outputs responding to varied and complex prompts (e.g., languages, instructions, questions) and engage in sustained humanlike interactions. Scholars have reported on the pedagogical benefits of using ChatGPT for language teaching and learning, including acting as a conversation partner and reference tool (Kohnke et al., 2023), creating lesson plans and task-based activities (Hong, 2023), providing tailored feedback on students' written work (Barrot, 2023), and assisting the writing process (e.g., idea generation, drafting, revising, editing and evaluating; Yan, 2023). Equally, the same scholars have warned of the risks to academic integrity and student learning of using ChatGPT (e.g. Yan, 2023). Therefore, for learners to be able to use AI chatbots productively, they need to be aware of the functions of the tool and understand how to interact with them effectively (e.g., construct appropriate prompts and responses; Hockly, 2023; Yeo, 2023). They must also be aware of the tools' limitations and know how to use them critically. For instance, being aware that chatbots can provide biased and untruthful responses (Akgun & Greenhow, 2022), that using these tools for certain tasks could be considered plagiarism (Yan, 2023), and that learners could become over-reliant on the tools in completing tasks, thus limiting opportunities for learning (Kohnke et al., 2023).

Due to the release of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, there is a pressing need for school-age learners to develop digital competencies (Cervera & Caena, 2022). It has been argued that all teachers, including English language teachers, have a responsibility to support their learners to become competent and critically aware digital users and citizens (UNICEF, 2023). Consistent with this concept, this article reports on practitioner research conducted by a secondary school English language teacher in the Philippines (the first author) that aimed to explore how to develop secondary school English language learners' critical and productive use of ChatGPT.

In this article, we begin by describing how the teacher implemented the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. We then reflect on its use, including students' voices on using ChatGPT in their English language learning.

# 2 THE USE OF CHATGPT

This practitioner research was carried out by the first author in a public secondary school situated at a relocation site, with learners coming from various parts of the Philippines. The class chosen had 49 learners (see Table 1 for age groups and gender) with intermediate English proficiency. To understand the needs of learners pertaining to the use of ChatGPT, we conducted a pre-intervention survey (see Appendix 1). The survey found that $8 7 \%$ of learners expressed a lack of familiarity with ChatGPT; however, all the students expressed eagerness to learn more about it (see Table 2). Pseudonyms are used for student participants (i.e., Angel, Remmy, Mich, and Nathan).

To scaffold students' introduction to ChatGPT, we developed a four-lesson sequence following the I-D-E-A (introduction, development, engagement, assimilation) instructional process (Department of Education - CALABARzON, 2020; see Appendix 2). The sequence includes a number of scaffolded experiential activities that help students learn through doing. The theme of travel was adopted with students engaging in roleplay with ChatGPT tasked with being a hotel receptionist. To align the research with the syllabus, the lesson's language aim was to develop students' ability to pose written questions. The lessons were conducted in April 2023.

# 3 REFLECTION ON THE USE OF CHATGPT

To understand the impact of the lessons, various data sources were utilized (see Table 3). Findings from the post-intervention survey, students' interactions on ChatGPT, and the teacher's observations and self-reflection shed light on how teachers can introduce the productive and critical use of ChatGPT to language learners.

# 3.1 Productive use of ChatGPT

During the introductory experiential activity the students were tasked with interacting with ChatGPT as a traveler to their town. The collected interactions on ChatGPT showed that students struggled to interact with the chatbot. The questions asked were not specific enough and ChatGPT gave generic and standard responses (see Figure 1).

After the teacher introduced strategies to interact with ChatGPT, specifically how to create prompts, the students were able to interact more smoothly with it. The teacher discussed how the chatbot can take up roles (e.g., receptionist), and that students need to provide more contextual information (e.g., Manila) in the prompts. This led to more relevant interactions (see Figure 2).

Students' responses in the post-intervention survey showed they gained a greater understanding of the utility of ChatGPT. For example, Angel and Remmy wrote as follows:

Before the intervention, I was already using this site for coding, scripts, and other purposes. However, after the intervention, I found that we may use it for a variety of purposes, such as answering common or challenging questions, delving into complex subjects, and other things.

(Angel)

Since I didn't use ChatGPT before, my only idea about this tool is it can only be used for conversation because of the word \*chat' but after our teacher introduced it to us,

FIGURE 3 Example interaction with ChatGPT providing an inaccurate response.

I found that this AI is very responsive to our questions, and also polite if it doesn't answer our questions. (Remmy)

# 3.2 Critical use of ChatGPT

Using scaffolded experimental activities provided students with the opportunities to experience and discuss some of the limitations of ChatGPT. For instance, when students attempted to ask questions as a traveler to the city their school was located in Brgy, Pinugay in Baras, the responses, while seeming to be authoritative and correct, were factually inaccurate. ChatGPT provided hotels in a nearby city, and not Baras (see Figure 3). However, when the capital of the Philippines, Manila, was used, it was able to generate more accurate responses (see Figure 4). The teacher used this example to discuss the data set ChatGPT draws on and that it presents information from specific contexts.

Students also became aware that ChatGPT could not provide real-time information. When they inquired about hotels, the chatbot alerted them that it could not guarantee the accuracy of the information it provided. It can only suggest rather than provide instantaneous information (see Figure 5). During the class discussions, some students pointed this out. For example, Nathan said, "What I got was new knowledge regarding ChatGPT; it has limitations, and it should be necessary that my question be clear and concise.' Mich stated that "ChatGPT has limited information and also it cannot book a hotel reservation."

Again, this allowed the teacher to facilitate a discussion around the limitations of ChatGPT. Students were reminded to verify any responses with other methods, such as internet searches or using ChatGPT to engage in "fictitious roleplay" rather than rely on it for real information.

# 4 CONCLUSION

Generative AI tools have become a major disruptor to education globally (Moorhouse et al., 2023). This practitioner research suggests that ChatGPT can be a useful tool for students to practice second-language interactions. It can take up the role of an interlocutor and can maintain interactions with learners. Importantly, learners need to have specific skills to use ChatGPT for language practice (Kohnke et al., 2023). The findings imply that by using scaffolded experimental activities, teachers can help learners develop the skills needed to use ChatGPT productively and critically, thereby increasing the potential benefits ChatGPT can provide to language learners. We suggest that teachers should develop activities designed to introduce the use of ChatGPT to their learners. Our study can act as a starting point in helping teachers consider how to introduce the tool in their classrooms.

This study was limited to one class of learners in one context and conducted over a short period. It is important that other language teachers explore how ChatGPT can be further utilized for language teaching with different groups of learners in diverse contexts. As generative AI tools are an emerging technology, studies must look at the benefits and pitfalls of using them in language teaching and learning.
