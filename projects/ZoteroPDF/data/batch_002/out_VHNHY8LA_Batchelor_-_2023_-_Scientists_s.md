The research article (RA) has held unparalleled importance in several fields of applied linguistics but is only one genre among many that researchers produce and readers consume. This study compares RAs with a related genre called popular science.' More linguistic-oriented research of popular science genres is needed to account for the growing body of contemporary popular science discourse. This study collected 400 matching professional and popular science articles published online to compare their use of three lexicogrammatical patterns that often function to perform attribution. Results showed that the popular science texts were denser with attribution, often named human authors within instances of attribution, and utilized reporting verbs with a neutral or positive evaluative stance. This study argues that, while the function of attribution in RAs is to build ethos and build an argument through identifying a gap in previous literature, attribution in science news articles functions to portray study authors as the main actors in research stories and portray popular science writers as objective, though at times supportive, reporters of recent news, highlighting the journalistic function of this variety of popular science.

# 1. Introduction

Scientific genres, especially the research article (RA), have held unparalled importance in several fields of applied linguistics (Samraj, 2016). However, the RA represents only one genre among many that researchers produce and readers consume. Scholars have recently shown increased interest in downstream' scientific genres, that i communicative events wherein the language producer has less specialized knowledge of the topic, the intended audience extends beyond esoteric academic communities, and the language tends to be lessprecise and technical (Hilgartner, 1990. These communicative events are often referred to as popular science (Calsimiglia Van Dijk, 2004). Because of the parallels between popular and professional science, several studies have compared the two genres to understand their linguistic and rhetorical features (e.g., Hyland, 2010; Zhang, 2015).

Despite growing interest, more research is needed on popular science genres. One reason is that some corpora adopted in previous studies were under-described or to smal to produce generalizable findings. Large publi corpora, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (CocA), the British National Corpus (BNC), and the International Corpus of English (ICE), have been used in previous studies (e.g., Larsson, 2019; Liu & Deng, 2017; Zhang, 2015), but description of how these texts fit within the broad rubric of popular science is not always clear. In other cases, corpora are small (e.g, Csongor & Rebek-Nagy, 2012) or highly specific (e.g., Calsamiglia & VanDijk, 2004), limitig their generalizabilit. Aditionally, the wide ary of contexts examined (e.g., online science videos in Luzon (2019) and science podcasts in Ye (2021) means that most contexts sill have research gaps that can be filled.

There is a need for research targeting contemporary sources of written popular science, as well-known sources like New Scientist and Scientific American are well represented in the literature. The increasing discourse on the Intenet means that the number of resources available to study popular science writing has also increased. A second nee is to describe more linguisic features of this discourse. Studies of the expanding contexts of science communication have largely taken a rhetorical perspective (Perez-Llantada, 2021), and among the available grammatical studies, many have examined aspects of meta-discourse (e.g., Fu & Hyland, 2014).

The purpose of this study is to complement the growing literature by investigating a less examined feature, namely attribution practices, acos newl collected corora of science nws articles and RAs. Atribution, or mtlingistic rereentations of the ideasof external sources (Thomas & Hawes, 1994), has bee fruitul rearch item for specialists of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) as attriuting ideas to others is both vital to success inacademic writing and difficult (Thompon & Ye, 1991). Thus, examining the attribution practices of popular and professional science genres may provide useful insights for EAP researchers and practitioners.

Below, I review relevant literature on popular science and attribution in academic writing. Then, I present this study's research questions.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Contexts of popular and professional science communicatior

Science communication can be described as a spectrum of communicative events defined by situational characteristics. Hilgartner's (1990) metaphor of 'upstream' and 'downstream' science is a useful illustration here (Fig. 1)

Contexts of science communication can be roughly located in this stream by describing their characteristics, such as who the author is, who the intended audience is, and the quality of the content. As Fig. 1 suggests, what may be considered more popular contexts, such as science news and pres reports, are further downstream, since the intended audience includes readers with varied knowledge of the subject matter and authors may be scientists or non-scintists. Academic contexts, such as conferences and RAs, are further upstream since the intended audience has more specialized knowledge of the topics and the authors tend to be the researchers. While this distinction is simplified, I will continue to use popular science to refer to downstream contexs and professional science' to refer to upstream contexts, as these terms are economical and widely used.

Contexts of popular science have been of interest to many scholars. Applied ingusts have taken discourse analytic approaches to investigate ocal and global features. One of the earliest studies to speak on the language of popular science was Adams-Smith (1987), who analyzed a few matching pairs of medical professional and popular artice, noting that technical tems were replaced by everyday language, tentativenessrlaced by certainty, and the passive voice replaced by active. Recent research adds support to these claims. For example, various studies have found that popular texts use less passive voice (Seoane & Suarez-Gomez, 2020), less academic vocabulary (Munoz, 2015), and less complex noun phrases (Larsson & Kaatari, 2020) than RAs.

Other cholars have sought to compare the use of metadiscoursal features across popular and professional texts, with a particular focus on testing the hypothesis that popular texts replace tentativeness with certainty (e.g., Csongor & Rebek-Nagy, 2012; Fu & Hyland, 2014; Varttla, 1999. Metadiscourse emphasizes the idea that academic communication is not just an exchange of information but rather reflects language users' personalities attitudes, and stance (Hyland, 2005). Though these studies provide mixed evidence, the consensus is that popular texts hedge les and communicate a confident, supportive tone, thereby presenting science differently than RAs.

Other work has investigated global features, such as move-step analyses of online crowdfunding proposals (Mehlenbacher, 2017) and science podcasts (Ye, 2021). Nwogu's (1991) analysis of popular magazine articles reported that these texts showed a similar organization to jounalisic writing, including hooking readers into a story, providing details, and ending with an evaluation of the story. Indeed, a handful of studies have observed how pop text can resemble a hybrid between professional science and journalism (e. g., Larsson & Kaatari, 2020).

Conclusions from this iterature highlight textual differences between popular and professional science texts and link those differences to ideological and pedagogical implications. Hyland (2010), for example, cautions that dfferences between professional and popular texts make the lattr a poor model of th former. However, he goes on to say that, comparisons [. can have an important consciousnes raising function by highlighting features of scientific discourse for learner noticing," which \*may help students see something of the importance of audience" (p. 126).In other words, while an imperfect mirror of one another, contexts of popular science may nonethelessprovide students, be they English Language Learners (ELLs) or otherwise, with useful tols for interacting with professional science discourse.

Parkinson and Adendorff (2004) come to asimilar conclusion. They find that popular science writers focus on human participants ffer in citation methods, avoid passive voice, and use more informal language relative to professional science. They conclude that, [P]opular texts can be said to represent poor models for students. However, besides usually being easier in terms of content and thus making for a suitable first reading/introduction to a topic, we believe that popular texts may be valuable both in the teaching of science and in the teaching of scientific writing. (p. 391-392)

To summarize, scholars have shown that popular science texts share important differences with professonal science, but that these differences may offer certain affordances (.., Hyland, 2010; Pelger & Nilsson, 2016). leser investigated area in popular science writing is attribution practice. Acknowledging the external sources of research is a salient and dificul fatur for many students (Swales, 1990), as i requires complex decisins that reveal the writer's stance toward the propositions. Moreover, who one chooses to cite, how they cite them, and how they evaluate the cited information provides insight into the ideological features of the genre (Calsamiglia & Ferrero, 2003).

Below, I review relevant litrature on attribution in academic writing, before turning to reviews of lexicogrammatical patterns ol attribution and the reporting verbs used in them.

# 2.2. Attribution in academic writing

# 2.2.1. Attribution in academic writing

Put simply, attribution refers to the ways that writers give credit to external source for the ideas present in the writing. Although there was research prior to Wwales, Swales early work on RA introductions brought aribution practices into the spotight in AP and ushered in a large body of research around this concept (Pecorari, 2013). Swales introduced the now-standard method of classifying citations as integral, where the citation has syntactic role in the clause, or non-integral, where they do not. He also llustrated how citation practices interact with the moves and steps of introductions, linking these practices with functional purpose. According to Hyland (2002), by reporting the ideas of others, "a writer simultaneously accomplishes a number of rhetorical objectives," such as displaying allegiance to certain communities, garnering ethos, and identifying a problem in the literature (p. 115).

Research quickly coalesced around 'reporting verbs, or the verbs used within atribution. From the start, these scholars acknowledged that the choice of reporting verb has an evaluative dimension. An early and influential taxonomy was presented by Thompson and Ye (1991), later followed by Thomas and Hawes (1994) and Hyland (202). While each study offers a new contribution, their reporting verb taxonomies show some similarities. Examples are given below.

0 Real-world/research/experimental acts: analyze, demonstrate, discover, evaluate, examine, explore, find, notice, observe, show Discourse/textual acts: caution, conclude, indicate, maintain, note, report, point out, state, suggest, write Cognition/mental acts: assume, believe, conceptualize, consider, focus on, recognize, regard, suspect think, view

Real-world acts refer to activities or perceptions that take place during theresearch proces (e..,  discovered that ..) discourse acts refer to cncative expressions (,  sgs tht .) and ontive act rfer to metl proses (.,  bliees tat. .) However, the scholars note that many reporting verbs can be used in multiple ways depending on context.

An important take-away from this literature is that reporting verbs allow writersto subtly evaluate the entities that they cite. For example, Thompson and Ye (1991), Thomas and Hawes (1994), and Hyland (2002) highlight the capacity of writers to use reporting verbs to present propositions as factual or non-factual, agreable or disagreeable, or simply neutral. Another important mesag is that reporting verbs vary across discipline (Hyland, 2002). Soft knowledge' fields tend to use more Discourse Acts, where writers can express their stance toward past rsearch and thereby create a more argumentative style of discourse, whereas natural and physical sciences frequently use Research Acts, owing to their empirical nature of knowledge development.

For the remainder fthis paper, I fllow Thompson and Ye (1991) in referring to the writer of a report as writer and the aributed entity as 'author'. For example, the writer of (1) is the real-life author of Pop $\# 3 0 6$ (a science news article), while the team, a noun phrase in the sentence, is the author.

(1) Across two summers, in 2018 and 2019, the team found the soil produced four times more greenhouse gas emissions than standing dead trees. (Pop $\# 3 0 6$

Distinguishing between the writer and author is important because writer attribute information to authors, and thus the twc entities are distinct.

# 2.2.2. Three lexicogrammatical patterns of attribution

While previous research has typically identified attrbution in academic writing by searching firstfor citations and then their surrounding contexts (e.g., Hyland, 2002; Pickard, 1995), Charles (2006) builds of the work of Hunston and colleagues to identify instances of reports by identfying certain lexicogrammatical patterns and sifig through returned sentences for attribution. Charles refers to thee instnces of ibution as arch reorts (RRs), or orts wth  source which i frenceth work of thers in the field" (p. 312). I use the terms research report, report, and attribution interchangeably in this paper to refer to the assigning of words or ideas related to academic research to an author by the writer(s).

According to Charles, two pattrns oft used in RRs include verbs with finite that complement clauses [v (that)] and anticipatory it clauses with that complement clauses [it BE v (that)], where (that) indicates that the complementizer is optional. As Thompson (1996)

points out, attribution can be found across a varity of patterns. A third pattern that is often used to attribute information i the complex preposition according to (e.g., according to the CDC) (Biber et al., 1999, p. 973). Examples of these three patterns used are shown below.

$\bullet$ Lee and Moon hope that it can help them analyze other historicallysignificant solar storms captured i other sunspot sketches. (that)]   
$\bullet$ It's suggested that people who are more easily influenced by marketing tactics would be more at risk of becoming obese.it BE V (that)]   
$\bullet$ According to the ICAP framework, learning by explaining as implemented in the present study falls under the constructive level. [according to]

These three patterns of attribution are useful for this study in particular for two reasons. First, they are amenable to computational searches. Thus, identfying attribution via validated lexicogrammatical patens allows this study to more easil identify RRs in larger corpora. Second, they offer a method for identifying RRs without relying on academic-style citation, such as American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA), which not all scientific genres use.

# 2.3. Research questions

I adopted the abovethree lexicogrammatical paterns, namely  (that), it E that), and according to, to investigate RRs across two corpora of science communication, namely online science news artices representing popular science, and research articles, representing professional science. In doing so, I seek to answer the following research questions.

1. How does the overall use ofRRs and the ways they are expressed in writing compare across the corpora in terms ofrequency?   
2. How do the authors of RRs compare acros the corpora in terms of frequency, particularly with regard to animacy?   
3. How do the reporting verbs used in RRs compare across the corpora in terms of frequency and pragmatic function?

# 3. Materials and methods

# 3.1. Corpus collection

Two matching corpora were collected. The first corpus, the pop corpus', includes written texts from online science news websites that reviewed recently published research. The social media wesit Reddit, specifically a forum called \*r/cience," was examined to identify popular science sources frequently shared there y users. In winter 2022, I reviewed several of the recently shared sources to identify those which reglarly published free online artices that review recenty published reearch. From this review, I selected eight sources which covered four topical categories frequently attested in popular science writing, namely the environment, health, psychology, and astronomy. 50 texts from each source were collecte, resulting in acorpus of 400 texts. The corpus was balanced such that no single writer could contribute more than 10 texts, or $2 . 5 \%$ , to the corpus.

The second corpus, called the RA corpus', is comprised of published RAs covering the same topics. That is since each popular article principally reviewed one RA, each of these RAs were then collected resulting in a orpus of 400 RAs. A description of the corpora is shown in Table 1.

As Table 1 show, most texts were published between the years 2020 and 2021. The popular articles tended to be short, with an average of about 700 words, while the RAs were quite longer at about 5000 words. The RAs were published in ${ \sim } 2 5 0$ different journals, compared to the 8 sources that the popular texts were gathered from. Appendix A lists these 8 sources.

# 3.2. Identifying the three patterns in the corpora

To identify RRs, the programming language Python and package spaCy (v.3.2) was used to part-of-speech tag and syntactically parse the corpora. SpaCy reports tagging and parsing accuracy rates in the mid. $9 0 \%$ range (Facts & Figures, n. d.). Scripts utilizing spaCy's rule-based matcher, which makes use of part-of-speech and syntactic information to identify custom pattrns in text, were written to identify all instances of v (that), it BE v (that), and according to, which were then reviewed for accuracy.

Afer manually reviewing and removing certain items (e.g., instances of v (that) clauses introduced by wh complementizers),a random sample of $2 0 \%$ of all v (that) instances and all instances of the other two patterns were analyzed for accuracy. V (that) patterns were found to be $9 3 \%$ accurate on 326 instances for the pop corpus and $9 4 \%$ on 1431 instances for the RA corpus. Because there were fewer instances of the BE v (that) and according to patterns, all were reviewed and found to be $1 0 0 \%$ accurate.

# 3.3. Differentiating RRs from non-RRs

RRs were defined as clauses which atributed research-relevant information to external entities and not solely to the writer themselves. In previous reearch, categorie ased on citation style were used to categorize rports. However, because the science news articles used in this study were found not to use academic-stlecitation, additional categories had to be developed. These are described below.

Deixis. This category includes the use f (pronouns to refer back to previous RRs. These instances occur anywhere but the start f a chain of reference. Hence, the authors of these clauses only make sense in the context of previously introduced material. Deixis often incudes common nouns detmined by definte determiners (e., th study shows .), third peron pronouns (e.g., thy arge that .), or Other common nouns referring to previously established research, regardles of determiner (e.g., results sugested tht ..

Citation. This category includes the use of integral or non-integral citations to aribute a proposition to someone/thing. A third subtype was creat for this stdy, called intia citation' Intial citations have a syntactic role in the clause, but the name of the uthr is replace y ommonou, uuly reerring to a sigle study , ew sty published n.. They nerally occr first in a chain of reference and will later be cited in detail.

General reference. This category refersto RRs that atribute propositions to a broad, non-specific group of people or entity. The uthors rfer to scientists, reearch, knowledge, or schools of thought, and are often plural common nouns scinis have lon thought .., r  la tt citato ii l  t..) o th sie (   thot tt... a re diffes from other categories largely in that it is not possible to identify any specific author.

Quotation. Finall, this category reports the exact words of an author with quotation marks. Based on a qualitative review of returned instances, a minimum of 5 words was required to be considered as a quotation, to avoid including short terminology bookended by quotation marks. Both clauses that entirely comprise quotation (\*we show conclusively that .\*) and clauses which only include partial quotation (e.g., the researchers argue that " .-.") were included.

When categorizing RRs, an order of operations was determined such that quotation supersedes ll other categories, followed by citation. So, for example, if a single R included a quotation, citation, and general reference all in one sentence/clause, it would be coded as quotation. But f the quotation was removed from the report, it would then be coded as the citation sub-type. Finall, if both the quotation and citation were removed from the report, then it would be coded as an instance of general reference. Consider the following report as an example.

D It's been thought that f there is an oxygen atmosphere, there's a good chance then there was photosynthesis," Zinder says.

This report could be clasified onef two waysither as an example of quotation, since the direct reporting f seech is present, or as an example of neral reference, sinc the it B (that pan s present. But accordng to the above order of opeations, this would first be clasified as a quotation. If the quotation marks and Zinder ays" clause were removed, it would become a general reference Finally, because of the large number of that omplement clauses in the corpora (over 10,00 in total), it was not possble tocode al instances. Instead, to provide n estimation of the true rate, allinstance of the patte were put in a randm order and reiewed, one. by-one, until 800 instances functioning as Rs were identified. The pop corpus showed a rate of 4.7 v that Rs per 100 words (ptw) (see section 4.1). This was calculated by multiplying the ratio of RRs to all instances that needed to be reviewed to reach 800 by the total number of v (that) paterns in the corpus. This number was then divided by the word count of the corpus and multiplied by 1000 and was performed for both the pop and RA corpus..

# 4. Results & discussion

# 4.1. Comparing the frequencies of RR patterns across the corpora

First, I report on the frequencies of use of the three lexicogrammatical patterns in either corpus (Table 2).

The frequencies shown in Table 2 sugges certain differences between the genres. First, the practice of attributing words and ideas to others, inthis case words and ideas related to reearch, was much more frequent in the popular science corpus, occurring about five times more ofen there relative to the RA corpus, suggesting that authors of these texts rely heavily on attributing the content of thir articles to other pople or objects. Additionall, the corpora show different prfrences for the thre lexcogrammatical. While v (that) patterns were most common overall they were much more frequent in the popular science articles, as was the according to patten though to a less severe extent. By contrast, the it BE v (that) pattern was marginally more frequent in the RAs.

The preference for the tht) patten in popular science articles andthe it BE (tht) patten in RAs reflets the different ways each gere is organized. inite complement clauses, of which that lauses are the most common (Biber e al., 1999 p.754), reflect a lausal complexity preferred by conversational-style genres (Biber & Gray, 2016, p. 62). As a result, these structures are thought to be less complex and easier to produce (Biber et al., 2011), potentially making the articles more accessble to readers. Extraposed that clauses (i.e., the it BE (that) paten) by contrast i preferred by academic writer (iber & Gray, 2016, p. 81) and considerably more complex (Biber et al., 2011). In short, these distibutions suggest that popular science articles rely on patterns that are es complex and arguably easier to consume.

Next, I compared the ways that Rs were expressed in the writing of the two corpora, namely the four sub-types described in section 3.3 (Table 3).

Table 3 helps us understand how popular science writers perform aribution. While RAs rely most upon citation, popular scienc writers utilize a wider variety of methods. Consider the following excerpt from a pop article.

(1) In the coming century, scientists predict enormous swathes of land will be regularly inundated by water. By 2100, if we have failed to put up defences and do nothing to curb our global emissions, new research has found coastal flooding could increase by nearly 50 percent. \*We are attempting to understand the magnitude of the global scale impacts of future coastal flooding, engineer Ian Young, from the University of Melbourne in Australia, told CNBC. (Pop $\# 3 0 5$

Each of the thre sentence in this excert represents an RR. The first two sentences iclude an instance of the (that) pattern (i. sciss pc.., w rehs foud..), an t thir istin las re the subet (ngier n ug.. an r (told) follow the reported that clause. Many texts in the pop corpus look like this excerpt does: Thetext begins with brief context introducing the article's general topic, sometimes using general reference, which is followed by an instance of initial citation to introduce the particular study that the article will report on. Later in the text, the writer can continue to reference this intial citation with deixis or direct quotations.

Elaborating on the words or ideas of asingle person or study is rare in RAs, which tend to summarize several citations in a small space without belaboring any one study at length (Pickard, 1995). In doing so, RA writers generalize knowledge acros multiple citations, saving space and allowing them to comment on the litrature more easily (Hyland & Jiang, 2019). Consider the following extract from the RA corpus.

(2) Findings of the study conducted by the Eggermont (2004) shows the significant assciation between television viewing and the desirability of physicalattractiveness and a pleasant personality in a romantic partner. Study conducted by Sorathiya and Gala (2015) argues that the role of Bollywood movies is not just limited to entertainment of young people but it also affects their thought processes. There are plenty of studies that have systematically investgated different types of romantic media content (romantic movies, reality programs, soap operas) and its impact on the partners in the romantic relationship (Coyne et al., 2011; Ribarsky, 2014; Gamble & Nelson, 2016). (RA #262)

This excerpt from a psychology RA shows three RRs in three sentences. The first two sentences name the authors of a study, couching them in nominal post-modifier, and the third sentence summarizes over three studies placed in parentheses at the end of the sentence. By organizing s this way, the RA writers cover a lot of argumentative ground in lttle space reerencing five studies which contribute to their argument on the effects of media on young people's conception of romantic relationships.

By contrast, pop writer tend to review previous literature using general reference, which describes the current or past state of

Like non-integral citation in RAs, general references ike this one are economical devices that alow the pop writer to very briefly indicate what the majority of an academic field once thought or currentl thinks. However, this choice may have consequences. For example, researchers have criticized the lack of adequate background information given in science news article, which in turn can sensationalize the study in focus because it does not illstrate how it fits into a larger body of work (Pellechia, 1997, p. 52)

# 4.2. Comparing the authors of RRs

Following Charle (2006), I also examined the authors of RRs for whether they were human or non-human. This analysis excludes it BE v (that) patterns, since authors of these sentences are not always stated in the clause. Table 4 reports the frequency of human and non-human authors, as well as the most common authors in either corpus.

Table 4 reveals one of the most important ifferences between the two genres. That is, pop writes typicallyattribute RRs to human authors and RA writers typically attribute RRs to non-human authors. Consider the following two examples.

(4) The authors also say these black holes would likely emit large amounts of X-rays, gamma rays, or even radio waves. Pop $\# 1 3 0$   
(5) Indeed, the rapidly growing literature on relational values recognizes that human-nature relationships can be valued in their own right, in ways distinct from the instrumental and intrinsic value framings common in Western research [69, 70]. (RA #171)

The pop writer f(4)attributes thereport to the authors, the Rs subject and author. The RA writer of (5) attributes the report to the rapidly growing iteature on relational value, an inanimate author. Parkinson and Adendorf (2004) attribute the density of human authors in popular science writing to two purposes: framing scientific knowledge as a debate among stake holders and withholding writer evaluation of cited material. In other words, writers of popular articles can avoid commenting upon the truth value of scientific claims by atributing those claims to others. RA writers, on the other hand, may be les reticent to make subtle, evaluative remarks about previous resarch Moreover, the tendency for RAs to utilize non-integal ciation means that they can refer tothe human authors of past research by placing them within parentheses or in a footnote.

Other than common nouns, the inclusive first-person pronoun we was also among the most frequent in the pop corpus. In this position, we functioned similarly to rearchers in example (3), namely to report gneral reference by taking stock of what humanity has learned (6) or was spoken by a researcher and quoted in the article (7).

(6) Today too, we know that subsurface life is common. (Pop $\# 3 6 0 $ (7) \*We've assumed that ice ages have been the key thing in making the Sahara dry versus wet' (Pop #374)

# 4.3.  Comparing the reporting verbs of RRs

Table 5 displays the reporting verbs of (that) and it BE (that) patterns by the three major reporting verb categories. The accordin to pattern was excluded from this analysis since the main verb does not control the author, which in fact is the noun phras.

complementing the preposition according to rather than the subject of the clause.

Table 5 reflects both similaritie and differences in the choice of reporting verbs between the genres. Specifically, both corpora relied on Discourse Acts to a similar extent, making up a little over $4 0 \%$ of RRs with v (that) and it BE v (that) patterns. However, the pop science articles relied on Cognition Acts more ofen and, consequentl, research acts les often than RAs. Below, I explore these Acts in more detail.

# 4.3.1. Discourse acts

Discourse Acts frame RRs as spoken or written expressins made by the author. These Acts were used with similar frequency in both corpora, but the most common verbs in either corpus suggest differences (Table 6).

Table 6 reflects some well-known Discourse Acts, such as suggest, indicate, and argue. However, therelative frequencies with which these verbs were used differ. For example, the proportional use of suggest is about $1 0 \%$ less in the pop corpus, likely because say occurred so frequently. Say has astraight-forward use for journalistic genres, as writers oten interview or otherwise directly quote their article's subjects (Hyland, 2005, p. 97). In the pop corpus, say and other Discourse Acts in the v (that) patten largely served to paraphrase the author's words or ideas, as example (8) illustrates.

(8) The team says they hope to begin human clinical trials of the new contraceptive drug delivery system within the next three to five years. (Pop $\# 2 9$

The frequent use say can be seen as an otherwise unremarkable method of paraphrase, but in the context of reporting verbs it allows the writer to withhold themselves from the interpretation of the proposition. That is say positions the writer as an objective reporter of what was truthfully said without commenting on or interpreting its content.

Say reflects a greater trend in the evaluative potential of the preferred Discourse Acts between the genres. The pop corpus frequently used value-neutral (e.g., document, report say) or value-positive (eg, d, argue, explain, note, point out) verbs (Hyland, 2002; Thompson & Ye, 1991), while the RA corpus more greatly preferred verbs expressing tentativenes, namely sugest indicate, and propose (Hyland, 2002). Thus, these genres appear to use Discourse Acts for somewhat diferent pragmatic purposes. Consider the following examples.

(9) Initial work proposed that phospholipids could be synthesized under posible prebiotic conditions (5-7), but the availabilit of the precursor molecules on early Earth was questioned (3, 8). (RA $\# 2 5 9$   
(10) Researchers explain that while these developments are of course culturally important, they can have a negative effect on the forest, and they recommend that such further developments be done with conservation in mind. (Pop $\# 3 9 6$

The RA writer in (9) selected propose to summarize the implications of previous research, portraying the proposal in a less-than. assertive light, as suggested by the added clause beginning with \*but'. By contrast, the Discourse Acts in (10) from a pop article paints the authors words as explanations and recommendations, and in doing so subtly communicates to the reader a greater sense of truthfulness attached to the propositions.

# 4.3.2. Research acts

Writers of both genres relied on a small number of frequent verbs to carry out Research Acts, which represent the greates!

proportion of overall reporting verbs. Similar to past reearch (e.g., Pecorari, 2013), find and show were primarily responsible for the high frequency, making up about $7 0 \%$ of overall instances. Find was most common in the pop corpus, while show most common in the RA corpus.

According to Hyland (2002), show reveals the writer's attitude toward the proposition as positive (i.e, acepting of the proposi. tion), while find is neutral. Indeed, show (11) somtimes portrays a higher level of confidence in the reported proposition than find (12)

(11) Bardeen et al. (2017) showed that high stratospheric temperatures, similar to those observed here, can greatly increase the downwelling infrared energy at the surface. (RA $\# 1 5 3$   
(12) Comparing ice loss shear stres, and seismic records in southwest Alaska from 1920 onwards, researchers found most large earthquakes were linked to long-term earth rebound. (Pop $\# 3 1 7$   
(11) positions the cited findings as factuali.e., researchers uncovered findings which have a particular meaning that the writer agrees with. (12) also reports on study findings but withholds an interpretation of what they mean. Like say, it positions the writer as an objective observer rather than interpreter.

Looking at ther Research Acts beyond find and show, another semantic difference between the genres can be seen. A small group of verbs that highlight the discovery' aspect of science, including find, reveal and discover, were more frequent in the pop corpus (Table 7).

The verbs in Table 7 are more frequent in the pop articles because they increase the newsworthiness of science news. Consider examples (13) and (14) below.

(13) Weber's team discovered that the microbes contained genes which allowed them to interact with the coral surface. (Pop $\# 3 9 1$ (14) A new measurement of a pecific kind of black hole reveals i is so massive it call into question fundamental aspects of stellar evolution. (Pop $\# 1 2 2$

While it is likely that pop writers adopt theseverbs in part to avoid repetition, they also lend to a discourse of newsworthiness and novelty that has been shown in popular science writing (e.g., Fanestock, 1986; Hyland, 2010; Luzon, 2019). RA writrs, on the other hand, tend to report research by using verbs which do not convey such a sense of discovery, such as show $\mathbf { N } = 1 8 7$ $3 9 \%$ , demonstrate $\left( \mathrm { N } = 2 7 \right.$ $5 . 6 \%$ , and estimate $\mathrm { N } = 2 6$ $5 . 4 \%$

# 4.3.3. Cognition Acts

The frequency of Cognition Acts and their specific verbs varied between the genres. In the pop corpus, think $( \mathrm { N } = 4 4 )$ ) and believe (N $= 3 0 $ ) were most common, comprising $4 7 \%$ of all Cognition Acts. On the other hand, know $( \Nu = 1 8 )$ and assume $( \mathrm { N } = 1 5$ ) were most common in the RA corpus, comprising $4 4 \%$ . These verbs present different semantics and evaluative potential and are explored further below.

According to Hyland (2002), think positions the author as having a positive attitude toward the proposition, while believe conveys greater tentativeness. In practice, however, it was ofen difficult to identify this distinction. Consider examples (15) and (16).

(15) And now a team led by scientists from the University of Bergen in Norway thinks they have an answer. (Pop $\# 8 1$ (16) A team of researchers believes they have a way to tackle this phenomenon - but the solution is wildly unpopular. (Pop #37

Both examples appear early in their respective text and serve to introduce the study which the pop article willreport on. Additionally, both clauses position the study as being a solution to a problem. Yet, they use different reporting verbs.

Instead, both think and believe arguably convey tentativeness on the part of the author, especiall relative to other choices. That is they present a proposition as the author's intellctual interpretation, something like an educated guess, as opposed to a certain conclusion. Consider example (17).

(17) The researchers think that only two of the diss observed could potentially host a massive gas giant like Jupiter. (Pop #151)

The use of think, as opposed to another verb like know or show, frames the author's interpretation as an initial (educated) guess Which could be verified with further investigation.The pop corpus's use of thnk and believe may be due to the fact that popular articles report on very recently published research. As a result, not enough time has passed to determine whether the results are conclusive or accepted by the wider research communit, and framing reports as thoughts or beliefs may be useful for describing the research in this

moment of uncertainty.

In the RA corpus, many Cognitive Acts, including think, believe, know and assume, were used in the it BE (that) pattern, whereasthe pop corpus strongly preferred the v (that) pattern. Consider example (18) from an RA.

(18) It i believed that a higher level oftrust in workplace precautions is related to a decline in the focus on the outbreak, which was also in line with our study (23). (RA $\# 1 6 9$

While the t BE v (that) pattern often serves to recount the views held by an academic field (Thomas & Hawes, 1994), the v (that) pattern forces the writer to select a subject who experiences the cognition. Thus, pop artices adopted explicit authors ike we or scientiss, while RAs concealed these authors, either by making no reference to them at all or by packaging them in non-integral citations.

# 5. Conclusions

This study examined atribution practices across two contexts of science communication, namely online science news articles and published research articles. As a functionally and structurally complex task frequent in academic writing, attribution can provide useful insight for scholars of science communication and EAP. Below, I discuss some insights and implications for these groups.

# 5.1. Insights and implications for researching popular science

Ths study showed that online science news articles are relete with attribution. It isclear that  primary function of science news is to report on the words and ideas f others. Additionall, how pop and RA writers attribute nformation shows important ifferences. While RAs oten summarize many authors at once in non-integral citation, popular rticles tend to deliberate lesson previous research and instead focus on the study being reported on in the article. When these writers seek to summarize over previous research, they often do so through general reference with common nouns as the authors (e.g., Researchers first noticed that .

The reporting verbs used in reports suggested additional differences. Popular artice often frame reports as Cognitive Act, perhaps to indicate that a recently published study's implications are not yet set in stone. Cognitive Acts in the RAs were les frequent and largely appeared in the anticipatory it patern, subjugating the author to anon-integral citation or omitting it altogether. In contrast to RAs, reports framed as Discourse Acts in the pop corpus often communicated a positive or neutral evaluation, adding credence to the argument that pop writers tend to be les critical f reearch in order to sl the story. Finally, the topi f newsworthines and novelty in popular science discourse (e.g., Fanestock, 1986; Hyland, 2010; Luzon, 2019) also appeared in this study, as several Research Act verbs common in the pop corpus served to present scientific findings as a wonder' of science by appealing to their novelty and innovation.

In short, differences in the purposes of science news and RAs were reflected in their methods of attribution. Science news articles are journalistic and largely focus on a single study. As aresult, these articles have a high density of RRs, which serve to describe the findings of the study in focus. Additionall, writers are expected to interview study authors and include those quotations in their article, which arguably adds credibility to the article. By contrast, RAs often use RRs to establish credibilit and highlight a problem in the literature that their study will fill. Thus, they fulfill specific functions important to parts of the full RA.

# 5.2. Insights and implications for EAP

A handful of studies have spoken to the usefulness of popular science texts in classrooms with ELLs. Parkinson and Adendorff in particular, warn that popular attribution-style may not be appropriate for the academic tyle' ften required in EAP classrooms. At the same time, echoing Hyland (2010), this difference in stle also has the potentil of raising awareness to how atribution is used differently between the gnres and how those differences reflect functional urose. For exampl, popular science text could be used to examine why these writers tend to use more reorting vers with a netrl or positive stance, strongly prefer the (that) pattern, and rely on more reports overall whereas RA writers in the disciplines covered in this study) tend to atribute a proposition to many sources at once through non-integralcitation, strategically utiliz critical reporting verbs, and use the it BE v (that) patten with a greater proportion. This comparison may lead to discussions about styl, stance, and communicative functions, especially in research writing where there is significant literature to support further discussion and activities (e.g., Swales & Feak, 2012).

In sum, previous research has attested to the importance and difficult of mastering appropriate attribution in academic writing in a second language (Swales, 1990; Thompson & Ye, 1991). Studies have argued that popular science texts may be able to increase audience awareness (Pelger & Nilsson, 2016), genre awarenes (Hyland, 2010), and provide a scaffold for using more dificult professional texts (Parkinson & Adendorff, 2004). The current study shows that popular texts make frequent and varied use of RRs. These texts may ffr a criticl comparioaganst typical tt re like the, as wellas offr practice with iting sctfic reearch y embedding examples in shorter, less complex texts.

# 5.3. Limitations

Finally, there re some limitations that hould be mentioned. First I relied on previous reearch to identify thre exicogrammatical patterns that often function to perform attribution. While these atterns were alo found toperform attribution in thistudy's corpora it is worth noting that they offer only a partial view of all possile ways to arbute words and ideas. Further research may identify other ways of identifying attribution without relying on citations as markers. Second, science communication can be thought of as a spectrum from more professional to more popular texts (see Fig. 1). As a result, no single genre can fully represent professional or popular science writing, including this study's corpora. As a helpful reviewer pointed out, the journal Nature's "News and Views" section in fact tends to use academic-style citation despite being considered a variet of popular science. Thus, this study's findings may only be generalizable to a certain extent of online science news writing and further research is needed to investigate the subtle ways that 'downstream' contexts of science communication differ from one another.
