# ABSTRACT

Keywords:   
Transfer of learning   
Adaptive transfer   
Digital multimodal composition   
Genre knowledge   
Second language writing   
Argumentative writing

Drawing upon adaptive transfer as a conceptual framework, this study aims to investigate adolescent second language (L2) learners' transfer of knowledge across different genres (narratives and arguments) and media (print-based writing and digital multimodal composition). Data were gathered from class observations, interviews, and student artifacts. The collected data were analyzed based on inductive and deductive approaches as well as adaptive transfer. This study demonstrated that adolescent L2 learners applied the prior knowledge learned in narrative writing to argumentative writing, both within and beyond the current program. Another finding in this study is that the participants' knowledge acquired from digital multimodal composition influenced their print-based writing, and vice versa. The current study's demonstration of the transfer across genres and media confirms the existence of adaptive transfer which supports the reshaping of prior knowledge from familiar to unfamiliar contexts. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research and pedagogical implications for L2 teaching and learning.

# 1. Introduction

Students frequently transfer what they have learned in one situation to another, for example from the English arts classto the social studies clas. Transfer of lemin occurs when, asexplained by Perkins and Salomon (1994), ening in one context ehances (positive transfer or undermines (negative transfer) a related pefomance in anothr context (p. 6452). Transfer of eaning issinficant, as it "lies at the heart of our educational system' (Bransford & Schwartz, 199, p. 61). One major objective of any literacy-based pedagogy is transfer of learning, and thus, the topic has received increased attention in both first language (L1) and second language (L2) literacy research (James, 2008; Larsen-Freeman, 2013).

In the field of L2 literacy, two strands of inquiry have traditionally been developed: crosslinguistic and cross-disciplinary transfer. Studies on the former have examined the influence f learners L1 in their L2 (Pavlenko & Jarvis, 2002) and sometimes acros multiple languages (L1, L2, and L3; Kobayashi & Rinert, 2013). Research on the atter has explored how L2 learners transer knowledge across disciplinary contexts, for instance, examining how college L2 learners transfer what they learned about writing essays in an English-for-academic-puroses EAP) clas to discipline-specific lasss (Hansen, 2000; Jwa, 2019), r pecificall, writing literature review in aociology class. Overal, thee transfer studs hae preented valuale insihts on transfer f learning for both practtioners and researchers.

Unfortunatel,transfer often does not seem to occur, which is one of the most challenging issues in researching and teaching transfer of learning (Larsen-Freeman, 2013). This is primarily because learners attempt to merely reuse or directly apply what they have learned in one situation to another, and pursue similarities' whil simultaneously avoiding differences (DePalma & Ringer, 2011. However, transfer does not necessrily indicate that prior knowledge is simply reused in a familiar or similar situation. Additionall, transfer of learning can occur across ether completely different domains, or closely relatd contexts; Hatano and Greeno (199) noted that \*in everyday life, using known concets and methods in a new situation, even across domains, is farly common' (p. 648).

As such, a more recent body of research has recognized the need to reconceptualize transfer of learning (Larsen Freeman, 2013; Leonard & Nowacek, 2016). Notably, in the field of L2 literacy, DePalma and Ringer (2011 offered the notion of adaptive transfer as a conceptual framework. They suggested that transfer research should focus more on the concept of eshaping, which refers to adapting previously learned knowledge to new or unfamiliar situations, rather than simply reusing or directly applying it. Therefore, adaptive transfer sems valuable and ignificant in (reonceptualizing transfer across ifferent kinds of domains, such as transfer acros enres and media as will be observed in the current study.

Transfer acros geres seems vital for understanding L2 learners transfer because they engage in different writig genres about the same topic and may transfer knowledge across genre. For instance, they can write narrative about their personal experience f topic (e.g., online learning during the coviD-19 era), produce expository essays about the topic by addressing is structures and functions, and/or construct argumentative (\*pro" or \*con) papers on the same topic. However, reearch has scarcely addressed how 2 students develop their genre knowledge in the process of adapting to new rhetorical contexts" (Kim & Belcher, 2018, p. 57). Thus, it seems important to explore how they transfer genre knowledge to better understand transfer of learning.

In addition, the ubiquitous use of digital technologies encourages 2 learners to engage in transfer acros media. For instance, in an English as a second language (ESL) or EAP class, they write narrative or argumentative essays on inriguing topics (e.g., artificial intelligence or recycling). ubsequently, they are asked to adapt them to digitlly mediated vide clips, ften called digital multimodal composing (DMC), uploading on social media sie e.g., YouTube) to reach a wider audience. While composing acros media, students may transfer literacy knowledge by using and combining multiple semiotic modes, such as images, music, and texts (Kang, 2021). As such, these two types of transfer (transfer across genres and media) are especially compelling to investigate as they have been prevalent yet underexplored. In short, to full understand L2 leaners transfer of lening acros diverse laning sitations, it seems significant to investigate how they transfer literacy knowledge across genres and media.

# 2. Conceptual framework

DePalma and Ringer (2011) have offered adaptive transfer as a new concept, defined as the conscious or intuitive process of applying or reshaping learned writing knowledge in new and potentially unfamiliar writing situations" (p. 134). Inthis theory, they (re)conceptualize transfer of learning by emphasizing the reshaping or adapting of prior knowledge in new or unfamiliar contexts. To expound adaptive transfer as a theoretical framework, DePalma and Ringer (2011) have suggested six dimensions characterizing this concept: \*ynamic, idosyncratic, cros-ontexual, rhetorical, multilingual, and transformative (p. 141). Adaptive transfer is dynamic because it is asumed that writing knowledge from one context can be reshaped elsewhere. It is also idiosyncratic, in that adaptive transfer is ffeted y such indiual facr as clas, rae, nder, or soc stas. urthr, adative transfer i cossconxal, as it occurs when L2 learners integrate acquired knowledge from a famliar context into an unfamiliar context. Moreover, adaptive transfer is rhetorical because diffrences in their writing occur through not only major factors influencing rhetorical situations, such as the context, audience, and purpose of writing, but also L2 learners strategic and creative choices to attain thir rhetorical objectives. Adaptive transfer isalso multilingual, as linguistic variations in L2 learners languages of origin are always involved in transfer of learning, and it atribute agency to L2 learners to intervene and change writing contexts. Finall, adaptive transfer is transformative because it acknowledges that L2 learners oncepts of literacy practices and writing itslf are constantly ltering. Newcomers in a new literacy community are likely to reshape themselves and thir literacy practices. These six dimensions of adaptive transfer have been offered as "a theoretical orientation' (p. 622) to investigate L2 learners' transfer of learning (DePalma, 2015)

# 3. Literature review

This section explores a body of literature that has investigated the transfer of learning that primaril occurs in the field of L2 literacy in terms of transfer across (1) languages, (2) disciplinary contexts, (3) genres, and (4) media.

# 3.1. Transfer across languages

As previously noted, transfer reearch has tradtionally explored cross-ingistic influences by considering the ful rnge of ways in which a person's knowledge of one language can affect that person's knowledge and use of another language" (Jarvis & Pavlenko, 2008, p. 3). Specificly, cross-linguistic transfer research has explored how L2 leaners can minimize negative transfer and promote positive transfer, especiall from their L1 to L2 (Kang, 2005; Kobayashi & Rinnert, 2008; Kubota, 1998; Simpson, 2000).

Some recent transfer scholars have supported a more positive view of cross-inguistic influence, or tanslingualism. For example,

Canagarajah (2011) noted that the deviations from a language that we se in the usage of multilinguals might be cases of positive transfer rather than negative interference" (p. 413). Translingualism offers a novel perspective on L2 writig, as it always involves diverse contexs and multiple semiotic modes by using codemeshing, which is a strategy for the\*realization of translanguaging in texts' and "accommodates the possbilit of mixing communicative modes and divers symbol systems (other than language) (p. 403). For instance, one college ESL learner participating in his study demonstrated an example of codemeshing by employing a smiling emoticon $( ^ { \mathfrak { s } } \mathfrak { Q } ^ { \mathfrak { s } } )$ in her writing, believing that the symbol can "serve as another language that words may not be the best tool to express" (Canagarajah, 2011, p. 405).

Rinnert et al. (2015) also explored cross-inguistic transfer, notably from the adaptive transfer perspective. They investigated how novice writers of Japanese as a foreign language transferred knowledge across languages to create bothL1 (English) and L2 Japanese) argumentative papers. The participants' \*text construction, including how and what past knowledge they transferred in a new writing context (p. 226) was ultimately controlled by their writing agency. When writing both L1 and L2 argumentative papers, the students assumed the role of gent in asessing audience selecting apropriate text features, and transforming/reshaping selected features' (p. 213). For instance, based on their previous knowledge of language varieties, they purposely voiced \*their opinions in a les forceful way in Japanese" (p. 228), compared to ther argumentative papers in English. Here, L2 learners writing agency appeared to intervene and influence their transfer across languages.

Canagarajah's (2011) study is compelling because it explored how semiotic modes (e.g., emoticons) were used acroslanguages. The study by Rinnert et al. (2015) is also intriguing because it investigated L2 learners' argumentative papers in terms of the multilingual dimension of adaptive transfer to address transfer across languages..

# 3.2. Transfer across disciplinary contexts

The L2 literacy reerch on cros-diciplinry transfer has been influnced by  sitated ening thery, in that lning occur cross contexts (Lave & Wenger, 1991), and transer of learning i not \*simply something an individual does in isolation, but rather depends on social and cultural factors" (Larsen-Freeman, 2013, p. 114). Thus, cros-disciplinary transfer research has primarily examined transfer from L2 learners ESL or EAP clases to their content-specific courses (Hansen, 200; James, 2008, 2010, 2012; Jwa, 2019).

For example, Hansen (2000) observed a Taiwanese graduate student who learned to write for mathematics during an EAP course. As mathematics was the student's authentic field of discourse, she perceived the EAP classas an inauthentic community. She also attempted to write to meet the expectations of the EAP instructor's iscourse community and not her own. Consequently, her written texts were \*inauthentic within her own discourse community and lacked her voice of authority" (p. 27). Hansen (2000) wondered how much of what [an L2 learner] has learned in the EAP course she willvalue enough to use when writing for [authentic] math. ematics" (p. 46). Hansen's (2000) study raised several remarkable isues in terms of knowledge transferability from one context to another.

Similarly, Jwa (2019) explored how two Korean ESL learners transferred knowledge from their ESL-FYC first-year composition) to disciplinary writing contexts in a US university. This study revealed that the degree to which college 2 leaners \*recognize the dif. ference between previous and new writing practices influences how learning transfer occurs" (p. 109). Students' use of prior knowledge depended on their perceived differences and similarities of disciplinary contexts. For example, one participant applied knowledge learned from the ESL-FYC class-or specificall, several rhetorical functions of academic essays' inroduction and conclusion-in a discipline-specific businesscourse, where she wrote a bad-news ltter. She recognized a buffer in the inroductions of both bad-news leters and academic essays as similar because of the similar rhetorical function. In her analysis, she discovered that exclamations (e.g., \*thank you") might be "deliberate eye-catchers as well as functional in easing the reader's mind prior to their arrival a the bad news," which might be "comparable to her usual opening strategie in academic papers' (p. 114). Thus, she chose to transfer this rhetorical function from her academic essay to her business letter, across disciplinary contexts.

Research on cross-disciplinary transfer has contributed to our understanding of how L2 learners transfer knowledge from one context to another. Jwa's (2019) study is particularly intriguing, s it atemted to explore 2 leaners transfer based on differences as well as similarities across disciplinary contexts.

# 3.3. Transfer across genres

Transfer across ifferent writing genres has seldom been investigated in L2/multilingual context, as previously noted. Further, some transfer studies that have attempted to report on the transferring of genre-related knowledge have rarely addressed transfer across different writing nre: nrrative, expository, and amenttive writing. onetheles, ther studies have ofed some insights into transfer across enre. For instance, Shrestha (2017) explored how threecollege students transfer genre features and conceptual knowledge learned in one writing assesment task (p. 3)an academic esay--to another business studie assignment. Although the focus of the study was not on the transfer acros diffrent writing genres, it demonstrated that genre features, such as description, comparison, and explanation, were actuall transferred. The main finding of the study is that dynamic assssment could \*contribute to the transfer of genre features' (p. 1) learned from academic literacy courses to the students' chosen academic field (business)

Kim and Belcher (2018) investigated how four college L2 learners from Korea as exchange students in the US built \*new genre knowledge in the process of participating in L2 rhetorica situations during [their] study abroad' (p. 56). The researchers found that the participants implictly and explicitly used both their L1 and L2 genre knowledge previously learned in Korea, such as the standard five-paragraph essays, to complete their ESL writing assgnments in the US. Hence, Kim and Belcher (2018) explored the rhetorical similarities across L2 learners L1 and L2 with a focus on transfer across languages (rather than transfer across dfferent writing genres). lso, Wilson and Soblo (2020) recetly explored six college-level multilingual writers adaptive transfer across their F class and a subsequent course, in which they were asked to write secondary-source research papers for a chosen topic. Through textual analysis, the authors revealed that the participants transformed and transferred the genre task based on the particular audiences they chose to target" (p. 8) using a range of discursive and generic resources (p. 1). This inriguing study was based on adaptive transfer, but was limited to primarily exploring transfer across similar writing tasks.

Therefore, to obtain a more comprehensive view of transfer of learning, exploring transfer across ifferent writing genres (e.g., transfer between narratives and arguments) isboth timely and critical. As DePalma (2015) has suggested, \*questions regarding the degree to which writers draw from and transform genre knowledge (. 616, emphasis added) acros diffrent writing genre (as well as across languages, disciplinary contexts, and media) should be addressed in transfer research.

# 3.4. Transfer across media

Explorations into L2 learners' transfer across media have recently emerged, especially as they shft from print-based writing to DMC. For example, based on adaptive transfer, DePalma (2015) investigated how both L1 and L2 collge writers transferred multiple literacy knowledge when they remediated their print-based essays into digital storie. One L2 participant had already known how to create tension in music, and integrated her knowledge as a musical composer into writing her esay and designing her digital story to establish dramatic tension and points of climax" (p. 625). Thus, the participant's prior knowledge was reshaped when adapting print-based essays into digita stries, or transfer across media. Similarly, lexander et al. (2016) applied adaptive transer to writing center contexts when exploring transfer acros media. The authors recognized students challenges in converting print-based essays to digital stories, then offered adaptive remediation as a multidimensional approach to assist students' transfer across media, especially from print-based writing to DMC. Adaptive remediation is composed of four elements or strategies: (a) charting, or the practice of exploring texts to decide rhetorical moves; (b) inventorying, or the storing of the multiple semiotic modes and media at one's disposal; (c) coordinating, or analyzing and investigating all \*rhetorical strategies, inventional possibilities, and additional literacies or re sources" (Alexander et al., 2016, p. 35), based on the possile remediation of text; and (d) literacy linking, or the transferrig, integrating, and reshaping of literacy knowledge from one context to another to ensure a proper fit.

Wu (2020) recently explored how, and to what extent, three college English as foreign language (EFL) learners reshaped literacy knowledge for \*digital literacy practices in a Sino-US telecollaboration project" (p. 1), based on adaptive transfer. The participants communicated with their American partners through an asynchronous Internet forum software (phpBB) to complete several English essas and exchange comments in English. u's (2020) study revealed that the students transferred literacy practices acros media, in "a number of contexts: distant (high school), recent (the previous semester), and immediate (the concurrent course and the telecollaboration project)" (p. 11), to increase digital literacy and ultimately communicate both digitlly and virtally. For instance, one participant (Tam) in Wu's (2020) study decided to\*reuse a formulaic expression (looking forward to your reply acquired in high school" (p.11) for her digital literacy practice he later varied the patterns by reading her American peers posts and incorporating them into her own posts.

Overall, the reearch discussed in this subsection has augmented our understanding of transfer across media particularly based on adaptive transfer. However, thesestdies were limited to examining a unidirectioal transfer proces, that is transfer from print-based writing to DMC. Given that, it is worth examining whether, how, and to what extent transfer of knowledge occurs across media, especially from DMC to print-based writing, to fully understand transfer across media in diverse learning situations.

# 4. Research questions

This current study is guided by two following research questions:

1. How do L2 learners transfer knowledge across different writing genres (narratives and arguments)?   
2. How do L2 learners transfer knowledge across different composing media (print-based writing and DMC)?

# 5. Methods

# 5.1. Research context

This research project was conducted in a multimedia lab at a high school in Korea I designed and offered an English L2 writing class as an extracurricular program to explore transfer of knowledge across genres and media. This ater-school program was composed of 2- h sessions throughout one 14-week academic semester. During the program, the students engaged in multiplecomposing practices in the following order:

(1) Narrative print-based writing (2) Narrative DMC

(3) Argumentative DMC (4) Argumentative print-based writing

This order was delierate, a i allowed me to investigate students bidirectional transfer of knowledge across ifferent genres and media with a minimal number of class sessions.

In the first week, I ffered an overview of the program and explained two writing genres (narratives and arguments). I taught students how to write narrative print-base essays based on their personal experiences. During the second and third weeks, students wrote their frt narrtive draft on self-selected topics in either English or Korean.After having an individual writing conference with the teacher/researcher, students completed their narrative print-based essays in English. From the fourth to sixth weeks, I taught students how to locate the images and music necessary for creating DMC products. The students produced narrative DMC products based on their essays using video-editing software, such as Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. In week seven, they had the opportunty to present their DMC projects and share their experiences in creating them.

From weeks eight to ten, I taught students how to construct the argumentative writing genre, which involves a claim, evidence, and warrants based on Toulmin's model of argumentation. Students then created argumentative DMC products with self-selected topics. Each student also had a writing conference with the teacher/researcher to revise their argumentative scripts and DMC products. In week 11 students exchanged their experiences and questions after presenting their DMC projects to the cass From weeks 12-14, they wrote argumentative print-based essays with afocus on delivering the same message in words without using any other semiotic modes, such as images, music, or voiceovers. Table 1 presents the students' topics in each genre.

# 5.2. Research participants

Six students at the research sit voluntarily participated in the program and research; however, this paper discusses only thee focal participants: Justin, Dana, and Grace (pseudonyms). This is because these participants provided the most salient and relevant examples of the transfer proces acros geres and media (research questions). Other aspects were also considered when choosing them as focal participant: I considered their previous writing experiences in both Korean and English; I also decided to include students who not only missed fewer sessions but also completed llof the four tasks/assignments (i.e, two print-based essays and two DMC products), which were critical sources of data for the current study; and the richness and sincerity of interview responses were another critical factors to select the three focal participants.

Justin is an 11th-grade boy (age 17), who loves reading and drawing cartoons, and perceives himself as a cartoonist. His teacher. rated English writing competency is low, but his computer skill are advanced, and h is known as tech-savvy in the program. Danais a 10th-grade girl (age 16) who had once stayed in the US for approximately one year when she was in the second grade. Her teacher. rated English writing competency is advanced. She wants to be a journalist and has been highly interested in improving her Korean and English writing skill. Grace is also a 10th-grade girl (age 16) with an intermediate English writing competency. Whil attending private institutes, Grace had been educated on Korean argumentative and TOEFL writing to prepare for the Korean college entrance examination. All thre participants joined the program to improve their English writing sills and learn about DMC, such as creating YouTube video clips.

# 5.3. Data collection and analysis

Over one academic semester, data were collected from multiple sources. Student demographic surveys were useful for under. standing the students' backgrounds, such as their prior learning experiences and hobbies or interests. A teacher in charge of the lab assted in this study by video-recording all sesions. After each sesson, I watched the video recordings and provided refined as sessments or relections of how the students engaged in multiple composing practice in terms of transfer of knowledge. I also often added analytical memos and additional information in the fieldnotes regarding what they learned beyond the program. These fieldnotes were used in creating interview questions for each student. I conducted three semi-structured interviews with each participant The first and second one during the program and the last one after the program. As the primary data for this study, the interview data were especially crucial because the students' responses to the interviews allowed me to:

gain a more completeview of student experiences in each writing context; to include a thick decription of the contexts in which students were writing; and to gauge students' perception of how they adapted their prior writing knowledge to new and unfamiliar ... writing tasks. (DePalma, 2015, p. 191, p. 191)

However, I did have a concern about the credibility of the interview data because I was both their classroom teacher and the researcher who interviewed them, a dual role that could have prevented the students from revealing everything about their class experiences (Jerolmack & Khan, 2014). To compensate for this possbilit, I endeavored to establish a favorable rapport with the students through prolonged engagement. I made myself availableafter clas for any student who needed help with his or her essay or any other aspect of the material that might be unclear. I expected that the students might be e forthcoming in the earler interviews; but chances were that by the end of the semester of working together, I was able to hear their trustworthy voices (DeVault & McCoy, 2006).

Table 1 Students' topics in each genre.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Narratives</td><td>Arguments</td></tr><tr><td> Justin</td><td>Blind passion</td><td>The problems with the government&#x27;s system of hiring public officials</td></tr><tr><td>Dana</td><td>My first trip to Hong Kong</td><td> No deregulation of broadcast advertising</td></tr><tr><td>Grace</td><td>My family camping</td><td>No physical education class in extreme weather</td></tr></table></body></html>

During the interviews, I typically asked questions about students' experiences in reshaping their prior knowledge to engage in multiple composing practices eyond and withinthe current program. All interviews occurred in the classroom (multimedialab) a the research site. Each interview lasted $9 0 { \mathrm { - } } 1 2 0 \operatorname { m i n }$ , and was conducted in Korean to more freely communicate with the participants about their proces of and/or experience with transfer of learning. Allinterviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for data analysis. Finally, student artifacts were also gathered, such as their print-based essays and DMC products.

Data analysis and data collection took place recursively (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015). The data collected throughout the study were analy oh inctively anddctively a n a procs f qlitie data anlysis (Mlest al., 2014). ificall,  trnried all the interviews and repeatedly reviewed them as well as the fieldnotes and student artifacts to identify and code any themes or patterns emerging from the data. Subsequently, I marked words, phrases, or passages during the coding process that represented characteristics of adaptive transfer (e.g., the reshaping of prior knowledge acros contexts) or those related to the current study's research questions. Then, descriptive coding (assgning label to a word or passages) and In Vivo coding (using a participant's own words or phrases) were used to generate codes, such as L2 (English) knowledge, L1 (Korean) knowledge, genre knowledge, disciplinary knowledge, unfamiliar situation, print-based writing, DMC, and academic writing, among others. I then linked the codes and created categories while conducting more focused coding and analys processes. While repeatedly reviewing all data excerpts, I earched for any \*connections between the various categories that might be called themes" (Seidman, 2006, p. 124). This data analysis focused more on explicit example of transfer acros gnres and media. everal themes emerged, such as the aplicatio of prior nowledge to a new writing genre, the reshaping of knowledge based on composing media, the bidirectionality of transfer, the interplay between genres and media, transfer from informal to formal learning, and different roles in semiotic modes, among others.

Adaptive transfer was also used as an analytical ool and was integral to this study's conceptual framework (DePalma, 2015). Six dimensions of adaptive transfer were initiall used as deductive units in the data analysis, ut the cros-contextual dimension among six was elicited and utilized as an overarching category for the current study. I divided this into two more pertinent subcategories: (1) transfer across genres, and (2) transfer across media within the category (crosscontextual). Finally, I organized the emergent codes/themes into the relevant subcategories that werealready created. The subsequent section rports the findings from the inductive and deductive data analysis.

# 6. Findings

Adaptive transfer is cross-contextual as it "occurs when students perceive similarity between the familiar writing context in which the skill was learned and the unfamiliar context with which the writer is faced (DePalma & Ringer, 2011, p. 141). DePalma (2015) also suggested cross-contextual reshaping as (L2) learners' \*integration of diverse literacies, including digital, visual, and auditory literacies, aross writing tasks, media, and contexts' (p. 623). Based on this cos-contextual dimension and reshaping of adaptive transfer, the current study explores how and to what extent L2 learners transfer knowledge across genres and media.

# 6.1. Transfer across genres

As some L2 writing scholars have argued that L2 practitioners should offer genre-based writing instruction (Hyland, 2007; Johns. 2011), they may not be interested in exploring how L2 learners may transfer knowledge across ifferent writing genres. However, one major finding of this study is that the participants reshaped and transfrred knowledge acrossdifferent writing genres to create more productive meaning in multiple composing practices. For instance, Dana explored her future career interes broadcasting) in another extracurricular English writing class efore joining the current program. In the previous class she wrote areport titled Why I Want tobe a Journdlist. This report had characteristics of two writing genres, as it depicted her personal experience of why and how she became interested in broadcasting (narrtive writing) and explained what broadcasting-related jos entailed (expository writing). Through writing this rport, Dana learned several key elements of these two English writing genres. One semester later, Dana participated in the current program and engaged in the other writing genre: argumentative writing. I observed that she reshaped some knowledge that she had gained from the previous writing practice to engage in argumentative writig. In other words, Dana transferred her knowledge of narrative and expository writing gained in her prior class to argumentative writing in the current program, across ifferent writing genres, and in several ways.

First, Dana's prior knowledge and experience helped her with selecting a topic. When asked to choose atopic for the argumentative genre in the program, she was prompted to write about broadcasting not only because she was interested in the topic, but also because she had learned about some critical ssues involving broadcast advertisements in her prior clas. This knowledge eventually helped her construct a logical argument in the current program. Specifically, Dana's previous writing revealed that the major air-channel broadcasting companies gained substantially unfair advertising earnings (e.g., additional benefits from in-program commercials), which created a monopoly in the advertising market for major air-channel broadcasting. In the current program, she constructed her argument by reusing and reshaping this knowledge as evidence to support her main claim that broadcast advertising should not be deregulated. Table compare parts of her previous rort and her aumentative esay. t llustrates how she transferred a critical issue in broadcasting (the monopoly) as explained in her narrative/expository report (the eft column) to the supporting evidence in her argumentative essay (the right column). In short, Dana constructed an argument by combining the conventions of argumentative writing that were new to her but learned in the program (an unfamiliar context) and the knowledge of narrative/expository writing acquired i her prior writing experience (a familiar context. By reshaping her knowledge, transfer occurred acros different writing genres.

Justin's case also demonstrated transfer across genres, from narrative to argumentative writing. Although this example shows transfer across gees, i soisplas transfer across ifferent leing contxts. Justin was an avid comic reder and catonist. When adapting his print-based essay to DMC, Justin integrated his knowledge acquired from reading and drawing comics by using only text in some slides of his narrative DMC product, as demonstrated in Fig. 1.

These sides initially appeared odd because almost all the students DMC products included numerous semiotic modes: written words, narrations, images, background music, moving efects, and vivid colors, among others. However, Justin depended on text to deliver his message, wth a clear rson for this dcsion. Justin's favorite cartoonis fen used text wthout ilustrations in some comic strips for emphasis, such as speech ballons for a main character's soliloquy; Justin adapted this srategy when creating his narrative DMC product. In other words, Justin learned from his favorite cartoonist that using only text could be an efective strategy to emphasize the author's intended messages and direct the audience's atention. Justin did not use any images or sounds in reshaping this knowledge, but used only text i some slides of his narrative DMC product. This knowledge was also applied when he created his second DMC product. The last slide of his argumentative DMC again used only text as an emphasizing strategy (se Fig. 2). Additionally, Justin reshaped this method in his own way by using white text on a black background for contrast.

In short, Justin transferred his knowledge from reading comics to creating a DMC product. This knowledge was also transferred from a narratie to an argumentative DMC project as such, this case demonstrates dynamic and complex transfer across ifferent writing genres (from narratie to argumentative writing) as well as across learning contexts (from reading and creating comics to the current program's DMC).

In addition, Justin also transferred genre knowledge from narrative to argumentative writing within the program. Specificall, his argumentative writing in the program was positively influenced by the knowledge he gained from his narrative writing in the program. The students learned about three major rules of narrative writig: (1) know your audience, (2) have a sory in mind, and (3) describe. Justin integrated the knowledge of the importnce of considering th udience acquired from his narrative to argumentative writing, as he explained during the interview: "Just like narrtives, composing arguments also is not about writing for oneself, so I need to consider my potential audience when making an argument.\* Of note here is that Justin compared the two different writing genres and applied what he learned from narrative to argumentative writing.

This transfer process also became significantly more complex and dynamic when Justin transferred his knowledge about the importance of considering the audienceto different composing media: aprint-base esay and a DMC project. More specifially, Justin first wrote a detailed vide script about his topic for argumentative DMC about the problems with he government's system of hiring public official. Subsequently, when remediating it into a print-based essay, he stil used some of his detailed video script, but deliberately shortened it rather than simply reusing the original script. As with Dana and Grace, Justin could have simply reused the same script for his print-based essay, but he intentionally and carefully shortened th script and redrafted the essay, which was his way of adaptive transfer. When asked why he reduced his script, Justin answered during the interview:

I reduced the length of explanations for my print-based essay. The argument itself is the same across my video and esay. For a video, full sentences should be used in detail when you narrate the evidence. However, for a print-based essay, they do not need to be explained in full sentences; instead, they can be included in brackets. The script of my argumentative video was originally composed of long conversational phrases, so I ook out al the colloquial sentences to complete the print-based essay. I think can deliver content more quickly and accurately when I write briefly..

The participants, including Justin, had been expected to use more (or the same amount of) lingustic modes (words) in their print based essays than in DMC products, as usually did students in many other multimodal studies. For DMC products students could employ other multiple semiotic modes (e.g, images, music, narration), as well as words, for communication whereas for print-based essays they had to rely on just a single mode (words). However, Justin seemed to believe that his argumentative print-based essay had to be written more concisely than the video scrit t effctively persuade his audience. This finding surely has to do with genre/media interaction. Hence, he decided to shorten some parts of his script by eliminating some detailed conversations. As illstrated by the right column in Table 3, Justin's argumentative print-based essay became shorter than the video script by deleting the words underlined in the left column.

It is important to note that different composing media (print-based writing and DMC) came into play in Justin's transfer across genres. When Justin transferred his knowledge (the importance of considering the audience from narratie to argumentative writing, he applied and reshaped the knowledge differently depending on different composing media For the print-based essay, Justin wrote his argument more concisely because he believed that aconcise delivery of his logic would be more convincing for his audience, and thus, his audience could focus more on the main claim in his argument and less on trivial details. Altenatively, when delivering the same claim through DMC, he realized that the video script needed to be more descriptive and provide more details because his audience would experience difficulty following his main argument in the DMC project, which would play rapidly in real time.

Additionally, a DMC product typically integrates multiple semiotic modes, such as text, i mages, sounds, and moving images. Hence, the audience might need to observeall modes that create meaning; this compelled Justin to include more details in hisvideo script to help his audience comprehend his main claim.

Here, Justin's decisions about the degrees of detail he wanted to provide resulted from the knowledge learned from his narrative writing, or specifically, the importance of considering the audience. Overall, Justin's transfer across genres was ultimately more complex and dynamic because different composing media also influenced the transfer process across dfferent writing genres.

# 6.2. Transfer across media

The students engaged in both print-based writing and DMC on the same topic, with different sequences of composing tasks. In other words, for narratives, the students were asked to write print-based essays firt then remediate them into DMC products. For the argumentative genre, they created DMC products firt, then adapted them into print-based essays. By alternating the order of composing media, this study aimed to investigate whether and how transfer occurs bidirctionaly acros pint-based writing and DMC.

# 6.2.1. From print-based writing to DMC

Dana's cas illustrates transfer from narrative print-based writing to narrative DMC. In writing anarrative esay about her family trip to Hong Kong and adapting it to a DMC product, she reshaped and integrated the knowledge about the importance of providing detailed descriptions acquired from narrative print-based writing into DMC (refer to the previously noted third major rule of narrative writing). Based on this rule, the students were advised to include as much personal detal as possible tocomplete their narrative essays. Dana followed this instrction by decribing the events and feings of her tri. For instance, to describe her fluctuating feelings about A Symphony of Lights, famous light and sound show in Hong Kong, Dana used several English adjectives in her print-based esay, such as "exciting," "disappointed," \*tedious," and "boring." Regarding her remediated narrative DMC project, Dana reshaped her knowledge of detailed descriptions by using multiple images of the same scene to vividly portray her constantly changing feelings about the light show. She could have used only one image to describe the show, but instead, Dana deliberately chose to use four ifferent images that seem to corrspond to the four adjectives used in her print-based essay. The four diffrent images for one landmark successuly describe her emotional changes from exciting to boring) and make her DMC more appealing to her audience. As such, Dana effectively transferred the knowledge she learned in narrative print-based writing (the importance of offring detailed descriptions) to her DMC product (see Kang, 2021 for more details).

Another example of transfer from print-based wirig to DMC was found in Grace's case. As did Dana, Grace effctively reused and reshaped her knowledge of the importance of having "detailed descriptions, which she had gained from narrative print-based writing, to create her narrative DMC product. Grace realized that detailed descriptions would be one of the most critical factors in writing a narrative esay among the three major rules of narrative writing, as noted above. Accordingly, Grace endeavored to describe what the cat family she met at the campgrounds looked like, in particular about the cats' colors, when writing her print-based narrative essay. The part of her story was about how the kitens might have gotten the mixed color of gray and yellow, a illustrated in the narration part of Fig. 3. In the story, Grace assumed that the father cat would have a gray or black color, based on the kittens' mixed color. Then, when remediating this narrative essay into a DMC product, Grace wanted to demonstrate her observation and speculation more vividy and clearly. Therefore, she carefully and meticulously selected and used images that match her descriptions. For instance, Grace took considerable time to find the exact image of a cat that has a half black and a half gray (see the second image in Fig. 3).

When creating this narrative DMC product, Grace seemed to integrate the knowledge about the importance of having detailed descriptions that she acquired in print-based narrtive writing. Grace recognized this transfer of knowledge, as indicated during the interview, I described my story with words in a print-based esay. Then, when I remediated the essay into a multimodal video, I carefull chose images that could better describe my story." This thus can be viewed as transfer acros media, from print-based writing to DMC.

# 6.2.2. From DMC to print-based writing

Justin demonstrated an opposite transfer across ifferent composing media, as his knowledge transferred from DMC to print-based writing. During the program, Justin learned that argumentative writing aimed to persuade an audience when creating his argumentative DMC product Subsequently, when adapting it to a print-based esay, he realized that providing concise key points rather than wordy details would more efectively convince his potential audience in a print-based essay, as previously discussed. Therefore, Justin decided to create an argumentative print-based essay briefer than the video script for his argumentative DMC (see Table 3 above).

Grace also demonstrated transfer across media, from DMC to print-based writig. She reshaped and integrated the knowledge about semiotic modes diffrent roles in constructig arguments--which she had gained from argumentatie DMC-into print-based writing. Specificall, Grace seemed to be self-taught, in that the linguistic mode (words) was the most critical element for her logical argu. mentation; thus, she did her besto write a stand-alone (nearly perfect) video script for her argumentative DMC product. However, While creating the DMC product itself, Grace treated nonlinguistic modes (e.g., images and music) as having secondary significance. She developed the knowledge that differences might exis in semiotic modes importance, as she clarified during the interview:  think my voiceover [script] is more important than other modes, such as images or music, in delivering my message especially for my argumentative video."

Therefore, inguistic modes for Grace were most important in argumentation, which I termed the significance of text4 Grace reshaped and integrated the knowledge about text's significance in argumentation into her remediated argumentative print-based essay. Namely, this knowledge transferred across media, from her DMC to print-based writing: she decided not to fix the video script that she had already wrtten for the DMC product, then submitted it as her argumentative print-based essay. This is because she had already completed the stand-alone script and did not need to revise it.

Overall it is noteworthy that Justin and Grace chose diffrent knowledge to be transferred, from DMC to print-based writing, respectively. By reshaping and integrating her knowledge about the significance of text, Grace did not revise her video script, while Justin revised his script based on his knowledge of the importance of considering the audience.

# 7. Discussion

The first research question of this study concerns how L2 learners transfer knowledge acros different writing genres. The study's findings revealed that the participants brought prior genre-based knowledge that they had gained both within and beyond the program. Grounded on the cross-contextual reshaping of adaptive transfer (DePalma & Ringer, 2011), I discovered that the students prior knowledge in one genre was useful for composing in another. Dana developed her prior genre-based knowledge (both narrative and expository) from her previous extracurricular writing class This prior experience and knowledge from this class enabled her to not only select the topic for her argumentation, but also develop the logic for her argumentative claim in the current program. In doing so, Dana constructed an argument based on conventions of argumentation (an unfamiliar writing tak) as well as on her knowledge of narrative and expository writing (familiar writing tasks) acquired in her prior writing experiences.

Justin demonstrated transfer across genres within the current program. For his argumentative DMC product he applied the emphasizing strategy (using text only) that he used for narrative DMC. He also integrated another knowledge (considering the audience) that he leaned through narrative writing into his argumentative writing practice. Additionally, when the knowledge was transferre across genres, Justin dynamicll and differently aplied thi nowledge based on diffrent composing media. In his printbased essay, he composed his argument more concisely; however, when delivering the same claim in multiple modes, Justin wrote a more descriptive video script for his DMC product. Both of his decisions resulted from his knowledge of the importance of considering the audience from his narrative writing practice. As such, his genre knowledge was adaptively transferred and reshaped from narrative to argumentative writing and based on different composing media..

Research on transfer across dfferent writing genres has rarely ben conducted in the field of L2 literacy. Nonetheles, a few research studies have explored how L2 leaners transfer genre (or rhetorical) knowledge. For example, Shrestha (2017) reported on the transfer of gre feture. However, t foused on transfer not acros different writing genres but across similar writing contexts, from students' academic literacy course to their particular academic field (businessprogram). Likewise, Kim and Belcher (2018) revealed the transfer of gre knowledge regarding the fie-paragraph essays acros similar context, from their OE writing clas in Korea to composing academic argumentative papers in the US. Wilson and Soblo (2020) similarly reported on transferring genre knowledge, from the AP/FYC classo composing secondary-source rearch papers. Therefore, it s sinificant that the current study demonstrates how L2 learners transfer prior knowledge acros ifferent writing genres,especilly from nrrative to argumentative writing, which might be one of the earliest research attempts in the field. This study's findings on transfer across genres also confirm one of the theoretical assumptions of adaptive transfer, in that L2 learners might \*draw from and transform genre knowledge between tasks, classes, and contexts" (DePalma, 2015, p. 616).

The second research question concerns how L2 learners transfer knowledge across diffrent composing media. Most research on transfer across media, however, has explored a unidirectional process, from print-based writing to DMC (Alexander et al., 2016; DePalma, 2015; Wu, 2020). In terms of the transfer's directionalit, the findings from both Dana and Gace in the current study were similar to those from the prior studies. Dana and Grace applied their knowledge of providing detailed descriptions learned from their narrative print-based essays to create DMC products. In a study by Alexander et al. (2016), an L1 college student (Sophie) wrote a print-based narrative essay on a crucial moment in her life, then remediated it into a digital story. She managed to reshape her knowledge, the \*ability to come up with sessons' (p. 37), from her print-based writing for her remediated digital story. Therefore, Sophie sucesfully hrank the longer segments with detail in her print-based esay down to something that served for her remediated digital story. Although she experienced many challenges when composing across media, \*moving from the segmented print-based essay to sections in her digital story-seemed to work well for Sophie" (p. 37). It is compelling that both Sophie in Alexander et al's (2016) study and Dana and Grace in the current study transferred particular prior knowledge from print-based writing to DMC (i.e., by considering segments, for Sophie; and providing detailed descriptions, for Dana and Grace).

It is also noteworthy that Justin and Grace demonstrated transfer across media in the opposite direction, from DMC to print-based writing. Notably, each transfered different knowledge, with an mphasis on differnt values of knowledge. Justin shorted his vido script with the audience in mind, while Gracedid not revise hers based on the text's significance. These findings are congruent with Christiansen's (2017) study, which explored college ESL learners in a composition class in the US, although this study was not grounded upon the view of adaptive transfer. The author examined ways in which \*the skils used in digital research projects shape how learners conceptualize writing traditional text-based research papers" (p. 56). While Justin and Grace in the current study transferredtheir prior knowledge, or the sigficance f adience and text, respectively, the participants in Christiansen's (2017) study transferred the knowledge acquired from DMC, such as academic requirements \*in terms of organization of ideas, variet of examples and variety of writing styles' (p. 59), to their print-based writing. In this regard, Shepherd (2018) asserted that students should be encouraged to connect their prior DMC experiences with their print-based writing in school.

The students in the current study transferred prior knowledge acros genres and media, especially from familiar contexts to new or unfamiliar contexts (DMC or argumentative writing) while engaging in multiple composing practices. Justin was an active agent in transferring his prior knowledge (using only text as an emphasizing strategy) acquired from reading/creating comics (a familiar learning context) to the DMC practice (an unfamiliar learning context). This finding confirms the results of several transfer studies conducted in the field. For example, one participant (Noreen) in DePalma's (2015) study demonstrated transfer from a familia context (music composition) to an unfamilia context (creating a digital story). Justin and Noreen had extensive experience with drawing comics and composing music, respectively. Justin held an identity as a cartoonist and Noreen a music composer. Each effectively transferred the knowledge acquired from a previous familia context for Justi, an emphasizing strategy from reading comics; and for Noreen, a skill to create tension from music composition) to the new or unfamiliar DMC context.

Similarly, one participant (Ye-Na) in Jwa's (2019) study applied knowledge learned from her ESL class, which had become familiar, to her subsequent busines course, which was relatively new to her. The participant transferred several rhetorical functions of the introduction and conclusion of academic essays from her ESL classinto the discipline course (busines), in which she wrote a business letter. Itis also noteworthy that Justin's transfer of knowledge inthe current study might be congruent with Ye-Na' case (Jwa, 2019). As Ye-Na transferred knowledge based on the \*concept of audience-centeredness (p. 113) Justin transferred knowledge across genres and media by considering the importance of the audience.

# 8. Implications for research and practice

Thus far, the current study's findings and discussion demonstrate that L2 learners reshape their prior knowledge when writing across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, particularly across genres and media; this provides a significant contribution to transfer research in the fie f literacy. Addtionall, in tems f avancing the thery of adaptie transfer, seral findings fromthe current study confirm some theoretical assumptions of adaptive transfer, such as the reshaping of knowledge across familiar and unfamiliar contexts (e.g, composing across genres and media). Nevertheles, this study did not necesarily investigate the conditions that faclitate 2 leners transfer of knowledge, although could speulate. Thus, it i noteworthy to explore the facors tha can promote transfer acros genres and media. In addition, I reported only three participants' transfer over one academic semester; thus, future research can examine more participants over a longer duration. Further research can extend this study by exploring transfer across geres nd media in ters of dferent diectionalities such as transfer from ments to narratives. Finally, this stud fousd on the cross-contextual dimension of adaptive transfer; thus, future cholars might explore adaptive transfer using the other five dimensions. idiosyncratic, dynamic, multilingual, rhetorical, and transformative.

This study's findings also suggest several pedagogical implications fr ESL and EAP courses. The current study's students initially experienced dificulty in writing across genres and media, especially when remediating their print-based essays into DMC proects. More specificall, it was the most chllenging for them to transmit meanings across media without deteriorating them. For instance, Dana had a hard time remediating her print-based argumentative essay into a DMC product. She elaborated that, unlike her narrative, some of the contents of her argumentation were abstract ids and thus was difficult for concrete visual artiulation. Hence, she did not know how to display them multimodall. In other words, Dana, as an inexperienced adolescent L2 writer, semed to experience \*the challenge of putting concept into practice" (Yi t al., 2017, p. 52). Adaptive remediation by Alexander et al. (2016) could provide a solution to this ssue. In partcular, litecy linkig f adaptive remediation - transferring, integrating, and reshaping literacy know. edge from one context into another to be fitted - might be helpful (see Alexander et al., 2016 for more detail).

Further, L2 teachers and students should engage in open conversations about transfer of learning, such as students' prior transfer experiences and any possible benefit of such transfer, which could help students become more aware of transfer in their multiple composition practices. Specifically, adolescent 2 leaners may experience fear when learning something new in an unfamiliar context, which may then interfere with their productive L2 learning. In this regard, L2 teachers should encourage students to develop transfer. related meta-awareness, an ability to recognize the availability and/or transferability of something that may not en seem available and/or transfrable, across diffrent domains (e.g., composing acros genres and media). In this way, students might be able to overcome the fear of learning something new in unfamiliar contexts.
