# Abstract

This paper reports the results of a study comparing the interactional dynamics of face-to-face and on-line peer-tutoring in writing by university students in Hong Kong. Transcripts of face-to-face tutoring sessions, as well as logs of on-line sessions conducted by the same peer-tutors, were coded for speech functions using a system based on Halliday’s functional-semantic view of dialogue.

Results show considerable differences between the interactional dynamics in on-line and face-to-face tutoring sessions. In particular, face-to-face interactions involved more hierarchal encounters in which tutors took control of the discourse, whereas on-line interactions were more egalitarian, with clients controlling the discourse more. Differences were also found in the topics participants chose to focus on in the two modes, with issues of grammar, vocabulary, and style taking precedence in face-to-face sessions and more ‘‘global’’ writing concerns like content and process being discussed more in on-line sessions.

# 1. Interactional dynamics in peer-tutoring

This paper compares the ways peer-tutors and clients at a university writing center in Hong Kong discursively construct relationships and activities in face-to-face and in on-line (synchronous chat) modes. It is particularly concerned with how participants in tutoring sessions negotiate roles and agendas, and it suggests a method for analyzing the interactional dynamics of tutoring sessions that links these negotiations to functional discursive strategies.

Research into tutor and client interaction in writing centers has focused extensively on the nature of the relationship that tutors and clients collaboratively co-create and how this relationship affects the kind of learning that takes place. Most researchers and theorists on the social dynamics of writing center practice in L1 settings (e.g., Bruffee, 1986; Harris, 1986; Trimbur, 1987) have coalesced around what has become a kind of ‘‘writing-center orthodoxy,’’ one that emphasizes student control of the interaction with the goal of ‘‘empowerment.’’ Flynn (1993) summarizes this view as follows:

 the student controls the direction of the learning;   
 the focus of the session is on the students’ writing skills, not on the text at hand11 ;   
 the short term goal is to equip the student with the skills to surmount the difficulties that brought her or him to the writing center;   
 the long term goal is to enable the student to function independently when confronted with new writing tasks (p. 4).

Central to this orthodoxy is the promotion of egalitarian relationships between tutors and clients (Harris, 1986; Meyer & Smith, 1987). Good tutoring sessions are seen to be collaborative (Blau, Hall, & Strauss, 1998), having as their goal helping the writer take charge of the writing process (Fletcher, 1993; Taylor, 1993). Writing center scholars have also written of the importance of empathy, warmth, and caring; of developing closeness; and of taking a more ‘‘holistic’’ view of the person (Taylor, 1993). In sociolinguistic terms, this combination of closeness and egalitarianism conforms to what Scollon and Scollon (2001) refer to as a face system of symmetrical solidarity, a pattern of relating in which both parties use ‘‘involvement strategies’’ (what Brown and Levinson (1987) call ‘‘positive politeness’’) in order to build intimacy. In this face system, interactional control is usually shared and power is negotiated.

Some research has seen benefits in this approach, finding that clients make more improvements in their writing and take up the advice of tutors more readily when they are more actively involved in controlling the agenda of the session (Fletcher, 1993), and that supportive strategies compare favorably to authoritarian ones in feedback sessions on writing in a wide range of first language and second language contexts (Lockhart & Ng, 1995; Taylor, 1993; Williams, 2004).

Other studies, however, have shown that in many writing centers this egalitarian ideal is mostly just an ideal. In many cases, tutors take control of writing center interactions to the point where, like other institutional discourse, these exchanges become a series of question/answer adjacency pairs in which the institutional representative is the questioner, controlling both topic and interaction (Drew & Heritage, 1992; Thonus, 1999a, 1999b). Researchers have found that in tutoring sessions tutors tend to talk a lot, interrupt a lot, and give advice they are not asked to give (Thonus, 1995a, 1995b, 1999a). Tutors have also been found to ask more closed questions and request mostly factual rather than explanatory or evaluative information (Bell, 1989; Johnson, 1993). Some researchers (see for example Thonus, 1999a) argue that institutional forces put tutors at odds with the egalitarian principles they are meant to uphold. In his article, ‘‘Peer Tutoring: A Contradiction in Terms,’’ Trimbur (1987) goes so far as to suggest that ‘‘the very nature of the dynamic, with one person being a tutor and the other a client, disallows true collaboration’’ (p. 23).

Difficulties with the model of symmetrical solidarity advocated above are especially apparent in second language writing contexts. Most of the investigations concerning second language writers in writing centers have been in settings in which native speaking peer-tutors counsel non-native speaking clients, and these studies have shown that, in general, tutors take on more authoritative roles with second language writers, exercising significant control over the interaction (Thonus, 2004; Williams, 2004, 2005). Thonus (1995a, 1995b, 1998, 1999a), for example, found native speaking tutors made more suggestions and used fewer mitigating politeness strategies with non-native speaking clients than with native speaking clients, and Thonus (1999b) and Williams (2005) found that tutors were more likely to control the floor in their interactions with non-native speakers through interruptions, topic nominations, and topic shifts.

The less modulated, more direct style tutors tend to take up with L2 writers may in part be attributed to an effort by tutors to make their advice more comprehensible to non-native speakers (Thonus, 1999a), and indeed, Williams (2004) found in her study of the revisions which L2 writers made after writing center visits that more direct suggestions tended to result in revisions, whereas more implicit instruction tended to be ignored.

At the same time it has also been found that some non-native speaking clients, especially those who come from cultures which may not value symmetrical solidarity in the way it is valued in the Western culture which produced the ‘‘writing center orthodoxy’’ (Scollon & Scollon, 2001), prefer for the tutor to take charge of the interaction, as they may see tutors as authoritative institutional representatives rather than equals (Thonus, 1998, 1999a; Young, 1992; Williams, 2001, 2004). Hierarchical face systems, however, do not always prevail in second language writing tutorials. Weigle and Nelson (2004) have observed that second language writers and peer tutors operating outside of the writing center setting were able to negotiate a variety of relationships along a cline from hierarchical to egalitarian.

A number of researchers have suggested that tutorials with second language writers might require a more flexible approach (Cogie, Strain, & Lorinskas, 1999; Williams & Severino, 2004), noting that non-directive tutoring is sometimes inadequate to meet their needs. Instead, they suggest tutors take up the more authoritative roles of ‘‘language informants.’’

# 2. On-line tutoring

With more and more writing centers introducing on-line tutoring modes (either asynchronous – through email and message boards – or synchronous – through various kinds of chat software), more attention is being paid to how these new modes affect tutor–client interaction.

One important focus of studies into on-line feedback has been precisely the issue discussed above—the power relations that are constructed between tutors and clients. Many of these studies suggest that in on-line tutoring sessions relationships tend to be less hierarchical, even when tutors are truly authority figures, like class teachers. Selfe (1992) claims that on-line environments ‘‘offer alternative spaces for academic student involvement because they offer different conversational power structures’’ than those of traditional settings (p. 149). It has also been found that ‘‘high-apprehension’’ writers prefer and contribute more in electronic feedback sessions (Mabrito, 1991) and that electronic feedback has positive impacts on second language writers in terms of the quality of their revisions and their involvement in the writing process (Tuzi, 2001). Weigle and Nelson (2004), based on their observations of the use of email to supplement face-to-face tutoring, go so far as to suggest that internet-based tutoring might well be more productive than face-to-face tutoring for many second language writers.

Some of the work in this area has focused more explicitly on the different topics and task types on-line tutoring might be best at addressing. Davis and Koch (1999) suggest that on-line tutoring using the synchronous chat mode is better designed for global writing concerns like tone, audience, organization, topic, and thesis. Questions involving grammar and sentence structure are not as easily addressed. Honeycutt (2001), in his comparison of feedback sessions using an asynchronous mode (email) and a synchronous one (chat), found that ‘‘asynchronous media tend to produce more directive comments about potential revision strategies, whereas synchronous conferencing supports informative and elicitive comments indicating a greater amount of personal and collaborative involvement between participants’’ (p. 54).

# 3. Models for studying tutor–client interaction

Researchers who have studied interaction around peer-tutoring have used a variety of approaches. In their early studies of face-to-face peer response groups, for example, Gere and his colleagues (Gere and Abbot, 1985; Gere and Stevens, 1985) developed a functional coding scheme that placed comments into primary categories of informative, directive, or elicitive, with other categories related to focus of attention and topic of utterance. Porter (1991) used a framework based on the work of Sinclair and Coulthard (1975) to examine tutor–client interaction and Blau et al. (1998) borrowed tools from pragmatics. In her examinations of tutor dominance in writing center consultations with second language writers, Thonus (1998, 1999a) has developed tools from interactional sociolinguistics (Schiffrin, 1996), examining interaction in terms of politeness strategies, topic initiation, turn length, directives, and features of conversational involvement, such as backchanneling, laughter, and small talk.

Our model draws on the approaches mentioned above, but takes as its basis Halliday’s functional-semantic view of dialogue (Eggins & Slade, 1997; Halliday, 1994), a view that sees conversation chiefly as the ‘‘exchange of commodities’’ realized through various conversational moves. Moves are not the same as turns, and indeed a turn may contain any number of moves. A move is a discourse unit that represents the realization of a speech function.

The speech functions people use to move conversations forward, says Halliday, can be classified by the kinds of commodity exchanged (either information or goods and services), and by the role the speaker takes up in the exchange (giving or demanding) (see Table 1).

In this model, every utterance establishes a relationship between the person who is speaking and the person who is probably going to speak next. The implicit interactivity in dialogue is based on the fact that each of these speech functions positions both the speaker and the potential respondent. Every time a speaker takes on a role, he or she assigns a role to the listener. ‘‘If I am giving, you are called upon to accept. If I am demanding, you are called upon to give’’ (Halliday, 1994, p. 12). When deploying speech functions, speakers take up discourse identities (questioner, answerer, giver, receiver, etc.), which are invariably linked to larger social identities and ideologies (Kress, 1985).

On this basis, Halliday divides speech functions into initiating moves and responding moves. Initiating moves (statements, offers, questions, and commands) are those taken independently of an initiating move by the other party; responding moves (such as acts of acknowledgement, agreement, compliance, acceptance, and answering) are those taken in response to an initiating move by the other party. Responses can be further divided into those that are supportive (acceptance, compliance, acknowledgement) or confrontational (rejection, refusal, contradiction). Obviously, our choice of responding moves is constrained by the kind of initiating move they are deployed to address.

Source: From Halliday (1994, p. 69).

One important link between speech functions and social context is that social roles constrain the speech functions participants have access to. The example given by Eggins and Slade (1997) is of a classroom situation. ‘‘The social role of a teacher,’’ they write, ‘‘gives access to the full range of initiating speech functions when interacting with students, while the social role of student places constraints on both the frequency and types of initiations that can be made’’ (p. 183). This dynamic between speech functions and social roles is particularly interesting in situations where roles are more indeterminate and there is more room for interactional control to be negotiated, situations like peer-tutoring sessions.

Among the advantages of this systemic approach are that it allows data to be coded exhaustively (all utterances can be placed in one move class or another, and move classes can be analyzed to various degrees of delicacy) and that it provides a way to relate patterns in move choices to the interpersonal context of the interaction, particularly to issues of power. Indeed, the distinction between initiating and responding moves itself can tell us a lot about underlying patterns of inequality and difference in an interaction. A number of scholars (see for example Linell, 1990) have observed a correlation between the distribution of initiating and responding sequences and interactional dominance.

Eggins and Slade’s (1997) development of Halliday’s model takes the system to a great degree of delicacy. For the purposes of this study a more simplified model was used, but one which we believe is adequate to reveal important patterns of interactional dynamics. In this model (see Appendixes A and B), the initiating moves of offer, statement, directive, and question are subdivided into offers and wishes, information, explanation, and evaluation, and requests, suggestions, and commands. Questions are analyzed based on the type of response they seemed designed to elicit (information, explanation, evaluation, etc.). Responding moves (responses to offers, responses to statements, responses to directives, and responses to questions) are also subdivided into the ‘‘discretionary alternatives’’ of acceptance/rejection, agreement/disagreement, compliance/refusal, and answering/disclaiming. Moreover, answers are further sub-divided into speech functions like information, explanation, and evaluation. Questions are also sometimes seen as responding moves, especially when they are designed to elicit confirmation or clarification of a move made by the other participant.

# 4. Background: The Language Clinic

This study is part of a larger project which involved the setting up and monitoring of a peertutoring center within the English department of a university in Hong Kong.2 The center is called ‘‘The Language Clinic,’’ and it makes face-to-face and on-line tutoring in writing from peertutors available to students in the department, the vast majority of whom are Chinese ESL learners. Face-to-face tutoring is offered for approximately 20 hours per week and is only available on weekdays and in the daytime. Most sessions last between 15 minutes and half an hour. Clients usually email a draft of their assignment to the tutor before the session. On-line tutoring using a dedicated $\mathrm { I C Q } ^ { 3 }$ account is available during fixed hours in the evenings and on weekends. ICQ sessions can be as short as 3 minutes and as long as an hour or more. Sometimes clients and tutors make use of the ‘‘file transfer’’ function of ICQ to exchange texts during these sessions. After a year of operation, clients expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the services, both in terms of the perceived competence of the tutors and the perceived usefulness of the interactions (Jones, Li, Locke, & Garralda, 2004).

The data are composed of two corpora, one consisting of the transcripts of six face-to-face consultations (totaling 633 turns/680 moves) conducted by five different tutors, all audio recorded with the informed consent of both tutors and clients, and the other consisting of the logs of $1 8 ~ \mathrm { I C Q }$ tutoring sessions (totaling 591 turns/613 moves) conducted by the same tutors, with many of the same clients (see below). The average length of the face-to-face sessions was 105.7 turns and 113.3 moves, and the average length of the on-line consultations was 32.8 turns and 34 moves.

The situation presented here is rather different from the second language writing contexts studied by Thonus (1995b, 1998, 1999a, 1999b), Williams (2001, 2005), and others, in that both clients and tutors were non-native English speakers and second language writers themselves. All of the tutors were Chinese females between the ages of 20 and 24. Three of them were second year students taking an English and Communication Studies course, and two were third year students working toward a degree in English Language Education. They had all undergone a training program consisting of five intensive workshops, which included the study of transcripts from previous tutoring sessions and role-plays of potential tutoring situations, as well as a month long apprenticeship with an experienced tutor. While the philosophy of the training materials in many ways reflected the non-directive approach characteristic of writing centers elsewhere, more attention is given to strategies for dealing with the kinds of sentence level errors characteristic of clients’ writing in this setting. All of the tutors had had at least 3 months of experience at the time the data was collected.

All of the clients were also Chinese students in the Department of English and Communication who were enrolled in a first year composition course. While instructors of this course encouraged the students to use the tutoring services, such use was entirely voluntary. Table 2 shows the distribution and length (in turns) of the sessions analyzed as well as the tutors and clients involved.

The data were coded for move types using MaxQDA software for the qualitative analysis of textual data. They were also coded for the topics participants discussed using a classification system that grew from the data itself. The coding was performed independently by one of the researchers and a trained research assistant. In cases of discrepancy in the coding, the two coders negotiated a mutually acceptable choice. When, even after negotiation, the coders could not agree, the disputed moves were discarded from the analysis. In the corpus of face-to-face sessions, four disputed moves were discarded $0 . 5 8 \%$ of the total moves). In the corpus of on-line sessions, six disputed moves were discarded $( 0 . 9 8 \%$ of the total moves). Finally, stretches of interaction exhibiting particular ‘‘typical’’ patterns of interactional dynamics were more closely scrutinized with reference to the kinds of goals interactants brought to the task and the kinds of learning outcomes that seemed to ensue.

# 5. Results and discussion

# 5.1. Interactional control

Our analysis revealed significant differences in the patterns of interactional control in on-line and face-to-face tutoring sessions. Face-to-face consultations were characterized by more tutortalk and by more tutor control of the interaction. The average length of tutors’ turns in face-toface sessions (14.6 words) was twice that of clients’ turns (7.2 words). In contrast, clients in online consultations talked (or typed) more than tutors, with turns averaging 11.8 words to the tutors’ average of 9.6 words.

Tutors in face-to-face sessions were also found to use more initiating moves than clients, whose contributions were mostly in the form of responding moves. In contrast, in on-line tutoring, clients made almost as many initiating moves as tutors (see Fig. 1).

What these broad figures suggest is a situation in which, in face-to-face tutoring, tutors did most of the talking as well as deciding what was to be talked about, whereas in on-line consultations, clients were more proactive about setting the agenda and tutors responded more to client’s ideas, and in fact, our data is full of examples conforming to this picture.

Excerpt 1 is a rather extreme, but not unusual example of the interactional pattern predominant in face-to-face consultations in which tutors set the agenda and students produced only occasional short answers or acknowledgements.

Fig. 1. Distribution of initiating and responding moves (as percentage of total moves).

# Excerpt 1

T: Ok. ‘‘and then I found . . .’’ Yes, correct. If you want to say play piano, you need to add . . .   
C: The.   
T: Yes. Play the piano, just like play the guitar.   
C: Um ..   
T: ‘‘Instead of pushing Yuki too hard, I tried my best to arouse her interest and to . . .   
C: Give.   
T: Yes. To give her encouragement. ‘‘These could . . . EMPOWER her’’ . . . do you know the word ‘‘empower’’? It means make somebody feel more power . . .   
C: Um . . .   
T: Do you mean a piano learner? Because he learnt piano.   
C: Yes.   
T: ‘‘However his mother . . .. EVEN THOUGH’’ Do you know the meaning of ‘‘even’’ and ‘‘even though’’? C: Um . . .‘‘even though’’ is although, ‘‘even’’ is . .   
T: We use ‘‘even’’ to show that something is surprising, unusual, unexpected or extreme.   
C: Um . . .

In this example, not only does the tutor control the interaction completely by producing all of the initiating moves (questions, explanations, and prompts in the form of sentences from the client’s essay), but at one point she does not even allow the client to produce the appropriate responding move, but instead provides it herself. The client’s contribution is little more than a series of minimal responses.

In Excerpt 2, from an on-line tutoring session, a very different pattern of interactional dynamics can be observed. In the beginning of the excerpt, the client is asking the tutor’s opinion of a character in his story.

# Excerpt 2

C: Is she PURE, Innocent?   
T: she is   
C: i see   
T: kind of ideal girl   
C: that’s it, only if Ur answer is yes to that question about Pure, Innocent, I feel good   
C: ideal, really, ideal   
T: :-)   
C: so how about the plot then ?   
T: it’s fine, except what i said about ‘water’   
C: in fact, I don’t expect reader to have any special feeling toward water, it’s neutral,

T: besides, u have rather long description of Magic’s innerworld C: esp. the last paragraph, coz that’s the ENDING

In this example, the client is clearly more in control of the interaction. He asks all of the questions, sets the agenda, and responds actively to the tutor’s comments with clarifications and explanations.

This difference in interactional dynamics between face-to-face and on-line consultations was also noted by the tutors themselves in follow-up interviews. One said:

Some students who come to the office are too submissive. They seem to be under a false impression that we tutors sitting in that room are authorities or superior to them. In order not to appear too stupid, they tend to speak as little as possible. At the same time, some tutors, driven by an irresistible temptation to give lectures, tend to be very dominant, even though they know they should let their clients talk more and ask more; on-line, however, clients feel much freer to ask questions. Even if they raise some truly stupid questions, they don’t feel so embarrassed. On-line communication is always less formal.

It is important to note that not all interactions conformed to these patterns. Our data also has examples of more egalitarian discourse relationships in face-to-face sessions and more hierarchal relationships in on-line sessions. In both modes, discourse relationships (and social relationships) were variable and negotiated; it seems, though, that in on-line interaction, there was more variation and more room for negotiation.

It is also important to say that we are not taking the position adopted by some of the scholars mentioned above that the system of symmetrical solidarity evident in the on-line interaction is necessarily superior to the more hierarchal and directive style of the face-toface sessions. We believe that the issue is much more complicated and that understanding the relationship between discourse roles and teaching outcomes requires closer attention to the interactional strategies participants use and to the different topics and purposes of the interactions.

# 5.2. Interactional strategies

Closer analysis of the initiating moves used by tutors and clients sheds further light on how participants assumed and maintained interactional control and the kinds of discourse roles they constructed for their interlocutors through these moves. Fig. 2 shows a breakdown of the types of initiating moves made by tutors and clients in the two modes.

![](img/e1b91669d62792f3459b2907e5075443985e0a61bc877a2a7c5a996ececb72ee.jpg)

Fig. 3. Purpose of initiating questions (as percentage of total moves).

In face-to-face meetings, tutors controlled conversations primarily by asking questions, making statements, and issuing directives. In this mode, tutors asked four times more questions than clients. In the on-line mode, clients asked more questions than tutors, made significantly more statements than in the face-to-face mode, and issued just as many directives as tutors. In other words, the traditional ‘‘institutional pattern’’ of questioner and answerer seen in face-toface consultations was essentially reversed in the on-line mode, clients taking up the traditionally superior discourse role of questioners.

It is not surprising that questions were the most popular initiating move by both tutors and clients since questioning strategies are central to most models of teaching. Questions can be used to elicit information, an explanation, or an evaluation. These kinds of questioning moves have various strategic functions in tutoring, such as diagnosing client needs, testing client comprehension, and leading clients to self-evaluate or self-correct. In addition, tutors also sometimes make use of what are called ‘‘display questions,’’ questions which are designed not to elicit real information, but rather to test whether or not a client is able to produce particular kinds of utterances or information. Fig. 3 shows the purpose of the initiating questions of tutors and clients in the two modes.

In the face-to-face mode, most tutor questions were designed to elicit explanations, questions like: ‘‘What’s the use of that here?,’’ ‘‘Why do you put so here?,’’ and ‘‘What are you trying to tell us here?’’ Consistent with other studies of tutor–client interaction (Bell, 1989; Johnson, 1993), tutors also produced a high number of information eliciting questions such as, ‘‘Have you mentioned piano lessons before?’’ and ‘‘Did you take only one piano lesson or many?’’ Finally, they asked a large number of questions eliciting evaluations, mostly questions about the ‘‘goodness’’ or ‘‘correctness’’ of certain lexical choices or grammatical structures, like ‘‘Is this grammatical?,’’ ‘‘What’s the problem here?,’’ and ‘‘Is it necessary to use this word?’’

Often these questions were parts of chains of related questions designed to lead the client to self-correct, understand their problem, or develop the ability to spot their own error. In Excerpt 3, for example, the tutor uses a series of questions to help the client come to an understanding of a particular lexical item.

# Excerpt 3

T: When do you use ‘‘take note?’’ C: When you pay attention or jot down something. T: Pay attention, okay. Can you look up the word ‘‘note?’’

C: (inaudible)   
T: Can you see here?   
C: Pay attention to it because you think it’s important or significant.   
T: But what’s the difference between your sentence and here in the example? It’s that we should . . . C: (inaudible) people have similar mindsets.   
T: And here?   
C: If you take note of, oh . . .   
T: What does take note of mean then?   
C: We should take note of . . .

Underlying this mode of questioning, then, is a kind of inductive instructional strategy which seeks to lead clients towards understanding and correcting themselves. This strategy of prompting learners to self-correct, referred to by Lyster and Ranta (1997) as negotiation of form, is widely seen as superior to more direct approaches such as simply telling students the correct form (Lyster, 1998; Lyster & Ranta, 1997; Pica, Holliday, Lewis, & Morganthaler, 1989). The paradox in this strategy is that, in seeking to give clients more responsibility, tutors assume more interactional control, making it more difficult for clients to affect the overall agenda of the session and the choices about what kinds of errors are to be focused on and what they would like to learn about those errors.

In on-line interaction, on the other hand, clients asked more questions than tutors, asserting much more control over the agenda of the interaction. More interactional control, however, was not necessarily synonymous with assuming more responsibility for their learning. Instead of favoring questions eliciting explanations, they favored those eliciting information and evaluations, questions like, ‘‘Is this sentence okay?,’’ ‘‘Can I say ‘grab it up?’,’’ and ‘‘Honestly, does it bore you?’’ Such questions often focused on grammatical ‘‘rules’’ or whether or not something was ‘‘right or wrong.’’ Excerpts 4 and 5 are examples of these questioning strategies.

# Excerpt 4

C: hi can i say ‘‘Mary and Tom were mutual enemies ever since they were born’’?   
T: yes, you can say that. :)   
C: ok thx  
T: you’re welcome:)

# Excerpt 5

C: should I use offered by or offered from?   
T: offered by:)   
C: thz a lots!!   
T: you’re welcome:)   
T: offer:verb. somebody offer somebody else something. Like ‘‘This meal was offered by Mr.chan.’’ when used as an   
Noun, you can say: ‘‘this is an offer from the dean.’’   
C: so should I use which offered from Polytechnic University or by   
T: by :)

These excerpts represent a type of interaction that was actually very typical in the corpus of ICQ chats: short, instrumental exchanges in which clients asked about the ‘‘correctness’’ of a particular sentence, phrase, or word. Often in such exchanges, clients appeared much more interested in the evaluation or information than in why the evaluation had been made or how they might apply the information in situations outside of the immediate context of their question. In Excerpt 5, for example, although the tutor attempts to offer an explanation of the grammatical rule, rather than applying it, in the next turn the client simply asks the tutor to apply it for him. While it might be argued that, in such exchanges, clients take some responsibility for their learning by asking the questions in the first place, such questions, more often than not, are designed to provide them with ‘‘quick fixes’’ rather than real opportunities to explore the reasons behind their errors.

Another important difference in the kinds of discussions about grammar in which participants engaged in the two modes was that in face-to-face sessions, questions and explanations about grammar almost always occurred in the context of a text, whereas in on-line interaction clients frequently elicited evaluations regarding de-contextualized sentences, phrases, or words. While for clients such items were likely part, of larger texts, already composed or in progress, in most cases the tutors did not have access to these texts, making it more difficult for them to make an accurate diagnosis. Sometimes clients using the on-line service would email or transfer longer files to the tutor, but more often they used this service to make inquiries about more discrete problems usually while they were in the process of drafting their assignments.

# 5.3. Open versus closed questions

This is not to say that questioning strategies in face-to-face consultations universally resulted in more self-correction and self-reflection among clients than in computer-mediated sessions. In fact, there is evidence that when tutors did ask questions in on-line tutoring sessions, the questions were often designed to elicit more elaborated responses from clients. A number of scholars (Bell, 1989; Blau et al., 1998; Johnson, 1993) have noted that the extent to which questioning leads to increased client involvement in the revision process depends to some extent on whether the questions used are closed questions (those eliciting yes/no responses or giving the answerer a finite number of choices), open questions (those eliciting more extended replies), or rhetorical questions (those which are not meant to elicit a response at all). Fig. 4 shows the percentage of tutors’ initiating questions that were open, closed, and rhetorical.

As can be seen from Fig. 4, tutors were slightly more likely to ask closed questions and rhetorical questions in face-to-face consultations, whereas they were slightly more likely to ask open questions in computer-mediated sessions, questions like ‘‘What do you think the reader might feel reading your essay?’’ and ‘‘What problems have you found with the ending?’’

The effect of closed questions on the interactions was not just to increase the degree of interactional control exercised by tutors, but also to limit the clients’ ability to make substantive contributions to the revision process. In Excerpt 6 from a face-to-face session, for example, the client’s range of responses is limited to complying with directives or answering yes or no questions. When she does attempt an explanation (‘‘It’s like a reason’’), the tutor appears to ignore her. It can be argued that this strategy narrows the client’s opportunities to develop a clearer understating of the error; at the end of the excerpt, when the client says ‘‘Just cross out,’’ it is unclear whether she has really understood or is simply complying with what she infers to be the tutor’s demand.

C: Yes.   
T: Are you using so as a conjunction here?   
C: No.

C: Just cross out.

In contrast, Excerpt 7 from an on-line consultation is characterized by more open-ended questions, and the effect of these questions appears to be to encourage the client to explore for himself what might be wrong with his essay. In this example, when the client elicits advice from the tutor, the tutor continues to encourage the client to come up with his own solutions by asking further open-ended questions. This strategy leads not just to longer client turns, but also results in more egalitarian distribution of interactional control and more cooperative topic management.

# 5.4. Other initiating moves

Similar differences in the patterns of interactional control between on-line and face-to-face tutoring sessions can be seen in the distribution of other frequently used initiating moves, in particular, statements and directives.

Whereas in face-to-face interactions tutors made more than three times more initiating statements, in on-line interaction, clients made almost as many initiating statements as tutors. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the types of statements tutors and clients made in the different modes.

Consistent with the observations made in the analysis of questioning strategies, it was found that in face-to-face consultations tutors spent a significant amount of time explaining things to clients and offering evaluations, whereas in on-line sessions, clients were more likely to engage in explaining things to the tutors and even offered slightly more evaluations than in face-to-face sessions. One other interesting difference was that in face-to-face interactions tutors favored explanations, whereas in on-line sessions they favored evaluations.

Fig. 5. Distribution of statements (as percentage of total moves).

Among the clearest evidence of the difference in interactional control between on-line and face-to-face sessions was how much more willing clients seemed to be to issue directives in online sessions. Whereas in face-to-face sessions, tutors issued more than six times more directives than clients, in on-line sessions the number of directives tutors and clients issued was equal. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of different kinds of directives issued by clients and tutors in the two modes.

As can be seen from the graph, there was a dramatic difference in the distribution of requests between the two modes. In face-to-face interaction, tutors issued most of the requests, while in the on-line mode, it was clients who were doing most of the requesting. A similar contrast can be seen in the distribution of commands: whereas in face-to-face consultations, clients issued hardly any commands, in on-line interactions, they issued almost as many commands as tutors.

Fig. 6. Distribution of directives (as percentage or total moves).

The ways clients responded to directives were also different in face-to-face and on-line modes. Directives (requests, suggestions and commands) can elicit positive responses (compliance), neutral responses (acknowledgement, ambivalence), and negative responses (challenges, refusal). Whereas clients gave overwhelmingly positive responses in face-to-face encounters (more than twenty times more than negative responses), in on-line encounters, the number of negative responses was equal to the number of positive responses. As Thonus (1999b) states, one hallmark of a peer relationship in tutoring is the freedom to reject a tutor’s advice.

# 5.5. Topics

Along with the differences in interactional dynamics between the two modes observed above, and closely related to them, participants also exhibited differences in the topics they chose to discuss in face-to-face and in on-line tutoring sessions. Fig. 7 shows the percentage of turns devoted to various topics in the two modes.

What is perhaps most striking is that most of the turns in face-to-face encounters were devoted to textual issues: the discussion of grammar, word choice, and style, whereas more turns in the on-line sessions focused on what writing center theorists have termed ‘‘higher order goals’’ (Bruffee, 1986; Harris, 1986): issues of content and the writing process. This finding is consistent with Davis and Koch’s (1999) suggestion that synchronous computer-mediated interaction is more suited to addressing global issues in writing rather than details like grammar and sentence structure. It also helps us to understand a bit better the kinds of interactional strategies tutors and clients used in the two modes. In discussions of grammar, which involve fairly clear-cut ‘‘rules,’’ distinctions between ‘‘right’’ and ‘‘wrong’’, and a body of information which tutors are more likely to be in command of than clients—more tutor control of the discourse and more closed questions seem natural. In discussions involving broader issues of content, process, and the writer’s intentions, however, one would expect more open-ended questions and more client control of the discourse. This is also consistent with the contention of Blau et al. (1998) that directive instruction is more suited to discussions of grammar and mechanics, while non-directive approaches are more appropriate for talking about ideas, structure and voice.

![](img/e863f707f07bf207de1752498ddaf394a36d6b20980e515dd0d22f5589e969c5.jpg)  
Fig. 7. Percentage of turns devoted to different topics (GRA, grammar; WC, word choice; STRU, structure or organization; CNT, content; STY, style; PRO, writing process; VST, visit; ASBK, background of assignment; CRS, courses; DICT, dictionaries and other resources; REL, relational communication; and OTH, other).

Another dramatic difference in what participants discussed in the two modes is the relative frequency of what we call relational communication in on-line sessions. By relational communication we primarily mean talk which has as its main purpose the establishment or maintenance of rapport between interlocutors, what has elsewhere been termed phatic communication (Saville-Troike, 1982). We include in this category not only things like greetings, leave-takings, expressions of gratitude, and compliments, but also instances where participants talked about themselves or asked about their interlocutor in ways not directly related to the task at hand.

Of course, in face-to-face interaction, much ‘‘relational work’’ is done non-verbally through things like gesture, gaze, and facial expression, whereas in computer-mediated communication, with its lack of physical cues, this work must be done more explicitly. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of relational communication engaged in the on-line mode (constituting over ten percent of all turns) suggests that participants were doing more than just making up for the lack of physical cues. They were, in fact, constructing their relationships with each other and the ‘‘activity’’ of peer tutoring in different ways. Another factor contributing to the more informal and interpersonal character of the on-line sessions is the register of computer chat itself, which typically makes liberal use of such markers of interpersonal meaning as icons, abbreviations, and emoticons.

In short, face-to-face sessions were constructed like ‘‘lessons,’’ focusing on information and establishing and enforcing a clearly hierarchal relationship between tutor and client. In this mode, participants rarely strayed from the task to engage in ‘‘small talk’’ or relationship building (since the hierarchal nature of the relationship was already fixed) (Scollon & Scollon, 2001). On-line sessions were constructed more like ‘‘conversations,’’ with the negotiation of topics more open, the negotiation of relationships more fluid, and participants more willing to disclose and discuss more personal issues. One of the tutors commented on this difference, saying:

Students ask more questions during the ICQ sessions because they’re more comfortable. They tend to chat with you or even try to be friends rather than act like it’s a client-tutor session. Most of the ICQ chats are pleasant as you get to know the clients more and they’re willing to seek us out for help the next time.

# 6. Discussion and conclusion

The results of this study suggest that different modes of communication facilitate the construction of different kinds of relationships between peer-tutors and clients. Face-to-face interactions seem to lend themselves to more hierarchal relationships in which tutors take control of the discourse, primarily though strategies of asking ‘‘leading questions.’’ On-line interactions, on the other hand, seem to lead to more egalitarian relationships, with clients controlling the discourse more. In other words, the on-line interactions we studied appear to conform more closely to the ‘‘ideal’’ advocated in the writing center literature of non-directive tutoring within relationships of symmetrical solidarity. This, however, did not necessarily result in clients taking more responsibility for their learning.

Related to these differences in interactional dynamics were differences in the topics participants chose to focus on in the two modes. In face-to-face sessions, issues of grammar, vocabulary, and style took precedence, whereas in on-line sessions, participants were more likely to discuss more ‘‘global’’ writing concerns like content and process. In fact, when participants did discuss more detailed textual issues in on-line sessions, those discussions were often superficial, limited mostly to client initiated exchanges about the ‘‘correctness’’ of de-contextualized words, phrases, or sentences. This finding is similar to those of previous researchers (Davis & Koch, 1999; Honeycutt, 2001) who have suggested that synchronous chat is well suited for more global writing concerns but problematic when it comes to discussions of grammar.

It is perhaps not surprising that the tutors and clients in this study used hierarchical face systems in face-to-face tutoring sessions, particularly considering the cultural milieu in which the study was carried out. The behavior of both the tutors and the clients in many ways conformed to cultural norms of teacher–student interaction widely observed in Chinese educational contexts (see for example Jin & Cortazzi, 1998; Rao, 2001; Scollon & Scollon, 2001; Wong, 1988). Furthermore, even though both tutors and clients were non-native speakers, there was usually an assumed (if not real) difference in the language proficiency of the two parties, an important factor in discursive dominance (Thonus, 1999a). Finally, as Thonus has also pointed out, institutional factors and the formality of the setting can mitigate against egalitarian face systems. It is important to point out that all of the sessions that we analyzed (and most of the sessions in the writing center) were conducted overwhelmingly in English, a language not normally used between Cantonese speakers in face-to-face interaction outside of school (except, interestingly, when they use instant messaging software like ICQ). The use of English gave a further feeling of institutional formality to these encounters. The formality of the institutional setting was something that was remarked upon by tutors in the follow-up interviews. One noted:

I think the environment, the setting might be factors as well as the situation. I mean, in the office where we meet the students, sometimes they feel awkward and scared to ask help from the tutors. I find that many of them are very quiet and just try to agree more with us. This might be because they think we’re always right and don’t want to make us angry . . . I think the concept of ‘‘face’’ plays a big role here.

The real question, then, is what can account for the dramatic shift in interactional dynamics when the tutoring sessions were conducted on-line? Possible answers to this question are suggested in the large body of research on computer-mediated communication (CMC). Some researchers, for example, have found that CMC seems to have an effect on power relations, the lack of physical cues often resulting in more egalitarian communication (Sproull & Kiesler, 1986; Walther, 1992). Others (Cooper & Sportolari, 1997; Jones, 1995; Parks & Floyd, 1996; Walther, 1996) have pointed out that participants in computer-mediated interactions often develop closer relationships and feel more comfortable disclosing personal information, partly because of the perceived distance and relative anonymity of CMC. As one tutor remarked, ‘‘Clients are less shy in on-line sessions simply because we can’t see them. This changes the feeling of the situation.’’ Another noted, ‘‘Face-to-face sessions are definitely not as friendly and cozy as the on-line help sessions.’’

Research focusing particularly on computer-mediated teaching and mentoring has resulted in similar findings. Bierema and Merriam (2002) note that what distinguishes e-mentoring from face-to-face modes is an erosion of traditional power relations and more egalitarian exchanges. Chen and Gaines (1998) found that computer-mediated discussions between teachers and students were characterized not just by more egalitarian communication, but also by more collaboration, more interactivity, more attentiveness, and more reflective responses from students (see also Tannacito, 1998).

Trimbur (1992) suggests that the success of electronic peer tutoring stems from students’ widespread use of CMC for social interaction and comfort with the medium, and that using it for tutoring may be a way to help students bring their own ‘literacy networks’ into the writing process. This last reason seems particularly relevant to clients in this study who universally used computer-based chat to communicate with friends and manage their social lives (Jones, 2001). When tutors and clients sat together in an office at the university, they were on the tutors’ territory. When they chatted using ICQ, they were more on the clients’ turf. This transformation of power relations is the natural result of taking the interaction out of the writing center space and time which ‘‘cue’’ certain cultural and institution relationships and putting it in a different space and time (evenings and weekends) which ‘‘cue’’ different types of social relationships (friendlier and more egalitarian).

Perhaps the best conclusion we can come to from this study is not that either on-line or face-toface modes are ‘‘better’’ in terms of client learning, but rather that different modes serve different purposes, and the ideal situation is to use them together. On-line encounters give peer-tutors and their clients more opportunities to explore larger issues like content and process, and to get to know each other better. It is likely that the relationships that develop on-line positively influence subsequent face-to-face encounters. Face-to-face encounters, on the other hand, seem better suited for detailed discussions of textual issues, and it is similarly likely that information shared and lessons learned from such discussions might positively influence later on-line conversations of such issues.

The study presented here was limited in a number of ways, including the relatively small size of the sample and the restriction of the analysis to verbal interactions. Future research in this area might attempt to confirm the trends described here with larger populations or in different cultural contexts. It might also consider the impact of interactional dynamics on clients’ subsequent revisions and on their learning and language proficiency more generally. Finally, more work needs to be done on how insights from this and similar studies can be integrated into the training of tutors in writing centers and into efforts to help clients better reflect upon their own learning strategies.
