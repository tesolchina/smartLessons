Over the last two decades, a substantial amount of research has been done on interaction in writing conferences. However, most previous studies have focused on the cognitive aspects of conference discourse, neglecting its affective components. Yet conferences are by no means emotionally neutral, as they inherently involve evaluation of student work, correction, directions for improvement, and even criticism–that is, they involve potentially face-threatening acts. Therefore, it is important for teachers to know how to conference with students in non-threatening and affiliative ways. The study presented here examines on a turn-by-turn basis how a writing instructor used a wide range of affiliative interactional resources, including talk and embodied behavior, in two potentially face-threatening moments in writing conferences: providing critical feedback and uttering a directive. The analysis suggests that the use of affiliative interactional resources during feedback activities allows writing teachers to maintain positive relationships with students without deviating from their instructional objectives. Drawing on these findings, the article discusses the implications of this study for second language (L2) writing pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

Responding to student writing during writing conferences is a powerful means of providing feedback. The benefits of writing conferences are widely addressed in the first- and second-language writing feedback literature. One benefit is the negotiation that takes place in conferences, which gives both the teacher and the student the opportunity for better understanding and learning (e.g., Carnicelli, 1980; Conrad and Goldstein, 1999). Martin and Mottet (2011), for example, noted that, “Fewer errors in perception occur because students have the opportunity to ask for clarification or further exploration” (p. 5). Conferences also allow students to exercise their agency by negotiating teacher feedback and standing up for their ideas (Eodice, 1998; Gilliland, 2014; Newkirk, 1995). Written comments, in contrast, deprive students of this opportunity, providing only what Carnicelli (1980) called “one-way communication” (p. 108).

While responding to student writing during conferences may be pedagogically beneficial, such feedback is “not emotionally neutral” (Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011, p. 78). Instead, face-to-face encounters regarding students' work may be considered “emotionally charged interactions” (Trees et al., 2009, pp. 397e398) and become an obstacle to the development of positive teacher-student relationships. This may happen, first, because as a pedagogical practice, providing feedback enacts power relations wherein teacher and student perform asymmetrical roles, primarily due to unequal access to knowledge and institutionalized rights to this knowledge (Drew and Heritage, 1992). Second, responding to student writing involves evaluation and assessment of student work, correction, and directions for improvement, all of which often involve criticism. As Trees et al. (2009) put it, “Even when combined with glowing comments about strong aspects of the students' work, suggestions about improvement inherently contain the message that students did not do as well as they could–and perhaps should–have” (p. 398, emphasis in original). This may induce negative reactions from students, which can undermine the effectiveness and value of teacher feedback (Varlander, 2008; Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011 € ).

It goes without saying that instructors are expected to evaluate student performance; nevertheless, because of the inherent face-threatening nature of criticism, feedback is likely to “heighten emotional tension” (Kerssen-Griep and Witt, 2012, p. 499). Therefore, even the most delicately and tactfully formulated comments can easily be taken wrongly, and be destructive to learner identity (Carnicelli, 1980). In some cases, they may even impact students' self-esteem, motivation, and emotional well-being (Varlander, 2008 € ). Finally, criticism may also negatively impact students' perceptions of the teacher (Lee and Schallert, 2008), which may become an obstacle to the development of positive teacher-student relationships.

Considering the importance of the affective component of writing conferences, it is crucial for writing teachers to understand how to conference with students in non-threatening and affiliative ways. As Chen (2005) rightly noticed, “Since feelings and emotions intrinsically pervade conversations, the affective dimension of conferencing cannot be ignored” (p. 19). Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to examine writing conference discourse from an interpersonal, or relational, angle. What follows is a review of the relevant literature on the importance of relational aspects of writing conferences and teacher use of interactional resources to manage such relations.

# 1.1. Importance of relational aspects of writing conferences

The potentially damaging influence of feedback on positive teacher-student relationships appears to contradict the idea in the literature that writing conferences should provide a venue for creating and maintaining rapport between participants. According to Wilcox (1997), for instance, a writing conference cannot be productive if the teacher does not have trusting relationships with students. The link between positive interactional atmosphere and effectiveness of conferences was also addressed by Consalvo (2011), who asserted that a friendly conversation between teacher and student promotes their productivity in writing conferences. Along the same lines, Kaufman (2000) suggested that positive conference interaction between teacher and student facilitates further learning: “Rapport usually results in a productive conference in which the student leaves with new perspectives, a clarified direction for further work, and a renewed enthusiasm” (p. 92). Martin and Mottet (2011) argued that due to rapport, students are more likely to trust teachers' suggestions. Finally, Chen (2005) pointed out the importance of embracing the emotional layer ingrained in conference interaction: “[F]eelings of being welcomed or rejected, encouraged or humiliated, valued or threatened remain strong in learners long after the conference is over” (Chen, 2005, p. 19).

The significance of a positive and supportive conference atmosphere is also documented in the literature from the students' perspective. Thus, Liu (2009) examined students' expectations of conferences and found that about half of those he studied viewed conferences as an opportunity to strengthen “a close personal relationship” (p. 110) with their instructor, as well as places where they could feel safer and more confident. One of Qureshi's (2013) participants also commented on a similar feeling of safety and confidence: “[I]t is easy I think [to ask questions] … the teacher is friendly … you didn't get nervous” (p. 29). Black (1998) also found that students' assessment of writing conference effectiveness was influenced by the emotional factor. She likewise referred to her own conferencing experience as a learner, which resembled those of her students: “What makes certain memories of conferencing so strong for me is not whether I got the advice to rewrite a particular paper and get a good grade, but whether I felt welcomed or humiliated or valued or threatened” (pp. 123e134). As seen from these statements, students indeed expect writing conferences to be relationship-enhancing activities.

Considering the importance of a positive conference atmosphere and teacher-student relationships on the one hand, and the existence of a potentially face-threatening component in teacher feedback on the other, conference feedback stands as a highly complex phenomenon that contains two seemingly contradictory objectives: to deliver evaluative and sometimes corrective information and to minimize the face-threatening effect of this activity. It is not surprising therefore that writing teachers sometimes may feel, in Kerssen-Griep and Witt (2012)'s words, “torn between directing students' learning or maintaining productive rapport with them” (p. 498).

# 1.2. Managing relational aspects of feedback

How, then, can instructors find a balance between instructional and relational goals? Previous research has demonstrated that teachers can take advantage of the very nature of oral feedback–face-to-face interaction–and use its various interactional resources to maximize affiliation and establish solidarity with students in potentially face-threatening moments of instruction. Below is a brief review of studies that examined teacher interactional resources during feedback encounters (both in the classroom and in one-on-one interaction) implemented in order to minimize face-threatening effects of the feedback act, level power differences, and soften error correction.

# 1.2.1. Minimizing face-threatening effects of feedback

Various interactional strategies that help to minimize face threat of instructional feedback were examined by KerssenGriep and Witt (e.g., Kerssen-Griep and Witt, 2012; Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011) in a series of experiments conducted with college undergraduates. In these studies, students watched a video segment of an instructor providing feedback while speaking to the camera as if addressing the student directly. The students were asked to imagine that they were receiving actual feedback from this instructor. The students then completed a questionnaire indicating their perceptions of the feedback and the instructor. During this experiment, one of the four video scenarios was randomly assigned to the students, in which the teacher either used or did not use relationship-building strategies while delivering feedback. The two groups of relationship-building strategies were: 1) teacher nonverbal immediacy, which includes eye gaze, smile, open body position, gesture, physical proximity, and relaxed posture, and 2) face-threat mitigation techniques, which include verbal expressions of solidarity and approbation, tactful hedges, and qualifiers.

Both studies found the relationship between teacher's nonverbal immediacy behaviors and students' perceptions of the teacher: teacher's perceived credibility (Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011), and teacher's ability to motivate students and treat them fairly (Kerssen-Griep and Witt, 2012). To illustrate, Witt and Kerssen-Griep (2011) revealed that when the teacher used various relational tools, including frequent eye contact, smiles, relaxed body positions and gestures, students perceived him as “a credible source of feedback” (p. 87), more competent and intelligent, more ethical, honorable, trustworthy, caring, and “someone who had their best interests in mind” (p. 88). Furthermore, Kerssen-Griep and Witt (2012) found that when the teacher used nonverbal immediacy and face-threat mitigation techniques during feedback encounters, students perceived him fairer and more motivating.

The influence of immediacy behaviors on student affective learning was considered by Martin and Mottet (2011). Their study was conducted in a high school context comparing how two types of writing conference scenarios presented to ninthgraders affected their emotional acceptance of the course and the material taught in it. In the first type, the teacher used immediacy behaviors such as making eye contact, speaking in a soft voice, keeping a relaxed posture, smiling, and using gestures. In the second type, the teacher exhibited non-immediacy behaviors such as having little eye contact, speaking in a louder voice, having a rather stiff body posture, and leaning back in the chair. After analyzing the scenarios, students completed a survey. Findings revealed that students had more positive reactions to the teacher, the conference, and writing in general in the scenarios in which the teacher used immediacy behavior.

# 1.2.2. Leveling power difference

Relational interactional moves that help to balance power difference between teacher and student were examined in Consalvo (2011). The study found that both verbal and nonverbal relational moves were implemented by two instructors as they interacted with their students during writing conferences. Verbal relational moves included “I-statements” (i.e., teacher sharing own experience with students) and self-deprecating comments (i.e., “verbal shrinking-of-official-teacher-self” (p. 156)). Nonverbal relational moves included bodily actions teachers utilized to “become physically less imposing” (p. 156), such as sitting on the floor, kneeling, and squatting. Consalvo found that these relational moves presented the teachers as “more human, less powerful” (p. 141) and overall created a positive conference atmosphere.

# 1.2.3. Softening error correction

Error correction is a common instructional activity in L2 classrooms. However, while it may be seen as an inevitable aspect of language teaching, error correction can be face threatening for students. Previous research shows that teachers can minimize the harshness of error correction by deploying affiliative interactional resources, thus managing both instructional and relational aspects of teaching.

To illustrate, Nguyen (2007) showed that relationship-building strategies can be “implicitly blended into instruction” (p. 299, emphasis in original) and thus become an integral part of the teaching-learning process. In her study, conducted in the ESL classroom, Nguyen described how an instructor corrected students in non-threatening and affiliative ways by implementing various interactional resources, including lexical and prosodic elements of speech, bodily position, gesture, and facial expression. Similar interactional resources were implemented by a teacher in Park's (2016) study conducted in the Korean as a foreign language classroom. To express affiliation with the students, the teacher used smile, soft laughter, and compliments in the moments of correcting students' errors. Both studies suggest that teachers can establish the type of environment “where real learning tasks are done and real social relationships are built through the authentic and natural employment of various interactional resources” (Nguyen, 2007, p. 299, emphasis in original).

Although the aforementioned studies provide insight into how teachers can mitigate the face-threatening nature of feedback through the use of relational tools, they nevertheless beg several unresolved questions due to two major limitations. The first limitation is the lack in authenticity of the examined phenomena. Thus, the studies by Kerssen-Griep and Witt (2012), Witt and Kerssen-Griep (2011), and Martin and Mottet (2011) were conducted under experimental conditions by presenting hypothetical scenarios to the students. Such artificially created situations do not reflect the complexity and richness of real-life human interaction and the dynamic nature of social activities, mutually constituted by participants on a moment-by-moment basis. In fact, Martin and Mottet (2011) themselves acknowledged the methodological limitation of their study: “A more authentic measure through actual conferences between teacher and student could have yielded potentially more reliable data” (p.13). Therefore, questions remain: How can teachers use the nonverbal immediacy tools and face-threat mitigation techniques discussed in these studies in real-life teacher-student interaction? How do students respond to these techniques in unfolding, moment-to-moment activities?

The second limitation is the focus on teacher actions. For example, Consalvo (2011) primarily examined instructors' behaviors, essentially overlooking the analysis of students' reactions. In addition, Nguyen (2007) and Park (2016) dealt with multi-party classroom interaction, making it difficult to analyze thoroughly the reactions of individual students to the relationship-building strategies implemented by the teachers. Accordingly, questions remain to be answered: What are students' reactions to teachers' attempts to build solidarity and establish a positive atmosphere during instruction? How are affiliative moments mutually created in teacher-student interaction?

# 1.3. The present study

This review of the literature provides compelling support for the argument that it is important for teachers to know how to provide feedback in non-threatening and affiliative ways. As yet, however, it appears that research has not discussed how affiliative moments in teacher-student interaction are cooperatively created during potentially face-threatening feedback activities in writing conferences. Therefore, this study examines how one writing teacher employed mundane but highly developed interactional resources, including her talk and embodied actions, to respond to student writing in affiliative and non-threatening ways during writing conferences.

# 2. Terms used in the study

Before describing the study, it is important to define the terms used in it. Three concepts guided the analysis of the data: affiliation, affiliative interactional resources, and participation frameworks.

Affiliation. In research on interaction, particularly in conversation analysis (CA), the term affiliation is frequently discussed in the same context with the concept of alignment to describe the cooperative nature of human interaction. Alignment is used to refer to the “structural level of cooperation” (Stivers et al., 2011, p. 20), whereas affiliation is seen as “the affective level of cooperation” (Stivers et al., 2011, p. 21), indexing emotionally positive, pro-social relational connections between participants. The present study adopts the view of affiliation as expression of social solidarity, and is used to describe teacher-student interpersonal closeness and social coherence during conference interaction.

Affiliative interactional resources. This term is used in the literature to refer to interactional tools used by participants to create social solidarity and interpersonal closeness. From this perspective, affiliative interactional resources are somewhat similar to relationship-building tools. However, unlike the latter, which may not produce an immediate interactional result– although they may impact relationships in the long run–affiliative interactional resources are employed to reach an immediate affective cooperation between participants by bringing them in a moment of interpersonal closeness and solidarity. In this study, the term is used to refer to pro-social interactional tools deployed by the teacher to create solidarity and togetherness with the students in potentially face-threatening moments of conference interaction.

Research on interaction describes a wide range of resources used by participants to convey affiliation. They include verbal resources, such as lexical and grammatical features (e.g., Couper-Kuhlen, 2012; Jefferson, 2002; Lee, 2016), laughter (e.g., Clift, 2016; Glenn, 2003; Kozlova, 2008), phonetic and prosodic features of talk (e.g., Couper-Kuhlen, 2012; Lindstrom, 2009€ ; Müller, 1996; Reber, 2012), and various features of embodied behavior (e.g., Goodwin, 2006; Goodwin et al., 2012). In the language learning context, Amador and Adams (2013) described a variety of affiliative resources used by the teacher, including smiling, laughing, joking, implementing playful embodied and verbal parodies, increasing voice pitch, and increasing physical proximity.

Participation frameworks. This term is used in the literature to describe how participants visibly display their dynamically changing roles, and how they orient to each other's roles and actions in the unfolding sequential organization of social activity. Goffman (1981), who developed this analytical concept, explained:

[W]hen a word is spoken all those who happen to be in perceptual range of the event will have some sort of participation status relative to it. The codification of these various positions and the normative specifications of appropriate conduct with each other provide an essential background for interaction analysis (p. 3).

Goffman's model of participation frameworks emphasizes and provides a classification of the roles of participants in interaction–speakers and hearers. Speakers hold the floor by delivering the utterance and determine “the production format” (Goffman, 1981, p. 146) of the action in progress, and the other participants are oriented to the speaker's action in a particular “participation status” (p. 137). Therefore, participation frameworks, according to Goffman, are a combination of the participation status of all actors for that particular moment of interaction.

Goodwin (2007b; see also Goodwin, 2003; Goodwin and Goodwin, 2004) challenged Goffman's participation frameworks by suggesting that his model primarily provided a typology of participants rather than the analysis of the interactive organization of utterances constructed by the participants in each moment of interaction. Goodwin (2007b) also argued that Goffman endowed the speaker with the primary role and “considerable cognitive complexity” (p. 20), thereby leaving the “semiotic life” of the hearer on the periphery (p. 21). Thus, according to Goodwin, Goffman's model placed hearers and speakers in two isolated worlds, which in turn incapacitated the analysis of interaction as a process “in which different kinds of participants are building action in concert with each other” (Goodwin, 2007b, p. 28).

Accordingly, in Goodwin's model of participation frameworks, which he refers to as embodied participation frameworks (see Goodwin, 2007b), both speakers and hearers are defined as active co-participants whose talk and embodied action affect the organization of the action in progress. Goodwin's model demonstrates that the hearer's role entails more than listening, but involves “situated use of the body, and gaze in particular, as a way of visibly displaying to others the focus of one's orientation” (Goodwin, 2000b, p. 159). Goodwin (2007b) further argues that even when hearers are silent, they are actively “engaged in detailed analysis of the unfolding structure of that talk,” and based on this analysis, they make “projections relevant to their own participation in it” (p. 24). At the same time, because of the hearers' active co-presence and co-participation enacted through their visible bodily conduct, speakers actively attend to them and systematically modify their actions in order to accommodate the actions of the hearers. This model therefore is built on the concept of “mutual reflexivity” (Goodwin, 2007b, p. 28) of all participants at any moment in interaction. That is, at each moment, participation frameworks are created and sustained through the participants' mutual attention to the organization of the unfolding action, their embodied displays, which demonstrate whether or not they are attending to the moment of action, and their reflexive orientation toward each other's talk and embodied behavior.

To take into account simultaneous multimodal actions of both participants (i.e., teacher and student) in conference interaction, the present study adopts Goodwin's model of participation frameworks.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Context

Data were collected in a first-year composition course for international students at a large research university in the Midwest. One-on-one writing conferences were part of the curriculum. The course syllabus consisted of a sequenced writing project–a series of assignments written on the same topic, which students developed over the course of the semester by approaching it from different angles: formulating their research questions (Formal Proposal), consulting with an expert (Interview Report), synthesizing information from multiple academic sources (Synthesis Paper), making an argument on a particular issue within their topic (Argumentative Essay), and finally presenting the findings of their research orally (Oral Presentation).

# 3.2. Participants

The teacher in this study, Alicia1 (Fig. 1), was a graduate teaching assistant who had come to the U. S. from Eastern Europe. At the time of this study, she was in the second year of her doctoral program. Although it was her first time teaching the multilingual version of introductory composition, like most other instructors who taught the multilingual version, she had taught a mainstream section of the course in her first year of graduate studies. Moreover, before becoming a doctoral student, she had taught writing and English for Academic Purposes for two years in another institution in the U.S.

The two other participants were Alicia's students. Bin (Fig. 2) was an exchange student from China studying Economics, and at the time of the study, he was a junior. Jade (Fig. 3) was a sophomore student from China, majoring in Animal Science.

# 3.3. Data collection

The data presented here were collected as part of a larger study examining the moment-to-moment construction of affiliative teacher-student relationships in writing conferences. The corpus of the video-recorded data in the larger study consisted of 14 writing conferences, with the total of 217 contact minutes of naturally occurring interaction; each student participant was recorded seven times with an average length of $1 5 . 6 \mathrm { m i n }$ per conference. Although no quantitative measure was employed to capture the number of affiliative instances occurred in the data, both the conference observations and the analysis of the episodes revealed the teacher's frequent use of affiliative interactional resources while she was conferencing with the students.

The data were collected for the purpose of detailed, moment-to-moment analysis. This method, as opposed to researcher's high-inference data collection through observation and notetaking, allowed for an “emphasis on concrete experience and performance” (Atkinson, 2011, p. 156) by capturing fine details of participants' talk and embodied behavior. Indeed, human interaction is highly complex and dynamic; therefore, in order to understand how particular social actions are being mutually constituted by participants moment to moment, the researcher needed to employ methods that could “grasp the [interactive] process in flight” (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 68).

Two video-recorded episodes were selected for the purpose of this article, as they contained potentially facethreatening acts for students–receiving critical feedback (Excerpt 1) and receiving a directive (Excerpt 2). Both episodes demonstrate how the teacher mitigated these potentially face-threatening acts by using a range of affiliative interactional resources.

# 3.4. Data transcription

A modified version of transcribing conventions (see Appendix) developed by conversation analysts, most notably by Gail Jefferson (2004), were used to transcribe the selected episodes. This transcription system allows for recording participants' interaction in a highly detailed manner. Special attention during transcribing was given to capturing the semiotic richness of interaction; therefore, unlike the classic CA transcription system, transcripts in this study were abundantly annotated to reflect the “constellation of [multimodal] resources” (Flewitt et al., 2009, p. 44) interwoven in interaction, that is, participants' embodied displays used in conjunction with their manipulation of physical objects as well as their spatial orientation to each other and their physical environment.2

# 3.5. Data analysis

The transcripts were analyzed while watching the selected video-recordings using the discourse-analytic approach known as multimodal interaction analysis (Atkinson, 2011; Nishino and Atkinson, 2015; Norris, 2004). This method is based on several traditions in analyzing interaction, including conversation analysis (Jefferson, 1988; Sacks et al., 1974; Schegloff, 2007; Schegloff and Sacks, 1973), interactional sociolinguistics (Goffman, 1963, 1974; Gumperz, 1982; Kendon, 1990; Tannen, 1984), microethnography (Erickson, 1992; Erickson and Shultz, 1982), multimodal analysis (Kress & Van Leeuwen, 2001; Van Leeuwen, 1999), and nonverbal communication studies (Andersen, 1999; Argyle, 1988; Floyd and Guerrero, 2006; Knapp et al., 2013). As suggested by its name, multimodal interaction analysis focuses on capturing the moment-to-moment use of the many and varied semiotic resources (Goodwin, 2000a) that participants deploy to build social action together. By allowing the systematic examination of these semiotic resources, multimodal interaction analysis provides a deeper understanding of the complex nature of human interaction.

# 4. Analysis of excerpts

The analysis below demonstrates how the instructor used multimodal interactional resources (e.g., spoken utterances, visible embodied displays) during writing conferences to respond to students' writing in affiliative and non-threatening ways. In Excerpt 1 the teacher softened criticism by using humor, and in Excerpt 2 she converted an unfinished directive into an expression of empathy toward the student. Thus, both episodes illustrate how affiliation was achieved without deviating from the instructional objective of the meeting.

# 4.1. Providing critical feedback

In Excerpt 1, Alicia and Bin are discussing Bin's second draft of the Formal Proposal. The conversation is focused on Bin's introduction of this paper, which he wrote in a story-like way, i.e., as a narrative. As became apparent from the interaction preceding this excerpt, Bin was pleased with his introduction, finding it unique and attention getting. Alicia, however, did not share Bin's view, and prior to Excerpt 1 she had gently explained to Bin that the rhetorical strategy he had used did not meet her expectations for an academic proposal. She even used the word “surprised” to describe her initial reaction while reading his narrative-like introduction. In the excerpt, Alicia tries to explain her reaction by referring to Bin's (imagined) audience, and ultimately, helping Bin understand why a narrative approach is not appropriate for an academic audience. But she does this in an affiliative way, through creating a humorous role-play situation that demonstrates the inappropriateness of Bin's introduction.

As Excerpt 1 begins (see below), Alicia sits in front of the desktop computer in the computer lab, gazing at Bin, with her head resting on her left hand and her right arm resting on the desk next to the keyboard. Bin sits to Alicia's right, gazing at the computer screen, with his open tablet positioned in front of him (Picture 1).

Excerpt 1 starts by Alicia's referring to a topic previously covered in class–analyzing business proposals (lines 1, 5). Having set the stage, she then moves on to providing critical feedback on Bin's introduction. She does so through an imaginary example (lines 17e20): rather than directly telling Bin how the information should be presented in an academic proposal, she makes a shift in participation frameworks by creating a mini role-play scenario to make her point. In this scenario, Alicia–taking the role of a salesperson–presents Bin with a hypothetical proposal, whose purpose is to help her sell furniture to Bin. This situation appears to be humorous not only because of its content, but also because of the way Alicia performs it. That is, first, she adopts a stagy facial expression: she widens her eyes and slightly raises her eyebrows (Picture 2a). Second, she speaks in a dramatic, low-pitched voice, as if describing a scene from a horror story (lines 27e28). Bin aligns with the humorous nature of Alicia's performance by immediately responding to it with a laughter token (line 31, Picture 2b).

As soon as the dramatized scenario has been enacted, Alicia resumes her “normal” voice (lines 35e36), thereby indicating another shift in participation frameworks–from the humorous frame of the role-play back to an instructor orientation. She explains to Bin the seeming absurdity of the presented situation in lines 35 and 38, and then continues her explanation until line 57. When Alicia uses the word “Halloween” (line 54), Bin nods and smiles, thus expressing his affiliation with Alicia and his understanding of the comical nature of her example (line 56, Picture 2c). He also reiterates his understanding of the meaning of the presented scenario by the statement “uh I know” (line 59) uttered in a smile voice and enhanced, once again, by a slight head nod. These multimodal actions may also indicate that Bin is now making connections between Alicia's example and his own writing, as well as increasing his awareness of the genre inappropriateness of his introduction, which Alicia subjected to criticism.

As the excerpt concludes, Alicia starts discussing the main point of the presented scenario, in other words, explaining what Bin should learn from this example (lines 63, 67, 69). Just before that–in line 62–she shifts her gaze to the computer screen– now “the central player” (Nishino and Atkinson, 2015, p. 45) in their discussion. Bin also displays his alignment with this reframing and his readiness to receive further instruction by shifting his gaze to Alicia in line 66.

In sum, the non-threatening atmosphere in this episode was created by the teacher's shifting participation frameworks from instruction to a play frame (Kozlova, 2008; Zdrojkowski, 2007) in which she was able to critically evaluate Bin's introduction but in a humorous, affectively positive, and indirect way. As she did so, Alicia produced an imaginary role-play scenario by taking on a different identity, which allowed her to temporarily step away from her authoritative teacher role. As seen from the analysis, the role-play scenario resembled a rhetorical choice (i.e., a story) in Bin's introduction. The combination of affiliative interactional resources that Alicia used to index the inappropriateness of this rhetorical choice allowed her to soften the critical nature of her feedback, create an affiliative moment with the student, and prepare a safe environment for the subsequent instruction.

# 4.2. Giving a directive

In Excerpt 2, Alicia and Jade are discussing Jade's second draft of the Synthesis Paper. The conversation is focused on the grammatical accuracy of Jade's paper. Prior to the excerpt, Alicia pointed out several grammatical issues in Jade' draft. In the analyzed episode, she wants to know if Jade proofread the draft before submitting it. As the excerpt begins (see below), Alicia sits in front of the desktop computer, gazing at the screen, which displays Jade's draft and in which Alicia appears to have marked Jade's errors. Jade sits to Alicia's right, gazing at the computer screen, with her open laptop positioned in front of her (Picture 3).

In line 1, Alicia begins to make a statement that looks like an evaluation, or a direct comment on the quality of Jade's writing: “There is so-sometimes u:m,” perhaps starting to say something like: “There is sometimes lots of mistakes in this paper.” This assumption can be made based on at least two details. First, the syntactic structure of Alicia's unfinished statement consists of the nonreferential there followed by the copula verb be, whose function is to indicate “a mental space in which some entity is to be located” (Celce-Murcia and Larsen-Freeman, 1999, p. 450). This grammatical structure requires the placement of a logical subject, which in this case seems to be situated in Jade's draft–the locus of both participants' attention. Second, Alicia and Jade are looking at the computer screen that displays Jade's draft with marked grammatical errors, so Alicia's statement should be a comment on what both of them can see in the draft.

Due to its critical nature as well as Alicia's authority, this statement would have also appeared to be dissaffiliative and potentially face threatening for the student. However, without finishing it, Alicia pauses and restarts this utterance as a question (line 2). Thus, she turns a potentially negative and critical statement into a question, thereby seeking information rather than asserting the reality or criticizing student's performance. Essentially, we can infer that she is trying to understand the student from the student's point of view. Alicia's embodied action is significant here as well: she establishes an interpersonal contact with Jade through turning her head toward Jade and gazing at her (Picture 4a).

In line 18 it becomes apparent that Jade did not proofread her draft. Alicia's relevant task becomes to instruct Jade to proofread her papers before submitting them. In fact, she starts doing this in lines 22 and 24: “So you can you can do this for the papers you're writing.” Next, in line 29, Alicia appears to continue to direct Jade: “So once you are done with them … While it is not clear how Alicia was going to finish this statement, it can be argued that it would be a direct instruction, based on the grammatical construction of the beginning of this sentence (i.e., the use of the pronoun “you”). However, without finishing her directive, she reforms it into an affiliative utterance that describes her personal experience: she employs an Istatement (Consalvo, 2011), by switching the grammatical perspective from “you” to “I” (lines 33, 36, 38): “Sometimes I write a paper and don't look at it anymore.”

In addition to changing the grammatical perspective from the student to herself, Alicia also makes a shift in participation frameworks by momentarily stepping away from her teacher role and taking on the identity of a writer who is familiar with the difficulties that other writers may face. In other words, by taking the perspective of Jade's fellow writer, Alicia positions herself on the same level with the student. Thus, by putting herself in Jade's shoes (so to speak) with this statement, Alicia “maximize[s] affiliative concern” for Jade (Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011, p. 76).

While producing her affiliative utterance “Sometimes I write a paper and don't look at it anymore,” Alicia also makes a pushing away gesture as an affective means of enacting what Jade may be feeling about revising (Picture 4b). In other words, Alicia embodies her empathy, as described by Bavelas et al. (1990): “Rather than simply saying, “I know how you feel,” the [interlocutor] actually shows how you feel, in the analogically coded equivalent of the verbal statement” (p. 325, emphasis in original). This empathetic action elicits a gradually emerging smile from Jade (line 38). Jade then responds in a rather energetic way: she overlaps with the last word of Alicia's sentence (line 42), starts laughing, brings her hand to her chin, and nods. Alicia immediately aligns with Jade (line 45), and they both join in laughter (Picture 4c). As a climax point of this excerpt, their simultaneous laughter appears to be a visible expression of their emotional convergence and mutual affiliation (Partington, 2006; Thonus, 2008).

The excerpt ends with Alicia's reiterating her empathy in line 53: “I know I know this feeling.” Notice that while Alicia is making this statement, Jade continues to gaze at Alicia with an affiliative smile on her face (Picture 4d), thus expressing her solidarity with the teacher.

Thus, in Excerpt 2, the teacher avoided a face-threatening moment in interaction by withholding a critical statement and directive, but instead performed an act whose function was directly the opposite of threatening the student's face–i.e., creating an affiliative bond. As the analysis shows, Alicia temporarily stepped away from her teacher role to create togetherness and solidarity with the student, and it can be argued that by doing so she prepared a more fertile environment for subsequent instructional activities.

# 5. Discussion

The data presented here illustrate how the teacher responded to student writing during writing conferences in pro-social and affiliative ways. The two excerpts selected for analysis illustrated instances of critical feedback and potential direct instruction. These instances, as argued earlier, are likely to be face threatening for learners (Kerssen-Griep and Witt, 2012; Martin and Mottet, 2011; Nguyen, 2007; Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011), and as such, may cause “social strain” for them (Amador and Adams, 2013, p. 147). The affiliative interactional resources used by the teacher allowed her to decrease this threat by minimizing her authoritative position and softening criticism, and helped her project a positive stance and maintain a collaborative atmosphere. Ultimately, the use of each of these interactional resources allowed the teacher to balance the instructional objectives (e.g., deliver instructional material, provide helpful feedback, facilitate students' learning) and the relational objectives (e.g., maintain affiliation with the students, preserve positive relationships with them).

One affiliative interactional resource that helped the teacher create solidarity with the students in potentially facethreatening moments of interaction in both episodes was a shift in participation frameworks by Alicia's taking on a different identity. In Excerpt 1, for example, she switched from the instructional framework “teacher-student” to the imaginary framework “salesperson-customer” in a humorous role-play, which allowed her to provide critical feedback while playing a less threatening role. In Excerpt 2, Alicia took on the role of the student's fellow writer, which allowed her to express empathy and thus create a moment of affiliation with the student. In both episodes, the shifts in participation frameworks reduced the perceived distance and power imbalance and created closeness, familiarity, and solidarity with the students in potentially face-threatening moments of interaction. This observation compliments the findings described in Nguyen (2007), in which a similar shift in participation frameworks was performed by teacher in order to facilitate affiliation with the students and maintain positive relationships without deviating from instructional activities.

Furthermore, the teacher's embodied actions played a crucial role in both episodes by appearing to foster affiliation with the students. That is, in Excerpt 1, the teacher's embodied behavior–in combination with other interactional tools (e.g., pitch of voice)–allowed creating a dramatic performance, which had a humorous effect and elicited student's laughter. In Excerpt 2, Alicia's embodied action expressed her affective stance on the action of proofreading, which, presumably, reflected the student's stance as well. This also made the instructor's expression of empathy more powerful, and, as the analysis of Episode 2 showed, it brought the teacher and the student to the joint moment of mutual affiliation–i.e., simultaneous laughter. It must also be mentioned here that the affiliative effect of the teacher's embodied actions in both excerpts could only be observed in relation to a particular moment of interaction in which they were employed–that is, in their immediate ecology. Put differently, they should be viewed not as a combination of actions with static and decontextualized symbolic meanings, but as environmentally coupled gestures3 (Goodwin, 2007a, 2007c)–that is, with reference to the social and physical context in which they were produced.

Along with the embodied actions that served affiliative purposes in potentially face-threatening moments of conference interaction, the instructor used other tools that allowed her to build affiliation during the meetings, such as her voice in Excerpt 1, and I-statements in Excerpt 2. Thus, in Excerpt 1, Alicia's voice increased the humorous effect by creating a dramatic feel in the described situation. The tone and the intonation of her voice, used in combination with other interactional resources, created a comical situation, whose effectiveness was recoverable from the student's laughter. In Excerpt 2, Alicia used I-statements to facilitate solidarity with the student. I-statements are defined by Consalvo (2011) as relational moves, and they allow the current speaker to temporarily project a different interactional role, thereby inviting the co-participant to take on a position relevant to this role shift. In Consalvo (2011), for example, the writing instructor employed I-statements to move from being a teacher-evaluator to being an interested and sympathetic reader. Similarly, in Excerpt 2, the teacher used Istatements to switch from being a figure of authority to being a fellow writer who is well aware of some of the challenges writers may face, and this allowed her to create an affiliative connection with the student.

Finally, the students' reactions to the teacher's affiliative actions may be judged as the indicator of their effectiveness. Thus, in both episodes, the students responded with full-fledged laughter, which marked their affiliation with the teacher and their appreciation of the teacher's utterance in the particular moment of interaction (Zdrojkowski, 2007). In Excerpt 1, for example, the student was supportive of the teacher's humorous contribution to their interaction. He interpreted the situation as laughable (Thonus, 2008) marking it with laughter–a sign of his acknowledgement and appreciation of the teacher's humorous examples. As Lindstrom and Sorjonen (2013)€ observed, “By laughing the recipient displays that she has recognized and understood that a joke was told and that it was funny, and consequently affiliates with the state the joke teller has conveyed by telling the joke” (p. 353). In such a vein, the teacher's use of humor in this episode appears to be effective (Glenn, 1989).

In Excerpt 2, on the other hand, the student's laughter was not the sign of support of the teacher's humorous contribution to the interaction, but rather the appreciation of the teacher's empathetic statement. As seen from the analysis of this episode, Alicia's embodied actions–vibrantly enacting her and Jade's emotional attitude to the action of proofreading–made her expression of empathy more powerful and produced Jade's animated multimodal response to it: an overlapping utterance produced at higher volume and immediately followed by her laughter. Put differently, it appeared that with this reaction, Jade was essentially saying: “You are so right! This is exactly how I feel!” Moreover, student's laughter in this episode was reciprocated by the teacher. In the literature, mutual laughter is frequently referred to as a rapport-building and affiliative tool that creates comfort in interaction (Matlock, 2000), helps manage emotional tension (Partington, 2006; Zdrojkowski, 2007), reduces power imbalances (Thonus, 2008), indicates the interlocutors' intention to share authority (Zdrojkowski, 2007), and creates solidarity between interlocutors (Kozlova, 2008). It can be argued therefore that Alicia's laughing with the student marked the highest degree of their affiliation.

As demonstrated, due to their potentially face-threatening nature, providing critical feedback and uttering directives may pose difficulties to teachers by putting them in front of a potentially inevitable trade-off between instructing students and maintaining positive relationships with them. As Trees et al. (2009) noted, “Successfully evaluating students' work challenges teachers to achieve both corrective task and identity-protection goals in interaction” (p. 397). The episodes analyzed above demonstrate that the teacher in this study took up this challenge by effectively employing a combination of multimodal affiliative resources during potentially face-threatening moments of interaction, and by doing so, accomplished the instructional task without damaging her relationship with the students. In other words, the teacher's interactional resources functioned to meet simultaneously instructional and relational objectives.

To conclude, the study provides an important contribution to the exiting scholarship on the teacher's use of affiliative resources in face-threatening moments of instruction. Similar to the previous studies examining the implementation of teacher nonverbal immediacy and face-threat mitigation techniques (Kerssen-Griep and Witt, 2012; Martin and Mottet, 2011; Witt and Kerssen-Griep, 2011), the present study showed the importance of teacher's affiliative behavior in feedback encounters. However, due to the methodological framework employed for the analysis of conference interaction, the study also demonstrated how affiliative interactional resources were implemented in situ, moment to moment, in real-time interaction– essentially giving these affiliative resources life, functionality, and substance. In addition, unlike Consalvo (2011), the analysis in this study also considered students' reactions to teacher's affiliative behavior; and unlike Nguyen (2007) and Park (2016), it focused on one-on-one, rather than multi-party, interaction. Thus, the study showed in detail how affiliation was mutually constructed on a turn-by-turn basis, “with the reference to the properties of embodied co-presence” of both interlocutors (Streeck et al., 2011, p. 3). In sum, the study provides, as Lindstrom and Sorjonen (2013) € put it, “a more fine-grained appreciation of affiliation as a dynamic phenomenon” (p. 367).

# 6. Implications for L2 writing pedagogy

The study offers important implications for second language writing pedagogy. Due to the detailed, turn-by-turn examination of conference interaction, the findings offer insight into the logistics of teacher feedback by demonstrating, through the microscopic lens of multimodal interaction analysis, how feedback is accomplished as a moment-to-moment social action. It is true that the literature on feedback provides writing teachers with a number of valuable suggestions, tips, and best practices. However, while these are certainly helpful, they appear to be mostly general ideas–“rules of thumb” and “what-to-dos,” presumed to work in any institutional context irrespective of specific students' needs. This study, in contrast, has analyzed feedback as a complex interactional phenomenon–i.e., a dynamically unfolding action, mutually constituted by the teacher and the student in real time. From this perspective, the study suggests that any feedback practice described in the literature could also be studied as a highly complex and situated social activity, rather than general, static rules of thumb or all-purpose strategies.

Along with this methodological contribution, the following principles evidenced in this study may be applied by L2 writing instructors.

Feedback has a potential face-threatening effect. When providing feedback on student performance, instructors may potentially create a distance between themselves and their students due to their assertion of authority and the evaluation– and even criticism, implicitly or explicitly stated–of written student work. While all students may be sensitive to teacher feedback (Varlander, 2008 € ), correcting students' language errors in particular may be damaging to L2 learner identity and self-confidence (Amador and Adams, 2013). Therefore, the effectiveness and value of teacher feedback may be undermined by students' reactions to it. Being aware of the face-threatening nature of feedback will help L2 writing teachers find appropriate interactional resources to deliver evaluation without damaging learner identity and to provide helpful suggestions for improvement without straining teacher-student relationships.

Feedback can be an affiliation-building practice. The study also provides L2 writing instructors with a view of teacher feedback as an affiliation-building practice. Teachers should understand that while feedback may constitute serious face threats for L2 writers, it is possible to decrease its damaging effect by softening criticism, mitigating imposition, and balancing power differences through the natural use of affiliative interactional resources, including verbal utterances and embodied actions.

Embodied behavior is a means to affiliate with students. Because of their powerful affiliative capacity, embodied actions should be considered by L2 writing teachers not only as a tool of instruction (e.g., Belhiah, 2009, 2013; Seo and Koshik, 2010; Smotrova and Lantolf, 2013; van Compernolle and Smotrova, 2014), but also as a tool for maintaining a positive atmosphere and creating affiliative moments during conference interaction. As social actors, human beings are highly sensitive to embodied displays in their daily interaction with each other. Conferences are no exception, and teachers should be conscious of the effects of their embodied behavior on the progression of a current activity, students' reactions to it, and long-term consequences, including students' willingness to engage in subsequent instructional activities and their attitudes toward the teacher and the class (e.g., Fassinger, 2000; Frisby and Martin, 2010; Frisby and Myers, 2008).

# 7. Conclusion

The ultimate goal of teacher feedback is to facilitate student learning. Examining the effect of conference feedback on students' revisions was beyond the scope of this study, and thus it opens a promising direction for future investigations. Nevertheless, based on the findings of previous research examining the link between teacher-student relationships and students' uptake of teacher feedback (e.g., Lee and Schallert, 2008), it is reasonable to assume that teachers' ability to create a positive and affiliative atmosphere during writing conferences may affect the extent to which students make subsequent revisions. As Kaufman (2000) noticed, “Good relationships inspire good conversations. Good conversations influence good writing” (p. 99). Therefore, this study may serve as a springboard for further discussion on the impact of the relational component of writing conference interaction on student participation, subsequent revisions, and, ultimately, their writing development.
