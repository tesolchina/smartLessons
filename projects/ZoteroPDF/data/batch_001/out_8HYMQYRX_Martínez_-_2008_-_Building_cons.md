# Abstract

This paper reports on the way article writers bring prior texts into biology research articles. It studies the functional moves in which citations occur and their formal features, providing a better understanding of the linguistic resources that are used to construct intertextuality in science. The results show the functions of citations were strongly associated with the rhetorical moves in which they occurred and with particular sections of the research article, although citations providing background information occurred in all the sections. The study also found that integral citations were preferred in the more argumentative moves. Self citations occurred in all moves, suggesting the relevance of networking not only with others´ research but also with the authors’ own previous studies. These findings may be useful in academic writing courses addressed to non-native English speakers, who need to be made aware of the specific language resources available for the construction of consensus in science to become successful writers.

# 1. Introduction

The research article (RA) is the most widely used genre for negotiating knowledge in the scientific community (Swales, 1990). The interaction that it enacts has been pointed out to be central for active participation and membership in the community, as well as for the construction of identities among peers (Bruffee, 1986). In the RA, a dialog is established by bringing in prior texts with which the writers explicitly interact in a form known as ‘‘manifest intertextuality’’ (Fairclough, 1992 p. 85). The explicit incorporation of texts is carried out through citation, allowing article writers to show familiarity with the current literature and, at the same time, providing researchers an opportunity to differentiate themselves from other authors and to argue for the novelty of their claims compared with the existing literature (Bazerman, 1988; Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995; Myers, 1990).

This form of intertextual dialog has emerged relatively recently in the history of articles in science. In a diachronic analysis of the changes undergone by the experimental report in physics in the twentieth century, Bazerman (1988) observes an increase in the amount of ‘‘background and contextual knowledge’’ (p. 164) on which the articles are grounded, as manifested in a higher number of references. As Bazerman points out, the presence of this form of knowledge in the paper ‘‘suggests an increasing embedding of arguments in the web of the literature of the field’’ (p. 164). Bazerman also notes other interesting developments associated with citations. He observes that in recent articles, citations are spread throughout the paper, are directly related to the study and are integrated to the argument. In earlier physics papers, in contrast, citations tended to accumulate at the beginning of the article, were used to provide general information, and were not discussed or incorporated into the argument.

Knorr-Cetina (1981), in an ethnographic research of scientific activity in a laboratory, also shows how citation contributes to the dialogic nature of research article writing. She observes that the argument of the RA is constructed in interaction with the arguments of others who have also contributed to the topic. Her research reveals that the argument involves a ‘‘hidden strategy’’, since much of the content of the RA is written ‘‘against someone else’’, although it is not done explicitly (p. 126). This is so because underlying the interaction explicitly stated in the text are the interests of competing researchers. Thus, writers draw on others’ contributions, but, at the same time, use them as an opportunity to differentiate themselves from these others.

Perhaps the first step of this ‘‘hidden strategy’’ is the writer’s decision of who to include in the dialog and who to leave out. On the one hand, inclusion of claims has been interpreted as a form of reward Mulkay (1972), or ‘‘gifts’’ (Myers, 1989, p. 10), as authors are recognized and incorporated in the dialog of science, which enhances their credibility as scientists (Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995). On the other hand, omission of claims has been associated with competition or to the need to avoid confrontation. Usually, competing claims are either minimized or simply omitted (Myers, 1989), and so are claims perceived as erroneous. Omission is, then, a form of punishment that, as Myers (1990) observes, contributes to the death of the claim: ‘‘The usual method of dealing with research claims one thinks are wrong is to ignore them; if they are not picked up by anyone, they will disappear into the morass of scientific publication.’’ (Myers, 1990, p. 101)

Various studies have been concerned with different aspects of the construction of dialog, as the evaluative function of reporting verbs, the structure of citations, and the role of self-citation. In relation to reporting verbs, the studies by Hyland (1999) and Thompson and Ye (1991) provide an analysis of the interpersonal contribution of these verbs to the writers’ positioning in relation to the literature cited. In both studies, the authors observed that the choice of a particular verb to report research serves to indicate the writer’s positive, neutral or critical evaluation of the information reported. Also the choice of integral vs. non-integral reporting structures, as noted by Swales (1990), offers the possibility for the writer to focus the interaction on authors or on their findings, respectively. These resources are options that help to materialize the ‘‘hidden strategy’’ observed by Knorr-Cetina (1981).

Another resource of importance in the construction of the intertextual negotiation is the interplay of the writer’s own and others’ past contributions through the use of self-citation. Myers (1990), in a study of the rhetoric of grant proposals, observed how one of the writers that he studied integrated both the existing literature and his own previous work. This interplay of own and others’ research contributed to the aim of persuading the granting agency, as it stressed the coherence of the writer’s own previous work. The practice of self-citation has also been observed in the published article. Hyland (2001), in a study of self-mention in RAs, observes that, although self-citation may have various motivations, it clearly contributes to the construction of an authoritative persona by highlighting the degree of writer involvement in the disciplinary problem under scrutiny. It is important, however, to use self-citations judiciously, as illustrated in a case study by Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995). In this case study of a manuscript that had been heavily criticised in the review process, it was shown that the reviewers had noted that the article required a dialogic reformulation. The first submitted version of the article was grounded only on the writer’s previous studies and the reviewers observed that the article needed to engage with other experts in the field.

The contribution of citation to the dialogic construction of science has been studied in the article as a whole, comparing its use in different disciplines (Hyland, 1999, 2000, 2001),and has been touched upon indirectly in various studies (Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995; Brett, 1994; Dudley-Evans, 1986, 1994; Peacock, 2002; Swales, 1990; Thompson, 1993). The distribution of citations and their functions in different moves of the RA has, however, been relatively neglected and it would be of interest to know how writers use citations in different moves.

The present paper reports on the ways article writers bring prior texts into the biology RA by studying the functional moves in which citations occur and their formal features. The results provide insights into the linguistic resources that contribute to the construction of ‘‘intertextual linkages’’ (Berkenkotter and Huckin, 1995, p. 47), and help reveal aspects of the ‘‘hidden strategy’’ pointed out by Knorr-Cetina (1981, p. 126) by showing how citation works persuasively in academic writing. Such insights are potentially of value in academic writing courses addressed to non-native English speaking (NNES) writers, who need to be made aware of the specific language resources available for the construction of consensus in science in order to succeed as writers.

# 2. The study

The study was carried out on six research articles in the biological sciences, published in prestigious international journals, that had the Introduction-Method-Result-and-Discussion (IMRD) structure (Swales, 1990). Three of the articles in the corpus, 3, 4 and 6, used the footnote reference format for in-text citation, while 1, 2 and 5, used the author-date format. The articles were selected by specialist informants: biologists whose research was directly related to the fields of the articles. The study had two parts, an identification of the moves that contained citations and their distribution across sections, and an analysis of the linguistic characteristics of the citations used in each move.

# 2.1. Move analysis

The unit of analysis was a functional move (Swales, 1990), a block of text with a recognizable rhetorical purpose contributing to the writer’s argument. Of the 197 moves identified, twenty-five had more than one citation; then, for classification purposes only the most central citation in the move was considered, that is, the one more clearly related to the function of the move. Thus, in example 2.1, where the move has three citations, only the first was considered for the analysis, and the move was classified as Comparing with previous studies expressing disagreement

(1). In contrast, Sun et al. [16] reported that chitosan, another protective additive, is able to covalently bind quinones, which are highly toxic compounds [17] and which have been identified as products of HRP-catalyzed oxidation of phenol [18, 19 and 20]. (TEXT 6)

For move analysis, the categories used were those identified in the existing literature as having citations in them. The categories were:

a) Reviewing items of previous research   
b) Providing methodological information   
c) Comparing with previous studies expressing agreement   
d) Comparing with previous studies expressing disagreement   
e) Interpreting own results in relation to previous studies   
f) Providing information a) Reviewing items of previous research involves citations that contribute to the delimitation of the ongoing dialogic space of knowledge construction to which the writer wishes to add new information. This move is considered central in the rhetoric of the Introduction section (Swales, 1990). b) Providing methodological information involves citations with reference to methods or aspects of the methodology (Swales, 1990). Moves $c$ , $d$ and $e$ are based on Dudley-Evans (1986, 1994), who proposed them for the Discussion section in a study of Master of science dissertations. These moves, however, may also occur in the Results section, as demonstrated by Brett (1994) and Thompson (1993). c) Comparing with previous studies expressing agreement establishes an explicit or implicit comparison between the findings of the specific paper and the findings of other authors that lend support to them. d) Comparing with previous studies expressing disagreement establishes an explicit or implicit comparison between the findings of the specific paper and the findings of others that diverge from the results obtained. e) Interpreting own results in relation to previous studies provides hypotheses or interpretations of results, supporting them with previous studies. $f )$ Providing information provides information from the literature that adds to the understanding of certain specific concepts or procedures (Dudley-Evans, 1994).

The cases identified were classified according to the above-mentioned categories. The three science experts that selected the articles, who were knowledgeable of the status of both paper writers and cited authors, contributed to the study by validating the categories and by interpreting the results obtained. They categorized the functions of moves with citations in the texts. There was $92 \%$ agreement in the categorization. The mismatches occurred due to problems with some science-specific aspects of the content of certain moves. Those mismatches were revised and corrected in interaction with the subject specialists.

2.2. Formal features of citations and their distribution in moves

For citations, the following formal features were studied, as well as other features that emerged from the analysis:

1. Formal type: Integral vs. non-integral (Swales, 1990).   
2. Use of reporting verb (Hyland, 1999).   
3. Use of self-citation (Hyland, 2001), considered as those that included at least one of the paper authors.

Each of these features has been shown to contribute to interaction with the reader and academic persuasion in various ways. Integral vs non-integral, for example, allows the writer to focus on the information or on the author (cf Weissberg and Buker, 1990), reporting verbs provide an evaluation by the writer of the cited material and can be negative, positive, or neutral, (Hyland, 2000; Thompson and Ye, 1991), self-citation can perform different functions, but reminds the reader of the writer’s prior work in the area and so helps establish credibility (Hyland, 2001).

The moves and formal features were counted for frequency and distribution through cross tabulation. The data were analyzed using inferential statistics for the significance tests in the expected frequency tables. The significance test employed was Chi-square, with a significance of $P \ge . 0 5$ .

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1. Distribution of moves with citations

A total of 197 moves with citations were found in the 6 papers, there being an average of 32 cases per paper. Moves with citations occurred in the four sections of the articles, lending support to Bazerman’s observation that citations are spread throughout the RA. Introductions contained the highest percentage of citations $( 3 6 . 5 \% )$ and Results contained the lowest (Table 1).

The functions of the citations were, as expected, closely associated with the sections of the paper where they occurred, as shown in Table 1. More that half of the moves involved Reviewing items of previous research and Providing information, but, while the first occurred exclusively in Introduction, the second occurred in all the sections.

Citations involving comparison and interpretation moves occurred mainly in Discussion, but there were also cases in Results. Although the distribution was quite predictable, there were aspects of the distribution that are of particular interest.

These results indicate that, although both Results and Discussion have interpretative and comparative rhetorical moves (Brett, 1994; Thompson, 1993), it is the Discussion section that contains the most.

The high percentage of cases and wide distribution of the function Providing information highlights its importance in the construction of dialog in science. Providing information appears to be used to include background that the writers consider necessary for the adequate adjustment of communication with the intended audience. The amount of information is determined mainly by the authors’ assessment of the journal’s audience. Cases of this citation function were found in all moves and sections, and served to clarify aspects of the results obtained by using information from the existing literature, thus providing the networking necessary for both credibility and clarity. In most of the cases, the writers presented the information as having reached a certain degree of consensus in the community by using citations with present or present perfect tense (Swales, 1990), as in the following examples:

3.1. Prior to toxicity analyses, samples were treated with catalase enzyme to decompose residual $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ and suspended solids were removed by centrifugation for $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ at approximately $3 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { g }$ . Previous research has shown that neither catalase, nor HRP, nor the phosphate buffer salts are toxic to the microorganisms used in the toxicity assay of this study [15]. (Text 6, Method)

3.2. [The qscR knockout strain was not able to grow on the $\mathrm { C } _ { 1 }$ compound methanol or methylamine and grew slowly on the $\mathrm { C } _ { 2 }$ compounds, ethanol and ethylamine.] This phenotype is typical for mutants with lesions in serine cycle genes (3-7). (Text 3, Results)

3.3. [The gradual supply of peroxide also resulted in a lower rate of enzyme inactivation, which can be attributed to a slower rate of production of phenolic radicals that is limited by the availability of peroxide.] These radicals have been implicated as a significant cause of enzyme inactivation [6]. (Text 3, Results)

3.4. In the case of HRP-treated phenol solutions, detoxification was correlated with a drop of the absorbance at 400 nm. Several studies indicate that compounds with a maximum absorbance at 400 nm are formed immediately upon initiation of the reaction [32, 42 and 18]. The absorbance at this wavelength increases as the reaction proceeds and then diminishes as a precipitate is formed. 400nm is the characteristic absorbance peak of phenoxyl radicals [43] and also of quinones, particularly of $\pmb { p }$ -diphenoquinone [18], which has been identified as a product of HRP-catalyzed oxidation of phenol. (Text 6, Discussion)

Moves involving comparison, both of agreement and disagreement, were characterized by an explicitly signaled dialog, with a clear demarcation of own and others’ work. This demarcation was constructed with three clear linguistic signals: deictics used to refer to the authors $( w e )$ ; reference to the present work (this/our/the present/the current study/ work/data/finding); reference to the work of others, in most cases using integral citations; and in almost all cases a signal of comparison for agreement (the same, similar, consistent, confirm, support [Examples 3.5 and 3.6]) or disagreement (however, but, in contrast, fewer, more, less, different, the greatest difference, question [Examples 3.7 and 3.8]).

3.5. Our study demonstrates the statistical equivalence of MAS and CS, similar to the results of Stromberg et al. (1994) and Van Berloo and Stam (1999) (Text 2)

3.6. Our finding that OccR is dimeric in solution and tetrameric when DNA-bound is consistent with the extended footprints at the occQ operator and with earlier studies that OccR binds DNA cooperatively [.] (32, 33, 37). (Text 4)

3.7. Fewer QTL were identified in this study than in other studies of first-generation SWCB resistance (Bohn et al., 1997; Groh et al., 1998; and Khairallah et al., 1998). (Text 2)

3.8. In contrast to the present study, the chemisorption of reaction products onto chitosan observed by Sun et al. [16] took place within a few minutes. (Text 6)

The move Interpreting own results in relation to previous studies was highly dialogic, also with clear deictic signals that marked the present work (we, our/the current study, here), a reference to the work of others stressed by the use of integral citations, and an interpretation signal manifested in a tentative expression, such as indicate, may be important, can be considered, the suggestion, a possible explanation. These examples illustrate these points:

3.9. Since Sun et al. [16] demonstrated that quinones are chemisorbed by chitosan, it is possible that the reduction in toxicity observed here is due to a similar mechanism (Text 6)

3.10. Another explanation relates to the level of susceptibility of the parents.[.] Considering the QTL regions identified on common chromosomes between the current study and those of Bohn et al. (1997) and Groh et al. (1998), the QTL identified on $^ { c 9 }$ (bins 9.03-9.04, 9.04, and 9.04-9.05, respectively) can be considered common between the three studies based on their presence within common bins and on loci common to the populations (Text 2)

# 3.2. Distribution of integral and non-integral citations

A high proportion of the citations, $7 1 . 1 \%$ , were non-integral (Table 2). This result is lower than that found by Hyland (1999) for biology, who found that $9 0 . 2 \%$ of citations were non-integral. It must be pointed out, however, that the results in this study are not directly comparable to the results in Hyland, as the unit of analysis was not the same. The distribution of integral and non-integral citations was significant, with most moves having a higher number of non-integral citations, except for Comparing with previous studies expressing disagreement and Interpreting own results in relation to previous studies, where integral citations outnumbered non-integral. This shows that in these two functions, which are clearly the most argumentative in the RA, the writers chose to include authors in the structure of the clause to argue with them. It is worth noting that the proportions of integral and non-integral citations in agreement was the opposite of those in disagreement, the higher being for disagreement, which suggests that more confrontation requires more personal address.

Example:

3.11. In contrast to the present study, the chemisorption of reaction products onto chitosan observed by Sun et al. [16] took place within a few minutes. (Text 6)

# 3.3. Distribution of reporting verbs

Reporting verbs occurred in all the articles, but with different citation methods. About $39 \%$ of the citations contained reporting verbs, a finding that is similar to Hyland’s (1999) in biology RAs. The pattern of distribution was significant, with the greatest concentration occurring in moves expressing agreement and interpretation, followed by those expressing disagreement (Table 3), which characterize the Discussion section (Dudley-Evans, 1986, 1994).

The repertoire of reporting verbs was quite restricted, the most frequently used verbs being find, show, suggest, describe, observe and demonstrate, each with at least three occurrences. The choice of these verbs lends support to Hyland’s (1999) observation that in the hard sciences it is possible to assume shared knowledge, which reduces the need for a high rhetorical effort. In the Methodological information citations, reporting verbs were used in functions that served to refer to the cited authors’ work, usually a method or procedure, without providing details about the process. This form of citation contributes to what Swales and Feak (1994, p. 166) call ‘‘fast’’ texts in Methods, allowing a high degree of inexplicitness that is expected to be compensated by shared knowledge. Notably, the verb describe occurred in twelve of the fourteen cases with reporting verb in this move, further confirming the expectations of a restricted repertoire for the hard sciences, as suggested by Hyland.

Examples:

3.12. Serine cycle enzyme activities were assayed as described previously (1, 3, 4) (Text 3)   
3.13. The analysis was performed in three steps as described by Groh et al. (1998) (Text 2)

# 3.4. Distribution of self-citation

Interestingly, almost a fourth of the central citations in the moves were cases of self-citation (Table 4), which confirms the relevance in the sciences of networking not only with others’ research but also with own previous research, as already pointed out by Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995) and Myers (1990). The pattern of distribution of self-citation in relation to citation of other authors’ sources was not significant. There was a similar proportion of cases of self-citation in all the moves. The proportions of self-citation seem to be high, a finding also observed by Hyland in biology compared with other fields (Hyland, 2001), even though it must be pointed out that two articles (Texts 1 and 3) had no cases of self-citation, and one, Text 5, had only one case. The subject specialists interpreted this absence as due to the fact that the aspect focused on in the research was new for the group (Text 1), to the relative novelty of the topic in the field (Text 5), and to a change in the line of research (Text 3).

The way in which self-citation was incorporated into the text was also interesting. In Reviewing items of previous research, a move occurring in Introduction which concentrated the highest proportion of cases of self-citation $( 3 1 . 2 \% )$ , self-citations were incorporated as if they were others’ sources; that is, there were no explicit signals, such as first person use, that could indicate that the contributions were the authors. In the move Providing information, however, an interesting difference was observed in Results. In this section self-citation was signaled explicitly by the use of first person. The following examples illustrate this:

3.14. We identified previously (17) a 55-nt region containing five adjacent sites to which OccR binds (Text 4, Results)

3.15. We established previously (7) that slow migrating OccR-DNA complexes have a DNase I footprint of w60 nt, whereas less bent complexes have a DNase I footprint of about 50 nt (Fig. 4A). where the $[ \ J$ -subunit of RNAP is known to bind several promoters (31) (Text 4, Results)

This evidence suggests that authors may choose a low exposure when they include their own work to create the research space (Swales, 1990) for their study in Introduction, but show a more personal and confident self later, when they present their results.

# 4. Conclusions

Although the corpus used here was not large enough to allow for generalizations, it does point to some characteristics of the forms and functions of citations and their association to the sections of the article. This may contribute to the understanding of the ways in which experts represent and negotiate divergent or convergent perspectives with other researchers.

It was possible to see that citations had different structural patterns depending on the move in which they occurred, moves which were strongly associated to the sections of the article. Citations increased their interactive strength towards the Discussion, by using more explicit signals of dialog. This tendency to a more personal and dialogic interaction was also manifested in the higher presence of integral citations with reporting verbs and the use of selfcitation with explicit signals of authorial identity in the moves occurring in Results and Discussion.

This study is motivated by pedagogical applications and the need to assist NNES writers to become active members of the scientific community by making them aware of the resources used by writers who succeed in publishing. Flowerdew (2001) and Granger and Tyson (1996) have observed that NNES texts are characterized by a poverty of linguistic resources, manifested in the overuse of the same form for a specific communicative function. More detailed information about the linguistic resources available for the construction of dialog in science, as exemplified by the information provided for biology in this study, may enhance instruction, which could result in the production of richer texts by non-native writers, meeting the expectations of their specific fields.
