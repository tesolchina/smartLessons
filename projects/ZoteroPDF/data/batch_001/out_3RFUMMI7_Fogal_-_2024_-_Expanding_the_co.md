Recent reviews of the L2 collaborative writing (Cw) literature have highlighted a propensity for researchers to rely on learner and task-related variables to explore CW phenomena. However, this focus limits how scholars conceptualize CW by overlooking the wider educational context that accompanies CW activities and how writers orient to said spaces. Investigating how writers perceive the Cw landscape is important as their perceptions are known to impact writing development. Engaging a systems orientation to writing spaces, this study examined how students in different writing conditions perceive the writing landscape. This work followed two intact university classes (one engaged in CW, and one not) over one semester, and collected data from five iterations of a system mapping task and interviews with students. The CW group perceived a more nuanced and complex perspective of the writing space, comparatively. Cluster analyses also revealed that both groups oriented similarly to two variable sets: task and environmental factors, and learner and environmental variables. This study demonstrates how CW positively impacts writers' perceptions of the writing space and encourages instructors to help CW students realize and take advantage of the wider context that CW is embedded in. This work also expands the CW research framework.

# 1. Introduction

The benefit of collaborative work (i.e., multiple agents working collctively toward an end goal) on subsequent individual per. formance has long been recognized in disparate educational contexts, including the learning ciences (Laughli et al, 2008), mathematics Ellis, 2011), and preservice teacher education (Watters & Ginns, 2000. Research on L2 collaborative writing (CW) has also demonstrated positive learner outcomes, with studies regularly documenting how language learning from CW activities (in dyads or small groups) transfer to individual cllaborators in subsequent writing tas for an overview, se Eladali, 2021). As recent reviews and commentary on the CW litrature have suggested (Li & Zhang, 2021; Storch, 2019; Zhang & Plonsky, 2020), related research has focused primarily on linguistic output (e.g, Bikowski & Vithanage, 2016; Storch, 2002) or on interaction features informing CW dialogues and activities (e.g., Li & Kim, 2016; Storch, 1998; Wang, 2019).

Moreover, such studies have typically examined interactions related to learner (e., proficiency level, 1) and task-related variables (e., task type or task setting) see Zhang & Plonsky, 2020, for an overview). Insightful in their findings and principled in their approaches, these studies--with few exceptions (Cho, 2017; Storch, 2004; Wang, 2019, reviewed later)-are limited as such variable sets frequently restrict CW inestigations to those foused n interactions between collaborators. ubsquenly, thr is litle account of how the wider educational context informing CW might impact related writing processes.

To understand a broader account of the CW landscape, researchers rely on limited studies that investigate learner perceptions of CW. These studies have predominantly examined student stisfaction relative to the CW experience, generall observed to be supportive (Bikowski & Vithanage, 2016; Shehadeh, 2011), or learners perceptions of the task itself, commonly found to be positive (Kessler, 2009; Storch, 2005). However, these studies do not address how writers perceive to orient themselves inside the CW space. That is, little is known about how students adapt to CW tasks when a wider lens is cast on the CW context.

Exploring the wider educational landscape informing CW is important because how learners identify, refect upon, and interact with their writig spaces can influence the composing strategies they develop and the quality of their writing output (Majchrzak, 2018; Nitta, 2020). Moreover, without expanding the CW research framework researchers are left to guide writing pedagogy with a limitig understanding of the environment CW occurs in and how students orient to said contexts. Not having aces to this information is problematic because of the situational nature of writing: learner, task and environmental variables (the later defined subsequently)all press upon it. Given that writing is a located, spatial activity, understanding how writers orient accordingly can provide useful feedback about CW composing processes and can lend support to instructors and administrators coordinating such spaces.

# 2. Defining key terms: collaborative writing spaces and environmental variables

To develop further insights into the CW landscape, the present study expands the definition of the CW space by adding previously unexamined factors to the conventional focus on individual and task related variables. This approach explores, for instance, how instructor-classroom dynamics and classroom-wide discussions impact CW. Doing so extends the research lens beyond dyadic or small group CW interactions. In redefining the CW space research also moves outside the classroom, tapping into the personal and professional interactions and engagements of instructors and students. Doing so can account for, for example, how writing center tutors and previous writing instruction impact CW.

One way to activate this expanded defintion of the CW space is by attending to environmental variables. Environmental variables are defined as those factors beyond the conventional fold that potentially inform CW processes. Such variables include, for example, professional development workshops for intructors, students previous writing teachers, and students peers outside of classitems typicall diasociated with  stdies. Environmentl variable furtherdiffe from enr and task variables as they facilitate studies into the educational landscape CW occurs in, rather than just examining the CW interaction itself. That is, exploring such variables pushes research beyond its standard focus on learner and task-related variables and motivates researchers to stretch the CW research boundary. In the present work, environmental features are examined alongside those factors often inked with CW research i., learner and task variables) to explore how learners perceive the interaction of these three variable sets on their English writing development. In doing so, this paper takes up call by Li & Zhang (2021) and Storch (2019) to expand the research framework informing CW studies.

# 3. An expanding collaborative writing research landscape

The work of Storch (2004), Cho (2017), and Wang (2019) provide important insights into, and can help chart the later evolution of, variables conventionally associated with CW research (for thorough overviews, se Li & Zhang, 2021; Storch, 2019; Zhang & Plonsky, 2020). Although related studies predate these publications (e.g, Villamil & De Guerrero, 1996), these three selections demonstrate notable increases in the scope of variables investigated in CW research. As their publication dates correspond with an increase in the breadth of coverage, they are presented chronologically, with overlapping features highlighted when necessary.

Storch's (2004) classroom-based study followed approximately 16 dyads across one semester of university studies. Her work. framed by activity theory, documented unique interaction patterns that mirrored learners underlying ambitions, showing how leaner variables such as collaborators' aims, motivations, experiences, and beliefs contributed to CW interaction patterns. Exploring this variable set developed the research space considerably by moving beyond conventional attntion to group-level exchanges. Storch's work provided useful preliminary insights into how additional factors (e.g., learner variables such as motivations and experiences) inform our interpretation of dyadic behavior in CW contexts..

Cho (2017) and Wang (2019) broadened Storch (2004)'s exploratory landscape by employing Engestrom's (1999, 2015) extended activity theory modeldescribed by Storch as \*presenting a more complex activity system (p. 475)to track other factors informing CW. The extended activity theory model typically accounts for the following variable set: instruments (e.g., online writing tools), objects (e.g, participants' goal), divisin of labor (e.g., collaborative roles), community (e.g, the group members), rules (e.g, task instructions), and subjects (e.g, the group members). As the models constituent parts suggest, this framework moves the research context beyond a focus on learner and task-related variables. With this model as a guide, Cho's work-a case study of three leaners engaged in computer-mediated Cw-documented how the quality and variance of collaborations could be atributed to, for example, the rules division of labor, and instruments informing the CW tasks. Cho's findings expanded Storch's (2004) earlie fcus on learners motivations and experiences. Like Wang, however (described subsequently), her work focused on computer-mediated Cw. What re mains unclear is how well these findings tansfer to face-to-face or classrom setings. Nonetheless, Cho's work underscored the promise of investigating a wider Cw landscape.

Like Cho (2017), Wang's (2019) study of web-based CW used Engestrom's (1999, 2015) extended activity theory to focus on interaction patterns among collaborative writers. Wang explored how regulatory activities (e.g., establishing a personal goal and evaluating group progress impacted learners and facilitated dferent interaction types. Through analyses of, for example, individual roles, writing strategies, agency, and time and team management, Wang found patterns of web-based CW to be dynamic within and across goups and essay tasks, and demonstrated how regulation activitie functioned as a powerful influence on behavioral patterns. Her work highlighted, in ways similar to Storch (2004), how goal-directed activitie havea wide-ranging inluence n learner behavior in CW contexts.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate how expanding the research landscape to include environmental variables facilitates knowledge of CW processes. Although these studies helped develop our understanding of diferent modes of CW (in particular computer-mediated or web-based Cw), there remains much to learn about classroom-based CW, the focus of the present work. For instance, ittleis known about how writers orient to claroom collaborative spaces when we broaden the exploratory lens to include environmental factors atypical of CW research. Nor do we know how, if at all such orientations shift over time.

To addres these issues, this study examines how CW spaces are perceived to interact develop, and change across one university semester in CW and independent writing (IW) students. In doing so, this work diffrentiates itelf from conventional comparative studies between CW and IW that typically attend to differences in linguistic output (e.g., Shehadeh, 2011; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Strobl, 2014) and instead focuses on how both sets of writers orient to their writing spaces. To assist with ths comparative interest, the following question support this study: How do CW and IW students orient similarly and dfferently to writing paces over one semester? The subsequent questions help guide this larger aim:

1. What are the differences in the two groups, if any, regarding how many and to what degree variables are seen to influence L2 writing development over one semester? 2. What patterns of relations with the writing space appear, if any, with students engaged in CW and those engaged in IW? 3. How did learners in CW and IW conditions orient themselves to the writing space, and did such orientations change over time?

One manner of pursuing answers to these questions is through a systems account (von Bertalanffy, 1969; Arrow, et al. 200) of the writing pace that enables researchers to push variables of interest even beyond those seen in recent CW studies employing activity theory.

# 4. Theoretical framework: a systems account of collaborative writing spaces

To examine a broad CW space, a perspective that foregrounds a measured degre of system-wide behavior is called for. A simplex systems approach, embedded within a complex dynamic systems theory orientation, provides a useful framework here. van Geert and Steenbeek (2014) dine uch stms  aontd wle of belief, rrenttions, ves, etions, hits, prctices and mteri ools that serve as a simplifying representation of the overarching complex system [emphasis in original] (p. 23). Interpreted as a series of nested features, the emergence of simplex systems is a result of reeated efforts to engage with the complex, expansive, and frequently unwieldly nature of educational landscapes (Koopmans, 2020; van Geert & Stenbeek, 2014). In this way, a simplex systems approach responds to call to generate research paces that can be meaningfully and feasibly explored while maintaining the inherent complexity of the larger educational context a phenomenon is embedded in--what van Geert and Steenbeek call \*praxis-based forms of repre senting complexity" (p. 22). As we redefine the CW space to move beyond interactions at the dyad or small group level, asimplex systems approach may prove fruitful.

A simplex systems perspective afords researchers an analytic framework that can furnish stakeholders (e.g., administrators, teachers, and students) with a broad view of the learning space that can assist with curricular and pedagogical decisions. For example, via a simplex systems analysis of how L2 writing is managed in a Thai universty actuary science program, Fogal (2020) demonstrated how the program's dfferent stakeholders and structures helped maintain it stability and qualit, and noted how small-scale curricular changes (e.g., instilling in new faculty the value of a writing-across-the-curriculum approach) could advance the educational environment. As Fogal demonstrated (seeto0 Fogal, 2022, 2023; Ludlow et al, 2017), a simple systems framework focuses on knowledge producing systems e, the space one lerns in) rather than the knowledge (.g., the leaning that occurs) sad systems generate (Davis & Sumara, 2006)--a key feature that complements existing CW interaction studies.

Documenting insights into expanded CW spaces via a simplex systems approach may contribute to the literature by revealing (a) how writers reflecting upon and interacting with learner, task, and environmental variables facilitates writing development, (b) how, when captured longitudinally, such perspectives shift over time, if at all and (c) how similar learning paces may be enacted in analogous educational contexts. Capturing these perspectives and developing these insights has become increasingly important as CW tasks find their way into progressvely more academic writing classes (Chen & Hapgood, 2021; Li & Zhang, 2021). To explore the CW space as a simplex system, system mapping can be effective.

# 5. System mapping

Having emerged as a research tool to operationalize simplex systems thinking, system mapping is predicated on the belief, one shared acroseistemological boundaries, that educational systems (e.g., clasrooms) are themselves complex and dynamic environments nested in more complex and larger institutions, including local chool boards college facultie, and governmental agencies (Davis & Sumara, 2006; van Gert & Steenbeek, 2014). System mapping maintains this wide view of the educational landscape by recognizing its interconnected nature and so attempts to capture the teaching-learning space across a wide range of relevant components. In doing so, as Ferreira & Ryan (2012) note, system mapping supports researchers by highlighting interdependencies, detecting occasions for improvement, describing how stakeholders are influenced, and outlining system borders and their perme. ability. Through these opportunities, system mapping identifies leverage points and tables evidence "for proposals aimed at how, where, and when educational spaces may benefit from change" (Fogal, 2022,p.2). As the L2 literature aims to better understand CW, system mapping may serve to address questions about how best, under what conditions, and with what larners CW may facilitate learning.

As a research tool system mapping addresses calls to expand conventional pproaches to CW research (Li & Zhang, 2021; Storch, 2019) and to examine the wide ecosystem associated with teaching and learning. To do so, system mapping operationalizes simplex systems in ways that are pedagogicall meaningful and researchable across space and time (Fogal, 2020). System mapping thus enables research to investigate learner generated, introspective oo at the learning landscape that extends beyond the standard classroom setting-a reflective perspective seldom accounted for in CW research (Li & Zhang, 2021).

# 6. The present study

The present work distinguishes itself from CW interaction studies as it does not focus on group-work dynamics at the dyad or small group levela shift that pairs with Li and Zhang's (2021) call to generate new avenues for investigating CW. In addition to exploring the wider CW context, this work also addreses two further invitations in the litature. The firt is the longstanding and repeated al to explore classroom writing research in ways that account for is situatedness (Cumming, 2016; Leki et al., 2008)that is, in the present context, to move beyond the group or dyad as the primary phenomenon of inquiry. The second, more recent but no less important and relate call, expands the first by highlighting a further need to adopt a curricular lens that extends L2 writing research beyond the classroom (Byrnes, 2020; Norri & Manchon, 2012). This callis particularly noteworthy here as recent descriptions of face-to-face CW research limit such endeavors to a"classroom-based domain of research (hang & Plonsky, 2020, p. 1). The present work thus presents an opportunity to expand this domain by exploring classoom-based Cw that is itelf embedded in a larger curricular (i., a universty undergraduate program of study) and social (e.g, learners' prs and previous writing instructors) ecosystem. The focus of this study, therefore, is not CW per se, but on CW as it is perceived to unfold relative to learners' complex writing spaces and how such perceptions may differbetween writer composing collaboratively and those writig independently. In this way, ths study identifies and compare system (rather than dyadic or group) interactions and perceptions between CW and IW students.

# 6.1. Context and participants

This study isembedded in parall and intact sections of a university course taught by the same instructor and follows two sets of learners: those engaged in CW (Section A) and those engaged in IW (Section B). The study ran over a single semester at a private university in Japan. Both the course and the liberal arts program the course i situated in i delivered in English. Generall, students in the program identify as bi- or multilingual and relate closely with at east English and Chinese, Japanese, or Korean languages. The mean TOEFL score of students in Section A was 106.35 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = 7 . 4 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . In Section B the mean score was 108.29 ( $\mathrm { S D } = 9 . 7 6 $ ). There was no statisticll meaningful dfference in TOEF scores between the two groups. The students followed in this study also provide rare look into CW among learners with advanced proficiency--a relatively unique perspective in CW studies (Zhang & Plonsky, 2020.

The course informing this study (Thinking & Writing [Tw) is required of all students in the faculty, and students typically enroll in TWin their second semester. The course aims to develop students citical thinking and writig ailities and moves learners through an extensive series of academic reading and writing tasks. Students compose approximately 15,00 words over a 14-week semester, comprised of aseries of near twice-weekly writing tasks (500 words each) and lengthier midterm (2000 words) and final paper (3000 words). The twice-weekly writing tass (2 in total) require students to write aresponse paper by synthesing their reading of required texts (e.g., selections from Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra) with notes derived from a professor's lecture and discussions at the group and clasroom level. Students were typicall alltted approximately 72 hours to complete each response paper. Students starting the course are aware of its reutation(i.e, as intellectually demanding and time intensive), and so typically begin W motivated for a rigorous course of study.

The two parall sections of TW met twice weekly for 100-minutes per session and were taught in consecutive periods of the day. With the exception of the first and last response paper, as well as the midterm and final essay, students in Section A $( n = 1 5$ , forming five triads) were required to engage in CW to complete the twice-weekly writing assignments. Students in Section B $n = 1 8$ , forming six triads, primarily used for in-class group discussions) did not complete any CW tasks. The selection of Section A for CW was random, and the two sections of the course were largely pedagogically matched. For example, both class sections had the same opportunities and alltted time to engage in smallgroup discssions and received the same lectures and writing assignment. n addtin, both et of learners frequently had the last feen minutes of clas to begin to consider the writing task. However, the CW students aso typically met outside of class, working on their essays face t face eg, at the universty library or a local coffe shop) and online using a video communication platform (e.g., Zoom). In this regard, collaboration was computer-mediated and face to face, with individual CW groups fluctuating between time spent in each of the two modes depending on group members'schedules.

Aside from the CW condition, the primary pedagogical difference between the groups was that on day one of the semester students in Section A received instructions for operationalizing CW. Presenting learners with some direction followed suggestions for best practice (Chen & Hapgood, 2021; Li & Zhang, 2021; Zhang, 2019) and was deemed necessary as no students had writen collaoratively before. The suggestions emphasized that students colaborate acros the writing pocess, iscuss the writing task in real time when possible, and employ one of a series of online writing platforms (e.g., Microsoft OneDrive) that facilitate CW.

Over the semester, students in the CW clas wrote in four different groups. Following the teacher's instructions, students elf selected into triads with the caveat that they work with new group members each time. Students changed groups in week 5, 9, and 12. Rather than ensure that each group work together for the same period of time, following Ushioda (2021) and aiming to capture the CW space in anaturlistc seig, classroom parameters guided the reearch space, and o changes in groups occurred at pedagogically meaningful points in the semester. According to the instructor, changes in group membership were made to expose students to potentially different perspectives on the study material. The IW students changed groups in the same weeks.

# 6.2. Data collection

System mapping (Fogal, 2022; Ludlow et al., 2017) was employed to capture how students interacted with a wide set of variables thought to influence writing development. The system mapping activity involved three stages. First, students in both groups were asked to consider the degree of influence (strong, moderate, weak) that a set of variables (Table 1, derived from Fogal, 2020, 2022) known to impact L2 writing development had relative to a guiding question (Considering TW, to what degre do the following items influence writing development?).

The items in Table 1 respond to call in the literature to envision writing development over the lifespan (e.., considering the impact of secondary schoo studies on tertiary-level writing), as a community-embedded exercise (e.g., including the influence of tutors at local writing centers), and as situated inside a wider curcular framework (e.g., acounting for the impact of other instructors in the faculty) that reaches beyond the conventional classoom space (Byrnes, 2020; eki et al. 2008). In addition to onsulting the literature (se, for example, Hyland's (2019) knowledge types required for effective writing), the variables were selected with input from L2 writing instructors and scholars, and was piloted across fours groups of learners and two proficiency lels (see Fogal, 2020, 2022) While many of the variables in Table 1 appear readily in the L2 writing literature (e.g., v3-learning about effective writing; v7-lexico-grammatical forms) and/or are familiar to writing instructors (e.g., v9-writing process; v19-writing center tutor), those marked with an asterisk were derived exclusively from the pilot study and so provide learners' insights on the topic of variables thought to inform their writing spaces. In adition to task and learner-related factors, the variables in the table were deemed particularly useful for the present study as they include environmental variables that have received minimal attention in the CW literature (Zhang & Plonsky, 2020).

Each of the 36 variables in Table 1 was listed on a card that students mapped onto a physical board (see Fig. 1 arranged on a desk. placing them relative to their degree of influence. A brief definition of each variable was noted on the back of the cards to assist learners. Students received the cards in randomized order, completed the task individuall, and were told to eclude cards considered insignificant.

After this first phase, students were asked to consider their completed system map holistcally, instead of as acollction of discrete items, and were invited to make changes to the placement of ther cards, if need be. In this way, students could visualize interactions and engage with relationships whil completing the task in ways that rating scales do not alow for (Fogal, 2022, 2023). The final phase asked students to draw lines that inked together variables thought to have a meaningful relationship (variables could be linked more than once to demonstrate a multiplicity of interactions stemming from the same variable).

Learners in both sections participated i five sstem mapping activities aross the semester atthe tart and finish to the term, and at the end of three ifferent thematic units of the course, in weeks five, nine, and twelve. As noted earlier, shifts in thematic unit also corresponded with changes in group membership. Table 2 provides an overview of the timing of the writing and mapping tasks students in both sections engaged in over the semester.

Finally, to gain deeper insights into decisions students made with their system maps and to better appreciate the growing understanding of their writing development and their orientation to the writing space, at the conclusion of the semester fllow-up, semistructured interviews were conducted with an equal number of students $( n = 8 )$ from each section who volunteered to discuss their learning experiences. As more students volunteered than was deemed feasible to interview, the interview students were randomly selected. In total, the dataset comprised sixteen interviews and 165 system maps.

# 6.3. Data analysis

To identify diffrences in how learners oriented to variables thought to impact writing development (RQ1) and patterns of perceived engagement with the writing space (RQ2), system maps were coded using a framework developed by Ludlow et al. (2017) and employed by Fogal (2020, 2022). Items that larners considered strong were coded 3, those considered moderate were coded 2, While items consider weak were coded 1. Items that were not employed were coded 0. To determine differences between the two sections, mean scores were calculated for each item. In addition, cut-of scores determined differences in degres of iluence: 2.5-3 (strong), 1.9-2.4 (moderate), and 1-1.8 (weak). The reults served to reveal patterns and differences of pereived inluences onwriting across the two sections.

To determine what component parts informed each section (RQ3), a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was employed using SPSS (version 28) to allow for different orientation types to the writing space to emerge. For each section, Ward's method determined the squared Euclidean distance between items in an agglomerative process that iteratively combines the closest relationships in the mapping data. The resulting dendrograms demonstrate which items were clustered and at what step (see Staples & Biber, 2015 for a discussion of cluster analysis in applied linguistics research).

A cluster analysis is particularly useful here as it facilitates the exploration and interpretation of multidimensional relationships (Ludlow et al, 2017) capable of highlighting diffrences and similarities concerning interactions and variables learners may have relied on (overtly or not) as they reflected on their writing development (Fogal, 2022). Considering the extensive amount of CW conducted by Section A, thus engaging a diverse set f learning experiences compared to Section B, it was surmised that such analyses could lead to novel interpretations of the writing space (Bruce & Bruce, 2017).

Collaborative writing group.  Variable number. Shaded cels repreet variales perceived as strongly influentia by both groups in that week. ' Independent writing group.

At present there is no consensus regarding an appropriate sample size for cluster analyses (Crowther et al., 2021; Sarstedt & Mooi. 2011). However, there i agreement that HCA is the most suitable approach for smaller samples (Crowther et al., 2021; Henry et al. 2015) with the caveat that researchers \*take appropriate steps to validate their cluster solutions" (Crowther et al., 2021,p. 106). As Crowther and colleagues note, this concern is ll the more relevant with small sample sizes. To address this concern, and given the interpretive nature of cluster analyses (e.g., determining the number of cluster solutions), consultations with two L2 writing scholars familiar with the research context, CW, and cluster analyses werealso conducted. The consultations included two online meetings with both scholars, thre wees apart, tocollectively review the dataset and the SPs output, including the agglomeration schedule known to help guide with interpretationStaples & Biber, 2015), and to discuss the relevance of ifferent cluster solutions concerning the writing context. That is as cluster analysis is highly interpretive, decisions regarding cluster solutions did not rely solely on the SPSS output. For example, solutions with more clusters may serve to initiate further study (Kane & Trochim, 2007) and are valuable when exploring novel ontexts. I addition, this study did not select the number f desired lusters in advanceconsistent with HCA Rather, to assis with selecting appropriate cluster solutions, alongside the interpretive asstance f two consultant, information gained or lost by adding or subtracting clusters (using the distance between fusion coeficients, derived from information in the agglomeration schedule) was examined to ensure that the clusters were sufficiently different. The meetings thus helped with decision making and ensured that different possible cluster solutions were engaged and discussed before determining the best possible outcome.

The interview data were transcribed verbatim and then coded using an open coding framework (Braun & Clarke, 2006). After two sessions of rater training, the interviews were coded separately by the author and a research asstant (ratr reliability was measured using Cohen's kappa: $\kappa = 0 . 8 7 $ . Following common practice (Fogal & Koyama, 2022; Hafner & Ho, 2020), differences in coding results were discussed until a resolution was reached. The ensuing analys aimed at elicitig thematic accounts of different categories in the interview data (Pavlenko, 2007) that could complement or further explain learners perceptions and decisions regarding the mapping task. For example, afer a close review of the transcripts the members of the CW group appeared to express new ideas about thir writing roceses. Afe this concet was intill identifie in the daset, the transcripts were threviewed losely by the author and research assistant to check whether this idea constituted a theme in the interview data. This proces was repeated with a series of potential themes in the transcripts.

# 6.4. Findings

RQ1. : What re the diffeences in the two groups, if any, regarding how many and to what dege varibles are sen to influence 2 writing development over one semester?

Table 3 documents changes in the number of variables and the degre of inluence such variables had on leaners across five data collection points over one semester.

As Table 3 shows, at the start of the semester both sets of writers identified nearly the same number of variables as strongly influencing their writing. However, as the semester progressed, the two sections diverged, with the CW group consistently having identified more variables as having astrong influence on writing development than did the IW group. Moreover, as the number of variables listed as strongly influential remained comparatively high and stable in the W group from week five onwards, the number of strongly influential variables fluctuated throughout the term for the IW group, with week nine showing a noticeable increase-a change that is not sustained. The results of RQ1 demonstrate that after initially similar interpretations of the writig space, the CW group consistently identified more variables over time as having a strong impact on writing development in comparison to the IW group.

RQ2. : What, if any, patterns of relations with the writing space appear with students engaged in CW and those engaged in IW?

Research question two provides a more nuanced perspective of the findings derived from RQ1. Table 4 was designed to emphasi which variables appeared to strongly influence learners' writing, across both groups, and how these perspectives shifted over tim

Table 4 documents notable ifferences and similarities in how the two groups interpreted the meaningfulnessof the variables. For example, across groups vriable 2 and 10lin to think criticly and wriing fedack, rectively) are shard in weeks 1, 5, ad 9, and then variable 3 (learning about effective writing) across weeks 5, 9, and 12. Variables.

21, 22 and 23 (professor-class dynamics general dynamics among students, and small group dynamics, respectively) are consistently present in the CW group in the last four iterations of the mapping task, although these only appear in week 15 of the IW groupunsurprising, given that the IW group had much les exposure, comparatively,to intense work with peers and so had les opportunities to engage with agent-agent dynamics.

Within groups, among the collaborative writers there is a consistent set of variables perceived as strong across the semester (v2. leaning to think criticlly, v9-writing proces v10-writing fedback, and v16-W professor), whereas variables 5 css discussions, 21 (professor-clas dymics) 22 (general dys mong stdents), 23 (small goup mics), 28 (GPA), and 29 (aition t be an effective writer) apear i all weeks except week one. The independent writers do not share this consistency. In addition, in week 15 the IW group emphasies agents and interactions with them (v16-TW professor v19-writing center utor(s, v21-professo-cass dynamics v22- general dynamics among students, and v23-small group dynamics).

Although dificlt to infer precisely what is driving these similarities and differences, the interview data provide some insights Space precludes extensive reporting, but Table 5 documents themes that emerged from the interview data and related samples.

As Table 5 notes, the unfolding semester and frequent CW tass triggered a degree of reflection and awareness about writing that was thus far unrealized among the CW group. Moreover, as RQ1 indicates that awareness stabilized. The interview data atribute this stability to the iterative nature of the writing task (i.e, consistently asking students to synthesize data). The interview data also revealed patterns wherein learners highlighted the breadth of possbilities for engagement that informed their writig, and that said possibilities covered a wider set of variables than interview participants had initially thought meaningful.

Concerning the IW group, Table 5 shows that learners interactions with tutors in the university writing center (visited to seek assistance for the mid-term paper) provided perspective on a wider set of variables thought to impact their writing, providing some evidence for thespike in strongly ifluential variables see in week nine ee Table 3). Moreover, thetheme f agents and dynamic also helps explain an inclination toward relationships and engagement with others that informs perceptions of the learning space in the closing weeks of the semester (see Table 4, week 15).

The results of RQ2 show that collaborative writers emphasized multiple group dynamics (among peers in smalland large groups, and with the instructor) and a wide set of strongly influential variables early in the semester (week 5) and maintained this perspective. The CW group also had a more holistic perspective of the writing experience and articulated a more complex view of their writing processes. Comparatively (and in contrast), the IW group deemed group dynamics important only toward the end of the fiften-week semester and was generally les stable in its interpretation of the writing space, with extra attention given to writing center tutors in widening their perspectives on writing development. The CW group was also more acute to the potential impact of diffrent sets of dynamics on their writing when explored aross a wide educational landscape, comparatively, and underscored that the practice of writing collaboratively heled influence how thee lener oriented to the writing space in ways that reflectd a more nuanced view of composing processes. The IW group eventually came to appreciate some of these dynamics, but only late in the semester.

RQ3. : How did learners in CW and IW conditions orient themselves to the writing pace, and did such orientations change over time?

As noted, a cluster analysis was conducted to allow different orientation types to emerge from the dataset. The dendrograms for the CW (Appendix A) and the IW group (Appendix B) reveal two distinct patterns of orientation across both groups and acros time that help define the clusters a) course and curriculum (defined as the combination of task and environmental variables) and (b) agents and students' personal experiences (defined as the pairing of learner and environmental factors). These definitions stem from the variables informing the clusters. For example, the orientation to course and currculum includes variables such as learning about effectie writing (v3), writing asignments (v4), wriig feedack (v10), and critical engagement (v14) that underscore attentionto pedagogical decisions and course content. Further, an orientation toward agents and students' personal experiences comprises variables that include, among others,course professor (v16), small group dynamics (v23), ambition to be an effectie writer (v29), and secondary school writing experiences (v32) all of which emphasizeattention to individuals (including a focus on oneself) and interactions with others and their experiences.

Limited exceptions to these orienting pattrns include, in the CW group, in cluster one of week 12, (Appendix A, Fig. A4) and clusters one and three and in wee fifeen (Appendix A, Fig. A5), places where only limited variable depart from these orienting patterns. Similarly, in the IW group minimal changes appear in cluster two of weeks one and fifteen (Appendix B, Fig. B1 and Fig B5, respectively). However, despite these exceptions, both groups overwhelmingly maintained a consistent and simila orientation to their writing paces across the semester, demonstrating ittle change in how they perceive groups of variales interacting over time. The results of RQ3 revealed that learners in both groups oriented themselves to the writing space similarl across time, despite writing under different conditions for fifteen weeks.

A summary of the primary findings of this study suggest that notwithstanding similarities early on in their perspectives of the writing space, the CW group discerned notably more variablesas having astrong inluence on academic writing over time (RQ1), that the CW group linked said variables more consistently to group dynamics and the interpretation of the writing space as nuanced and complex (RQ2), and that despite these differences, both groups oriented themselves similarly across time to two distinct sets of influential variable: those focused on the course and curriculum (i.e, task and environmental factors), and those concentrated on agents and learners' experiences (i.e., learner and environmental variables) (RQ3).

# 7. Discussion

This study explores how collaborative writers and independent writers orient to writing spaces over time. Results from RQ1 and RQ2 showed that the CW group, comparatively, developed a more nuanced interpretation of the writing landscape by emphasizing a consistent and broader perspective from week five onwards. Although increased awareness of the writing space is known to improve linguistic performance (Fogal, 2023; Negretti & McGrath, 2018), the present study highlights the utility of both promoting that awarenesinide a larger CW environment and the ability of CW to facilitate that rflection. For instance, this awareness may encourage writer to attend to unexpected forms and sources of input and to engage with underexplored learning opportunitie (e.g., pursuing extensive out-of-clas discussions with per or writing center tutors. This study thus contributes to better realizing how CW experience can help trigger such awarenes and helps to recognize and conceptualize 2 writing acros a broader curricular landscae (Byrnes, 2020; Fogal, 2020)--one that locates CW and CW research inside that wider curricular sphere.

Despite showing that CW can raise awareness of the writing space, the findings also demonstrate a limit to said awarenes. Although the CW group perceived more variables as strongly impacting their writing development (RQ1), the understanding of how those variables interacted to serve development was limited across groups to within similar cluster types (RQ3). This representation is concerning, as the writing space appears centralized and restricted to defined sets of variable types interacting. In both CW and IW contexts, this constraint is problematic as centralized environments (those that curb possbilities for activity) provide minimal op portunities for emergent behavior and experimentation (e.g., seking out new writing strategies) that could help learners with problem solving and writing (Fogal, 2020; Majchrzak, 2018). This finding was particularly surprising in the CW group, given the expectation--based on findings in other domains of collaborative work (e.g., social systems, Aminpour et al., 2021, and the behavioral sciences, Sulik et al., 2022)-that working with multiple group members on repeated, problem-solving tasks (responding to essay prompts) would expose students to various ways of thinking that would translate into diverse perceptions of the writing space. The present study sugests that such collaorative opportunitie did not advantage the CW group in this way. Rather, such noticing opportunities were limited to features of the writing landscape, but not to how those features interacted. This work thus contributes to discussions (g., Elabdali, 2021; Shehadeh, 2011) about the beneficial limit or boundary of CW--at least in the context of the present study (i.e., advanced learners in an EFL university setting).

When considering the CW research framework, this work expands this context in two ways. First, system mapping provides a new method for exploring CW. As the literature suggests (Fogal, 2020, 2022; Ludlow et al., 2017), this tchnique allows stakeholders to reflect upon their engagement with the educational landscape in an effort, for one, to asst with learning and interventions. For example, in the present study system mapping exposed centralized or limited views of interactions that may hamper writing and problem solving. To address this concern, this work invites instructors to lead CW students through exercises that expose them to different ways of thinking about their writing development (e.g., what contributions have students' past L2 writing studies made to their present writing experince)an invitation akin to calls in the literature for explicit classoom instruction on how best to operationalize CW (Chen & Hapgood, 2021; Li & Zhu, 2017). As a relatively new research method for L2 writing studies, system mapping appears poised to assist CW researchers to understand the wide landscape CW activities occur in. Accordingly, system mapping can function as a macro-analytic tool that complements studies focused on the dyad or small group.

Second, the findings emphasize the utility of including environmental factors in CW research. Students from both sections recognized environmental features as closely related to learner and task-related variables (RQ3), emphasizing how learners in both writing conditions areciated, although to different derees (RQs 1 and 2), the interrlated and complex nature of L2 writing and how this awareness at last with the CW group, could trigger opportunities for engagement otherwise untapped, as previously noted. Considering environmental variables also provides an additional layer of understanding to CW phenomena by unpacking system components and operations at diffrent levels of granularity. This study, and those of Cho (2017) and Wang (2019), represent very early glances into how CW research may benefit from operationalizing a larger variable et across wider research landscape. Both of these contributions, then, addres calls in the literature (Li & Zhang, 2021; Storch, 2019) to broaden the scope and context of CW research and allow scholars to probe how stakeholders perceive and interact with the dynamic and complex ecosystem CW writing is embedded in.

In summary, the findings and related discussion expand the CW research framework in numerous ways. First, this study demonstrates how examining an unconventionally broad CW space can reveal the utility of students reflcting on said spaces tostimulate their situational awarenessin ways that may serve language learning. Second, accessing learners' perspectives of expansive writing spaces enables researchers to appreciate how leaners relate to said environments, signifying to researchers the potential limts of CW among advanced learners. Third, this study inroduces a novel reearch tool i., system mapping) capable of capturing and examining a wide educational landscape, thus complementing CW research on, for instance, small groups. This complement is made possible by including a wider variable se (i.., environmental variables) that stdies of dyads, for example, typically do not account for. Expanding the CW research agenda in these ways provides researchers with a principled method for exploring CW at diffrent levels of granularity, thus exposing researchers to unique, system-wide perspectives on CW that can guide understanding and praxis.

In this vein and based on the findings discussed and summarized thus far, this work also presents opportunities to advance classoom practice. That is understanding learner's perceptions of the wider writing space may help writing instructors and program directors to facilitate opportunitie for students t see, reflect upon, and take advantage of the wider educational context that CW is embedded in. For example, instructors may encourage writing center visits or consultations with professors as extensions of the CW experience. Moreover, instructors can also employ system mappingshown by Fogal (2023) to enhance learners' language awareness in service of writing development-to raise awareness f the wider context informing learners writing practice. Such an approach would enable instructors to address cassroom ssues a the local level, given the highly contextualized nature of systm mapping. This work also suggests that intructors engage CW students in activities (eg., stem mapping, group or claroom-wide discussions that point beyond the conventional classoom, or journaling about their past writing experiences) that reveal to learners diverse perspectives about advancing their writing In these ways, instructors can provide CW students with explicit acessto experiences beyond the classroom that may serve their writing needs.

Finally, this study is not without limitations, some of which may guide future research. This work did not examine linguistic output via learners compositions. However, such an analys could address the utility of CW to advance diffrent writing constructs among adanced learners participating in repeated CW tasks. In addition, there i some chance that leaners were underprepared for the third step in the system mapping activity (the synthesizing of variable interactions), despite relevant controls like guided asstance and samples for students to examine. Although previous studies employing system mapping reported no such concerns, synthesizing is widely considered a higher-order thinking process and may require further guidance than what was delivered here. Similar to recommendations for approaching CW in the classoom (i.., including guidance on best practice), future studies employing system mapping may consider more guidance for learners regarding the final step in the synthesis task.

# 8. Conclusion

This study examined how writers in CW and IW conditions orient to the writing space while considering their writing development. Related findings make contributions to theory, pedagogy, and research methods. This work documents how collaborative writers move from limited to expansive and stable modes of interpreting the writing space in ways that highlight a nuanced and complex understanding of the CW landscape. onversely, despite these new perspectives, learners in both conditions were restricted in their thinking about how variables interact to support L2 writing. Both groups characterized their writing environments as centralized systemsnotable for their potential to constrain student aces to novel approaches to dealing with their writing. This highlightsa potential limit to what can be expected of advanced learners engaged in Cw that requires further investigation. Pedagogicall, this work confirms earlier claims about the importance of providing learners with initial clasroom support for operationalizing CW and addresses instructors neds to recognize and facilitate writer engagement with the wide landscape W is embedded in. Finl, this work expands the CW research framework by introducing system mapping as a meaningful technique for exploring CW spaces and expanding the variable set conventionally associated with CW studie.In addition to the contributions thus noted, this work invites researchers to consider a systems approach to CW studies as a meaningful and worthwhile complement to previous and ongoing projects in this research domain.
