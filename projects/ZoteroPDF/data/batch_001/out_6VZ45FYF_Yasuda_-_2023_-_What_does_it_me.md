Argumentation is a crucial skill in higher education, and argumentative essays are common genres that students have to write. However, studies have shown that many L2 learners have difficulty in developing an argument in their essays (Wingate, 2012) and that teachers face challenges in gaining an understanding of argumentation and how to scaffold L2 learners (Kibler, 2017). As a first step toward establishing a comprehensive argumentative writing framework for learners and teachers, this article presents a synthesis of relevant empirical studies that illuminate the argumentative features of academic discourse. Focusing on two research perspectives--argumentative writing for general academic purposes and argumentative writing for specific academic purposes-, this review aims to establish a nexus between generic knowledge about argumentation and discipline-specific contexts for argumentation. This review forms the theoretical foundations for the improvement of English for academic purposes practice, providing choices that teachers may have been previously unaware of, thus empowering them to move beyond the constraints of a structure-oriented understanding of argumentative writing and helping learners navigate the demands of higher education.

# 1. Introduction

Argumentation is integral to academic discourse, playing a crucial role in establishing and disseminating knowledge. When establishing knowledge, writer onstruct their aguments by preenting scholarly evidenceto support or challenge a claim or position. Writers also employ arguments to effectively convey their ideas or stance to their intended readers. Constructing well-refined arguments alows writersto persuade and engage their readers as wellas strengthen their own position. Thus, many English for Academic Purposes (EAP) educators may concur that students must acquire the ability to compose high-quality arguments to sucesfully participate in their target discourse community.

The ability to writ an effective argumentative essay is also an important marker of second language (L2) writing ability, as standardized language proficiency tests often include academic essay writing to sesstudents' argumentative abilit. This indicates that \*the quality of the academic esay depends on the development of an argument (Wingate, 2012, p. 152) and that argumentative essays \*serve as a gatekeeper to advanced secondary and tertiary work" (Kibler & Hardigree, 2017, p. 76). The ability to compose arguments is becoming increasingly crucial as a growing number of students from non-English backgrounds constitute the school population in English-dominant countries. Plenty of academic writing textbooks offring guidance and intruction about the "ive-paragraph essay' structure may reflect the needs of this student demographic and lead teachers to uncriticlly impose on their students this generic structure of argumentative writing.

Nonetheles, a question remains about how closely the textbook instructions on argumentative writing reflect the type of writing that occurs outside the academic writing classroom (Schneer, 2014). Studies have revealed that many L2 students have difficulty composing arguments in their disciplinary courses due to their lack of experience in writing argumentative texts (Booth Olson et al. 2023; Pessoa, Mitchll, & Miller, 2017; Varghese & Abraham, 1998; Zha & Hirvela, 2015). Wingate's(2012) survey on L2 writers experience in argumentative writing in higher education demonstrated that students "are either unaware that they are expected to develop an argument in their esays or have difficulty in doing so" (p. 145). In their study of L2 universty students reading-to-write argumentative essays, Qin and Karabacak (2010) observed students making claims without paying adequate attention to opposing positions and necesary rebuttals In their analysi of L2 writers argumentatiesays in a world history course, Miller, Mitchell, & Pessoa, 2016 demonstrated that L2 writers who had insufficient argumentative experience or expertise drew on narrative or explanatory approaches that did not lead to coherent argument--a phenomenon known as "emergent arguments' (p. 43).

Previous studies have also demonstrated that teachers have dificulty articulating the rules that govern high-quality argumentative writing (Kibler, 2017). One possble explanation i "a lack of consensus on how argumentation is defined and what must be included in an argumentative esay" (Hirvela, 2017, p. 69). As noted by Kibler and Hardigre (2017), the conceptualizations f argumentative writing vary widely in current scholarship. At the broadest level, two opposing schools of thought exist: One conceptualizes argumentation as a form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on a set of premises or evidence (Toulmin, 2003), while the other conceptualizes it as a form of inquiry or heuristics to deepen students thinking skill so as to formulate the arguments for and against a course f action, a point of view, or a solution to problem (Kuhn, 1991)This dichotomy is often described as the distinction between argumentative writing for general academic purposes i.e., generic, field-invariant conventions that can be applied to argumentative witing acrossdisciplines) and argumentative witing for specific academic purposes (ie., feld-dependent elements of argument that can contribute to deeper conceptual learning) (Andrews, 2010; Hirvela, 2017; VanDerHeide, Newell & Wynhof Olsen, 2023). The first perspective might be useful when argumentative writing is taught and learned in English for general academic purposes (EGAP) contexts, where ess experienced L2 writers are expected to write generic, context-neutral argumentative essays for writing courses. Converely, the second perspective is applicable to argumentative writing that is taught and learned in English for specific academic purposes (EsAP) contexts, where students use tools of argumentation to enrich their content knowledge and field-specific notions of argumentation might be crucial. While this \*reasoning-inquiry dichotomy" (Hirvela, 2017, p. 71) is an interesting way of conceptualizing argumentation, it appears that this distinction has resulted in a disciplinary division between argumentative writing in EGAP and ESAP contexts. Under the circumstances in which teaching argumentative writing is viewed as a binary option rather than a continuum, L2 writing teachers may draw on guidance offered in existing textboos or their intuitions and previous experinces to make pedagogical decisions, which may not be ideal for students' learning. They may also face dificulties articulating a common goal of improvement in the argument quality-\*improvement of what exactly?" (Mitchll, 200, p. 146, itlics in original).

Surprisingly, however, reearch into argumentation has been limited in academic discourse studies. In contrast to a large number of published studies regarding first language (L1) argumentative writing, what constitutes a good argumentation and the best way to provide instructional support remain underexplored topics in L2 literature. As Hirvela (2017) pointed out, \*it is present but not fully accounted for; visible but not closely scrutinized in any systematic sustained way; written about yet neglected with respect to any larger theoretical or pedagogical framing" (p. 70).

If the L2 community continues to under-scrutinize what argumentation means and how it is taught and learned, an important question remains unanswered: How can we help novice L2 students mprove as writers and aguers to successully participate in thir academic discourse communities? Therefore, the present conceptual review aims to ill his knowledge gap. Specifically, it eeks to highlight the argumentative features of academic discourse by combining EGAP-informed studies on generic knowledge about argumentation and ESAP-informed studies on discipline-specific argumentation features. This synthesis is crucial, given that dialogue between the two perspectives is not as frequent as we sometimes claim it to be.

In the present review, an "argument" comprises the artifacts that astudent creates when asked to articulate and justify claims or explanations," whereas "argumentation" refers to the process of constructing these artifacts" (Sampson & Clark, 2008, p.447). Further, this review categorizes relevant studies into two perspectives. One category is the GAP persective, which addresses ways of helping students to construct arguments as generic academic (transferrable) study skill. The core elements of argumentation (e., claim, evidence, warrants,counterarguments, and rebuttal) and relevant linguistic resources are taught to students so that they can write well-crafted argumentative essays. The other category is the ESAP perspective, which views argumentation as a way of arriving at a deeper understanding of a topic. Students are supported to construct discipline-specific arguments so that they can participate successfuly in their target academic discourse communities. The integration of these two research perspectives establishes a comprehensive argumentative writing framework, offers choices of which writing teachers may have been previously unaware, and encourages them to work beyond the reasoning-inquiry dichotomy. The integration of these two perspectives is especiall helpful for EAP teachers to go beyond the constraints of the form-oriented teaching of argumentative writing that is ubiquitous in commercial writing textboos. As such, the aim of this review is not to propose a specific formula or a rigidly defined notion of "good argu. mentation' but to explore what such argumentation comprises.

In conducting the review, the author rferred to the eight steps proposed by Xiao and Watson (2019) for a systematic literature review. The author searched Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EBscohost, thre frequently used databases by researchers across various disciplines, using the keywords "argument," "argumentation, "argumentative essays," and "argumentative writing." To be included in the review, studies had to meet the following criteria: (a) be an empirical study published in a peer-reviewed journal or edited volume; (b) be an empirical study of the features of arguments in academic contexts; and (c) be published between 2000 and 2003, which allowed the author to conduct a review of relatively recent literature. The initial search yielded 328 results. The author reviewed all title and abstracts and subsequently selected 89 studies that matched the eligility critrias the final set of studies analyzed in the present review. These studies included both L1 and L2 writing research on the grounds that the L1 (English) writing field, ften known as an "argument industry" (Hirvela, 2017, p. 70), has cllectively pursued a umber of important questions that the L2 writing field has yet to answer definitively, such as what constitutes a quality argument and what students need to know to participate successull in their disciplinary communities. While it should be recognized that the challenges faced by L2 writers learning to writ arguments are stinct fromthose of1 writers, cllctions ofL1 work regarding how to crafteffective aruments wil offer valuable insights into the clearer operationalization of argumentation in the L2 writing field.

# 2. Research on argumentative writing from the EGAP perspective

Most empirical research on generic argumentative writing focuses on four primary themes (a) the lexical and syntactic features of successfu argumentative writing, (b) the discourse functional featres of effective arguments; () the structural features that affect argumentative writing quality rating, and (d) the topic differences and their potential impacts on argument features. A summary of the studies reviewed in this section is available in the online version of this article (Appendix A).

# 2.1. Lexical and syntactic features

The ability to compose high-quality academic arguments requires the use of a particular register of language. Vocabulary and syntax \*are two fundamental inguistic resources used to construct meaning and communicate ideas" (Maamujav et l., 2021, p.2); thus, the lexical and syntactic features of successul argumentative writing are major concerns for researchers. Regarding lexical features, many researchers have explored the extent to which lexical complexity contributes to high-scoring argumentative writing. Lexical complexity is oten operationalized through large-grained measures, such as lxical diversity (how many diffrent words are used in a text) and lexical sophistication the proportion of les frequent, and more specialized or advanced words) (Booth Olson et al., 2023; Bulte & Housen, 2014; Yoon & Polio, 2017; Yu, 2010). Mazgutova and Kormos (2015) analyzed 39 argumentative essays written by two cohorts of students divided into higher- and lower-proficiency groups based on their ELS cores) in an intensive EAP program and found that their varied lexical choices and use f formal and academic words differentiated high- and low-scoring argumentatie essays. Maamujav et al. (2021), who studied \*text-based" argumentative writing by 86 adolescent L2 students in the United States secondary education contexts, also reported that lexical diversity and the use of academic and sophisticated vocabulary play important roles in composing academic texts that require higher levels of argumentation skill. Further evidence of the link between lexical features and argumentative writing comes from Higginbotham and Reid (2019), who studied argumentative essays written by 472 undergraduate students in a pre-sessional EAP course at a university in the United Kingdom. They reported that students who used many high-frequency words in their essays tended to receive lower grades for their essays (based on Hamp-Lyons and Henning's (1991) analytic rubric), whereas those who used a higher proportion of academic words tended to receive higher scores. These studies provide evidence that lexical diversity and lexical sophistication can be used as proxies for leaners abilities to write effectie arguments.

Along with lexical complexity, syntactic complexity has been shown to be a strong factor that affcts readers perceptions of the overall quality of argumentative writing. More specifically syntactic complexity at the sentence, clause, and phrasal levels is often used as an indicator of argumentative writing proficiency (Barkaoui, 2010; Kyle & Crossley, 2017, 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Siekmann et al., 2022). For example, Lahuerta Martinez (2018) investigated the correlation between syntactic complexity measures and the overal quality of argumentativesays written by 18 secondary chool students in Spain who learned English as a foreign language (EFL). The findings demonstrated that using longer units at the sentential and clausal levels was a significant indicator of higher qualit, whereas frequent use of simple sentences was a sign of lower writing quality. Regarding phrasal complexity, the data showed a significant relationship between the higher scores on argumentative essays and the mean length of noun phrases. Similar findings were obtained by Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015, who examined argumentative essays written by 190 ESL matriculate graduate students in the United States. The authors found that length-based global syntactic complexity measures (i.., the mean length of the sentences, dependent clauses per T-unit, and T-units per sentence) were significant predictors of argumentative writing quality across the two examined topics. While Lahuerta Martinez (2018) and Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015 reported a progres in argumentative writing characterized by increasing length, subordination, and phrasal elaboration, Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013 presented somewhat conflicting finding. The latter authors analyzed th syntactic features f argumentatie eays written by ESL college students in the United States and found that higher-rated argumentative essays did not necessarily contain more complex sentences at the clausal level (i.e., subordinating conjunctions and that-rlative clauses). However, Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013 study partilly supported Lahuerta Martinez's (2018) findings. They found that higher-rated argumentative essays were more complex at the phrasal level and contained more post-noun-modifying prepositional phrases. Informational density through phrasal elaboration was also reported by Staples et al. (2018 s a featre f aumenttive texts written by avancdwriter from hre uiversitie in the nited State, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. The authors' large-scale corpus study revealed that graduate student writers used many more of the features associated with informational density than undergraduate student counterparts through nominalizations attributive adjec. tives, abstract nouns, and premodifying nouns. The conflicting results indicate the need for researchers to revisit the widely held assumptions about syntactic complexity: \*more is more complexity," \*longer linguistic units are more complex," and "more and/or more deeply embedded is more complex" (Bulte & Housen, 2014, pp.44- 45). As Norrs & Ortega, 2009 and other (e.g, Casal & Lee,

2019; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Jiang et al., 2019; Kyle & Crossley, 2017, 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014) have stated syntactic complexity consists of several sub-constructs, dimensions, and components, each of which must be independently evaluated, depending on the writer's age, proficiency level, and most importantly, what they are expected to argue.

# 2.2. Discourse features

Studies on academic texts' discourse features have increasingly focused on evaluative language use, analyzing the ways in which writers present persuasive arguments in the language they utilize. The findings of these studies have revealed that argumentative writing effectiveness is greatly enhanced by the use of various epistemic markers, such as hedges, boosters, and attitude markers, helping writers show atitude, perspective, or stance toward the proposition (e.g., Dobbs, 2014; Le, 2008; Thompson, 2012; ecelli et al., 2013; Yo0n, 2017).

These epistemic markers, or the various linguistic devices used by writers to express their stances and persuade their readers, are often conceptualized as metadiscourse markers (Hyland, 2004; 2005a; 2005c). The vast literature on metadiscourse has provided empirical evidence to support Hyland's (2005c) interactional model, which proposes that metadiscourse markers have two primary functions and help writers crafteffective arguments: stance (i.., helping writers present themselves and convey their judgments, opinions, and commitments) and engagement i., helping writers acknowledge and connect to others, recognizing the presence of their readers, and pulling them along with their argument). According to Hyland (2005c), stance markers enable writers to project their position through linguistic choices such as hedge, boosters, atitude marker, and self-mentions. In addition to expressing their positions in what they write, writers also engage their intended readers by using one or more of the ollowing engagement markers: reader mentions, directives, questions, knowledge references, and personal asides.

Yoon (2017) explored the effct of these metadiscourse features (i.., hedges, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions, reader pronouns, and directives) on the overall argument quality and authorial voice strength based on Zhao's (2012) analytcal rubric. The author investigated 51 argumentative essays written by Greek-speaking EFL college students in the United States. The results demonstrated that hedging expressions were the only liguisti feature that was significantl correlated with overal argument quality; While holistic voice strength was related to other features, such as boosters, atitude markers, and self-mentions. Hedges serve three main functions in gaining the readers acceptance of a writer's argument: expressing propositions with greater precision, limiting the damage that may result from categorical commitments, and expressing deference as strategic politeness(Hyland, 1998). As demon. strated by Yoon (2017) and others (e.g., Gross & Chesley, 2012; Helms-Park & Stapleton, 2003; Thompson, 2012; Zha0, 2012), the ability to use hedges in consideration of the intended reader may be an important indicator for ifferentiating between effective and less effective arguments in academic contexts.

The effectivenes of evaluative language in determining argumentative writing quality was confirmed in a large-scale corpus study by Aull & Lancaster, 2014. The researcher created a corpus of nearly 400 argumentative essays written by three groups of writers: incoming firs-year college students, upper-level student writers, and professional academic writers. The researchers focused on how writers at different developmental stages used stance markers (i.e., hedges, boosters, code glosse, and adversative/contrast con. nectives) in argumentative writing. The findings revealed that the frequency of these stance markers was an indicator of the devel. opmental traectory of writing abilities. Aanc writrs used hedes (, possbly, geneally, reativly), rfomulation marker ., n particr, put nthr ay, spificall), and conrast ressions , whers, i corast, atatively) more freueny than novice writers who tended to overuse boosters (e.g., very, much certainly) and concessive/counter connectors (e.g., however). Aull & Lan caster, 2014 work implied that these evaluative resources played a crucial role in producing an effective argument because they indicated the author's view toward the stated proposition and conveyed the "stanceas the author's relationship toward the reader (e. g., dialogically engaged or critically distant) and stance toward a larger discourse community (one recognizing the importance of complexity and altentive views) (p. 174). verall the reults suggested that les experiecd writers found it challenging to express an authorial stance in their arguments; therefore, explicit instruction in evaluative language could asst them in persuasively conveying their messages and gradually acculturating them into argumentation practice in the academic world.

# 2.3. Structural features

The structural feature of writers' argumentative essays have received considerable attention in L2 writing research since Kaplan (1966) proposed the notion of contrastive rhetoric, in which the rhetorical patterns of a whole culture were reduced to a label such as "linear," "direct," or "circular." Based on the underlying assumption that organizational patterns can be transferred from L1 to L2, researchers explored the organizational patterns of L2 writers' argumentative essays, focusing on whether they used the general-to-specific (deductive) or the specific-to-general inductive) patterns (e.g., Connor, 1996; Hirose, 2003; Kobayashi & Rinnert 1996; Kubota, 1998; Sasaki & Hirose, 1996). In contrast to Kaplan (1966), these studies ffer evidence for the clam that L2 writers choice of the deductive or inductive methods of argumentation is affcted by both developmental (including their L2 writing experiences, 2 proficiency levels, and 1 writing abilities) and social factors (including thir awarenessof the context of writing, the purpose of writing, and the intended reader), rather than inguistic and cultural factors. Earlier contrastive rhetoric-based studies have been criticized as the static theory of L2 writing which denies the writer's agency and assumes that he or she does not have the autonomy to make decisions in spite of the circumstance\* (Matsuda, 1997, p. 49). Acumulating evidence from the subsequent studies has led to an expanded conception of the structural features of L2 argumentative writing.

Thus, more recent research on the structural features of L2 argumentation has strived to evaluate the efectivenes of the organizational structure from the developmental and social perspectives. One such attempt was to identify the trengths and weaknesses of

L2 writers' arguments based on Toulmin's model of argumentation (2003). The key elements f the model used to gauge argument soundness and strength included claims, grounds, warrants, backing, qualifiers, and rebuttals. Toulmin's theory of argumentation is depicted in the online version of this paper (see Appendix B).

The core elements of argumentation addressed in Toulmin's model helped researchers analyze the structural features of students argumentative writing and identify the strengths and weaknese of their argumentation ability. For example, Ferris (1994) analyzed 60 argumentative texts wrtten by university freshman composition students, showing that several of the argumentative elements taken from Toulmin's model --claims, data, and warrants-- distinguished advanced writers from novice ones. Aditionally, her findings showed that advanced writers were more adept at handling counterarguments. The results of Ferris (1994) study showed that the quality ratings of key elements, such as claims, data, warrants, and counterarguments, were the most significant predictors of the holistic writing scores assgned to college students argumentative texts. In a universty context in Singapore, Varghese & Abraham 1998 provided 30 s-year English-major undergraduates with explicit instruction in the Toulmin model of argument structure. The researchers found that the students made substantial progressafter instruction, as they produced more persuasive claims, more concrete data, and more valid warrants. The explicit instruction also helped students become more aware of views from both sides. In a Chinese university context, Qin and Karabacak (2010) analyzed the structural features of argumentative essays written by 13 students based on a modified Toulmin model, which included claims, data, counterargument claims, counterargument data, rebuttal claims, and rebuttl data. The findings demonstrated that while most students were ableto write arguments by presenting a basic argument structure, such as claims and data, they omitted opposing viewpoints and rebuttals. However,esays with higher scores included these elements. The tendency of lesskilled writers to dismiss evidence that contradicts their claims-known as \*myside bias' (Wolf. 2012)has been confirmed by other researchers (Nussbaum & Schraw, 2007; Stapleton, 2001; Stapleton & Wu, 2015).

While the application of Toulmin's model to analyze students' argumentative writing has contributed to our advanced under standing of the strengths and weakneses of their aility to argue, many studies have focused on whether certain argumentative el. ements are present rather than how good the quality of reasoning is within theargumentative elements In other words all that matters is the presence or absence of certain argumentative elements regardless of their acceptability or relevance. Typical assessment practices used to evaluate students' argumentative writing often rely on the analysis of the surface structure, while omitting a comprehensive analysis of the overallargument qualit or acertaining the extet to which the core argument elements are suficiently interlinked. However, what is mportant in agumentation is the quality of theseelements or \*the lines that join those boxes, that is, the action of linking grounds to claims, or supporting the argument with warrants and backing" (Andrews, 200, p. 8, italics in original), rather than the mere presence of the boxes or categories of arguments depicted in the Toulmin model (see Appendix B in the online version of this paper).

Stapleton and Wu (2015) emphasized that the presence of specific elements in students' argumentative essays is not always an accurate indicator of the argument's quality or substance. In their study of argumentative essays writen by 125 secondary students in Hong Kong, they revealed that even when the surface structure was efective, it did not necessril follow that the argument quality was effective. Similarly, Chuang and Yan's (2022) study of 150 ESL college students in the United States revealed that neither esay quality (A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 acording to the CEFR scale) nor profil type (two-sided complete argument, one-sided complete argument, incomplete argument, and non-argument) was predicted by any of Toulmin's elements, whether present or absent. These results emphasize the important role of qualitative analysis, suggesting that an analysis that considers only surface-level structural argument features may be insufficient.

# 2.4. Topic effects on argument features

While previous research has revealed sucessul argument features in terms of lexical, syntactic,discourse, and structural com ponents, there is another crucial variable that influences arguments: a topic's intricacy and complexity for writers. It can be hy. pothesized that if a topic is familiar, relevant, and worth arguing, writers feel encouraged to cultivate ideas, develop claims, and produce well-onsidered reasoning and evidence. In contrast, as Glaser (1984) claimed, people who are unfamiliar with a subject lack the schemata necessary to infer further knowledge.

Stapleton (2001) explored the relationship between topic familiarity and the argumentative writing quality of EFL students at a university in Japan. The study took writing sample from 45 sophomore students, including their responses to two different topics: one familiar importing ricet Japan) and the other unfamiliar (gun control in the United States). The students argumentative essays were evaluated to identify the extent to which the key elements of critical thinking could be displayed in their writing, including the (a) umber f arguments, b) extent of evidence, (c) recognition of opposing arguments, (d) corresponding refutations, and (e) number of fallacies. The results demonstrated that i familiar-topic essays, a wide range of evidence was employed, including logical explana tions, fact, consequence, comparisons, analogies, and personal experiences. Hence, the students constructed more effective argu. ments in the rice-import essays than in the gun-controlesays. This finding resonates with Glaser's (1984) research, which argues that there are significant differences in argument quality between familiar and unfamiliar topic essays.

The effects of topic differences on writers' linguistic choices were also detected by Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015, who examined 190 argumentative essays wrtten by ESL matriculate graduate students at eight institutions in the United States. The students wrote argumentative essays about two topics that dfered in causal reasoning: (i) whether people place too much emphasis on personal appearance and (ii) whether careful lanning at a young age ensures a good future. The authors found that the topics significantly affected the syntactic complexity of the essas. The first topic (i.e, appearance elicited a higher degree f subordination and greater global sentence complexty, whereas the second topic (i.e, the future) elicited more elaboration at the phrasal level. In a recent study, Lombardi (2022) also revealed topics effects on writers argumentation. The author investigated how 41 multilingual college students in the United tates used different modalies (i.e., epistemic versus deontic stance markers in their argumentative essays in response to two topics. One was an epistemic topic requiring students to address possbility and probability questions (eg, Do you think driverlesscars would be a safe and efective form of transportation in the near future? Why or why not). The other was a deontic topic demanding that students make judgments f necessity e.g., Should countries require young people to spend a yer or two in public service, either in the military or helping thir communities i a non-military position? Why or why not?). The results afirmed that students' per. formances in the deontic topic essays outperformed the epistemic topic essays and that the two different prompts resulted i different linguistic choices regarding modalities. Specifically, hedging expressons such as can, may, and seem to, were frequently used in epistemic topic essays, while deontic essays noted the frequent use of boosters such as should, must, and ought to.

The crucial implication of these studies isthat educators nedto take care of topic election and task design, considering \*what kind of argument? What kind of reasoning do we expect them [students] to display in the texts they produce?" (Lombardi, 2022, p. 10) and "who, in the real world, needs to write argumentative essays, anyway?" (Kirkpatrick, 2017,p. 81). These findings also highlight the need for researchers to carefully select valid constructs to measure the quality of argumentative writing.

# 3. Research on argumentative writing with an ESAP perspective

Some scholars may challenge the underlying premise of the EGAP perspective that a generic conceptualization of argumentative writing, which can travel acros contexts, can be established. They argue that \*writing and disciplinarity [in academic sttings] are locally situated, extensively mediate, deeply laminated, and highly heterogeneous" (Prior, 1998, p. 275) and suggest that \*we must not feel that our gl n the wtin cla i to tech some form of all-puroe arumet in order to prepare tudts to write efetiely everywhere in the curriculum' (Freedman, 1996, p. 112). Johns (2017) noted that "effctive argumentation is sitated, requiring a significantly thorough understanding of the audience, how to construct an authorial presence within the text, of acceptable text structure, and of appropriate use of print and visual language (p. 80, italics in original). The following section provides a review of research adopting the ESAP perspective. A summary of the studies reviewed in this section is available in the online version of this paper (Appendix C).

# 3.1. Argumentation across disciplines

Disciplinary teachers often adopt reading-to-write argumentative essays that require students to develop arguments based on their reading of various source texts (Kibler & Hardigre, 2017; Lombardi, 2022; Weigle & Parker, 2012; Wolfe, 2012; Zha0 & Hirvela, 2015). These studies ofer empirical evidence on discipline-specific ways of synthesizing the original information into a cohesive argument, suggesting that dfferences exist in arumentation across isciplines, particularly in the types of claims made, what counts as evidence, and how evidence is used to substantiate claims. Giltrow (200) noted that while ollege students were often advised that a general thesis at the beginning of an essay should be supported by specific examples later in the text, this convention was not always applicable to disciplinary argumentative writing. In sociology, for example, opening claims about humans are often avoided, as this discipline focuses on the social nature of people and associated constructs, rather than human nature as a whole. Similarl, history students are ften advised against making broad opening claims about past events and are trained to think of limits to generality rather than welcoming a statement of position. Nokes & De La Paz, 2023 elaborated on historical argumentation by pointing out that his torians' arguments always open the door for conflicting interpretations because majority of historical evidencenot the past but representations of the past-is produced by humans and as such is shaped by the author's values, priorities, perspectives, purposes, and insights" (Nokes & De La Paz, 2023, p. 335). Therefore, when reading and writing arguments in the field of hstorical reearch, it is important to ssess how compelling the evidence behind politicians' claims is? Who produced the evidence? Who was the intended audience? How was it published?" (Nokes & De La Paz, 2023, p. 361). The authors claimed that teaching students strategies for evaluating historical evidence through critical questions would prepare them to read and write historical arguments. Historical argumentation has also been analyzed by Miler, Mitchell, & Pessoa, 2014 in the Middle Eastern university context, using the ENGAGEMENT framework from systemic functional linguistics (Martin & White, 2005). The researchers analyzed how undergraduate students use ENGAGEMENT resources in their argumentative history papers to engage and persuade readers. Their findings revealed that argumentative writig in history consists of the following ENGAGEMENT resources: proclaim/endorse (e.g., X proves .,  shows ..), rocam/pronounce eg., The fact i .., contend tht ..), disclam/deny (e., did not, ner), disclam/counter (g, yet, but), concede $^ +$ counter (e.g., admitedy . but, while . stll, entertain/modality (e., perhaps, may), and attribute/acknowledge (e.g., according to X, X sugest .. An important mplication of the findings of Miller, Mtchll,  Pesa, 2014 i tht there might be certain linguistic resources valued within specific disciplines, and the nuanced usage of those linguistic resources could affect readers' impressions of the discipline-specific qualities of argumentative writing.

In another context, Harwood (2009) analyzed how academic writers use linguistic resources across disciplines, focusing on self-positioning. His findings showed that argumentation through self-positioning varies aross disciplines. Computer scientis, for example, use signposting citations (i.., directing readers to others works) to construct arguments, whereas sociologists use engaging citations (i.., engaging in critical dialogue with thers works). yland (2005b) revealed that social cience writers are more likely to use reader pronouns and references to shared knowledge, compared with natural cience writers, when presenting interpretative and evaluative positioning and creating a dialogue with their readers. Additionall, he found that directives are frequently employed by natural science writerstodirect readers to agree with their perspectives or adhere to a specific arument. Specific lingustic resources valued within specific course contexts were also identified by Lancastr's (2016) study, which focused on stance expressins (., self-mentions, hedges, boosters, disclaim markers, and attitude markers) in undergraduate coursework tasks wrtten in two distint courses: an economics course (a discipline situated in the social sciences) and a political theory course (a discipline situated in the humanities). Based on the analysis of the two disciplinary corpora that comprised high-graded and low-graded student papers, the researcher found that high-graded economics papers were characterized by the frequent use of various stance expressions, including hedges, disclaim markers, bosters, and self-mentions. Conversely, high-graded political theory papers used attitude markers with greater frequency than the economics papers. Lancaster (2016) argued that these diferences "can be understood in light of the rhetorical challenges of the respectieassignments' (p. 27): a major challenge for the economics writers was to persuade the reader to accept their analyses and recommendations by alternately demonstrating their pistemic commitments, whereas a rhetorical challenge for the political theory writers was to categorically assert their judgements and evaluations.

These disciplinary variations imply that an academic argument involves presenting a position on things that matter to a discipline" (Hyland, 2012, p. 134). This expression of perspective is insearable from writers ability to identify pertinent data and valid eidence, as well a choose context-appropriate linguistic resources, which ften develops in proportion to their disciline-specific knowledge. Their apparent lack of argumentation skill, that is the lack of ability to persuade readers through positioning, may reflect their misunderstanding of what is important in their discipline rather than being indicative of a lack of argumentation skills Kibler and Hardigree (2017) illutrated the situated nature of argumentation acquisition in their longitudinal case study of an L2 writer's use of evidence in argumentative writing over eight year from Grade 9 in high school to her fourth year in universty). The findings revealed that as the student's academic experience increased, she used evidence for a wider variety of rhetorical purposes and presented her stance more professionally by employing an increasing range of reporting verbs. These findings imply that the experience of reading, analyzing, and writing a range of situated texts in various subjects could asist students in developing the rhetorical flexibility necessary for new writig tasks. The relationship between writers' argumentation skills and their increasing disciplinary knowledge was further reported by Petric (2007; gender studies), Dressen-Hammouda (2014; geology), and Crosthwaite et al. (2017; dentistry).

However, it must be noted that there are variations that obscure disciplinary boundaries and intradisciplinary differences exist in writers argumentation patterns. This indicates that writers' meaning-making choice for argumentation are influenced by the purpose of writing or the type of text the author is writing, rather than by disciplinary norms and conventions. Harwood (2009) found tht academic writers in the same disciline employed different citation strategies to justify their claims when writig jounal articles and book chapters. The author's interview-based study of six computing and sociology scholars showed that regardles f their disciplinary backgrounds, they tended to cite fewer introductory signposting sources when writing a journal articl rather than a book chapter. MacPherson (2016) also found that the types of evidence used by ecologists varied depending on what type of claims they made. Through interviews with ten ecologists, MacPherson (2016) found that ecologists clams fell into three distinct categories: descriptive (addressing questions aout the patterns that exist in nature),causal (adressing questions about what causes the pattens observed in nature), and prescriptiv adressing questions about what should be done for the ecosystem). They als found that the evidence used by ecologists fel into three categories: observational, experimentl, and mathematical/logical. The ecologists in MacPherson's study ind. cated that observational evidence was mainly used to support descriptive claims, whereas experimental evidence was often employed to establish causal claims. It is also possible to support ecogical arguments with mathematical or logical evidence, particularly when "theoretical' ecologists support their arguments. These observations show that specific evidence is more useful than other evidence types for constructing effective arguments, resulting in argument variations even within the same discipline.

A recent study by Triki (2021), who examined the role of examples in producing a trustworthy piece of argument in research articles across various disciplines, demonstrated that the choice of exemplification markers (eg., such s, including, and for instace) was more significantly motivated by the purpose of the writer's argument than by disciplinary practices. Importantly, this study revealed that some hard sciences used examples more frequently than some soft ones and vice versa, implying that disciplines have become more hybrid and interdisciplinary, and that hasty over-generalizations about the boundarie of the soft and hard disciplines need to be avoided. Zhang & Cheung, 2023 also found that writers' argumentations differed depending on the text types they wrote rather than disciplinary conventions. For example, writers of chemistry research articles relied on "valuation" features (e.g, sustainable, vlid, important) when they reported new technologies whose practical significance was related to their commercial values, While the ame writer drew on hedging markers (e.g., likly, we infer that) to make tentative clams when reporting laboratory work to understand the composition properties structure, and working mechanism of materials. Interestingly, the authors reported that these features were shared by other disciplines, such as education, thus offering empirical support to the call for re-examining the fore grounding of disciplinary influence on argumentation patterns in academic texts.

Overall, these findings demonstrate that although argumentation patterns are inextricably linked with practices in academic disciplines, what constitutes a good argument is complex and situational; it dynamicall changes depending on how readers perceive the arguments and what they may expect. These differences are a matter of "who reads?" in response to "who writes?"

# 3.2. Multimodal argumentation

Another strand of research focuses on a form of argument that cannot always be expressed in words but rather involves multiple modes of persuasion. Medway (2000) provided an example of an argumentation style unique to the feld of architecture. Architecture embodies a creator's ability to argue in a non-verbal manner through design. The author found that students were constantly required to express their ethos and pathos as archtect i drawings and designs, addressing the following questions: \*why, with what considerations in mind, in anticipation of what efects, by the application of what general principle, why in this particular case, as an instance of what category of design move, and so on" (Medway, 2000 p. 37). The convention of emphasizing thevisual over the verbal as the primary means of argumentation has also been observed in other technical disciplines. Mathison (200) found that mechanical engineers sought to express their arguments in visuals and believed that writing about them was not entirely necessary. Their resistance to written arguments could often be heard in comments such as, I don't have to argue my design-the visual speaks for itself' (Mathison, 2000, p. 76).

However, although arguments in technical discilines are primarily expressed in visuals, this does not mean that written arguments are unnecesary. Architects must persuade clients of their work's merits through critiques and reviews. Similarly, mechanical engi. eers desigs must beexplicate verall to ensure that al their ascts can be approved, contested, and ransformed, ecially when the audience does not onsis f specialists in the same field. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with thee scientis in medicine, materials engineering, and information technology, Yasuda (2022) found that the synergistic integration of words, tables, figures, photos, formulas, and other forms of visual mathematical expressions assts scientists in conveying their arguments to readers. These findings indicate that multiple meaning-making or multimodal resources (verbal, numerical, and visual) are interdependent and constitute a disciplinary community in which one genre is often a necessary antecedent to another.

Analyzing argumentation from the ESAP perspective makes it evident that arguments are not solely or necessarily about the text type or structure of te logical reasoning produced by the writer. Rather, arguments are about building social relationships through "a co-constructed, shared sociocognitive space that alows readers and writers tosituate one another (Dressen-Hammouda, 2014, p. 16). Thus, arguments are created in the words, structure, and organization of certain rhetorical elements and in the form of multiple semiotic repertoires, such as non-verbal, visual, and numerical means. Simultaneously, arguments, both those in EGAP and ESAP contexts, share a common, intangible structure of relational reasoning that consists of positioning, justification, and persuasion. Particularly, it is mpotntto understand the extent to which thy are linked to each ther to present  position on isus that matter in a particular time and space (positioning), justify the logic of the author's claims (justification), and persuade the audience to accept them (persuasion). The abstract concetual model doe not offr definite criteria for ealuating apropriate aruments; rather, it opens up multifaceted ways to make arguments. As Mitchell (200) noted, disciplines practices, forms, rhetorical strategies, genres, and content could determine what worked or did not work as arguments. Thus it is imperative to note that writers must have the freedom to shift the structural elements as long as they adhere to a contained logic of the writing that is intenal, rather than adhering to an external logic based on a prescriptive template' (Schneer, 2014, p. 634).

# 4. Discussion and conclusions

In this conceptual review, the author synthesized previous studies of argumentative writing from two research perspectives: EGAP and ESAP. This synthesis will erve as a springboard for dialogue between the two perspectives and contribute to forming the theoretical foundations for the improvement of EAP practices, especially in presenting options that teachers may have previously ben unaware of. This wil ultimately empower teachers to move beyond the constraints of a structure-oriented understanding of argu. mentative writing and help learners navigate the demands of higher education.

The application of the EGAP perspective has enabled researchers to identify the linguistic, syntactic, discourse, and structural features of argumentative writing. Its most important contribution is a clear illustration of the fundamental cognitive and linguistic skills necessary for effctive argumentatio. In several discilines and everyday problems and dispute, people must ofte deal with statements that may be true or that they believe to be true, but may not be asolutely true. Given the discussion presented in the paper, we must ask, \*What can count as logic in argument?" (Hillocks, 2011, p. xvii. If an argument call for logi, and if educators are responsible for teaching this logic to students, then there must be an answer to this question. The EGAP perspective creates explicit roadmaps for what argumentative skills are, how they are learned, and how to scaffold students' argumentation.

However, a limitation of this perspective is that argumentative texts are prescriptive and formulaic, and they overlook the complexity of the social contexts involved inargumentative writing. Specifial, this perspective may not fully consider the ffects of the complex intersection of multiple social factors within a particular discourse culture , purpose topic, task type, gere, audience, and the writer-reader relationship) on the quality of the argumentative texts. The conceptual review suggests that the ESAP perspective complements these limitations by providing an in-depth description of the reality of disciplinary communities where a broad range of social practices exist for engaging in arguments. This perspective highlights the dialogical nature of argumentation (Tardy, 2012): aguments do not exist naturally in a static manner but are rather socially and culturally constructed. Therefore, arguments are not necessarily just about rasoning and logi, as i often described in the five-paragraph essy formula in commercial textbooks. Rather, they are concerned with the writers gentive meaning-making choices to build social relationships with their au. diences in a particular literacy event. This means that people make many different types of arguments that all for different kinds of evidence depending on the nature of the case. This point was echoed in Toulmin's (2003) classic analysis of justificatory arguments: the \*conclusions we come to, the assertations we put forward, willbe of very different kinds, ccording to the nature of the problem" (p. 12). The ESAP perspective demonstrates that such meaning-making attempts are realized by both the discursive and non-discursive features chosen by writers.

It i important to note that considering argumentative writing as a social practice does not negate the importance of the cognitive and lingustic ailities of argmentation. The later approachi crucial, especiall for scaffolding novice2 writers who are unfamiliar with argumentative essays and face challenges in learning to write arguments in their target language. However, given that existing studies in the EGAP domain tend to deal with the surface structure of the arguments, future studies must go beyond form-oriented approaches and explore factors that affect the argument's quality--namely, the soundness of arguments, which can be determined based on the cceptability of a proposition (i.e., the degree to which we have good reasons to believe that the roposition iscorrect) and the relevance of a propositio (i.., \*the degreeto which we have good reasons to belie that the proposition, if it were correct, would be effctive in achieving is ams) (Backman et al., 2023, p. 561, italics in origial). This insight enables reearchers to analyze the quality of L2 writers arguments in a specific context rather than evaluate arguments surface structure based on a predefined model or a priori rubric. This insight also has the potential to improve the educational asessment and instruction of student arguments as it provides the epistemic criteria for argument quality. Backman et al. (2023) recently proposed a novel framework, the rational force model (RFM), which focuses on the aceptability and relevance of an argument's elements in achieving the essay's rhetorical goals. For teachers, using the assessment criteria such as RFM with cognitive strategy instruction to develop students'strategic thinking and analytical reasoning skill (ooth Olson et l., 2023; VanDerHeide, Newell & Wynhoff lsen, 2023) could help enhance their understanding of argumentation and revise their instructional practices. This approach wil become increasingly important in the 21st century, as people's arguments often take place in echo chambers that lead them to draw on the same set of biased sources and interacting with a singular audience.

Regardless of the students, rearchers and educators need to ask, For what and for whom is teaching and leaning argumentative writing meant?" If one of the instructional goal is to expand L2 learners' agentive meaning-making choices or nurture writer agency (Canagarajah, 2013; Rinnert et al., 2015), then what is the role of arguments in writer development? How do we teach the target language while supporting the students to become empowered arguers? Such questions could serve as a springboard for educators to move beyond form/structure-oriented constraints and toward viewing language as meaningful and personal, creating conditions for students' agentic engagement, and designing prompts and tasks worth arguing for in real-world setings. Additionall, this insight encourages researchers to go beyond a one-off research activity and reconsider the value of researcher-led writing prompts and essay-writing rubrics of high-stakes language tests that do not sess the qualit of the entire argument. This enables researchers to dismantle reductive perspectives on what L2 writers cannot do and instead explore what they cando in their argumentation. This is an important epistemological standpoint in a \*multilingual turn'\* (Ortega, 2017) of L2 studies\*meaning-making is not just a matter of language signs but of complex multimodal semiotic resources' (Ortega, 2019, p. 28).

In conclusion, this conceptual review suggests that the study of argumentation in higher education settings must be multidi. mensional, encouraging researchers and educators to learn from both perspectives to expand their choices and adopt \*integrative strategies" (Maharg, 200, p. 86) depending on the context. Future research must include holistic approaches to explore the argument quality of L2 learners in a meaningful context rather than trying to identify patterns in their argumentation or ascertain whether certain inguistic or elemental feres are rst in dcontxtualize, deprsonalized, unauthentic, and reearcher-led settings. From a pedagogical perspective, future studies may reconsider the role of argumentation as a heuristic tool for students to produce written work and reflect on and deepen their thinking about the increasingly complex and diverse world in the 21st century.
