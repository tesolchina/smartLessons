# Abstract

This paper investigates the nature of texts produced for assessment at the highest level of advanced academic literacy: PhD theses. Eight theses from within a single department (Agricultural Botany) at a British university are the subject of study, and the contexts in which these texts were written are investigated through interviews with the supervisors. The notion of a genre of the PhD thesis is problematized and it is argued that a genre-analytic approach can be highly generative. Finally, the ways that the writers manipulate focus and position within their texts is explored through an investigation of citation practices in the theses.

# 1. Introduction

In recent years there has been a small but noticeable increase in the number of EAP studies of texts representative of advanced academic literacy practices: doctoral theses and Masters dissertations. The different organizational structures of PhD theses have been described by Thompson (1999) and Ridley (2000). Case studies have been conducted, on individual students developing their theses and learning to adjust to the expectations of their supervisors (Dudley-Evans, 1991; James, 1984), while Dong (1998) presents a set of self-reports by non-native speaker students on their experiences of learning the conventions of dissertation writing. Particular sections of theses have been studied by Bunton (1998) who analysed the rhetorical moves within the Introduction and Conclusion chapters of PhD theses, and identified a different set of moves compared to those used in research articles. Charles (2003) has investigated aspects of stance in the writing of Materials Science and Politics thesis writers and the ways that writers in these disciplines construct themselves within their texts.

The increase in interest in PhD theses can be attributed to a number of reasons. Firstly, analysts of academic texts have extended their concerns from texts produced for student writers (textbooks) and texts produced by expert writers (journal articles) so that attention is also paid to student-generated text. Secondly, there are now far greater numbers of students studying for doctorates. In the UK, the numbers of doctorates awarded in 2002 was 10,660, compared with a figure of almost half that amount (7559) in $1 9 9 5 ^ { 1 }$ ; it is difficult to determine exactly what number of those graduands were students for whom English was not their first language, but it is clear that the need for in-sessional English language support for international students has grown substantially, and also the need for better understanding of the writing challenges faced by these students.

What has been established to date is that there is variation between disciplines in terms of the macrostructures of the theses produced, and the ways that writers position themselves in their texts. Furthermore, there are differences between research articles and theses, in the moves that are made in different rhetorical sections, and in the greater use of metadiscourse in theses.

In this paper, I focus on variation in macrostructure and in citation practices within a single discipline. The data are a corpus of 8 theses written by native speaker students at the University of Reading and completed during the period 1989–1997, in a single department, Agricultural Botany.

The first half of this paper consists of:

an investigation of the contexts of situation and of culture in which the texts were produced, based on a set of interviews with supervisors, with an outline of two models for organisation of a thesis in Agricultural Botany, and   
† a discussion of how the notion of genre can assist in the description of the texts in the corpus.

The purpose is to contextualise the texts that are to be analysed, and the purposes and research paradigms that the researchers follow. In the second half, attention is given to the texts themselves, with a focus on citation practices within different sections of the theses, and the ways that issues of focus and of position constrain the rhetorical choices available to the writers of these texts.

The discussion relates to current practices in the UK, and more specifically to the practices in one UK university. It is recognised that in other countries, doctoral research work is subject to different traditions, and notions of what constitutes an acceptable thesis will vary from country to country.

# 2. Context

The average length of a thesis in the corpus used (hereafter called RAgBot) is 31,000 words, excluding appendices and bibliographies. In comparison to other theses held in the larger Reading Academic Text corpus from other areas (Agricultural Economics 63,000 and History 85,000), the Agricultural Botany theses are short.

A useful distinction can be drawn between experimental research work in Agricultural Botany that is primarily laboratory-based and experimental research work conducted under field conditions: the former tends to be reported in shorter texts (the two shortest texts—14,770 and 18,450—are both lab-based studies). Epistemological differences also exist between experimental research conducted in a laboratory and that done in the field: the laboratory researcher conducts experiments in which the variables are typically tightly controlled, and under conditions which are at least theoretically replicable, while the field worker collects data in conditions that cannot be wholly controlled, and in which the status of findings must retain an element of provisionality. A note of caution should be attached to this distinction, however; there are also laboratory-based studies in which the theoretical underpinnings and/or the methodologies used are less established, such as in the investigation of genome mapping of different crops, and this can lead to a higher level of speculation in the discussion of results, and to considerably longer texts (see figures for TAB-002 and TAB- $0 0 5 ^ { 2 }$ in Table 1).

Before turning to analysis of the texts produced for examination, it is necessary to explain something of the contexts of situation and of culture in which these texts were produced. The following is based on a set of interviews conducted with four of the supervisors of theses included in the RAgBot corpus. These interviews investigated faculty perceptions of the process of doctoral research, the purposes of such research, the nature of the thesis in each field of study, and questions of audience and organisation.

All four supervisors stressed that the PhD research process provides a training in:

1 research techniques and the management of a major research project, leading to an ability to work independently, and 2 logical enquiry and the effective communication of one’s work through writing.

Of the eight students, six had been employed by the department as Research Assistants on large-scale research projects, with predefined objectives. The situation is typical of postgraduate research programmes in the natural sciences as described by O’Brien, (1995, p. 9): “doctoral students contribute to a cumulative development of knowledge, in a predominantly collaborative enterprise”. The remaining two students were already employed in industry and they funded their own studies, with the support of their companies. They had chosen the subject of their doctoral research themselves. Information on the background of the theses is shown in Table 1, along with information on word counts and whether the research was primarily laboratory or field-based.

According to the supervisors, the fundamental nature of a thesis in Agricultural Botany is that of a report. The emphasis is on the work that has been done in the laboratory or field, and the information gained should be presented clearly and economically. As one supervisor put it, the thesis is “the lens through which the research work is seen.”

When asked about the audience for the thesis, all four supervisors stated that the thesis should be addressed to fellow researchers who are interested in the broad research area, on a level of parity and they felt that the thesis should definitely not be written solely for the supervisor, nor the examiner, as the ability to communicate one’s research to a wide audience is essential to scientific research practice. As the thesis writers tend to be members of a research project team in the department, their texts are likely to be read by fellow doctoral students too.

All four supervisors described the conventional format of writing in their discipline as the IMRD structure, with two patterns of organization: simple and complex. The simple four chapter pattern was only used by one of the writers (the text is one of the shortest and is also the oldest—1990), while the complex pattern was used by seven others. In the complex pattern, the thesis begins with an Introduction, and an optional description of “General Materials and Methods,” depending on whether a core set of materials and methods was used for most of the experiments reported. The IMRD pattern is recursive in each following chapter, with each section obligatory. A chapter reports a set of experiments, or, in some cases, more than one set of experiments, resulting in more than one IMRD cycle within the chapter.

One supervisor mentioned that two of his colleagues specialized in computer modelling of plant-soil interactions, and that the report of this kind of research would probably lead to a different macrostructure, as the bulk of the thesis would involve development of the model. Model development theses in Agricultural Economics have been remarked as having a macrostructure of “Introduction-TheoryModel-Data-Application-Evaluation” (Thompson, 2001), in which Theory constitutes by far the longest section. As there were no examples of such research in the corpus, no further discussion is made here, but the possibility that different macrostructures are used in Agricultural Botany theses, other than those shown here, should be noted.

# 3. Thesis as genre

To what extent is it useful to talk of a genre of the PhD thesis? As stated in the Introduction, studies to date have identified considerable variation between disciplines in the macrostructure, in the rhetorical purposes, and in the ways that writers position themselves within the texts known as PhD theses. Rather than pursue the concept of a single prototypical exponent of a thesis genre, which appears impossible, it is more productive to consider what insights notions of genre afford us in our descriptive analyses of PhD theses.

A fundamental element of current conceptualization of genre is that genres are about social action; genres are “how things get done, when language is used to accomplish them” (Martin, 1985, p. 250). A genre, following Miller (1994), develops from the repeated performance of similar communicative events. Repetition of actions leads to conventionalization, which serves at least two purposes:

† to regulate social interaction, and   
† to simplify the communicative event by setting up expectations of how the event will proceed, and by providing the actors with ready-made forms.

Genres are thus based in the societies that develop them and need to be learned by individuals who aspire to be accepted into the society, or at least to the extent that they can engage with the community. Furthermore, for different genres there are different degrees of tolerance of variation within the genre. For the novice, learning a new genre involves learning what it is acceptable to say, in what order, and the rhetorical options it is possible to consider in the circumstances. Freadman (1994) uses the metaphor of the rules of etiquette to describe the rules of a genre, implying that the rules are not immutable, and that they depend on social norms. The norms derive from social interactions at a range of levels—the general culture (for example, the scientific community at large), the local culture (the university department, and at another level, the laboratory, in the case of a science discipline), and the interplay between different levels.

If genres develop through the repetition of communicative events, we would expect that members of the community would have exposure to exemplary texts, or the conventions of the genre. In the case of the PhD, however, it is difficult to see that people do have much experience of exemplar texts. The reading that students do is likely to be of articles (addressed to a different audience), and most students will only ever write one thesis. Compared to article writing, where writers have easy access to examples of the genre, and may well write several articles in their career, it can be argued that the thesis, to the extent that it can be called a genre at all, is peculiar, and it is subject to considerable diversity between disciplines, and also within disciplines.

For example, the Agricultural Botany field worker may well be aware that his or her research cannot be replicated (the conditions are unique), and that therefore the suppression of the first person pronoun is not necessary. One of the supervisors interviewed stated that he encouraged his doctoral students to use $I$ for this very reason.

Laboratory work, on the other hand, with its control of variables, aims to produce results that can be replicated and therefore uses what Geertz (1983) terms a “writer-evacuated” style. The choice to use, or suppress, the first person pronoun in scientific writing is therefore constrained to a degree by the nature of the enquiry being reported.

Each writer brings experience of being a writer and a reader of other texts, and other genres to the task of writing a thesis, and the process of writing involves negotiation between the writer and the supervisor as to what can be carried over from previous writing experiences and what must be reformulated. One Agricultural Botany writer stood out from the others by the use of bullet point list summaries at the end of each chapter. The supervisor commented that the writer did not have a background in crop ecology before beginning the PhD and had acquired the custom of using bullet point summaries at the end of each chapter from her master’s level study in a different discipline. As supervisor, he perceived the peculiarity of the practice, but he also recognized its value and was prepared to accept it.

In another of the theses in Agricultural Botany, the negotiation of acceptability was more complex. The writer had worked for many years in an industrial organisation and his responsibility was to research and evaluate different methods for cultivating potatoes under a range of conditions. His work required him to write reports which would present results and implications relatively unequivocally. While this direct statement of the implication of findings was suitable for the workplace audience, it was not deemed appropriate for the discussions of findings required in his doctoral thesis, and his supervisor had to ask him several times to revise his discussion and conclusions sections so that there would be more qualification of statements, and also greater discussion of wider issues.

# 4. Citation practices in thesis writing

The writer of a thesis needs to successfully construct a coherent text, and an appropriate persona within that text, for the thesis be adjudged worthy of the award of a doctorate. The writer has to be able to convey a tone of authority, to persuade the examiners of their expertise and knowledge of the subject, while at the same time showing an appropriate awareness of the conventions and culture of their communities of practice. One means of understanding how writers construct their theses is to examine how they build their own thesis upon the texts of others, through analysis of their uses of citation.

In academic text, two basic types of citation can be distinguished: the integral and the non-integral (Swales, 1990, p. 141). An integral citation is placed within the sentence and plays an explicit role within the syntax of the sentence, while the non-integral citation is typically placed outside the sentence in parentheses, and can function:

as an attribution of the source of the proposition presented in the sentence as a reference to a text where further information can be found as an indication of the origin of a theory, technique or product as an identification of particular studies or texts alluded to in the sentence

The distinction between integral and non-integral is primarily formal, but there is also a functional aspect. A writer can choose either:

† to place focus on the researcher, the cited text, or the piece of research by including the citation in the sentence (integral), or   
† to emphasize the proposition (the finding, or the concept, for example), and deemphasize the researcher/text/piece of research by placing the citation outside the sentence (non-integral).

Weissberg and Buker (1990) describe these two types as “author prominent” and “information prominent”.

The roles of citations and the preferences shown for particular types are exemplified in the following three sections. In the first, we look at the Introduction chapter of one thesis, and note the types of citation used at different points of the chapter, observing the relation of citation type to rhetorical purpose. In the second, the uses of citation within a full IMRD chapter are presented, and, finally, in the third section, a Conclusions chapter is reviewed, with a discussion of the ways that the writer positions himself at the end of his thesis in relation to previous literature. The first example is chosen as it is a carefully crafted chapter, recommended by the supervisor as a well-written text, the second chosen because it has the highest level of density of citation in an IMRD chapter and is of average length, while the third was chosen as it is an example of a short thesis, which contrasts with the longer texts as the rhetorical needs are different.

The discussion that follows demonstrates both elements of typicality amongst theses in Agricultural Botany, and also of particularity in the texts of individual writers, or of writers in particular areas of research. The citation practices illustrate both the general tendencies within the discipline, within theses as a whole and also within different sections of theses, but they also reveal differences according to content, to writer and to local rhetorical considerations.

# 4.1. Introduction: TAB-005

The Introduction chapter in an Agricultural Botany thesis typically summarises what is known about the subject of the research, then identifies a gap in the current state of knowledge, subsequently establishing the niche for the current set of studies. TAB-005 starts off with an account of the history and distribution of two banana leaf diseases, which are identified as having serious economic consequences for bananagrowing countries. This is followed by sections on the symptoms, economic importance, epidemiology and control of the diseases. Throughout the sections, there is dense citation, with approximately half the sentences carrying a citation. The most common type of citation is non-integral, with the proposition (what is known) attributed to a source:

(1) Streaks usually appear 14–21 days after inoculation, first along the left margin of the leaf (Stover, 1987)

There is also frequent use of the non-integral citation type, which allows the writer to focus attention on the information in the sentence rather than to the person that made the observation:

(2) A similar situation where pathogenic variability in M. musicola appears to be related to altitude has also been observed in Colombia and Costa Rica (Merchan, 1990).

In this example, the writer could have placed the name of the researcher in the sentence itself (for example, “Merchan 1990 observed a similar situation .”), but chose not to do so. Where the name of the researcher is introduced into the sentence, the preference is for passive voice, so that the particular topic is thematised, and the researchers, or texts that provide the relevant information are in rheme position. The citation form, thus, gives prominence to the information rather than the researchers:

(3) Chemical control of Sigatoka up to the early 1970s has been described by Meredith (1970), Stover (1971a; 1972a), Wardlaw (1972), Long (1973) and most recently by Stover (1990)..

In the final thirteen paragraphs of the chapter, when the writer summarises the research needs, presents the research design, and then outlines the thesis, citations are no longer needed. The three citations that do appear refer to other groups of researchers who have developed new methods, which have been highly important in the approach taken in the current work:

(4) Two groups published similar work almost simultaneously. One group described genetic mapping applications and called the new assay RAPD analysis, for random amplification of polymorphic DNA (Williams, et al., 1990), and the other group focused on genome fingerprinting and called their assay AP-PCR for arbitrarily-primed PCR (Welsh and McClelland, 1990).

The relegation of the names to a position within parentheses allows attention to rest on the method rather than the people involved.

The picture deriving from this brief description of the uses of citation in the first chapter of TAB-005 indicates that non-integral citation is typical, with heavy use of citations of the Source type to act as attributions of the source of a fact or a proposition. The focus is placed on what is known, primarily, and on methods and findings. It should be noted, however, that the profile of citation use in each of the eight theses in the sub-corpus shows considerable variation, as can be seen in Fig. 1. Integral citations are markedly common in TAB-008, and relatively common in TAB004, both theses that report experiments in field conditions and which contain numerous reports of similar studies conducted on different types of plants. While the general tendency in Agricultural Botany is towards the use of non-integral citation, there are, at the same time, exceptions to the tendency.

# 4.2. A complete IMRD chapter: TAB-002

As stated above (Section 2), a common macrostructure for a thesis in the RAgBot corpus is a recursive IMRD pattern: the thesis begins with an introductory chapter, and then consists of a set of chapters, each of which contains at least one IMRD cycle, and then the thesis concludes with a summary chapter. In this section, we turn to a discussion of the citation types used in a single chapter in one of the theses, TAB-002, and examine the characteristic uses of citations in each of the four rhetorical sections: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion.

The Introduction section typically contains a review of the literature that relates to the particular set of experiments described in that chapter. In Chapter 4 of TAB-002, the use of RFLPs as a methodology to estimate genetic distance between inbred lines of sunflower is tested. The writer summarises what uses of this methodology by previous researchers have revealed about different plants and also what the methodology is, and why it is used. Names for methods, for theories or for phenomena are attributed to the originator:

(5) Heterosis (Shull, 1914) or hybrid vigour (Shull 1908, 1911; East 1908) is said to have occurred when the offspring of a cross exhibits a quantitative trait of higher value than either of the parental lines.

Compared to TAB-005, there is much more foregrounding of the names of researchers, as in:

(6) Numerous studies have now been carried out in maize to test this theory, but the results have been contradictory. Lee et al. (1989) and Smith et al. (1990) both reported a close association between hybrid performance and GD based on RFLP data. Conversely, Godshalk et al. (1990) and Melchinger et al. (1990) concluded that RFLPs are of limited value in predicting heterosis.

The reason for this difference is that the writer is comparing the findings of different studies. In the first sentence, “numerous studies” is in theme position, and thus the names of the studies are placed in theme position in the following sentence. The integral citation sentences in this case are also examples which support a general observation and this is a frequent pattern in TAB-002, as in the following:

(7) RFLPs are ideal markers for germplasm identification, as they meet all these criteria for inbred crops. For example, Evola et al. (1986) showed that maize RFLP markers were stably inherited over a number of generations and Beckmann and Soller (1983) demonstrated the discriminatory power of RFLPs by calculating that the probability of distinguishing 20 inbreds from each other was 0.99, when considering only 2 alleles at 20 loci occurring with a frequency of 0.5.

The findings of previous studies are used here as evidence to support the general statement in the first sentence. We may note also the use of past/active in these reports of findings, which fits with the observations of Malcolm (1987) that generalizations are stated in the present tense, and reports of specific experiments are in the past simple. Malcolm remarked of the present perfect that it tends to be used in general reports of work in a field of enquiry and we find an example of this in TAB-002:

(8) Molecular phylogenies have now been constructed for a number of genera including Brassica (Song et al. 1988), Lycopersicon (Miller and Tanksley, 1990b), Solanum (Debener et d), Helianthus (Gentzbittel et al. 1992) and Beta (Jung et al. 1993).

This is a common pattern of reference in theses which report a number of studies on different plants. The citation type used is the identification one (because the citations identify the agent for the verb “construct”) and the use of Identification citations is common in these listings of the different studies. The advantage of this form of citation is that it is economical—a single main clause conveys a large amount of information, and this is typical of the condensed style of writing that is used in the most of the Agricultural Botany theses.

In the Methods section, the materials and methods for the analyses that were made are described, in three paragraphs. There is a single Origin citation (to indicate the creator of a software program) and one Reference citation (to explain where further information on a particular method can be found), features typical in Methods sections.

In the Results section, there are six paragraphs, and only two citations. One is a Reference type citation, again referring the reader to another text to find further details of a technique, and the second is a Source citation which acts as a warrant for a causal explanation (“these heterozygotes’ may be due to a mixture of alternate fixed alleles as seen in rice inbreds [Wang and Tanksley, 1989]”).

The Discussion section is dense with citations as the writer places the findings of his analyses within the research literature. The majority of the citations are Source and Identification, although variation is provided by the occasional use of integral citations, as in:

Table 2 Citation density figures (per 1,000 words) for the four main rhetorical sections of chapters in the RAgBot theses   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Section</td><td>Density (per 1000 words)</td><td>Most common types of citation</td></tr><tr><td>Introduction</td><td>15.6</td><td>Source, Identification, Integral (verb controlling)</td></tr><tr><td>Methods</td><td>2.3</td><td>Reference, Origin</td></tr><tr><td>Results</td><td>2.4</td><td>Source (52%)</td></tr><tr><td>Discussion</td><td>10.1</td><td>Source, Identification, Integral (verb controlling)</td></tr></table></body></html>

(9) A recent study by Tersac et al. (1994) also showed .

This example appears in the final paragraph of the chapter, and refers to a study which reported similar findings to those of the writer. In general, though, we notice that the writer prefers to focus attention on the information rather than on the author or researcher.

It has been shown in this analysis of citations in a single chapter that the citations are concentrated in two sections (Introduction and Discussion) and this can be seen to typical of the RAgBot theses as a whole, as indicated in Table 2. Citation density is highest in the Introduction sections, and very low in Methods and Results sections, with a strong tendency to use Reference and Origin types in the Methods section.

It could be argued that these patterns of citation type use in PhD thesis writing are the same as they are in experimental research papers written for publication in international journals. The fifth chapter of TAB-009 is an unedited reproduction of an article that the writer had had published in the Annals of Applied Biology. Unsurprisingly, there are references to studies that have already been established in the thesis, but which are repeated because they were necessary in the chapter as a separate article. The dispersion of citations in the four sections of IMR and D is typical, with the greatest density in the introduction and no references in either the Methods or Results sections. One difference in the chapter, however, is in the perceived audience: three indications of the implications of the research findings for crop growers are made (the word ‘growers’ appears three times in this chapter, and only twice in all the other five chapters). Overall, however, there is little evidence to suggest that a single IMRD chapter in a thesis differs from a journal article in its use of citations and the citation types employed.

# 4.3. Conclusions: TAB-007

While the intermediate chapters in an Agricultural Botany thesis generally replicate the macrostructure of research articles (IMRD), the opening and closing chapters are particular to the thesis. The conventional sections of a thesis conclusion are:

† Introductory restatement of aims, research questions;   
† Consolidation of present research (e.g., findings, limitations);

![](img/557538edda364448ea4a860b0fb63fefd29b44ce258ef0616dd8d72a8af17ed9.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Graph showing citation density per chapter in each of the RAgBot theses.

† Practical applications/implications; and † Recommendations for future research

A thesis is a long text and the restatement of the aims and questions is a necessary reminder to the reader, several chapters on, of what the starting point of the research was. The concluding chapter is also an evaluation of the whole research project. This evaluation is strategically important as two of the targeted readers are also evaluating the project, to determine whether the writer is worthy of a doctorate. In the concluding chapter, therefore, the task of the writer is to point out what his/her achievements have been, and to forestall criticisms by identifying the limitations of the research.

Typically, the final chapter contains an increased level of citation relative to the chapters immediately preceding it in the thesis, as can be seen in Fig. 2. In the figure, the leftmost side of each graph shows the density in the first chapter and the rightmost that for the final chapter.

It should be stressed, however, that there is considerable variation in the density of citations in the Conclusions chapters, between theses in the sub-corpus, as can be seen in Fig. 3 below.

Though the final chapter of TAB-007 is actually titled “Discussion,” it functions as a concluding chapter. As noted, the final chapter of an Agricultural Botany thesis, like the final section of an IMRD paper, has a high density of citations, comparable to the number of citations in the Introduction section. In TAB-007, these are predominantly non-integral citations (29 out of 37 citations), and the Source type is once again the most common.

In this chapter the writer reviews the current state of knowledge of the subject of the thesis, the enzyme ACC oxidase. The main purpose is to state the problems that have not been resolved yet, both those that were recognised before, and those that have been identified by the writer’s research. It is interesting to note that there are few references to what the present set of studies have achieved other than this single example:

(10) In support of this proposal it has already been shown (Chapter 2) that the hydroxamate containing salicylhydroxamic acid is a potent inhibitor of ACC oxidase.

Fig. 3. Citation density in Conclusions chapters of the RAgBot theses and relative density of citation types. \*Figures are adjusted to show the number of citations per 10,000 words.

Typically, thesis writers begin their concluding chapter with a summary of the previous chapters, and highlight the main findings of their own work. In this thesis, however, as in TAB-001, the other notably short thesis, the writer presumably considers that the main findings of the research do not require recapitulation because the text is not excessively long. Readers are expected to recognize and remember what the main findings have been. Here the emphasis is, instead, on what is known about the enzyme and what remains to be investigated. In the following example, the first two sentences present the current state of knowledge, with typical Source citations as attributions for the origin of the information:

(11) A number of enzymes, are susceptible to inhibition by hydroxamate containing compounds, which may have several modes of action (Rich et al., 1978). In particular, hydroxamates have a high affinity for metal ions, especially $\mathrm { F e } 3 +$ (Rich et al., 1978) .

Our understanding of ACC oxidase is still expanding, and the absence of an undiscovered cofactor could account for the inactivation observed . obviously considerably more work must be completed to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the inactivation of ACC oxidase observed.

The tone of the latter sentences is interesting. In choosing to talk of “our understanding”, the writer is suggesting a shared position, in a research community, with the reader. This is then strengthened by the use of the “obviously,” which implies that the writer is forestalling the reader’s reaction, and is able to, through a shared understanding. This confident show of membership in the research community demonstrates that the writer is addressing a readership of fellow researchers, which supports the observations by the supervisors (see Section 2 above) that theses in Agricultural Botany should be written for the research community, rather than for the examiners, and should be written in a tone of parity.

The writer of TAB-007 is exceptionally assured in his tone, but other writers adopt a more cautious tone. In this extract from TAB-005, the writer mitigates the force of a rejection of another researcher’s hypothesis by the inclusion of a hedging catenative (“tend to.”):

(12) Although these results do not explain the precise means of this introduction, they tend to refute the hypothesis put forward by Buddenhagen (1987) that M. fijiensis arose in Honduras due to mutation .

The writer in this case has chosen to weaken the force of her criticism through the use of a hedge, which can be interpreted as a form of politeness, the avoidance of a direct facethreatening act.

An important move for several of these writers is to indicate how their findings relate to those of previous researchers, as in the following extract from TAB-003:

(13) Work carried out within this study shows a consistent increase in botanical richness with modest reductions in nitrogen fertiliser supporting the findings of Pysek and Leps (1991), who propose that significant changes in the weed community are evident with nitrogen rate. Similar observations have been made by Wilson et al. (1990) and Tilman (1982).

While the writer of TAB-007 assumes the role of confident member of a specialised research community, and TAB-005 shows consideration for the face of fellow researchers, the writer of TAB-003 takes a position of relative parity with previous researchers in the field, by implication. It would be tempting to speculate on the reasons for these differences by reference to the background of each writer in terms of whether they belonged to an industrial research project team (TAB-007), or an academic team (TAB-005), or by whether they were engaged in field work rather than laboratory work (TAB-003), but it should be recognised that there are most likely many other factors that contribute to these differences, and which lie beyond the scope of this paper.

# 5. Conclusions

This paper has investigated features of texts produced at an advanced stage of academic literacy, and the contexts of production (and reception) of such texts. The concept of a genre of the PhD thesis was problematized, and it was observed that texts produced under the name of thesis are usually the result of a negotiation of practice, convention and expectations between the writer, the supervisor and other readers of the text in its formative stages. Writers are likely to be seeking to position themselves in relation to members of the research community, as they perceive them, and this is most evident in the Conclusions chapter. How they position themselves varies from writer to writer, with varying degrees of confidence, or consideration for face, expressed.

The theses analysed were from a single department at the University of Reading. While many of the observations help to characterise writing in an applied life science (the tendency, for example, to focus on findings and methods rather than on researchers and the texts they produce), it has also been proposed that a distinction between work that is conducted in the laboratory and work conducted in the field is productive as the rhetorical choices available to writers vary according to the epistemological frameworks within which research is conducted.

A first step towards the analysis of a complete text is to identify its macrostructure. In the case of PhD theses in Agricultural Botany, two models of macrostructure have been observed: the simple and complex IMRD frameworks. The identification of these patterns was then shown to be useful for a study of rhetorical features of thesis writing, in that certain practices were typical of each of the IMRD sections. In the case of citations, reference to other texts is most common in Introduction and Discussion sections, with relatively little positioning of the writer in relation to other texts in the Methods and Results sections. In the Introduction and Discussion sections, the tendency is to use nonintegral citation types with a focus on information rather than the researchers. Some writers integrate the names of researchers into the syntax of the sentence, particularly in cases where comparisons of a number of studies are made. The choice of citation type is influenced by this and other rhetorical considerations, including the preferred themerheme relations in a series of sentences.

Learning how to make appropriate citations is a part of learning the ways of constructing and communicating knowledge in one’s disciplinary community (Hyland, 2000), and it has been shown here that the choice of a particular type of citation in any given context is dependent on rhetorical purpose. It has also been demonstrated that variation in approach and in epistemology exist within disciplines, which argues against reductive descriptions of how academic writers in a Agricultural Botany, for example, write-the picture is complex, and the teaching of advanced academic literacy requires sensitivity towards the contexts in which writers develop their texts. While it is possible, for example, to identify the use of non-integral citation types and the tendency to focus on findings/methods, as characteristic of agricultural botany thesis writing, it is also important to relate formal choices to rhetorical purposes, and it therefore seems logical to insist that students developing advanced academic literacy skills and strategies should be asked to view textual practices within contexts of production, and to combine text analysis with qualitative investigations of situation and culture. For the study of citation practices, this would mean that student writers should look not only at the formal features of citation types but should also consider the implications of different choices, both at a local level (the sentence and the paragraph) and also at a higher discoursal level (what to give prominence to, how to maintain the dominance of the authorial voice throughout the text, and how to position oneself in relation to the immediate audience and to the wider disciplinary community).
