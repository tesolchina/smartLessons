Writing book reviews provides novice scholars with the valuable experience of critical engagement with their field and the development of academic writing skills, but it also confronts them with rhetorical and publishing challenges. Given the enduring value of the genre and its potential importance in English for Research and Publication Purposes courses, we investigate how academics view their experience of publishing this genre. Based on in-depth interviews with fifteen Chinese scholars of varied professional status, we find that authors participate in writing book reviews early in their careers and appreciate the opportunities it offers to develop their academic writing, gain an appreciation of reader needs, become familiar with publication practices, and advance their careers. Concerns were raised, however, about the extent to which institutions value book reviews for advancement. Despite varying opinions, the respondents saw book reviews as affording them tangible gains, especially early in their careers, in writing for publication and learning disciplinary norms of communication. Thus the genre merits respect from institutions and a more central place in ERPP training programmes and postgraduate writing courses.

# 1. Introduction

Reviewing the work of others has been part of the academic landscape for almost 2000 years (Orteza y Ortezay Miranda, 1996) and today most international journals, especiall in the humanities and social sciences, devote section to book reviews. The genre eeks to acquaint readers with recent books and situate the discussion of these within the relevant literature in th fiel. It therefore not only functions to inform but also offers a critical evaluation, assting to construct, disseminate, and evaluate disciplinary knowledge (Hartley, 2006). The genre therefore plays an important role in supporting both the manufacture of knowledge and the social cohe. siveness of disciplinary communities.

While senior academics are believed to be the ideal authors of book reviews (Caanave & Li, 2023), novices, especially L2 cholars Often engage in this practice. However, lttle is known about why they take on this task and the challenges they encounter in doing so. In this study we therefore sek to addres this isue by exploring the motivations and experiences of junior L2 reearchersi China who have published book reviews and compare these with the perceptions of senior scholars. By doing so, we hope to shed light on the role of this genre in the academic iteracy development of novices and how this understanding might contribute to effctive pedagogy in English for Research and Publication Purposes (ERPP) courses.

# 2. Book reviews, publishing and academic writing

Ideally, reviews do more than summarise a book; they evaluate the contribution it makes to the field,situating it in the literature and interests of a discipline and pointing to particular strengths or weakness of its analyses. As a result, a good book review is "a crucial site of disciplinary engagement (Hyland, 2004, p. 41) which itelf ads to the literature of a topic. Numerous studies have therefore examined the linguistic and rhetorical features of book reviews (e.g. Ryshina-Pankova, 2011), underlining their disciplinary value. Some observers therefore fel that book reviews contribute more to the collectie good than individual credit (rienza, 2014) and see them as an important part of academic life (Brienza, 2015; Hartle, 2006), particularly in the softer disciplines where books play a major role.

Central to a successful book review are the rhetorical interactions by which writers add substance, interes, and personal connection to a disciplinary field. This is encapsulated by Tse and Hyland (2008, p. 1235):

book reviews do not simply respond to a general body of impersonal literature but offer a direct, public, and often critial, encounter with a particular text and its author. Interactions here are a key element of the discourse, balancing critique and collegiality to send clear signals of how the writer wishes to position him or herself in relation to his or her readers, target author and disciplinary community.

Thus book reviews require a degree of rhetorical investment which approaches that of research articles as they must contain :easoned arguments and present a knowledge of the field in a way which acknowledges both the sensibilities of the author and the expectations of readers.

Consequently, some observers advise novice scholars not to write book reviews, either because they are sen as not constituting \*impactful outputs in performance reviews (Henvile, 2020) or because they believe they are les able to write a review useful to readers (Kelsky, 2015). Casanave and Li (2023) therefore sugest that \*book reviews are best done by experienced teachers-researchers-writers in a field' (p. 150). Moreover, this is also a genre which has something of an image roblem' as a result of being seen as:

frequently brief, impressionistc, formulaic, bland, badly written, or, most distressing of al, nothing more than sales pitches or gratuitous hatchet jobs, ever so thinly disguised. (East, 2011, p. 52)

For these reasons, established academics tend to be preferred by book review editors but such people are often busy with teaching, research, administration, supervision, outreach and the other demands made on senior scholars. The task then often fals to research students and other novice academics. Supervisors often encourage their students to write reviews as an opportunity to publish something relatively small and manageable and to take advantage of an opportunity to participate, even peripherall, in disciplinary writing and publishing (Burgess 2021; Mur-Duenas, 2019). As Kamler (2008) argues, if students publish in their formatie years, they are more likely to do so as established academics" (p. 292), while Wats (2012) views writing for publication as part of doctoral research experience.

Junior cholars doubtless rfer to ublish artice and are often pressed to do so asrequirement for graduation, but the challenges of doing so are ften overwhelming (e.g. Luo & Hyland, 2019). For these writers, then, a book review is an opportunit to get their foot on the ladder and make a short, academic contribution with a relatively inflexible and easily mimicked structure which has a better than average chance of securing a publication in an international journal (Brienza, 2015).

Junior scholars also benefit from using and improving the writing and research skill they are developing as postgraduate students and gaining greater familirity with the relevant litrature. The opportunity to study a text thoroughly and to offer an opinion on it are crucial sklls and writing a ook review helps acculturate the writer into disciplinary practice. They also develop the skill to situate their own views more precisely in the discourse of their community (Sealey, 2015), a vital competence for novice and L2 writers (Mur-Dueas, 2019). Research also suggests that understanding how book reviews are written can contribute to more efective reading skills, because

awarenessof the generic textual structure and the rhetorical function of book reviews can foster more critical and effective reading practices in the selection of material among the overload of readings in university courses. (Motta-Roth, 1998, p. 31)

Perhaps equally important is the chance book reviews offr for novice writers to improve their genre awareness: how to express ideas and evaluations in ways which are insightful and appropriate, acquiring the knowledge to argue their viewpoints, signal their allegiances, and display their credibilit (Brienza, 2015; Ferris, 2019, Tardy, 2009). The experience can also provide novices with insights into both the constraints and opportunities for innovation in academic writing (Henville, 2020).

Overall, despite some scepticism in the literature regarding the participation of novice researchers in the genre, such writers are major contributors of the form, publishing a considerable number of reviews each year. Consequently, it i essential to understand the motivations, approaches, and perceptions of these writers towards such endeavours. This study explores these aspects through the voices of early-career L2 scholars, juxtaposing their insights with those of more experienced researchers. irst, we present our method and data.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants and interviews

To obtain the perspectives of L2 novice researchers, we interviewed five postgraduate students and five lecturers in applied linguistics across China, who indicated a willingness to participat following a WeChat recruitment campaign. To compare their views with those of senior scholars, we further recruited five professors in applied lingustics from across China. Half of those with doctoral degrees completed their theses in Chinese whereas the remainder were educated overseas. However, all the novice and senior par. ticipants were highly competent users of English, having passed the Test for English Majors Band 8 (roughly C2 in the Common European Framework).

Table 1 shows the participants' information. All had published at least one book review in English in an ssCI-indexed journal. including Jounal f Second Language Writing, Journal of English for Academic Purposes, English for Specific Purposes, Aplied Linguistics Language Testing, System, Translation Studies and Functions of Language. Informed consent was sought in writing) from all the participants prior to the data collection, and they were assured of anonymity.

The interview format could be described as refective, with the participants encouraged to answer at length and questions designed to elicit as much information as possble (Spradley, 2016). In this study we employed descriptive, structural and contrast questions (Flowerdew, 2005) to elicit and attest participants' emic perspectives and experiences of writing book reviews.

Descriptive questions were mostly semi-structured with open-ended prompts and involved a set of general areas for discussion (see Appendix). They aimed to provide a general view of the informants' perspectives on writing books reviews or more generall for research and publication purposes. Some were "grand tour' questions (Spradley, 2016) such as "Could you tell me about your experience of academic writing in English?" and How did you get to know about book reviews?", and participants were encouraged to give a general idea of what they felt appropriate about academic publishing and writing book reviews. Other types of \*grand tour" questions were more specific or worked to guide the participants through a specific descrition, for example, Please describe how you wrote a book review."

Structural questions followed up on descriptive questions for further elaboration when necessary. Examples were \*What do you think is the main diferencebetween book reviews and other academic genres?" and \*What other thins do you think you have gained by writing the book review?". They worked to provide more specific information and were adapted to each participant to test hypothesised categories, and to elicit examples to fit into these categories.

Contrast questions were also asked as a way to compare the responses of diffrent participants across interviews (Flowerdew, 2005). Contrast questions included, for example, "Some people we have interviewed have expressed reservations about writing book reviews because of changes in universty policies Do you agree?" and "Some people we have interviewed have said that the choice of a book makes no difference in the decision to write a book review. What is your view on this?

# 3.2. Data collection and analysis

We adopted a heuristic approach to data collection and analysis (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). Each participant was interviewed after an initial focus group discussion, with the novice and senior researchers interviewed separately. Both group and individual interviews were conducted online using the WeChat and mainly in Chinese the participants' mother tongue) for 45-60 min. The interviews were all digitlly recorded through voice messages, then transcribed verbatim and translated into English by the first author, before being checked for accuracy by each participant (Bll 1997). Diagrements were stled through icussion. The translated transcripts total 94,553 words, averaging 6303 words per interview. They were loaded onto thesoftware MAxQDA (VERBI Software, 2021), and sorted and re-sorted into themes. A theme represents a logically and situationally grounded construct that we identified as meaningful from the interviews, but which was not necessrily supported by frequency of mention. The aim was to look for both commonalities and differences among participants, moving from \*individual stories to common elements" (Hyland, 2013, p. 243.

Both authors coded and analysed the data independently, providing investigator triangulation to the analysis (Archibald, 2016) We started with the themes and the categories under each theme that arose from the intial se of descriptive questions. However, as we analysed the intrviews in greater depth, new themes and categories manfested themselves, hence the need for recoding. Out of a large set of categories, those judged to be the most interesting and relevant provided the framework for this paper as follows. Table 2 presents an example of category and themes identified in the transcribed data.

(1) Understanding of book reviews (2) Motivation for writing book reviews (3) Gains from writing book reviews (4) Reservation about writing book reviews

While analysing the transcripts, we approached some of the participants by WeChat for fllow-up information. We sent the drat interpretations of their interviews to the participants for comment to obtain participant verification (Ball, 1997). Allthe participants acknowledged reading the draft, and a number had specific comments on how it might be improved. Itbecame clear that for a number of participants the draft achieved a certain degree of catalytic validity (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). In other words, the interpretations developed an understanding among those studied which encouraged them to reassess the way they viewed the world.

# 3.3. Positionality statement

In conducting this research, we approached the interview process with an understanding of the potential impact that power dif ferences between researchers and participants could have on the integrity of the data. It is important to clarif that we, as researchers had no prior rlationship with the participants, so our interaction was limited to the context of the study itelf. This absence of a prior relationship meant there was no power difference between us and the participants beyond the roles of"researcher and \*articipant as defined by the study. We sought to maintain the most objective stance we could throughout the data collection process and gave participants every opportunity to correct our interpretations and check the transcriptions. We also conducted the interviews in a manner that emphasised respect,confidentialit, and the voluntary nature of participation, ensuring that participants fet comfortable to share their experiences and perspectives without any pressure or influence from us.

Throughout the research proces, we also remained reflective of our positions, constantly evaluating our approach to the interactions to mitigate any unintentional bias or influence. This reflexivity extended to our analysis and interpretation of the data. This commitment to ethical reearch practices and the objective collection and analysis of data underpins the credbility and validity of our study findings.

# 4. Findings

This section reports four main themes related to: i) the participants' understandings of book reviews, ii why they wrote them, i) what they felt they had gained by writing a review, and iv) the concerns and challenges they experienced. The most representative quotations were chosen from their responses to illustrate each of the four themes and to reveal the participants' perceptions and experiences of engaging in this genre.

# 4.1. Understanding of book reviews

All ten junior scholars, including the MA students, had a broad view of the genre and were able to discuss it in familia terms although some responses were brief. For example, book reviews are "short and concise (P6), \*relatively easy to publish" (P10) and strongly time-sensitive" (P4), whil "many journals set up a column on book reviews" (P15) and \*book reviews should diffr from journal to journal (P11). These views tend to expres a rather formulaic knowledge of the genre, perhaps acquired informally through colleagues, mentors or scanning journals, although few journals offer explicit statements on composing the genre.

Senior scholars were able to provide more elaborate responses on the proces of writing and on the rhetorical and subject-matter knowledge of writing them. This often took the form of seeing the book review as a strategic move in the widercareer game. P2, for example, a professor in translation with three published reviews to her name, commented on the low-threshold of publishing acceptance while P3 pointed to the likely different stylistic and rhetorical features required by journals.

"Book reviews are mainly introductory and brief, but more importantly, there is no external review, no peer review, so it is not very difficult to get our submission of book reviews accepted". (P2)

"Although almost al journals in our field has a book review section, they may have distinctive requirements and expectations on the shaping of book reviews'. (P3)

These responses indicate the greater awareness of senior academics with the publishing landscape, developed over longer engagement with it.

We also found that some participants, usually the senior group, had something to say about their rhetorical perceptions of book reviews. This awareness captures an understanding of the genre's intended purposes and an awareness of the dynamics of persuasion within a socio-rhetorical context" (Tardy, 2009, p. 21). For several writers this knowledge was quite sophisticated, allowing them to have a stronger grasp of the authorial positioning necessary to participate in the genre. These comments, for example, demonstrate an understanding of both the context and readers:

This is diffrent from writing a doctoral thesis. The people who read my thesis are focused and just a few, mainly supervisors and examiners, so writing is very specific with a clear purpose, like an examination'. (P6)

"Book reviews are normally for a wide range of readers, and who they are depends on the journal because some journals are theoretical while others are more practical'. (P1)

This understanding is crucial to a coherent and effective book review (Sealey, 2015), but our participants shared no firm consensus n their rhetorical features or content. Some novice researchers, for instance, saw the purpose as simply stting out the main ideas of the book:

"Book reviews have little inovative information, and what they present is a summary and reorganization of the book. The main points, I think". (P5)

Others, however, could recognise its important evaluative function:

"Reading a book with a critical attitude is important, because the book review editor normally wants to see critical insight rather than just a summary". (P12)

"A book review is not just an outline of a book's contents but a description and critical assessment of that book". (P10)

Despite the erences of opinion, l participants hd publishd reviews successfuly, so i ems that editors may apply differen criteria to the texts they accept for publication.

Overall, senior scholars were better able to recognise the broad rhetorical and subject-matter features of book reviews. Interest ingly, they also saw this genre understanding as strengthening their ability to write research articles:

"So when I wrote journal article, I found that having written book reviews was helpful, but they are not the same. They are two different tasks". (P2)

"I learnt a lot about academic criticism in writing book reviews and so it can play an important part in writing papers". (P3)

Thus the knowledge and experience gained in writing a book review provided useful rhetorical understandings which assted them to gain control of a number of key rhetorical skills required for publishing in more valued genres.

# 4.2. Motivations to write reviews

A writer's development of academic genre knowledge i a situated learning experience, offering novices a window on the discursive conventions of disciplinary practices. Welington (2010) refers to both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations for scholarly publication during doctoral candidature. Enhancing one's resume and profil, and achieving status and credibility in aresearch domain, are among the extrinsic motivations. Boosting self-confidence, gaining self-satisfaction, and developing and organizing ideas are some of the intrinsic ones. Authoring book reviews offrs writers the experience of writing for an unknown disciplinary audience and developing interpersonal and evaluative skills which might be transferable across genres. As a result, this is often an early rhetorical appren. ticeship for new scholars.

There are, however, both dangers and rewards of writing for publication as a junior scholar. Wats (2012), for example, points to the \*risk-laden" nature of writing for publication. We may see a book review, however, as a relatively low risk entry into academic publishing, so that many wrote their first book review early in their careers:

"in the first semester of my doctorial study'. (P5)

"during my overseas exchange of my PhD study". (P2)

"when I was about to graduate from my postgraduate study". (P10) or "in the first year after my PhD graduation'. (P6)

Therefore, authoring book reviews was frequently a formative writing experience for these scholars. The initial incentive to write reviews was varied among these participants. Some were approached by a journal and saw this as a mark of achievement in itself:

"I was pleased to receive the email from the editor to write a review of this new book in my area. This suggests that my research has been noticed. I think by this book review, I may strengthen my connection with the field even further'. (P10)

"It makes a difference that review editors contact me for a review, and this is totall different from proposing a review. Writing such an invited review, I believe, can help to promote my name and academic work, at least to the author of the book'" (P8)

Not ll were invited to submit a review, of course. One was guided by her supervisor as \*the first step in academic publishing (P14) and another heard the suggestion from a fellow student $^ { * * } \mathrm { X }$ told me about trying book reviews, and he got the idea from one of the. students in his office' (P6). In many cases, however, students discovered the opportunity for themselves:

"I noticed that book reviews are not usuall published by established scholars, but by PhD students or with the supervisors, soI thought writing this is also possible for me". (P11)

" received an email from a journal editor. He asked me if I could write a book review since I had been a peer reviewer for the journal. After reading the title and abstract of the book, I decided to do it'. (P10).

Beyond the invitation of journals and the encouragement of supervisors, our participants, from both novice and senior groups, revealed four issues they saw as central to encouraging them to publish book reviews.

i) To meet institutional requirements

A central concern among our participants is the pressure to publish. Like academics around the world, Chinese scholars se their careers "are increasingly tied to an abilit to gain acceptance for work in high-profil journals" (Hyland & Jiang, 2022, p. 55). P6 highlighted "coping with the university's staff ppraisal" when speaking of writing book reviews, and allparticipants agreed:

"We are under pressure from research appraisal. It's very stressful and one way out i to publish book reviews". (P7)

"New teachers at Chinese universities are enthusiastic but ineffective researchers, and this holds us back. After finishing my MA and joining [Xx] University as an English language teacher, I was required to publish articles in good journals. How to do this is a huge problem. Slow and uncertain, and writing book reviews gives me some hope'. (P4)

All noted that book reviews offered them a short-cut to recognised publication in university evaluation demands:

'It is quick to publish a book review, and they are recognised as outputs for promotion, so I was keen to do some". (P2 'I think postgraduate students usually base their choice of what and where to publish on the university's scholarship and graduation policies. I decided to write book reviews as it was more difficult for me to write research articles". (P12)

# ii) To gain subject knowledge

Participants have also pointed to the incentive that preparing a book review can spur themselves to read a book. It has been re. ported that academics \*no longer have time to read in depth more than a minute fraction of the literature in their own field" (Baveye, 2014, p.48). Therefore, by writing book reviews, participants are able to engage with newly published work in the field as mentioned by the participants working in translation and EAP.

"Because I have been researching the same topic as my PhD thesis, which is corpus-based translation studies, the books I reviewed wereall related to corpus-based translation or corpus stylistics, so writing book reviews helps to me to get access to the literature". (P2)

.We don't have time to search for new books and are not even aware when relevant books are published. So by working on a book review, we can read the book and gain knowledge of the most recent study in our field. It costs nothing". (P10)

ii) to gain rhetorical knowledge

As we noted above, these writers tended to recognise the broad rhetorical and subject-matter features of book reviews, and saw this genre knowledge as strengthening their ability to write research articles:

"So when I wrote journal article, I found writing book reviews was helpful in my academic writing, but they are not the same. They are two different tasks"'. (P2)

'In retrospect, I think writing book reviews was important to progress my academic writing skills'. (P6)

' learnt a lot about academic criticism in writing book reviews and so it can play an important part in academic writing". (P3

Submitting a book review was thus seen as a strategic move in gaining professional credit for promotion and tenure, but writers understood it also had a more developmental role. They recognised how the experience assisted them to gain control of a number of key rhetorical skills required for publishing in more exalted genres.

iv) To gain access to important journals

Participants also saw writing reviews as providing them with the valuable experience of international publication. The selection of a journal, the editing and review process and negotiating with reviewers and editors were all mentioned by our informants.

"Indexed papers seemed a remote possibilit for me, but some of my fellow PhD students have published a paper in an SSCI journal. When I found these journals also published book reviews, I thought it would be an opportunity for me to get an SSCI paper". (P9)

That is top journal. Although I have published a few papers in other good journals, I've never succeeded in getting into it SoI thought to publish a book review there to fulfil my dream of having a paper in it'. (P1).

# 4.3. Perceived benefits of publishing a book review

There seems to be a broad consensus in the literature that publishing as a doctoral student or junior scholar has important benefits for writers (e.g. Barnacle & Mewburn, 2010; Kamler, 2008). The most significant reported by participants was the experience of writing for others. As expertise develops with the practice of academic writing and the attention that needs to be given to inguistic features, this experience was crucial to becoming a competent academic writer:

"I think the biggest benefit I gained by writing the book review is that I developed my awareness of who readers might be, since was in a better position to understand who the readers are and what information they expect to receive. All this helps me to consider how I am supposed to communicate the message". (P11)

"Gradually, I am more aware of international journals. When preparing to try with book reviews, I colected almost all the sSCI journals in translation and communication and stored this information in different folders in my computer'. (P2)

"What I gained from writing the book review is to have learned about the genre convention of academic writing. I was able to see the wrong linguistic expressions I have always ignored'. (P15)

For some, the experience gave them strategies for both learning to understand a genre and to write it appropriately, as some of the ovice authors confirmed:

"I downloaded a number of book reviews published in the journal and read those t find out the preferred format. I got to know about the structure: a general description of the gist of the book, the content of each chapter, then an evaluative commentary. Basically, I used these as my models to write mine, and kept comparing my text with them again and again'. (P10)

"By writing a book review, I got to know that itis impossible to produce a sucessful text in one go. Although I polished the text again and again and thought it was the best I relised what I wrote was not clear, and only through repeated revisions could I get my ideas across clearly". (P9)

Participants also pointed to more specific learning gains from writing reviews. For example, Participant 7 believed that \*it offered me an important opportunity to practice academic writing", particularly,  have learned how to make beter use of ctation to support my arguments". Similarly, Participant 5 mentioned an example in which he leaned about the inappropriate use f hedges: \*the review editor advised me not to hedge on the positive evaluation I made on the book, but rather on the citicism I gave, so that my comment can be better accepted'. Others reported how they had developed a beter understanding f crafing academic arguments, which are usually not often tght explitl. Participnts, epially novice rearcher, enefte in this aspct of knowlge fromthe process of writing and publishing book reviews.

T have learned how to build an argument. Academic writing is a processof making an argument, so it i based on the writer's personal view of what to say. I learned the argumentation by writing the review'. (P8)

Others spoke of how the process enhanced their citiclity and a sense of how to approriately convey their evaluations of academic aterial:

The good thing about writing a book review,I think, is the opportunity for us to expres our own opinion and even criticism on a book we have read". (P13)

"What I like is to practice the skill of critical thinking by self-reflection when I make a judgment about the book". (P15)

In addition to benefits of developing these rhetorical and language skill, participants also spoke of gaining a greater awareness of academic publishing itself. For many of these novices, this venture into writing for publication was a new and mysterious endeavour and the book review provided an experience of the shallow end of the continuum. It was writing with training wheels:

"I have developed a sense of peer review, although the revision of a book review is a simpliied version of a peer review". (P4)

"Writing this review taught me ways of working, such as communicating with editors, and collaborating with the whole team to polish the review". (P12)

"During this process I fel that I gained some knowledge about academic publishing, for example, through communicating with the editor and responding to his comments'. (P7)

This also seems to have led to affective gains, with the authors' confidence growing after publishing a review:

"Compared with research articles, my experience of publishing the book review was much smoother. I sent the draft to the editor and she helped to revise it a couple of times, and then it was accepted'. (P6)

Others commented on how they learnt to work more efectively on their writing, particularly in managing their time. One participant said

"I have become more positive and active towards writing, and gradually manage my own time better and finish first-draf writing faster, in no more than three months'. (P14)

Central to this experience for many novice participants was the support of mentors, typically a upervisor or senior colleague. There is a substantial literature about the experiences of the supervisor-student relationship and how this can contribute to the transition from student to published scholar (e.g. Lu0 & Hyland, 2019). Ferrs (2019), for example, explores the types of feedback and other instructional interactions that can be helpful in scaffolding the writing process for students and Li (2019) considers mentorship in drafting and revising work for publication. The participants highlighted particular benefits:

"I was given advice about how to select the right book and how to contact a review editor and he also gave me the book review he wrote for reference". (P15)

"She told me to visit the webpage of the journal and read the instruction on book reviews. I also downloaded a few book reviews from the site for reference". (P7)

My supervisor helped to revise every version I wrote until the review was accepted. I also sought his guidance on comments from the book review editor, and on the revision I made based on these comments". (P12)

The advice of supervisors and mentors provided both practical advice and helped build the writers confidence in submitting a review.

# 4.4. Concerns and reservations

Although writing a review can be the first important step on the scholarly ladder, offering a valuable learning experience and shaping and a scholarly identity and persona, there are also potential drawbacks. Pare (2010), for instance, highlights the risk of "pre-mature" publication and warns that \*although the imperative is undeniable, and the desire to help students is laudable, the dangers of rushing students into the public exposure of publication need to be considered' (p. 30). Certainly, the anxiety related to academic publication can be counterproductive for students rather than helpful.

Even though almost all participants saw writing and publishing book reviews as a fruitful experience, many also had reser. vations and some regarded the experience as a painful and necessary process of becoming a publishing academic. As one of the novice participants noted, \*writing book reviews is not our ultimate goal in academic carer, but it is stage in our professional development" (P7). Another commented on how the experience put considerable pressure on her, making her reluctant to do a second review:

'it is not a very pleasant experience, but I think it is what we ned to go through in academic progres. Just like life, itis illed with lessons and diffculties. But as we have grown up, this may need to end as well, so now I'm not planning for more book reviews". (P10)

Participants reservation about writing book reviews was also influenced by the positions institutions took towards evaluation and romotion criteria. Although in some Chinese universities book reviews carry the same weight as research articles, others se little value in them and give them no credit. These concerns were commonly expressed by both novice and senior participants:

"I think I won't publish book reviews - simply because our universty doesn't give credit for them. Since book reviews are short and don't require research, the university doesn't see this type of output as a real academic publication'. (P4)

"Our university thinks book reviews are not based on full research, and so make little contribution to knowledge, so book reviews are not recognised anymore. I will not try to publish book reviews". (P9)

There is a new national policy that we should publish academic papers in China, so the office of social sciences in my university is encouraging teachers not to bother with book reviews in international journals". (P7)

Participants also saw these relative limitations of book reviews as faling to contribute to their academic trajectory and even potentially damaging to their creer. These concerns were especill prominent among those who had moved up the carer ladder to lecturers and professors:

"I need to take more care about the proportion of my publications between book reviews and research artices because I don't want my university and colleagues to belittle my academic capability". (P2)

"I am now really busy with teaching and research. I don't have enough time to do my projects, let alone write book reviews. (P5)

After publishing three book reviews, I think I need to change my plans. Writing research artice is more challenging and offers me more benefits, so I don't need to spend time writing book reviews just to have international publications'. (P8)

It would seem, then, that the book review becomes ess important to scholars as they move forward in their career, and althoug. useful at the beginning, gradually lose their lustre.

# 5. Conclusion

Despite their relatively short length, book reviews represent a carefully crafted contribution to disciplinary dialogues, while providing both novice and senior scholars with valuable learning experiences and an opportunity to build their publication lis. Our interviews with those who have published book reviews show that scholars come to understand the value of the genre early in their careers and see avantages, in terms of academic witing skill, reder appreciation, familirity wth ublication ractces, and career gains. The novice writers we talked to saw thisas an important step in building their professional standing and in coming to terms with the demands of publishing.

The participants also discussed the practical and affective gains they felt they had made by publishing book reviews. By engaging in the proces, they felt they had improved their rhetrical language use and ability to communicate more efectively with academic readers. Some believed their information literacy haddeveloped along with their confidnce in writing academic texts. Therfore, even though sometimes seen as "the second clas citizens" of scientific genres (Riley & Spreitzer, 1970, p. 361) which are marginalized in universty asessments (Hyland & Jiang, 2024), book reviews play an important part in the lives of scholars. Among the most important of these gains are the advantages writing has for graduate students in expanding the readership and subsequent feedback they get on their writing. As Watts (2012, p. 1104) observes:

the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with reviewerscan provide insight and different perspectives on doctoral work that may not emerge in supervision. Through the critical exchange of ideas and reeipt of challenging feedback, this instrumental approach to publishing has the potential to shape the thesis and the general direction of the research in creative ways.

Only a few of our participants mentioned that they wrote book reviews to improve their academic writing, but al reflected that this certainly helped to develop both types of writing kill and to beter understand how to craft an appropriate argument for disciplinary readers. The urgency with which non-anglophone academics are now expected to publish is challenging and the literature documents that the \*competitie bar for doctoral students is ring in terms of both quantity and quality (Jones, 2013, p. 89) It is now taken for granted that students should publish before they have diplomas in their hands" (Casanave, 2010, p. 47), yet with the presures of financial isues, heavy teaching loads, personal responsibilitie, family obligations and long commutes, this is often demanding for all students. In such circumstances, the chance to publish a short review of a book on an area one i familiar with from one's research studies, seems a relatively quick and low-anxiety solution to meeting such institutional requirements.

Although the participants expressed how their engagement with book reviews brought them both gains and concerns, we can also see that the genre contributes to the collective benefit of the discipline. This is apparent in the way it provides writers with an apprenticeship in academic writing, helping them to gain an understanding of the wider system of academic publishing upon which the disciplinary community depends. The knowledge gained in this way assists novices towards ful participation in their community of practice.

We recognise, of course, the limitations of our study. We have interviewed just 15 authors from a single country with similar disciplinary backgrounds and institutional demands. We believe, however, that it shows there are varying opinions which reflect seniority and experience among our interviewees and that it points to the ned for similar studies, perhaps with scholars from other countries, experiences and disciplines.

We have not set out to write an article on how to write reviews or to advocate that PhD students and junior scholars should write them. Like many of the authors in our interviews, hwever, we see this as an important aspect of an academic aprenticeship, fostering an understanding of the expectations of a disciplinary audience and acquiring the skill to become a member of that communit. We believe that our study provides a novel and important perspective on academic writing and publishing, revealing the ways that Chinese scholars perceive and participate in what is sometimes seen as a marginal genre in the publishing world and the aspirations of junior scholars as they seek to acquire new skil. For journal editors and publisher, our study may provide some insights into the stories behind the book reviews they receive, whether solicited or not, and the role that the genre plays in the lives of Chinese scholars.

In book reviews, then, we see noviceacademics taking their first steps in academic publishing and in beginning careers which wil lead to their immersion in their chosen fields and their participation in other, perhaps more demanding, written genre. For these reasons, we believe the genre should receive more respect from institutions and a more secure place in ERP training programmes and postgraduate writing courses.
