# Abstract

Although the role of social interaction through conversational activities is well established in the L2 writing classroom in relation to idea development, understanding rhetorical modes, the creation of a sense of audience, as well as the promotion of feedback, relatively little attention has been given to the actual discourse of teachers and learners, particularly in face-to-face writing conferences. Previous investigations of teacher talk in L2 conferences suggest that when there is more talk around revision in the conference, the revisions are more successful. However, these studies have employed different frameworks for analysis, investigated mostly high-proficiency learners, and have not systematically compared the relationship of the topics addressed in the conferences to the nature of the discourse. In contrast, this study employs two frameworks for analysis, negotiation and scaffolding, to investigate the discursive quality of two teachers, whose writing conferences with prematriculated ESL learners attended to very different writing concerns. Neither framework alone captured the differences between the teachers’ conferences, but together patterns of difference were evident. Certain combinations of negotiation and scaffolding moves in relation to conference focus allowed one teacher to vary assistance in relation to the proficiency of the learners and promote greater learner participation in the review of their writing.

# Introduction

The second language (L2) teacher–learner writing conference has been viewed not only as an effective and sometimes efficient tool for responding to learner writing (Ferris, 2003; Williams, 2004), but also as an ‘‘unparalleled opportunity to provide targeted individualized instruction’’ (Weissberg, 2006, p. 261). It might seem self-evident that a writing conference would provide a perfect opportunity for teachers to establish a collaborative stance, giving learners greater opportunities to participate in their learning about writing, and yet there is relatively little research on the actual discourse of writing conferences between teachers and adult L2 learners to substantiate these views for L2 writing development.

More attention has been given to the nature of talk about writing between peers in classrooms and between tutors and learners in writing centers than in face-to-face teacher–learner conferences. This research suggests that certain attitudes and behaviors are more facilitative than others in providing the necessary support for the developing writers (Cumming & So, 1996; Harris & Silva, 1993; Thonus, 1998, 1999, 2004). Collaborative stances are more productive than authoritative or prescriptive attitudes and behaviors which increase the affective relationship between the participants (DeGuerrero & Villamil, 2000; Weigle & Nelson, 2004) result in better receptiveness of students’ comments and the resolution of identified problems in subsequent drafts. Nonetheless, it remains the case that L2 adult learners often get shorter conferences, with tutors dominating the talk with evaluations and suggestions rather than substantial learner participation (Williams, 2004). In addition, the unique dynamic of a teacher/learner relationship established over a period of time in a classroom may promote or necessitate different specific interactional features from in a classroom with peers or in a writing center with tutors who are also often peers in age of the learners.

This study contributes to a small but growing body of research on the discourse of teachers and second language learners in face-to-face writing conferences. The results of the few previous investigations of teacher talk in L2 conferences (Goldstein & Conrad, 1990; Haneda, 2000; Patthey-Chavez & Ferris, 1997) suggest that when there is more talk about revision in the conference, the revisions are more successful. However, these studies have employed different frameworks for investigation, and the assumption that these are adequate has gone unchallenged. Research with a wider range of learners in different learning contexts is also needed ‘‘to describe and define more precisely the criteria for pedagogically beneficial discourse in L2 teacher–student interaction’’ (Haneda, 2000, p. 186).

By employing two frameworks, negotiation and scaffolding, this study investigates the discursive quality of teacher–learner conferences. Of course, writing teachers are ultimately concerned with the effect of conferencing on subsequent writing, but in the equation of talk and writing conferences, analysis of the writing is better understood and developed than the analysis of the talk. In order to make claims about the relationship of the writing conference talk to writing revision, more attention must be given to the talk. This study, then, represents a logically prior step to further investigations of the effect of conferences on writing improvement by proposing an analysis of talk that may provide a useful heuristic for investigating talk in L2 writing conferences in contexts with a variety of learners and writing tasks. An analysis of the second drafts of the learners investigated in this study is left for a future paper, in which it will also be necessary to establish a framework for determining successful revision for the sake of comparability across studies.

The two frameworks, negotiation and scaffolding, represent considerably different theoretical orientations towards second language learning, and yet both are found in the description of revision-promoting talk in writing conferences. Negotiation, typically associated with the Interactionist Hypothesis (Long, 1981), refers to certain tactics used in expert/novice pairs in order to solve communication problems, particularly in the area of conversational management and performed language functions. While the taxonomy of these tactics has grown (see Larsen-Freeman & Long, 1991), the most common features cited are confirmation checks, comprehension checks, and clarification requests. The use of these tactics stems from the desire for comprehension between interlocutors in spontaneous interaction. They are also thought to promote learning by providing modified input and corrective feedback to increase the learner’s ability to notice mismatches between their output and that of the more proficient interlocutor (Schmidt, 1990). One might expect then to find more negotiation when teachers interact with less proficient learners. Although there is some evidence that negotiation promotes comprehension (Gass & Varonis, 1994; Loschky, 1994; Pica, Young, & Doughty, 1987), it is harder to substantiate the claim that it directly promotes learning. Nonetheless, negotiation has been observed in writing talk between peers (Mendonc¸a & Johnson, 1994; Nelson & Murphy, 1993), learners and tutors in writing centers (Thonus, 1998; Williams, 2002, 2004), and teachers and learners in writing conferences (Goldstein & Conrad, 1990; Patthey-Chavez & Ferris, 1997) and linked with successful revision. It is not always immediately clear in these studies how negotiation has been operationalized for the analysis of talk or specifically linked to subsequent revision.

Scaffolding, like negotiation, refers to tactics in the talk provided by a more proficient interlocutor when assisting a less proficient learner in accomplishing a task or solving a problem which he or she could not accomplish alone. Scaffolding is often associated with a socio-cultural orientation to language learning since it describes the facilitative talk of expert/novice pairs in the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) (Vygotsky, 1978). Through dialogic collaboration in the ZPD, the expert can provide contingent and graduated assistance as required (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Anton, 1999; DeGuerrero & Villamil, 2000; McCormick & Donato, 2000). Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976), in their study of the tutoring of young children, observed that scaffolding in problem-solving situations is characterized by six important features: (a) recruitment (enlisting the learners’ interest in the task); (b) reduction in degrees of freedom (simplifying the task); (c) direction maintenance (keeping the learner motivated in pursuit of the goal); (d) marking critical features (highlighting certain relevant features and pointing out discrepancies between what has been produced and the ideal solution); (e) frustration control (reducing stress and frustration during problem solving); (f) demonstration (modeling an idealized form of the act to be performed by completing the act or by explicating the learner’s partial solution). The expert member of the pair uses a variety of communicative and linguistic moves to achieve this tutorial assistance. These features have been observed in peer discussions (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994), in writing center tutorials (Cumming & So, 1996), and in teacher–learner talk (Anton, 1999; DeGuerrero & Villamil,

2000; Haneda, 2004; McCormick & Donato, 2000). As with negotiation, one would expect the quantity and quality of scaffolding to be greater with less proficient learners than with more proficient ones.

The two analytical frameworks, negotiation and scaffolding, both reveal a significant role for the more experienced interlocutor in any learning interaction. These two terms, in fact, have become so commonplace in teaching pedagogy that they have lost some of their specificity as cover terms for articulated sets of interactional features. One can come across the term scaffolding in the discussion of any kind of supportive native speaker input, and one can also see the use of negotiation as an alternative definition of scaffolding in discussions of creating appropriate learning environments.

There are a limited number of studies that analyze the talk of teachers in face-to-face classroom writing conferences with adult L2 learners. The first major study by Goldstein and Conrad (1990) focused on the conferences of Englishas-a-second-language (ESL) learners, who had already matriculated into university-level coursework in the United States. The discourse of one teacher in conference with these three students was analyzed using the interactionist model of negotiation as well as turn-taking, questions, and topic nomination. They discovered that in spite of teachers’ and learners’ perceptions, teacher talk did not necessarily promote interaction or revision. Not every student was able to help set the agenda, make their needs known, express their ideas and opinions, and ask questions to clarify meanings. They also found that the conferences varied in relation to the learners’ language proficiency with more negotiation occurring between the teacher and the more proficient learners rather than the less proficient learners, and that aside from individual differences in personality, cultural expectations for conversational roles may have affected learner participation in the conferences. Nonetheless, Goldstein and Conrad found that when the teacher and a student negotiated revisions, the subsequent revisions were almost always successful as measured by the degree to which they resolved a rhetorical problem. The researchers indicated that the learners’ errors were mostly of a rhetorical and not lexico-grammatical nature due to the advanced proficiency of the learners, but the study does not differentiate the negotiation results by the focus of the revision talk on one or the other.

Patthey-Chavez and Ferris (1997) investigated the role of learner proficiency and institutional expectations in teacher–learner writing conferences from a socio-cultural perspective, claiming that the writing conference is a ‘‘classic example of a teacher–led’’ ZPD (p. 51). They report that in examining the role of learner proficiency (based on teacher judgments) and institutional expectations in the writing conferences of four teachers, the stronger students more actively participated in the writing conferences and were able to make more substantial revisions that involved the generation of new ideas. The weaker students, who participated less, however, were more likely to simply take the teacher’s suggestions and apply them directly to the next draft. The stronger students received less direct, more mitigated, talk from the teachers than the lower proficiency learners. Nonetheless, the teachers still dominated the talk of the conferences in all cases: The stronger students contributed from 11 to 37 percent of the conference talk and the weaker students from 8 to 26 percent. As in the Goldstein and Conrad (1990) study, the learners were matriculated students enrolled either in the composition sequence of a prestigious private university or in a business major course and had few language concerns in their writing. In addition, Patthey-Chavez and Ferris looked specifically at the trajectory of a limited number of revision topics prominent in the conferences involving argumentation and elaboration of ideas and not surface language concerns.

More recently, Haneda (2000, 2004) examined the nature of teacher–learner writing conference discourse in relation to students’ subsequent revisions with learners in her Japanese foreign language classroom from the perspectives of activity theory, systemic functional linguistics, and situated literacy. Although she did not apply the frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding directly, her analysis of talk sequences about content and rhetorical issues revealed that learner participation was influenced by L2 proficiency in that advanced learners were more interested in ideational content and rhetorical choices while intermediate students were more concerned with language use issues. This difference in focus was reflected in the types of revisions made although the average number of revisions made in relation to conference discussion was the same for both proficiency groups. She also found that across all the students content-talk sequences produced longer exchanges than those focusing on language use but that overall 73 percent of the conferences focused on language use.

These studies leave a number of issues to be addressed in understanding the relationship between teacher talk and learner participation in writing conferences and the potential of such talk to effect revisions. First, a rather narrow learner population type, high-proficiency matriculated English learners, has been investigated thus far. The frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding both predict that less proficient learners will benefit from such assistance, yet in Goldstein and Conrad (1990) as well as in Patthey-Chavez and Ferris (1997), it was the more proficient learners who engaged in longer exchanges with their teachers. It is not surprising that the relationship of the talk to the revisions was positive for stronger students, but it is not clear what aspects of the talk made the difference. It is, thus, important to analyze the talk of less proficient prematriculated second language learners. Second, in these two studies as well as in Haneda (2000, 2004), the talk analyzed focused primarily, by intention or by default, on topics of content and rhetoric even though Haneda noted that the vast majority of her conferences attended to concerns of language. Learners and teachers alike find language errors problematic and important to address. It is an open question whether negotiation and scaffolding occur in talk around language concerns. Third, these studies have used different frameworks for analyzing the nature of the conference talk making comparisons across data more difficult. In order to investigate the differences of talk with different types of learners, different writing tasks, and different conference foci, it is useful to understand how the frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding interface in the analysis of conference talk. Carefully coding conference talk for features of either framework or both will promote future analysis of the links between talk and revisions. Based on this review of the literature the following research questions have been formulated:

(1) How do the frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding interface in describing teacher talk in L2 writing conferences with prematriculated adult learners of English?   
(2) How does the focus of the conference on either language or content/rhetoric concerns impact the discursive nature of this talk?

# Participants

The participants in this study were 2 teachers and 6 students in the sixth level of a seven-level intensive English language program at a large U.S. university. All participants were given pseudonyms. Although the four teachers in Level 6 were invited to participate in the study, only three of the teachers engaged in face-to-face writing conferences and of those only two had students who were willing to participate in the study. The 2 teachers, Mary and John, were both experienced ESL teachers, with advanced degrees in language education. Mary was a candidate for a doctoral degree and John had completed a doctorate. Each had more than 5 years of teaching experience in an academic preparation intensive ESL program and had taught writing courses with writing conferences for several semesters.

The 6 students were placed into a specific level based on a pre- and postsession placement exam, which combines scores from four subsections (grammar, listening, reading, and writing). The essay portion of the exam is rated holistically using an eight-point rubric. On the postsession placement exam, given closest to the time of data collection, the 6 students received a five or six on the writing section, except for one, who received a seven (although he received a score of five on the exam 7 weeks earlier). Postsession paper-based TOEFL scores range from 497 to 607 (see Table 1). Although these scores are often considered sufficient for university admission, these students had not been admitted to university programs, had only been in the U.S. between 4 and 20 weeks, and had little to no experience in English university writing. The highest score of 607 is also somewhat misleading since the scores for this student on two subsequent tests at 7-week intervals were 577 and 570. Only 2 of the 6 students were promoted to the next level at the end of the session in which data was collected. Mary’s 3 students were Yoko (f) from Japan, Carlos (m) from Brazil, and Sung Won (m) from Korea, and John’s were Henri (m) a French-speaker from Guinea, Feng (m) from Taiwan, and Eun Young (f) from Korea.

Note. The writing placement is based on a holistic assessment using a scale of 8 with 8 being an indication the writing of the learner has surpassed the expectations of the seven-level IEP. a The scores in parentheses indicate two subsequent test results at 7-week intervals.

# Data collection

The six conferences were audio-recorded at the beginning of the 6th week. In all cases, the conferences were held in the regular classroom with the teacher meeting the student off to the side while the rest of the students were engaged in other regular activities. In Mary’s class this occurred in a computer laboratory, and she met the students in an alcove away from the area where the other students were revising their writing on computers. In John’s class, individual students met with John at the teacher’s desk in part of the classroom while the other nine students were sitting in three circles discussing a text they had all read. Although the conferences were visible to the class, there was enough activity and noise in both settings that the conversations were reasonably private. The teachers both faced away from the rest of the class and spoke in lowered tones during the conference. In John’s class, each conference lasted between 7 and 10 minutes (Henri 10:08; Feng 9:39; Eun Young 7:25), and in Mary’s class the conferences varied considerably, from 14 to 35 minutes (Yoko 16:30; Carlos 14:08; Sung Won 35:03). The two teachers were interviewed separately after the recorded writing conferences regarding their rationale for their purposes and practices in writing conferences.

The context of the writing conferences

Mary and John regularly engaged their learners in multi-draft essay writing and provided them with written and/or oral feedback on first drafts of all writing assignments. Mary had decided after trying to do several conferences in one session in the past to give each student one longer and ‘‘better’’ conference during one writing cycle in a session. This was primarily a pragmatic decision since she did not feel that with more than ten students (and most IEP classes have more than ten students in Level 6) she could take enough class time to make the conferences worthwhile to the students. As she put it, ‘‘if you can get in one good one, it’s going to benefit rather than three shabby quick ones.’’ For the first draft that got oral feedback in the conference, Mary did not write on the learners’ drafts until the conference, although she had read them before the conference day and thought about possible areas of revision. Just before the conference, she glanced through the texts again, but did not make notes on the text until she was talking with the student. This was followed by a short list of revision priorities, which she wrote on the front of the student’s text at the end of the conference. She always gave the learners three things to work on because she thought it was ‘‘as much as they can handle. . .I don’t want to give them the whole list ‘cause I don’t think they’ll tackle it all and they’ll be discouraged, but I don’t want to give them one because then it makes them feel like that is all they need to work on. And three just seems like a magic number, no real rhyme or reason.’’ Mary had several lead-up activities to the essay writing. In this case, the learners had watched the film Remember the Titans (Bruckheimer & Yagin, 2000) after which they discussed the issues raised in the movie and examples in the movie which refuted or supported positions on the issues. The students were allowed to choose which issue(s) they wanted to argue in their papers but were told that ‘‘all of their examples and supporting ideas must come from the movie,’’ and that they had to ‘‘write about the issue, not the movie.’’ Before writing the first draft for this assignment, the students had written a multi-draft summary of the movie, which was available for use in the essay if they chose.

John engaged in several writing conferences in each teaching session. John typically made written comments on the students’ drafts before the conference and then primarily talked about those in the conference. In his opinion, it was necessary to discuss the written comments because ‘‘one thing that I see all the time is, I write things down and the next thing is they throw it away. . .you know, I really want to talk with them about it because I think they won’t improve unless I can really show them that many of those things that are unclear to me become clearer to them over the course of several weeks.’’ In John’s class, where students wrote argumentative essays almost every weekend, he usually started with group brainstorming on a topic early in the week, followed by collaborative writing of an introduction. This might be followed by more discussion on the topic later in the week, and then the prompt would be given on Friday with a first draft due on Monday. For the task under investigation here, John told the class on the Friday previous to the writing conference that the topic was ‘‘pollution.’’ The conferences in this study fell in the 4th week of the 7-week session.

Both teachers indicated that they thought the best focus for the conference was content and organization rather than language issues. According to Mary, ‘‘The important things are getting your ideas down, then form (rhetoric), and then grammar.’’ John also expressed the view that the focus of the conference should be the ‘‘overall the organization of the essay, transitions, coherence, stuff like that, that most people don’t know much about.’’ In addition he added that he doesn’t ‘‘really pound away on language structure that much.’’ However, in the actual conferences, this was not the case; John focused almost exclusively on language issues, while Mary focused almost exclusively on rhetorical concerns.

# Data analysis

The six conferences and two interviews were transcribed using normal orthography. Every attempt was made to faithfully transcribe the subjects’ words as they were spoken. A close transcription of pauses, overlaps, or intonation changes was not made unless such features were observed to be exceptional in some way. Both teachers spent some time in each conference reading the student’s essay audibly or silently. The audible reading is written in quotation marks, and the silent reading along with other comments on nonverbal activity is noted in parentheses. Completely inaudible portions are indicated as $( ^ { * * * * } )$ .

Three negotiation features were used to code the teacher talk: comprehension checks [CC], clarification requests [CR], and revision clarification requests [RC] (Goldstein & Conrad, 1990). ‘‘Confirmation Checks,’’ the fourth category used by Goldstein and Conrad, was subsumed in the comprehension checks category since they are both related to comprehension, and the category ‘‘revision clarification’’ was expanded here to include talk about rhetorical features of writing.

The teachers’ talk was also coded for the six scaffolding features (Wood et al., 1976): (a) The expert recruits the learner’s interest in the task [R], (b) reduces in degrees of freedom [RDF] the complexity of the task, (c) directs the maintenance [DM] of the goal-oriented activity, (d) marks critical features [MCF] that point out discrepancies between what has been produced and the ideal solution, (e) controls the frustration [FC] of the learner during problem solving, and (f) demonstrates [D] possible solutions for completing the activity successfully. Through a variety of moves, not unlike those used to describe negotiation, such as questions, directives, pauses, use of the L1, and other verbal and nonverbal behaviors, the teacher-expert guides the learner-novice toward enhanced independent performance of the task, in this case, the revision of the first draft of their written texts. Examples of each of the coded features can be found in Table 2.

All of the transcripts of the teacher talk were initially coded by the researcher and later all were coded by a second colleague, also an applied linguist at a state university. Interrater reliability was greater than .87 for all nine coded features combined. Individually, the coding of each feature was .87 or greater except for Directions Management, which had an interrater reliability of .75.

Learner participation was measured by the length of each conference in minutes, the length of each conference in words, the distribution of talk (percent of words contributed by the student), and the mean and median length in words of each interlocutor’s turns (Patthey-Chavez & Ferris, 1997).

# Results

# Negotiation and scaffolding in the conferences

An analysis of the writing conference discourse reveals that both teachers engage in negotiation and use a variety of scaffolding features in their talk with learners about their writing. Nonetheless, the character of the conferences is quite different. The specific way in which negotiation is used in relation to certain features of scaffolding addresses the first research question.

# Mary’s conferences

Each of Mary’s conferences had a four-part structure: opening invitation, student presentation of their writing purposes, teacher’s response, and closing with revision plan. The invitation to present their writing was, according to Mary, because she wanted

students to maybe find [the problems] themselves, to already know, for example, oh you know, transitions are my big weakness, or you know, finding good examples is my weakness or something like that. . . because I think I think they get very little chance to diagnose their own writing and what they think and so I kinda give them that chance to almost kinda give a defense of their writing.

Mary stated the purpose of the conference clearly at the outset as an invitation to the learners to talk about their writing. The introduction to Yoko’s conference (see Excerpt A) exemplifies Mary’s opening in each conference.

Excerpt A: Yoko

1. M: What you need to do is, if you could umm kinda umm talk about each part of your essay like what’s   
2. the paragraph doing, what’s your thesis statement? Umm. Maybe, what are your main ideas, and   
3. then we’ll, I’ll talk about what I saw in your essay, okay? [DM]   
4. Y: This is the introduction and from this sentences, I think, this my thesis statement (pointing).

The opening invitation was followed by the student’s description of the purpose and design of the essay. In Excerpt B, Carlos’ description of his essay is representative of the way the three students presented their essays to Mary. Even though this was Carlos’ time to present his essay, Mary was not a passive listener. Rather she was actively engaged in negotiation, checking her comprehension of his main ideas, and in a non-directive way, already marking critical features in the essay that would get some attention later in the conference. Mary used questions (Lines 10 and 18), restatements (Lines 22, 24, and 28), and paraphrasing (Line 26) in negotiating. In Line 18, with rising intonation, Mary showed some surprise that the sentence just read is his thesis. In Line 26, with the use of the word ‘‘but,’’ Mary indicated that something was not clear. However, she did not pursue these concerns at this time. She checked her comprehension several times, giving Carlos an opportunity to explain his intentions, and then let him continue. The two marked critical features, the nature of the thesis statement and the ordering of topics, were embedded in a sequence of negotiation moves to check comprehension and request clarification.

Excerpt B: Carlos

7. C: Should I start now?   
8. M: Yeah.   
9. C: That’s my introduction and I centralize the ideas more on the racism.   
10. M: About racism? [CC]   
11. C: Yes, and I my thesis statement this on this last part, this last sentence.   
12. I need to read it?   
13. M: Yes.   
14. C: Okay. ‘‘The Titans, a movie about racism in the USA, is a perfect example of how the differences   
15. between colors do not matter, at least for few minutes until the differences come up sharply   
16. showing the irrational and primitive society that didn’t realize that color should not be considered   
17. a difference between humans being.’’   
18. M: This whole thing is your (begins questioning intonation) [RC] [MCF]   
19. C: Yeah, and I did it this statement and I think that I, I was going to talk about the Titans, the movie.   
20. Yeah? And in one paragraph the difference does not matter, another paragraph and that the   
21. difference matters sometimes in another paragraph.   
22. M: Okay, so we have the movie. [CC]   
23. C: Yeah.   
24. M: Differences doesn’t matter. [CC]   
25. C: Yeah, then difference matters.   
26. M: Okay, uh ‘‘showing sharply,’’ but then again you have the color should not be considered a difference.   
[CC] [MCF]   
27. C: That’s when.   
28. M: Oh. Okay, That’s difference. [CC]   
29. C: That’s my opinion.   
30. M: All right. I see. All right. [CC]

After learners had finished explaining their writing intentions, Mary began her review of the text. Mary’s interaction with Yoko and Carlos about their texts was quite similar. In Excerpt C from Carlos’ conference, Mary used questions, restatements, and paraphrasing to negotiate meaning as well as scaffolding moves to lead him towards the resolution of the two problems in his text. The first problem was his very short introduction, first marked as a critical feature in Line 18 (Excerpt B). Mary did not immediately provide a demonstration of a revision, but suggested a possible problem by asking Carlos to clarify his understanding of the nature of an introduction (Lines 57–73). He initiated and led the discussion at certain points (Lines 68–73), and before moving to the next topic Mary affirmed Carlos’ revision plan (Line 72).

Mary moved to the next topic by reading a portion of Carlos’ text, and then led him through his own essay by focusing his attention on the organization (first marked in Line 26, Excerpt B), one subtopic at a time (Lines 87, 90, and 93). Mary knew he was following by his responses to her revision clarification request (Line 77) and by his repeating of her comments (Lines 89 and 92). Eventually, he saw for himself (Line 96) that the order of the topics in the paper did not follow the order indicated in the introduction. Mary suggested a revision possibility (Lines 97–101), and Carlos confirmed by repeating what she has said (Line 99). Finally, he agreed that his introduction needed more than two sentences (Line 102). As Mary was leading the discussion, she requested more revision clarification than she did when Carlos was presenting his essay to her, but her pattern of negotiating over an extended number of turns to address one critical feature was the same.

Excerpt C: Carlos

57. M: Okay. Good. All right. Let’s start from the beginning. Um. First of all, how can you write a   
58. two-sentence paragraph, just a two-sentence introduction?[RC] [MCF]   
59. C: Two sentence?   
60. M: Yeah.   
61. C: In introduction?   
62. M: Yeah.   
63. C: (Chuckles) How many I should write?   
64. M: Do you really think you just needed two? [RC]   
65. C: No. I couldn’t think more about that.   
66. M: I mean you write this wonderful. Look at how wonderful the summary is, but   
67. you only take two sentences to introduce your essay. [RC]   
68. C: Yeah. I think I, I, in the introduction, what I should do is show what about I’m going to say.   
69. M: Yeah.   
70. C: And build the two statements that they can have an idea about everything that I’m going to   
71. say in essay, right?   
72. M: Yeah, right, that’s true.   
73. C: I think I did this. (Chuckles)   
74. M: You think you did? [RC] Okay. ‘‘Sometimes all the differences between people don’t exist an   
75. but it has always passed as a dream that is enjoyed until it has been broke by the reality. The   
76. a movie about racism in the USA, is a perfect example of how the difference between color d   
77. matter.’’ Okay. This is the first time you talk about color, right? [RC] [MCF]   
78. C: Uhuh. Yeah.   
79. M: Okay, you might have added, you might want to add a sentence about color here. [D]   
80. C: But I, I, I should not like. I can. I can’t start talking about the general idea and then and (que   
81. intonation).   
82. M: Yeah. The general idea color and then you can say color doesn’t matter. [D]   
83. C: I can’t start to say like general idea is the difference between people and then I start to be more   
84. specific about the color?   
85. M: Sure.   
86. C: Later, no?   
87. M: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so you say differences. (Mary flips through the essay pointing to the   
88. different parts as she talks). [DM]   
89. C: And the difference between color.   
90. M: And then, yeah, difference between color. (Mary writes a list of topics on the essay in the order they   
91. occur in the essay) [DM]   
92. C: And then the movie.   
93. M: Right, and then the movie, but you don’t go in that order.   
94. C: Why not?   
95. M: You do differences, movie, about racism, and then differences between color.   
96. C: Yeah! (Carlos seems surprised.)   
97. M: So, yeah, what I’m recommending is to um keep the differences and then talk about difference in   
98. color, like you said, and then you can talk about racism. [D]   
99. C: And then talk about racism.   
100. M: Yeah and then talk about the movie, exactly, so I think it’s going to take a little bit more than   
101. two sentences. [D]   
102. C: Uhuh.

The pattern of negotiation, however, changed with Sung Won, who had the most difficulty expressing himself orally in English (see Excerpt D). As a result, Mary’s conference with him was almost twice as long as with the others, and she asked him more questions, made more comprehension checks, gave him more compliments, and provided him with much more wait time to respond to her invitations to clarify his essay’s content or structure. In one instance (Line 203), Mary waited 19 seconds while Sung Won looked at his essay and tried to formulate a response to her question. Beyond questions for clarification or comprehension checks, Mary provided words for Sung Won to use in completing his thoughts (Line 200), started sentences for him to finish (Line 202), or repeated the words he had used to confirm her comprehension (Lines 208 and 213). It appears that this negotiation resulted in the teacher and learner coming to a mutual understanding of the needed revision with Mary affirming this idea (Line 217).

Excerpt D: Sung Won

195. S: It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter for discrimination.   
196. M: Okay.   
197. S: Yeah.   
198. M: Okay, so it doesn’t matter for [CC]   
199. S: Um.   
200. M: Working together? [CR]   
201. S: Yes.   
202. M: But it matters for? (5) [CR]   
203. S: It used to matter. I mean, uh, for, matter for (19) matter for, I mean, be used to as discrimination.   
204. M: What do you mean? [CR]   
205. S: Can be misused? from? uh?   
206. M: What can be misused? [CR]   
207. S: Difference.   
208. M: Difference? [CC]   
209. S: Difference can be used for people who want who want to get who want to get interested by   
210. discriminating other people.   
211. M: Um. Try to tell me in a different way. [CR]   
212. S: Yes not only color, but not only race, um, reason also can be can be.   
213. M: A reason? [CC]   
214. S: Region.   
215. M: Yeah, a region can be a reason for discrimination.   
216. S: Yes, yes, because they are different.   
217. M: Right.

Mary’s scaffolding assistance was also different with Sung Won than with Yoko and Carlos. While the number of critical features and topics addressed was relatively the same as in the other conferences, Mary provided Sung Won with more demonstrations of how to resolve his writing problems. In Excerpt E, Mary kept Sung Won focused on the marked critical feature by often reading his words as she demonstrated where and how to make a revision to clarify his intentions for the reader.

Excerpt E: Sung Won

122. M: Um, okay, what you might want to do is if you read this last part ‘‘In the result of white player’s   
123. boycott, Yoast can stay,’’ right? [CC]   
124. S: ‘‘Stay.’’ Yes.   
125. M: ‘‘Can stay in school as a defense coach.’’ Now here, then you say ‘‘in summer camp training.’’ What   
126. you might want to do is add a sentence that kind of goes from here, [D] I’m talking about something   
127. general. Now I’m going to talk about a little bit something deeper, right? A little bit more specific. So   
128. you maybe want to add a topic sentence that says this is the general story. [D] This is the important   
129. part of the story. Okay? [CC]   
130. S: Yeah?   
131. M: Even something simple like an important scene in the movie or an important part of the movie like   
132. summer at training camp and even something simple like that.[D] Then helps the reader know that   
133. here I’m talking about the movie in general. Now I’m going to talk about something a little bit   
134. more specific. All right let’s go back to your thesis statement. [MCF] Now if I just read your thesis   
135. statement, can I guess what the main ideas will be in your body? [RC]   
136. S: Do you mean my body?   
137. M: No, no the main ideas in your body, the body of your essay. [RDF]   
138. S: Ah, okay, um (18)   
139. M: So your big ideas are grouping and color differences. No? [CR]   
140. S: Grouping, uh, grouping makes difference.   
141. M: Okay, grouping makes difference. Ah, is that it? [CR]   
142. S: Yes.

There is a noticeable difference in the ways in which Mary engaged with her three learners. Her responses varied according to what she perceived to be the needs and abilities of the learners, and her assistance moved between less explicit and more explicit revision assistance. By giving the learners the floor initially, she could judge their ability to communicate about their texts. As a result, the learner less able to express his intentions and concerns received more time, more negotiation, and more of the type of scaffolding that would help him work independently compared with the orally more proficient learners. In all cases, though, there were many negotiation turns around each marked critical feature.

# John’s conferences

John followed the same format and focus in each of his conferences: a brief opening and closing episode around a longer, middle episode focused on specific problems in the student’s text. The students were not invited to contribute to the conference, and since John directed the talk in the conferences, the distinctions between the parts of the conference were not as clear as in Mary’s conferences. Nonetheless, John’s conferences also revealed negotiation and scaffolding assistance although the distribution was different than in Mary’s conferences, as was the interface between negotiation and scaffolding.

John opened each conference with a general statement about the quality of the paper, which included praise for the overall structure and content of the texts, but moved quickly into marking critical features in the text. In Excerpt F,

John’s introduction to Henri’s conference includes global comments about the text (Lines 1–3), a dramatic reading of some lines of the text (Lines 5–12) and ends with first problem in the writing (Line 12). The reading of the student’s words may function to control frustration for the student, but it did not give Henri an opportunity to indicate his writing purposes or concerns.

Excerpt F: Henri

1. J: Okay, let’s see. UH, What I like about your writing is that you, that you, are trying to do this whole   
2. dramatic entry, and entrance. Like, you’re showing a lot of pictures, which is something that I liked   
3. very much about your essay, the essay about [another student’s] birthday.   
4. H: $( ^ { \ast \ast \ast \ast } )$ .   
5. J: Yeah. It creates an image, you know, when you say ‘‘trees without color, rivers are dark, animals are   
6. running from the forest.’’ Everyone is going ‘Oh, what’s going to happen, what’s going to happen?’   
7. ‘‘People are sick. People cannot live in this place someone says. The environment is difficult to   
8. live in.’’ Okay. So these are all statements to make, to create a dramatic situation. Um, and then you   
9. summarize it. ‘‘All these situations are caused by environmental pollution. Nowadays, pollution is the   
10. cause.’’ and see, ‘‘Pollution.’’ You introduce the topic and then you go from, from, you’re using the   
11. key word again in the next sentence, ‘‘Nowadays, pollution is the cause of climatic change. Some   
12. diseases and even the death or nourriture.’’ (rising intonation) Franc¸ais, isn’t it? [MCF][CR]

The negotiated interaction began with the marking of critical features, which in John’s conferences were frequent. There was some negotiation around these critical features, but John did not ask nearly as many questions as Mary, and more of his questions required display of knowledge of individual words or grammar points rather than interpretation or explanation of the writer’s intentions in the essay. The questions got shorter responses from the learners, and so the conferences were predominantly John talking. The quick movement from one language problem to another with short responses to display questions was evident in Eun Young’s conference. In Excerpt G, John addressed seven language problems. Eun Young’s responses to the yes/no questions John asks were all very short. Only after Line 48, where John asked a wh-question, did she provide a slightly longer response in which she actually corrected the syntax of the sentence that had the marked critical feature (Line 48), but John did not confirm her correction because he was focused on only the word choice in that sentence.

Excerpt G: Eun Young

29. J: No problems in this one either. I mean, there are just some, you know, um. There are some problems   
30. with the words, and the word choice. [MCF] ‘‘And they become a bad temper.’’ Do you become a bad   
31. temper? [RDF] [CR]   
32. E: Um. Actually no.   
33. J: Actually no (Chuckling together.) Maybe, think about what, how you would say that, ‘‘They become a   
34. bad temper.’ (Pause) Would you say they become a bad temper? [RC]   
35. E: They get angry easily.   
36. J: Yeah. (Cheering.) They get angry easily. That sounds better, actually. Let’s go (looks further in the   
37. essay). Again form of pollution. [MCF] Whenever this is repeated, that’s (reading) Uhuh. Did you mean   
38. ‘‘for’’ as because here? [MCF] ‘‘For the pollution by the heavy industries in Koshin.’’ [CR]   
39. E: Yes, I mean because.   
40. J: But that, that, that wouldn’t work here, you know. You would have to say ‘‘because of.’’ [D] (Reading)   
41. Um, and think about it when you say ‘‘Water cannot be.’’ [MCF] Remember my TOEFL class, ‘‘to be’’   
42. plus?   
43. E: ‘‘Be’’ cannot, uh.   
44. J: ‘‘To Be’’ plus ‘‘Ved.’’ [RDF]   
45. E: ‘‘Drunken?’’   
46. J: ‘‘Drunk.’’ [D] ‘‘Even after’’ and see ‘‘even after,’’ subject and verb, ‘‘not even after boiled.’’ Something   
47. is missing. [MCF] Now here is one thing that I’m not quite sure. ‘‘It is really ridiculous to happen the   
48. water peddling.’’ [MCF] What do you mean by that? [CR]   
49. E: Mean? Uh, water peddling on the street is ridiculous because $( ^ { \ast \ast \ast \ast } )$ is a big city.   
50. J: Yeah, so you should get your water from the tap. [CC]   
51. E: Yeah.   
52. J Okay. ‘‘It is really . . .to happen the water peddling.’’ Rephrase this somehow. [DM] I wasn’t quite   
53. sure what you meant by that, you know. Maybe even the word ‘‘water peddling.’’ Maybe you could find   
54. another word for ‘‘water peddling.’’ [RDF] It sounds a bit awkward in here. This one is here just a   
55. spelling problem, ‘‘certain mental in water.’’ [MCF] Metal, I’m sure you wanted to say ‘‘metal.’’ [D]   
56. E: ‘‘Mental?’’   
57. J: ‘‘Mental,’’ like mind, or ‘‘metal’’ like silver, iron? [CR]   
58. E: Like silver, iron.   
59. J: Yeah, you meant ‘‘metal,’’ but it was just misspelled. [RDF]

Henri’s conference follows much the same pattern, with many marked critical features with few demonstrations for revision and minimal negotiation as can be seen in Excerpt H. John used a number of RDF moves to help Henri in the guessing game for one word, but when Henri actually found the right word (Line 48), John did not seem to notice it and told him to look it up in a dictionary (Lines 49–50).

Excerpt H: Henri

19. J: So, I see that sometimes. . .Is it? Now, let me ask you this question. Do you, do you think when you   
20. write that this sounds so English, this must be English? [RC] Because ‘‘disperation’’ sounds like a   
21. perfect English word, ‘‘disperation.’’[MCF]   
22. H: Yeah, It’s my idea.   
23. J: Could you find a different word for ‘‘disperation?’’[RDF]   
24. H: Lost?   
25. J: Can you? [RC] Lost? Yeah, loss. Okay. Can you find a verb that sounds like ‘‘disperation?’’[RDF]   
26. H: In English?   
27. J: Yah, yah. How about if you see someone and then the person is not here anymore? [RDF] He (waiting)   
28. H: He left.   
29. J: (chuckles)   
30. H: He. . .   
31. J: Starts with a ‘‘d.’’ [RDF]   
32. H: With a ‘‘d?’’   
33. J: That’s right, and sounds similar to this one. (pause) Dis. . ..[RDF]   
34. H: ‘‘Dismiss.’’   
35. J: No. Class dismissed. No. ‘‘Disappear.’’[D]   
36. H: ‘‘Disappear?’’   
37. J: Uhuh.   
38. H: Okay, (\*\*\*)   
39. J: And then for ‘‘disappear’’ there is a noun, and it’s not ‘‘disperation.’’[RDF] So, anyways, we’ll, I mean,   
40. this a word that, I would choose a different word here.   
41. H: Okay, so I know, I have one thing, that I would like here to respect the parallelism because I said   
42. ‘‘disease,’’ ‘‘death,’’ ‘‘disperation.’’   
43. J: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it. I like it. [FC] You know, yeah, yeah, yeah (overlapping with his last line).   
44. This is nice alliteration. ‘‘Disease,’’ ‘‘death,’’ or ‘‘disperation,’’ but you can, you can use a, a word   
45. with ‘‘d,’’ and it would still be okay. [RDF]   
46. H: Dis. Disappear.   
47. J: Yeah.   
48. H: Disappearance.   
49. J: You look it up. [DM] I’m not going to tell you too much about it. Look it up in your dictionary.   
50. Um. The spelling of diseases is not the way it should be, but, you know, I just wrote it down. [MCF]

Feng’s conference was noticeably different from the other two in that John only marked six critical features on six different topics with about the same distribution of negotiating moves as in Eun Young’s conference. Feng’s conference was almost entirely taken up with rather lengthy attention to a few words, which may account for the low number of MCFs. In fact, 69 percent of all the talk in Feng’s conference was in regard to five words: ‘‘pollution,’’ ‘‘honking,’’ ‘‘avoid,’’ ‘‘make,’’ and ‘‘hence.’’ Otherwise, the pattern of negotiation was similar to John’s other conferences.

# Summary of negotiation and scaffolding

From the perspective of the use of negotiation or scaffolding in conference talk, the teachers are not entirely dissimilar. All the negotiation tactics as well as most of the scaffolding tactics coded could be found in each teacher’s conferences. In response to Research Question 1, however, when the features of both frameworks are interfaced, a distinct profile of learner-engaging discourse can be seen for each teacher.

All three types of negotiating tactics examined in this study were found in the discourse of both teachers although the distribution between the two teachers is different (see Table 3). Mary showed more variation in the use of all three negotiating features among her students. Sung Won was less proficient in orally expressing his writing intentions, and he appeared to have received many more requests for clarification and many more comprehension or confirmation checks. Overall, John did not negotiate as much as Mary did, and he did not seem to vary his use among his students. He made few clarification requests, but this is not unexpected since the students produced relatively short responses to John’s comments or knowledge-display questions, which did not require clarification. Only in revision clarification moves were John’s conferences similar to Mary’s. Regardless of topic, both teachers asked the learners to think about possible revisions or indicate that they understood the revision that was being suggested.

It appears that both teachers used a variety of scaffolding behaviors in their talk with L2 writers. While certain scaffolding features were virtually absent from the conferences, less frequent, or difficult to determine, others were plentiful in both. The less represented scaffolding features include recruitment (R), frustration control (FC) mechanisms, and direction maintenance (DM). Recruitment is minimally present since the inherent nature of a writing conference has already recruited the learner. The student is alone with the teacher, separated from the distractions of the classroom, and the first draft lies between them, delineating the task. Direction maintenance is also a category that may be less evident due to the clear purpose of a writing conference. This is quite different from whole-class or even small-group discussions where the conversation can diverge in any number of ways and the teacher may need to help students stay focused on the primary goal of the lesson.

Frustration control, on the other hand, was undoubtedly present, but harder to detect since it can be accomplished by a wide variety of communicative and linguistic means and requires some evidence of growing frustration on the students’ part, which the transcripts did not reveal. It may have been accomplished by the teacher allowing students to ask questions, give explanations, and take time to respond, or by affirming the students’ texts by reading them, or giving them direct praise. It may be the case that specific teacher–learner tasks employ certain subsets of scaffolding features.

Certain scaffolding features were well represented in both teachers’ writing conferences, the most obvious being Marked Critical Features (MCF), Demonstrations (D), and to a lesser extent Reducing Degrees of Freedom (RDF), and Direction Maintenance (DM). Particularly noticeable is the number of critical features each teacher marked. Generally, Mary marked fewer critical features than John, and in addition, these features, while marked separately at different points in the conference, referred to only a few topics. While the learners spoke about their texts, Mary raised certain issues, returned to these in her response to the texts, and then returned to them again in preparing the revision list at the end of each conference. She was more focused in her choices of critical feature topics, while John’s choices were more varied.

Note. MCF $=$ marked critical features.

It is also evident that in spite of marking fewer critical features, Mary generally demonstrated more possible resolutions to writing problems in each of her conferences than John did in any of his conferences (Table 4). For example, in the conference with Carlos, Mary marked six critical features around four topics with 12 demonstrations, while John, in Feng’s conference, also marked six MCFs, but each one had a different topic and fewer demonstrations of possible solutions than problems noted.

In looking at the MCFs of each teacher more closely, another distinction is evident. Mary’s method of marking critical features was more varied than John’s and carried out by more revision clarification questions, which were typically open-ended, necessitating more than a one-word response from the learners. John most often simply stated problems directly, and if a response was requested, it was mostly by means of a display question. Examples from Mary’s conference with Yoko (see Table 5) and John’s conference with Eun Young (see Table 6) are representative, respectively, of all the conferences.

In summary, Mary had greater variety in negotiation and scaffolding moves than John, and she negotiated more around fewer topics while providing more demonstrations to address the problem. She also engaged the learners in a macro-level negotiation by discussing the same topics at three points in the conference: once when the learners presented their texts, once when she responded to them, and finally when they agreed on the revision plan at the end of the conferences, with longer sequences of micro-negotiation around these topics.

# Conference focus and learner participation

An examination of the data in regard to the second research question as to how the focus of the conference on either language or content/rhetoric concerns might impact the discursive nature of the conference suggests that the teachers’ foci may have led to the difference in the number of problems marked, the extent of demonstrations for revision, and the amount of learner participation. Mary established the focus of the conferences with her invitation to the learners to describe the organizational plan of their essays, and, except for one spelling correction, marked content and rhetorical concerns as critical features and provided demonstrations for revising these. In contrast, John led his conferences without stating his purpose, but by almost entirely addressing lexico-grammatical features. The few comments on content and structure, which were generally positive, typically appeared only as part of his brief introductions to the conferences. In one case with Henri, John took a longer turn than any other in the three conferences in which he described content and rhetorical features as he read portions of the text and asked Henri what he was trying to contrast. This might have opened the floor for Henri to explain his intentions or ask his own questions, but John continued with more reading and some suggestions for improving the contrast before returning to language concerns. Henri only managed to say ‘‘okay’’ a few times, and there was no negotiation.

Note. CC $=$ confirmation/clarification check; CR $=$ clarification request.

This difference in focus may explain the differences in learner participation and the negotiation and scaffolding moves between the two teachers’ conferences. Mary’s conferences overall generated more student talk than did John’s (see Table 7). Carlos and Sung Won participated 20 percent more in their conferences with Mary than did Eun Young and Henri in their conferences with John. The percentage of participation by Yoko and Feng was more similar, but when the amount of oral reading Mary did in Yoko’s conference is excluded, which was more than in any other conference by either teacher, Yoko’s participation jumps to 22.9 percent. Nonetheless, even if there was an overall similarity in the word count of these two students, their participation patterns were not similar.

a Turns include repetitions, reading of text portions, and false starts.

By comparing the mean and median length of turns of the learners and teachers (see Table 8), a pattern of difference between the two sets of conferences again emerges. The mean length of turn for all of Mary’s learners was greater than that of John’s and except in the case of Sung Won, the median length of turns was also greater in Mary’s conferences. Since the mean length of turns is in direct relation to the number of turns, it is particularly revealing that in the two conferences with the least number of turns, those of Yoko and Eun Young, even though the number of turns were similar, the mean length of turn was three times greater in Mary’s conference than in John’s. Although the number of turns is considerably different between Carlos and Sung Won (whose conference was twice as long), the average length of turns is very similar.

The dominance of John in his conferences is evident when the average length of his turns is compared with that of Mary’s in relation to their respective learners (see Table 9). Except for the conference with Yoko, in which a large amount of the learner’s text was read out loud, the average length of Mary’s turns is approximately twice that of the learners, while in John’s conferences, the average turn length is three to ten times greater than the learners’. This difference is also reflected in the median length of turns.

The distribution of the longer learner turns is also distinctive in the two sets of conferences. In Mary’s conferences, there are many longer learner turns at the beginning of the conferences, becoming somewhat shorter through the beginning of her response to the writing and then increasing again as Mary requests further clarification and makes revision suggestions. In John’s conferences, there are very few student turns of more than five words, and these tend to occur mid to late in the conferences, perhaps because his initial evaluation and subsequent attention to local language problems leaves little opportunity or necessity for the learner to extend the interaction, even though John does use negotiating tactics to check if the learner is following, and his learners provide many backchanneling cues.

# Discussion

The results of this study in regard to the first research question indicate that the frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding can each describe aspects of teacher talk in L2 writing conferences, but they do not capture the same qualitative features and independently do not provide an adequate profile of the conferences. Although all the conferences show evidence of both scaffolding and negotiation, viewed by either one independently, the distinctiveness of these two teachers’ conferences would not be apparent. When the two frameworks are viewed together, however, aspects of the qualitative differences in the conferences are captured. More negotiation around fewer marked critical features appears to motivate increased participation by the learners. This in turn may contribute to the creation of the collaborative stance that has been shown to be facilitative of subsequent writing revisions in tutor conferences (Cumming & So, 1996; Harris & Silva, 1993; Thonus, 1998, 1999). An added value of using both frameworks together and thus revealing a fuller picture of the range of interaction in the writing conferences, is that this approach can be applied to a range of writing conferences and the talk linked systematically to subsequent writing revisions.

In addition, the analysis of the conferences from either framework alone or together does not provide the same profile of distribution between strong and weak students as has been found in earlier studies (Goldstein & Conrad, 1990; Patthey-Chavez & Ferris, 1997). In the current study, Mary negotiated more with the learner who was weaker in oral interaction and less with the more fluent ones. On the other hand, John negotiated about the same amount with each learner, but less overall than Mary. Although the standardized test of the learners’ proficiency suggests that each of John’s learners was not at the same level of proficiency, he may have perceived them to be similar. It is possible that the behaviors of the teacher are not as adaptive to learner proficiency as has been suggested and are more a feature of the teacher’s interactive style generally or the stance they establish in the conference as either collaborative facilitator or prescriptive authority.

From the perspective of scaffolding alone, the results provide further evidence of how teachers can offer graduated and contingent assistance through dialogue (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Anton, 1999; DeGuerrero & Villamil, 2000; McCormick & Donato, 2000). Because Mary gave her students the floor early in the conference, she was better able to judge their proficiency and understanding of the writing problems to be resolved. If learners are more likely to attend to feedback in a writing conference as Ferris (2004) suggests, the teacher needs to know if they are attending to the same concerns as the teacher. Mary focused on fewer revision topics but referred to them several times in the conferences and provided demonstrations of resolution to these problems in a 3-to-1 ratio. John, on the other hand, addressed more topics in all of his conferences and in two conferences twice as many topics as in Mary’s conferences, but he consistently offered fewer demonstrations of possible resolutions to these problems.

In response to the second research question, it is evident that the goal and focus of the two teachers were very different, and this may have had a significant effect in shaping the interactional differences between them. In spite of stating a similar philosophical stance towards writing conferences in their interviews with me, only Mary fulfilled that intention throughout each of her conferences by focusing on the content and rhetorical features of the text. John’s focus on specific language problems sometimes led to a guessing game, thus limiting the learners’ ability to respond to John’s questions during the conferences or to initiate questions of their own about their writing. Mary’s content and rhetorical focus may have been instrumental in the differential participation rates, confirming Haneda’s (2000) finding that exchanges about content were longer than those about language issues. Patthey-Chavez and Ferris (1997), on the other hand, only examined a subset of content exchanges in their study, and Goldstein and Conrad (1990) did not distinguish between language and content exchanges, so it may be premature to say attention to content will always generate more learner participation. The interplay of proficiency in writing, fluency in speaking, comprehension in listening, focus of interest, and the opportunity to participate are relevant to the discussion of the relationship of writing conferences to learner participation and subsequent revisions, yet it may never be possible to disambiguate these sufficiently to identify which factor ultimately most contributes to writing development. Nonetheless, this study suggests that a focus on content and rhetoric may motivate more participation.

# Conclusions and implications

Although features of negotiation and scaffolding were found in all of the conferences, the conferences were not equally dialogic and as a result did not equally lead to learner participation in the conferences. The interface of negotiation and scaffolding, however, indicates that when there is more negotiation around fewer topics, students must attend to the revision topic, which leads to more participation and may lead to successful revisions and learning. Furthermore, it appears that conferences which focus almost entirely on content and rhetorical issues promote more learner participation even with prematriculated L2 adult learners with limited experience in English academic writing.

Although learners report appreciation for teacher feedback in writing classes, their limited and varied participation in all the conferences investigated so far suggests that teachers should make some adjustments in how conferences are conducted. This may necessitate greater self-awareness on the part of the teachers of how they interact with the learners by investigating their own conferences from the perspectives both of negotiation and scaffolding together with conference focus. The more dialogic conferences in this study suggest several strategies to encourage learner participation in the conferences. Giving the learners a specific invitation to talk about their writing, particularly their content and rhetorical goals, for example, would encourage greater participation. Discussing such goals will also promote more negotiation around fewer topics. Maintaining a dialog with the learner in which the learner has longer turns will permit the teacher to make adjustments in the kind of assistance he or she provides. Ultimately, the goal of the L2 writing teacher is that the learners will be more successful in their writing. Systematic analysis of writing conferences using the combined frameworks of negotiation and scaffolding with different types of learners and exploring changes in subsequent revisions will allow for greater comparability across studies and potentially link aspects of teacher talk with revisions more directly. Although it is unlikely that a single recipe for success will emerge from further research, teachers may begin to have greater confidence that certain principles and practices in the conferences promote learner success in writing revision. One can only hope that as evidence gathers, reflective teachers will look carefully at their own practices and modify them as necessary according to sound principles of engagement.
