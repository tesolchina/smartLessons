Whereas there has been some research on the role of bottom-up and top-down processing in the learning of a second or foreign language, very little attention has been given to bottom-up and top-down instructional approaches to language teaching. The research reported here used a quasi-experimental design to assess the relative effectiveness of two modes of academic English vocabulary instruction, bottom-up and top-down, to Chinese university students $N = 1 2 0$ ). The participants, divided into two groups—bottom-up and top-down—were exposed to 48 hours of explicit vocabulary instruction. Their achievement was measured with two vocabulary tests, Academic Vocabulary Size and Controlled Productive Knowledge, administered at the start (T1) and at the end (T2) of the treatment. Analyses of the test scores reveal that at T2 the bottom-up group slightly outperformed the top-down one on both vocabulary size and controlled productive knowledge. With respect to the former, the bottom-up group’s superiority was found to be statistically significant, although with a relatively small effect size $\cdot \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 5 )$ .

Bottom-up and top-down processing are well-established concepts ina wide range of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, pedaent ways of processing and/or organising information. Broadly speaking, bottom-up is a form of inductive (or data-driven) processing starting with smaller and/or lower-ranked units and moving upwards through larger and/or higher-ranked units. Top-down is a form of deductive (or schemata-driven) processing working in the opposite direction: from higher-to lower-ranked units (Jay, 2003). It is important to bear in mind that mental processing is almost never only bottom-up or top-down; most mental operations would involve both (Sun, 2002).

Bottom-up and top-down have also been used with reference to language processing. Bottom-up language processing works from phonemes and morphemes through lexemes and phrases to clauses and larger chunks of text. Top-down language processing works in the opposite direction, from the overall message and text structure to lower-ranked units (Celce-Murcia & Olshtain, 2001; Chaudron & Richards, 1986; Matthews, 2007; Shohamy & Inbar, 1991).

Figure 1 shows how Celce-Murcia and Olshtain (2001) conceptualise graphically the operation of bottom-up and top-down language processing. The two types of language processing seem closely aligned with the two principal forms of language use, perception and production. Language perception by its nature seems to be essentially bottom-up: Phonological, morphological, and lexical aspects of the sentence/utterance must be processed before it is linked to conceptual-semantic content. Production seems to generally operate in the opposite way: Starting with conceptual-semantic content and only then assigning grammatical structure to it. De Bot, Paribakht, and Wesche’s (1997) model of lexical perception and production shown in Figure 2 illustrates this. As widely recognised in relevant literature, language perception is not exclusively bottom-up and neither is language production only top-down, a fact which is clearly reflected by theories of speech perception and production. Take, for instance, Levelt, Roelofs, and Meyer’s (1999) speech production model.

As Figure 3 shows, in speech production the processing mode is clearly from top to bottom, but note the self-monitoring dimension of production, which is essentially bottom-up. In language perception, on the other hand, the decoding of language input necessarily starts in a bottom-up mode—with the processing of the phonemic and morphemic features of the message (Carrell, 1988; Carrell & Eisterhold, 1983; Rost, 1990), but when it comes to assigning a meaning to it the individual’s general knowledge of the world is necessarily invoked—in a top-down processing mode (Goodman, 1967; Smith, 2004). In addition, the language stimulus is often incomplete and/or ambiguous, in which case the individual’s conceptual system would also have to be accessed (in a top-down mode) to help disambiguate the stimulus.1

The concepts of bottom-up and top-down processing are obviously also relevant to the field of second/foreign language (L2) learning. How language learners process different types of L2 input would be expected to be of key importance for both second language learning theory and practice. There has been some research on the role of bottom-up and top-down processing in L2 reading and listening comprehension—notably, only the two perceptive skills. Researchers seem to be divided in relation to which of the two processing modes, bottomup or top-down, contributes more to reading and listening comprehension (Field, 2004; Tsui & Fullilove, 1998).

Earlier studies seem to favour top-down processing. Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, and Goetz (1977), for instance, assert that “the background knowledge structures [or ‘schemata’] that the reader brings to a text are much more important than linguistic structures in the text” (cited in Tsui & Fullilove, 1998, p. 434), therefore skilful readers would presumably favour top-down processing. Hildyard and Olson’s (1982) study also found that good listeners engaged in topdown processing while poor listeners mainly attended to lower-ranked elements. Similarly, in Shohamy and Inbar (1991, p. 29) the less proficient listeners performed less successfully on global questions, that is, questions which required broad understanding of the whole listening passage, but they were quite good at answering local questions, that is, questions which required attention to specific detail.

Others (e.g., Eskey, 1988; Perfetti, 1985) have argued that successful language processing may be impossible without solid bottom-up skills, suggesting that poor readers may in fact be over-relying on top-down processing, because their bottom-up skills (e.g., word recognition) are poor. In accord with that view, Tyler and Warren (1987) point out that thorough comprehension can take place only when listeners successfully decode (in a bottom-up mode) the L2 input before integrating it into their existing knowledge.

Yet others (Carrell, 1988; Mendelsohn, 2001; Stanovich, 1980) take a more balanced view, arguing that reading and listening are very complex mental operations necessarily involving both bottom-up and topdown processing and that over-reliance on either processing mode can lead to poor outcomes. Vandergrift (2004, p. 4) reinforces this view, stating that “learners need to learn how to use both processes to their advantage.”

Bottom-up and top-down also have a pedagogical dimension. Instructional techniques can be designed as either bottom-up or topdown (or mixed; Celce-Murcia & Olshtain, 2001). It is reasonable to assume that L2 instruction which is aligned with the learners’ preferred mode of processing would be more effective. However, somewhat surprisingly, little attention seems to have been given to bottomup and top-down instructional approaches in L2 teaching, nor has there been an attempt to establish empirically which one produces better learning outcomes. The present research has specifically been conducted to fill that gap. As part of this study, we used a quasi-experimental between-group design to assess the relative effectiveness of bottom-up and top-down instructional approaches to English academic vocabulary teaching for Chinese university students.

Our focus on L2 vocabulary has been driven by two principal considerations. Vocabulary instruction seems particularly well suited for an L2 delivery which strictly involves either a bottom-up or a top-down instructional design. In addition, in recent years there has been increased recognition that explicit vocabulary teaching is linked to improved learning outcomes, in relation not only to lexical knowledge, but also to L2 competence generally (Read, 2004; Sonbul & Schmitt, 2010).2

Besides, the issue of vocabulary competence in English as a foreign language (EFL) seems to be of particular relevance to the Chinese educational context. In China, teaching/learning English is an essential part of all levels of the country’s educational system. Language education in China typically involves quite sizable classes of up to 60 students (or sometimes even more!). Despite recent efforts to introduce the communicative approach more broadly, most language instruction (including vocabulary) is rooted in traditional teaching methods (grammar translation and/or audiolingual) and strongly relies on rote learning. Class activities are typically dominated by the teacher and commonly involve reading aloud, reciting, and repetition; little or no time is devoted to interactive communicative tasks. Both teachers and learners frequently resort to their first language (L1) for clarifying aspects of L2 grammar and meaning (Ma, 2009). While in secondary school there is a significant focus on developing learners’ grammatical knowledge, at university the students’ primary task is to develop their vocabulary proficiency in English (Hu, 2002b; Ma, 2009; Wang, 2010). There seems to be a widespread belief among university language instructors that extensive reading is the best way to develop vocabulary knowledge, while explicit teaching/learning is regarded as relatively unimportant and deployed relatively infrequently. Many among them, in fact, hold the view that learning vocabulary is the students’ own responsibility, but students often lack a sound systematic approach to learning vocabulary (Ma, 2009), and rote learning is commonly their most valued learning strategy (Gan, Humphreys, & HampLyons, 2004; Ma, 2009).

The Chinese College English Syllabus (National College English Testing Committee, 2013) specifies 4,200 English words as the minimum operational vocabulary knowledge university students must have, although some experts (e.g., Huang, Chen, Xu, Li, & Fu, 2004; Nation, 2006) have suggested that this number may be too low. In reality, very few Chinese students achieve even this relatively modest level of competence in EFL vocabulary (Frederic, 1997).

# RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES

The principal objective of our study was to examine the relative effectiveness of two forms of L2 vocabulary instruction, bottom-up and top-down. The study addressed the following research question: Which of two instructional approaches to vocabulary teaching, bottom-up or top-down, can produce better learning outcomes in relation to EFL academic vocabulary competence for Chinese university students?

The study involved a quasi-experimental pre- and posttest betweengroup design. For the purposes of the study we recruited 120 Chinese EFL learners who were first-year university students at Hebei Normal University, in China. The study’s participants were allocated to two research groups. Treatment in both groups involved 48 hours of exposure to EFL academic vocabulary instruction over 8 weeks (6 hours per week), but one of the groups was exposed to only bottom-up vocabulary teaching, whereas the other was exposed to only top-down vocabulary teaching. Two different vocabulary tests, Academic Vocabulary Size Test and Controlled Productive Knowledge Test, were administered to participants at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. The results from the pre- and posttests were then subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. The study’s design is graphically presented in Figure 4.

In summary, the study was designed in a way to ensure that all conditions in the two groups (including allocation of participants, instructor, syllabus, teaching materials, venues, and technology used) were as similar as possible, with the exception of the specific teaching approach (bottom-up or top-down).

# METHOD

# Participants

The study’s participants were pooled from among first-year students at Hebei Normal University, in Hebei province, China. We recruited the first 120 students who volunteered to participate in the research. The participants had a similar level of English proficiency, similar age, and similar educational background, based on the selection criteria of the university entrance exam of this university.

Hebei Normal University is a medium-ranked Chinese university located in Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei province. As the name suggests, it is a teacher-training institution. In terms of its structure and operation, Hebei Normal University is a typical representative of tertiary institutions in China.

FIGURE 4. A pre-post test between-group design.

Participants were given an opportunity to self-allocate to one of two learning groups, Group A and Group B. This was done to enable them to be together in the same learning group with their friends or classmates. Importantly, participants did not know in advance which instructional design (bottom-up or top-down) would be used in which group; in other words, their choice of group could not have been made on that basis. Each of the two learning groups was further subdivided into two classes to achieve a manageable class size (see Table 1).

Subsequent examination of the composition of the two groups showed that they were quite evenly matched along a range of demographic variables (including age, gender, level of education, parents’ level of education, ethnicity, primary language, urban/rural, etc.; see Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information). Also, as established via the vocabulary pretests, there were only relatively minor preexisting differences in vocabulary competence between the two groups, and in any case these differences were factored in in subsequent analyses.

The vocabulary pretest scores (see Table 2, in the Results section) also indicate that the participants’ proficiency level in English—at least as far as their lexical competence was concerned—was relatively low.

# Vocabulary Course

An English academic vocabulary course was constructed specifically for the purposes of the study. The design of the course syllabus was largely inspired by Coxhead’s (2006) and Nation’s (2001) ideas about vocabulary teaching. The vocabulary course involved 48 hours of EFL academic vocabulary instruction over 8 weeks (6 hours per week). Instruction was delivered per the lesson plan included in Appendix S2 (in the Supporting Information online).

A member of the research team was involved in teaching both groups. By the time of the start of the treatment, our colleague had had 6 years of EFL teaching experience in China, and a substantial part of that had in fact been devoted to vocabulary teaching. The instructor had no a priori preference for either of the two instructional approaches.

The course syllabus involved the following paper and online resources:

Academic Words List (AWL) and related sublists (Coxhead,   
2000)   
IELTS (academic module) preparing books 5 and 7: listening   
and reading content (University of Cambridge Local Examina  
tions Syndicate, 2006, 2009)   
http://wordinfo.info (English Word Information)

http://www.ldoceonline.com (Longman Dictionary of Contem

http://www.englishvocabularyexercises.com/AWL (online aca  
demic vocabulary exercises for the Academic Word List)

The online resources were deployed for looking up English-based definitions of lexical meaning as well as Chinese translation equivalents, for checking phonological and morphological aspects of the target lexeme, for collecting information about relevant collocations, and for engaging in lexical exercises.

Each lesson was structured in six distinct steps (or events):

Event 1: Introducing the spoken and written form, as well as the morphemic structure, of the target word   
Event 2: Introducing the definition and L1 translation of the target word   
Event 3: Introducing related forms from the same lexical family Event 4: Introducing different phrases and collocations of the target word   
Event 5: Presenting the target word at the sentence level   
Event 6: Presenting the target word at the level of the whole context

Group A (the bottom-up group) was instructed following the order of events from 1 to 6 as above. Group B (the top-down group) was instructed in the reverse order, starting with Event 6 and finishing with Event 1.

Appendix S2 in the Supporting Information online contains a complete lesson plan for the teaching of the lexeme transport.

# Vocabulary Tests

Two dimensions of the participants’ academic English vocabulary competence (reception and controlled production) were measured quantitatively with two vocabulary tests, the Academic Vocabulary Size Test (AVST) and the Controlled Productive Knowledge Test (CPKT); the two tests were administered at the beginning (T1) and at the end (T2) of the 8-week treatment. The pretests and posttests involved different items randomly selected from Coxhead’s (2000) Academic Word List (AWL).

The Academic Vocabulary Size Test was broadly based on Nation’s (2001) Vocabulary Level Test (academic vocabulary section). The participants were presented with a list of 50 lexemes randomly selected from the AWL. They were instructed to mark each lexical item with a $( \surd$ if they thought they recognised it; with a (?) if they thought the word was familiar, but were unsure about the meaning; or with a $( \times )$ if they didn’t recognise the word at all. When participants chose the (√) option, they were also required to provide at least one Chinese translation equivalent.

The AVST results were scored using the following procedure (based on the Vocabulary Knowledge Scale developed by Wesche and Paribakht, 1996). A lexical item marked with a $( \overset { \bullet } { \boldsymbol { \surd } } )$ and involving a correct Chinese translation equivalent was given a score of 1. A lexical item marked with a (√) but involving an incorrect Chinese translation equivalent was given a score of 0.5. Items marked with a (?) were scored as 0.5, and items marked with a $( \times )$ were scored as 0. Participants could achieve a maximum score of 50.

The CPKT was Nation’s (2001, p. 427) Productive Level Test (university word list level). It comprised 18 sentences involving one target lexical item each (randomly selected from the AWL). Participants were instructed to recover the target word from the cue provided, for example:

The Far East is one of the most populated reg of the world.

The afflu_ __ of the Western world contrasts with the poverty in other parts.

The book covers a series of isolated epis_____ from history.

Participants could achieve a maximum score of 18.

The full versions of the pre- and posttests can be viewed in Appen dix S3 in the Supporting Information online.

These two tests have been widely employed and recognised in the field (see Laufer & Nation, 1999; Nation, 2001; Schmitt, Schmitt, & Clapham, 2001), and their validity has been empirically established. However, as a further measure of reliability, the scores were also subjected to correlational analyses (in essence, test-retest correlations), and the bivariate correlation coefficients between T1 and T2 test scores for the whole sample and for each treatment group were found to be significant at .01, which suggests that the tests were reliable measures of the participants’ vocabulary acquisition.

# Analyses

To address the study’s main objective, that is, the relative efficiency of the two vocabulary teaching approaches, eight sets of data were collected: four sets of pretest scores and four sets of posttest scores. The test scores were subjected to a range of descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. These are presented schematically in Figure 5.

![](img/c82a415890549add9e3a1177929bf5a4ea52f9a00ce2044ec8d05f02813f2977.jpg)  
FIGURE 5. A pre-post test between-group design.

The study’s design allowed us to explore the following relationships:

(1). Group A AVST T1 vs. Group B AVST T1. This analysis enabled us to establish preexisting differences between the two groups in academic vocabulary size.   
(2). Group A CPKT T1 vs. Group B CPKT T1. This analysis enabled us to establish preexisting differences between the two groups in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge.   
(3). Group A AVST T1 vs. Group A AVST T2. This analysis enabled us to establish the relative growth in academic vocabulary size among Group A learners.   
(4). Group A CPKT T1 vs. Group A CPKT T2. This analysis enabled us to establish the relative growth in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge among Group A learners.   
(5). Group B AVST T1 vs. Group B AVST T2. This analysis enabled us to establish the relative growth in academic vocabulary size among Group B learners.   
(6). Group B CPKT T1 vs. Group B CPKT T2. This analysis enabled us to establish the relative growth in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge among Group B learners.   
(7). Group A AVST T2 vs. Group B AVST T2. This analysis enabled us to establish posttreatment differences between the two groups in academic vocabulary size.   
(8). Group A CPKT T2 vs. Group B CPKT T2. This analysis enabled us to establish posttreatment differences between the two groups in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge.

The latter two were directly related to the study’s main objective: establishing the effects of the two different instructional approaches, bottom-up and top-down, to the acquisition of EFL academic vocabulary.

More specifically, in addition to the descriptive statistics for the preand posttest scores, we conducted a mixed model (between-within subjects) 2 (group: bottom-up vs. top-down) $\times ~ 2$ (time: T1 vs. T2) ANOVA separately on the AVST and the CPKT scores to identify whether length of treatment had a significant effect on the scores and whether there was a significant time vs. group interaction. The latter was of particular interest because it would reveal whether gains in vocabulary acquisition were unequally distributed between the two groups, with implications for the relative effectiveness of the two instructional approaches. In order to gain insight into the specifics of the differences, the general significance effects and interactions in the ANOVAs were followed up with within-group (paired samples) and betweengroup (independent samples) t-tests. Finally, the test scores were subjected to analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) which was used to establish whether the differences at T2 between the top-down and bottom-up groups remained when controlling for preexisting variation in the scores at T1.

# RESULTS

# Descriptive Statistics

A summary of the descriptive statistics for the pre- and posttest scores is presented in Table 2. Visual inspection of the test scores’ histograms suggested a normal bell-curved distribution. Normality of distribution is further confirmed by the fact that all values for skewness displayed in Table 2 are well below 1.0, and the ratio between skewness and its standard error, and that between kurtosis and its standard error, is less than 3.00.3

Inspection of the mean values in Table 2 reveals that participants in both groups experienced a solid growth in EFL academic vocabulary knowledge as a result of the treatment, as demonstrated by the higher mean values for the posttest scores. Notably, the mean posttest values of the bottom-up group were slightly higher than those of top-down group. The significance of these differences for each of the tests is explored in the following sections.

# Results for Academic Vocabulary Size

The mixed model 2 (group: bottom-up vs. top-down) $\times ~ 2$ (time: T1 vs. T2) ANOVA conducted on the AVST scores reveals that there was a significant effect of time, $F \left( 1 , 1 1 8 \right) \ : = \ : 1 0 3 0 . 9 4$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .90. In other words, the pre- and post-AVST scores differed significantly between T1 and T2. It is noteworthy that the effect of time (i.e., length of exposure to instruction) is rather large, as revealed by the size of the partial eta squared statistic (.90). There was no significant time\*group interaction $\cdot p = . 8 5 )$ , suggesting that both groups gained equally in academic vocabulary size.

The significant main effect of time was followed up with within- and between-group comparisons using $t$ -tests. The within-group comparisons show that the group exposed to bottom-up instruction scored significantly higher on the post-AVST $M = 4 4 . 8 2$ ) than on the pre-AVST $M = 2 9 . 6 5$ , $t ( 5 9 ) = - . 2 0 . 1 3$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ ). Similarly, the group exposed to top-down instruction also scored significantly higher on the post-AVST $M = 4 2 . 7 0 $ ) than on the pre-AVST $M = 2 7 . 6 7$ , $t ( 5 9 ) ~ = ~ - 2 0 . 1 3$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ ). These results suggest that both groups made significant gains in the acquisition of academic vocabulary size over the instruction period, regardless of the type of instruction they were exposed to.

Between-group comparisons on the pre-AVST scores reveal that the existing differences between the two groups at T1 were marginal rather than significant, unequal variance $t ( 1 1 0 . 3 9 ) = 1 . 9$ , $p = . 0 5 8$ , with the bottom-up group scoring marginally higher $\langle M = 2 9 . 6 5$ ) than the top-down group ( $M = 2 7 . 6 7 $ ). At T2, however, the differences between the two groups on the AVST were statistically significant, $t ( 1 1 8 ) = 3 . 1 0$ , $\mathit { p } = . 0 0 2$ , with the bottom-up group $\mathit { ^ { \prime } M } = 4 4 . 8 7 $ ) outperforming the top-down group $( M = 4 2 . 7 0 )$ ). In order to test whether the marginal difference between the groups at T1 was responsible for the statistically significant one at T2, ANCOVA was conducted with the postAVST scores as a dependent variable and the pre-AVST scores as a covariate. The results reveal that even after controlling for the marginal preexisting between-group difference at T1, the difference in scores on the post-AVST remained statistically significant, $F ( 2 , 1 1 7 ) ~ = ~ 6 . 0 1$ , $\mathit { p } = . 0 2$ , $\dot { \eta } ^ { 2 } = . 0 5$ , although the effect size is relatively weak (.05 for instructional approach compared to .90 for time).

# Results for Controlled Productive Knowledge

A similar procedure was used to analyse the CPKT scores. First, the mixed model 2 (group: bottom-up vs. top-down) $\times ~ 2$ (time: T1 vs. T2)

ANOVA was run, and the results reveal that, again, there was a significant effect of time (i.e., length of exposure to instruction), $F ( 1 , 1 1 8 ) =$ 577.28, $p = . 0 0 0$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 8 3$ . The effect of time was nearly as large as that for AVST, as reflected in the size of the partial eta squared statistic (.83).

In contrast with the AVST scores, however, this time there was a significant time\*group interaction, $F ( 1 , 1 1 8 ) = 1 8 . 8 7$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .14, indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the growth in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge: the bottom-up group improved significantly more (mean difference $= 6 . 1 5$ ) than the top-down group (mean difference $= 4 . 2 7 \cdot$ ).

Within- and between-group comparisons conducted with a series of t-tests reveal that both the bottom-up and the top-down groups scored significantly higher on the post-CPKT than on the pre-CPKT. The relevant values for the bottom-up group were post-CPKT $M = 1 4 . 6 7 _ { . }$ ) versus pre-CPKT $M = 8 . 5 2$ ), $t ( 5 9 ) = - . 3 4 . 9 4$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ . The values for the top-down group were post-CPKT $M = 1 3 . 8 5$ ) versus pre-CPKT $M = 9 . 5 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), $t ( 5 9 ) = - . 1 0 . 7 7$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ . These results indicate that as a result of the treatment both groups made significant progress in the acquisition of controlled productive vocabulary knowledge.

Between-group comparisons (using independent samples $t$ -tests) on the pre-CPKT scores show that the differences between the two groups at T1 were marginal, unequal variance $t ( 9 9 . 7 2 ) ~ = ~ - 1 . 9 , ~ \dot { p } \stackrel { . } { = } ~ . 0 5 \dot { 7 }$ , although the top-down group scored slightly higher $M = 9 . 5 8$ ) than the bottom-up one $\mathbf { \zeta } M = 8 . 5 2$ ). The analyses of the post-CPKT scores reveal that, again, the bottom-up group ( $M = 1 4 . 6 7$ ) slightly outperformed the top-down one $M = 1 3 . 8 5$ ). However, in contrast to the findings in relation to the post-AVST scores, the differences between the two groups on the post-CPKT scores did not reach the conventional level of statistical significance $p = . 0 7 1$ ).

# DISCUSSION

The most important findings of the study can be summarised as follows. Both groups made significant gains in the attainment of English academic vocabulary, in terms of both vocabulary size and controlled productive vocabulary knowledge. It was not specifically among the study’s goals to examine the durability of the lexical knowledge attained as a result of the treatment. However, in view of the fact that the posttests were administered 2 weeks after the end of the course (and 10 weeks after its start), we believe that the posttest scores could be regarded as evidence of durable learning. It would seem that the

EFL academic vocabulary course that was specifically constructed for the purposes of the current study was quite effective in achieving very good learning outcomes, using either of the two instructional approaches.

The two groups’ high achievement notwithstanding, the bottom-up group slightly outperformed the top-down group at T2 on both vocabulary size and controlled productive vocabulary knowledge. The bottom-up group’s superiority on vocabulary size was found to be statistically significant after controlling for marginal preexisting differences between the two groups at T1, although the effect size was relatively small. The differences in the two groups’ performance on the controlled productive vocabulary knowledge test at T2 did not reach a conventional level of statistical significance. However, the bottom-up group was found to have undergone a larger growth in controlled productive vocabulary knowledge as a result of the treatment; this difference in growth between the two groups was found to be statistically significant.

The study’s findings clearly indicate that between the two instructional approaches the bottom-up approach worked marginally better for this population of EFL learners (i.e., first-year university students in China). Put simply, learners seemed to favour the bottom-up over the top-down instructional design.

This result may be impossible to explain by reference to a single factor. It is much more likely that the operation of several largely independent factors converged to yield such outcomes. In what follows we briefly consider what we believe to be the most important among them.

In the first place, it may be the case that by its nature L2 lexical development is better aligned with bottom-up instruction. According to Jiang’s (2000) theory, L2 lexical acquisition involves three distinct stages. An early initial stage involves only phonological and orthographic features for the L2 lexical entry. With the increase of learners’ exposure to the L2, the L2 lexical entry is linked to an L1 translation equivalent; notably, at this stage the L2 entry involves L2 phonological and orthographic features, but L1 syntactic and semantic features. After more exposure to, and experience with, the L2, the L1 syntactic and semantic features are gradually replaced by L2 syntactic and semantic features; this constitutes the third and final stage of L2 lexical development. Jiang’s model of L2 lexical development is schematically presented in Figure 6.

The actual sequencing of vocabulary instruction used in the bottomup approach seems reasonably well aligned with these three stages. In the bottom-up instruction, the first step involved presenting the phonological, morphological, and graphemic features of the target word.

FIGURE 6. The three stages of L2 lexical development (adapted from Jiang, 2000, and Ma, 2009).

Then the word’s definition and its Chinese translation were introduced, followed by instruction targeting related forms. These first three steps seem to correspond quite nicely to the first two stages of Jiang’s (2000) model, and Steps 4–6 of the bottom-up approach, which were concerned with the word’s use in higher ranked linguistic structures (e.g., collocations, clauses, discourse), seem to correspond to Jiang’s Stage 3. As pointed out earlier, the top-down approach involved the reverse sequence of instructional steps.

Another factor which is quite likely to have played a role in relation to this study’s results is the learners’ L2 proficiency level. There is generally agreement in relevant literature that top-down processing is more common among high-proficiency learners, whereas lower proficiency learners tend to favour bottom-up processing (e.g., Eskey, 1988; Shohamy & Inbar, 1991; Tsui & Fullilove, 1998). This pattern is probably at least in part due to the different modes of processing associated with language perception and language production. As we suggested in the introductory part of this article, language perception is essentially (though not exclusively) bottom-up, and the opposite seems to be the case with language production; Levelt et al.’s (1999) model of speech production presented earlier is a good illustration of that. In most natural circumstances the initial phases of (second) language acquisition are predominantly receptive (and therefore bottom-up). As L2 teaching professionals know quite well, the productive skills often lag considerably behind the receptive ones, and in some situations (especially in foreign language contexts) may not evolve to any substantial degree. As we noted earlier, the participants’ test scores at T1 (see Table 2, in the Results section) reveal that their English proficiency level was relatively low, indicating a natural tendency for bottom-up processing.

These two factors—proficiency level and nature of L2 lexical development—together go a long way towards explaining the advantage of the bottom-up instructional approach found in our study, although the participants’ preference for bottom-up processing may have been additionally reinforced by cultural and traditional factors specific to the Chinese context. It would appear that the notion of a bottom-up mode of information processing and knowledge formation is deeply rooted in the sociocultural and educational tradition of China (Hu, 2002a, 2005; Ma, 2009; Watkins & Biggs, 2001). The concept of gradual evolution from smaller and more basic elements to complex and elaborate structures seems to have been a continuous theme in Chinese thought and philosophy over a long time and remains a distinct characteristic feature, it has been argued, of contemporary Chinese mentality (Li, 2006). It is also a matter of fact that most education in the Chinese context (including first language literacy) involves bottom-up instruction (Jin, 2010; Peng, 1997). Jin (2010), for instance, advocates a distinctly bottom-up sequence as the most efficient way of teaching and learning Chinese literacy: 字[zi] (words), 词[ci] (phrases), 句[ju] (sentences), 段[duan] (paragraph), 篇[pian] (text). And as a matter of fact, most textbooks and teaching materials for Chinese literacy seem to follow that order (Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, 2011). In light of that, it should not be surprising that Chinese learners favour bottom-up processing.

Our discussion of the study’s findings would be incomplete without some commentary on the EFL academic vocabulary course that was specifically created for the purposes of our research. A comparison of T1 and T2 test scores reveals that the course enabled participants to achieve substantial gains in both vocabulary size and controlled productive vocabulary knowledge. It seems quite clear that the innovative design we used in constructing the syllabus as well as the use of a range of online vocabulary resources as an essential part of the instruction were instrumental in producing these notable learning outcomes. They also reinforce the value of explicit and direct vocabulary teaching for the development of both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge.

# CONCLUSION

Although we cannot claim that our results are definitive, they are indicative with respect to several points. For one thing, it appears that particular attention to vocabulary teaching, for example, in a dedicated course (whatever approach is used), will lead to successful learning of this part of a second language. Further, the particular method of course development that we used, constructing a vocabulary course which takes considerable advantage of resources available online, seems to have worked well.

Of course, the main goal of our study was to determine the relative effectiveness of the bottom-up and top-down approaches to vocabulary teaching, and our results show a clear, albeit weak, advantage for the former approach, although this should be confirmed by further studies. We have linked the mode of processing to two factors, learners’ proficiency level and the nature of L2 lexical development, suggesting that these may have been in part responsible for the outcomes of this study. We further suggest that the participants’ Chinese cultural and educational background may have also played a role in relation to our results. In this light it would be interesting to carry out similar studies in other cultural contexts where the bottom-up approach is not so deeply embedded. Should new studies produce similar results, then it might mean that the effectiveness of this approach is not (at all) to be attributed to cultural factors, but rather to features of human processing.

As noted earlier, the current study was specifically designed to address issues of L2 vocabulary instruction. An obvious extension of our research would involve examining the effectiveness of bottom-up and top-down instruction on the other major language skills (reading, listening, writing, and speaking), especially the productive ones.
