Motivation

This paper will illustrate the affordances which Exploratory Practice may offer to both EAP teachers and learners. In particular, the focus will be on a UK pre-sessional course where the author was the EAP teacher for a group of Chinese students preparing to complete an MSc in Project and Programme Management. This paper will demonstrate that, despite some initial dilemmas, EP was highly beneficial for these students and the teacher. By devising Potentially Exploitable Pedagogic Activities (PEPAs) which suited this specific pre-sessional context, the author was able to engage the students in classroom-based inquiries which aligned with the students' interests and questions about life in the UK as well as the new cultures of learning and teaching. Some questions were raised about the power dynamics and the egalitarian research approach promoted by EP. However, overall, the students viewed the experience as 'relevant, social practice' which led to skills development and better clarity about the new academic practices and norms. Importantly, EP also helped them engage more actively with the EAP course. This paper thus shows that practitioner research can enhance EAP practices whilst motivating teachers and students to work together to develop mutual understandings of Quality of (classroom) Life.

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1. The context - The role of practitioner research

Practitioner research is a flourishing area in language education and has been driven by increasing call for investigations to be reflexive and context-bound (Zeichner & Noffke, 2001). Teachers have been encouraged to position themselves as researchers ableto offer critical insights to both the teaching and research communities (Ushioda, 2020). Also, stronger partnerships between faculty researchers and language practitioners have been encouraged (e.g., Consoli & Dikilita, 2021). These calls have emerged from longstanding debates about the challenges surrounding practitioner reearch. For instance, Hanks (2017b) reports on severalisues which may prevent teachers from developing a sustainable interest in research (e.g., lack of time, lack of institutional support). Banegas & Consoli, 2021 ague that most teacher-le research is usuall conducted by teachers who go back to university and need to fulfil a research requirement as part of a postgraduate programme. They also highlight that it is even rarer to come across research produced by junior teachers. However, given their experience mentoring pre-service teachers in Argentina, they maintain that with suitable support from faculty members even les experienced teachers can engage sucessflly and meaningfully in research.

Here the term practitioner research refers o ll forms of claroom-based inquiry .g., Action Reearch, Reflective Practice) which highlight the critical role of language practitioners, including lners teachers, and school managers (Allwright, 2005). Significantly practitioner reearch can offr fresh perspectives on anguage education phenomena which tradtional rearch, conducted by external third-party researchers, may not be able to yield. This argument echoes Ushioda's (2016) small lens approach' which promotes a more sharply focused or contextualized angle of inquiry (p.6) with view to producing nuanced analyses of lassroom life. The field of EAP, too, has been characterised by renewed calls for a stronger teaching-research nexus (e.g., McKinley, 2019.

# 1.2. The issue - The sustainability of practitioner research in EAP.

EAP practitioners have been positioned in some HE institutions as operating on the edge of academia (Ding & Bruce, 2017) with little contractual oportunit to contributeto reearch which informs EAP pedagogie. This resuls i varying degrees of EAP teachers engagement with research. Factors whichoften impair AP teachers willingnes and ability to conduct their own pedagogical research include teaching workload, precarious short-term contracts, lack of suitable training (e.g., Bond, 2020; Hadley, 2015). However, this paper offrs renewed encouragement to EAP practitioners who may be tempted (or required) to conduct research within their own EAP settings. I wll show that doing practitioner research as part of an intensive pre-sessional programme in the UK, a high-stakes short course for international students, i not only possible but highly beneficial to both EAP teachers and learners. undertook this research by drawing on Exploratory Practice (Allwright, 2003), a form of practitioner research which lends itelf to the demanding realities of EAP in the UK.

# 1.3. Exploratory Practice

Exploratory Practice (herein EP) is now an established form of practitioner research in language education, which positions learners and teachers as co-researchers. Unlike other classoom-based research methodologies which are primarily driven by problem solving paradgms g, Action Reach), P fouses on etr undertandings of quality of lif i the claroom though the catlst of puzzle (g, Bree, 2006). Quality of life refers to practitioners well-being in the cassroom and a puzzl is a why-question which interrogates practices (e.g., why do students prefer working in pairs rather than in smallgoups?). EP thus invites practitioners to arrive at new understanding(s) of teaching and learning through puzzling' (Allwright, 2003). The data is generated through Potentially Explotable Pedagogic Activities (PEPAs), i., tasks which teachers and leaners would use as part of their teching and learning but with a focus on the specific puzzles at hand (Allwright & Hanks, 2009, p. 157). This is because one of EP's core aims is to avoid imposing extraneous research activities which would [take] time away from the business of the classes (teaching and learning) (Hanks, 2017b, p. 148). Rather, the aim is to enable teachers and learners to conduct inquries without experiencing burnout I this light, teaching practice becomes a form of research practice (Hanks, 2019).

# 1.4. The Link between Motivation and Exploratory Practice.

The study of motivation or the emergence of motivation through EP has been documented in a few international contexts. In Brazil, Lyra, Fish Braga, and Braga (2003) drew on EP to investigate teacher experiences at primary and secondary schoos with motivation being one of the prominent themes. In China, Li (2006) studied approaches to researching learner motivation in an undergraduate university programme. In the UAE, Al Zieni (2009) employed the principle of puzzling to investigate secondary school students' at. titudes and (de)motivation towards the coursebook. In Japan, Pinner (2019) adopted EP to explore the connection between authenticity and student motivation. In the UK, Hanks (2015, 2017b) mentored EAP teachers to use EP with their students and the implications for learner (as well as teacher) motivation became critical findings. This paper extends the debates on the motivational dimensions of EP by reporting on a study which adopted EP as a small-lens' approach (Ushioda, 2016) to investigate the motivations of 16 postgraduate Chinese students on aK pre-sesional programme. Ths study therefore foregrounds students perspectives on the use of EP and its motivational effects in one of the most popular EAP programmes in the UK.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Dilemmas about doing EP in a UK pre-sessional

During the early days of the six-week pre-sessional course (PS6 herein), I did not have a puzzle about motivation framed in the traditional sense which EP promotes. Without knowing the students or their individual motivations, I was not able to begin my inquiry with a puzzle such as why are my students motivated? However, I began with an overarching question which guided my entire study what are these students motivations t live and stud i the UK? Since P suggests that data should come from pedagogic activitie i., PEPAs); I turned my attention to activities which formed part and parcel of my own EAP teaching practice and which lent themselves well to becoming PEPAs. Amongst others, these included the following:

Day One Introduction, a short pieceoffree writing which invites students t inroduce themselves and ther academic aspirations. This is also an initial opportunity to gain an understanding of the students' writing skills.   
Classreflective discussions, these are short debates which aim to encourage students reflection on their progress and engagement with the content of the pre-sessional.

. Weekly reflective reports, these are short pieces of free writing which the students complete over the weekend to reflect on the week and discuss both academic and pastoral ideas - the students are fee to choose the focus of these texts. The main objective is for them to practise their writing without worrying about academic conventions such as referencing.

While I could see the enefits of EP, I was doubting my aility to implement it in this short and intensive pre-sessional programme. EAP teaching is demanding enough when fulflling the basic requirements of helping students 'meet the literacy challenges of achieving university success (Hyland, 2018, p. 13). In other words, I was concerned that my research agenda might detract from my core teaching responsibilities. However, as I show below, it was indeed possible and a successful experience, after all.

# 2.2. Implicit EP

Initiall, I did not tell my students that I would be researching their motivation. Although I was already collecting certain forms of data (e.g., post-classreflections on my teacher-researcher jounal), I was determined to prioritise my students' learning nees and did not want to impose the potential pressure of being researched' whilst gappling withall manner of vulnerabilities, especilly at the start of their ife in the UK evertheless, began turning pedagogical ctivities into PEPAs. Since at this intial stage, the students did not know I was doing EP, I call this phase implicit EP. I now discuss a sample PEPA which I used at the beginning of PS6.

2.2.1. Sample PEPA-out-of-class activity: Day One Introduction

I always ask my new students (normally on day 1) to writ about themselves, their interests, and expectations of the course. This task geerally enl very roadgudies to write feely; bt this time and in the sirit of EP, I fomuatdth fllowing instuctions to ensure they wrote about their motivation:

Write a paragraph for each question:

(A) What are your reasons for choosing to study at [name of university]? Describe your personal motivation for coming here and what you hope to achieve.   
(B) Why are you doing the pre-sessional?   
(C) What are your expectations of the pre-sessional?   
(D) What are your expectations of this Reading/Writing module with me?

I share here one sample answer to one of these questions from one student (Megan):

D: What are your expectations of the Text-based Studies module?

I have thirst for writing guidance. When I prepared the IELTS exam last year, my writing score was only five. Then I wrote a lot of things about IELTS writing, and things began changing. The final score of my IELTS writing part was six, which is not enough for academic writing I suppose. Therefore, I really want to improve writing ability and especially the correct expression of meaning. Under the suggestion of my friends, I need to write a lot to get familiar and collect the common expressions. However, revising essay is another important part of writing. Therefore, there is gratitude of you to help me with my text-based studies.

Other themes which emerged from this activity included the students desire to complete the selected Master's programme at a prestigious universty with an eye to gaining a professional competitive edge. These kinds of PEPAs were strategic in encouraging the students to identify and unpack the main reasons to study i the UK at the chose institution. I was able to gain an initial understanding of their own nees and desires. Importantly, with these initial PEPAs I was able to tap into the students expectations and how these meshed with their motivations.

I should now add that during PS6, I did not use EP exclusively to pursue my interest in students motivations and solely serve my own research agenda. Intead, I introduced the concept of EP to the students and encouraged them to explore their own puzes. After all, as part of their future taught master's programme they would become involved in the practices and discourses of research to complete their disertations. Thus, engaging them in doing EP during PS6 served as an early introduction to the world of social science research.

# 2.3. Explicit EP

This pre-sesional syllabus includes four sessions (i.e., 9 h) on British Culture, and it was in this context that I formally inroduced the students to EP as form of rearch practice alongside some possble research intruments (e.., surveys, interviews). This is what callexplicit EP. I encouragd the students to identify puzzles about their nw life in the UK, therey ensuring that these sios about British Culture addressed specific topics which were meaningful to them. The sample student puzzles below range from puzzling features of everyday life to broader issues of integration:

Alita: Why are the hot and cold-water taps separate in the UK?. Mei: Why doesn't the university offer accommodation on campus to all international students?

David: Why Chinese students always stick with Chinese students?

Students employed a range of PEPAs to explore these puzzes including google searches, interviews with the local residents, lassroom debates. After gaining some practice exploring their puzzles about British culture, I invited them to formulate academic Juzzles. Here are some examples:

Alita: Why do we need references for every idea in our essay?

Mei: Why do we need so many references in academic writing?

David: Why can I not find other case studies about the same topic!

They explored these puzzles by interviewing students and teachers from other class groups and conducting small-group debates in my classes as well as out-of-class autonomous research.

I now discus the core benefits of adopting EP as a form of practitioner research during this intensive pre-sessonal programme. To support this discssion, I will draw on data from PEPAs, short student reflections about EP, and several intrvies conducted after PS6. I willrefr to the experiences of those students who not only shared their insights through EP during the pre-sessional, ut also engaged in several in-depth interviews with me after the end of P6. Given the constraints of word count, I ill focus on three f these students: Alita, Mei, and David.

# 3. Implications for practice

# 3.1. Exploratory Practice as motivational practice

EP initially raised Alita's motivation because she realised that she was able to acquire new knowledge by using a variety of re sources around her, including seeking help from others. For example, interviewing people to explore her puzzles was important for Alita because she gained confidence in her spoken English. This was also crucial because her parents never wanted her t feel over. confident in case she failed, but she felt rather happy about doing EP and discovering such confidence about her performance. Significantly, EP represented a means to socialise with peers from other class. As a result, Alita enjoyed learning about other stu. dents opinions related to her academic puzze about referencing which, in turn, enhanced her motivation to do bettr academicall.

As shown by the student Val in Hanks (2012), learning that other peers share our same puzzes (especiall if this i a negative one like having isues with refeencing) may bring a new sense of calmnes produced by the understanding that we are ot alone in this site of struggle.

Exploratory practice is a kind of useful practice for me because I can speak to many new people. Before this practice I did not speak so easy with people. Interviews in the cafe were so good for me and now I have improved my personality and confidence with speaking English..

(Alita-EP Reflections, 21/08/17)

Mei enjoyed doing EP and particularly liked the interview' practice because this allowed her to talk with the local students. She used this activity to investigate her puzle about finding accommodation. Before engaging with EP, Mei just thought that it was bad of the universty not to ffer her on-campus accommodation. She then understoo that this was an ssue shared by many, and this taught her to accept challenges and consider multiple viewpoints before jumping to a conclusion. Through EP, Mei developed a new sense of autonomy and gained a degree of calmness. This also strengthened her citical thinking sils to evaluate an issue from several perspectives. Like the student Lynne in Hanks (2017b), Mei evinced a sense of elation about conducting EP-related activities by herself and 'taking the initiative' and responsibility for her own understanding.

EP taught me how to solve a [puzzle] by myself (..) Bfore EP I thought it's not good enough the university don't provide accommodation for us but after the interviews with staff and students I realise this is common and you should accept this challenge, so after EP I consider things from two sides and it motivates me that when I study I need to understand things from both side even if I don't like it but at least I understand.

(Mei-Interview-3)

Doing EP allowed David to practise his spoken English in new ways (e.g., conducting interviews with the local residents in a cafe) This was not solely a new research practice for him, but also a whole new sociological enterprise because, in his view, people do not talk with strangers in China as they are shy. Also, EP showed David that he could use English fairly autonomously without the need of resorting to Mandarin Chinese if communication broke down. Like in Alita's case, EP shaped David's motivation to communicate with others in English (one of his key motives) and, for someone who valued social interactions, it was certainly a positive boost. Furthermore, leaning from other classmates puzzles enhanced his motivation to live in the UK because by leaning more about the U culture he learnt to better appreciate the country. The desire of learning from others with similar puzzles and the benefits of recog. nising the value of other puzzles echoes Alit's experience and chimes with the postgraduate pre-sessonal students in Hanks (2017a).

Also, David's puzzing about UK asessment modes (his academic puzzle) made him feel much more confident about his future assignments. In keeping with the EP principle of understanding, he became able to accet the UK academic ystem which, in turn, led to higher motivation about his future postgraduate studies. Both Mei and David, with their acquired understandings about the educational and social cultures in the UK, support Hanks' (2019) argument that the nexus of theory and practice has the potential to enrich our understandings of culture and wellbeing' (pp143-144).

I feel its useful for the activity with the students from the other group [to explore the academic puzze]. (.) They expressed their opinions that when we write academic esays, some rules should be followed. Thus it i necessary for us to find some references to support our opinions. After that I talked to the tutor, who gave me particular explanation about my puzzlement. (...) This activity made me feel more confident and motivated about my future academic writing.

(David, EP-reflections, 21/08/17)

Overall, the students in this study revealed that, thanks t EP, they became more confident and motivated about their future studies either because they leant to accept the new educational and cultural systems or because they developed new skils whilst also carving out a new sense of learner autonomy and criticality. Also, as Hanks (2019, p156) posits, EP sems well-suited to EAP because of the tenet of integrating research with pedagogic praxis. It is worth noting that EP within this EAP context worked well because I adapted this research methodology reflexively and in response to this very setting (Wedell & Malderez, 2013). I encouraged these students to develop their own puzles by first exploring their own curiosity (Freire, 1973) about cultural and academic aspects of the new UK life. In these processes, the emphasis was put on developing understandings which were individual but ften became collctive (Allwright, 2005, p360). Therefore, EP gave the students the power to set the agenda for some parts of the pre-sessional sllabus whilst addressing questions that really mattered to them (Hanks, 2012, p. 121).

# 3.2. The motivational dimensions of EP

I must critically and honestly recognise that my students did not engage with EP to the same degre of depth (data collection and analysis) as other EAP students (e.g, Hanks, 2012). For instance, they only had one leson to discuss their interview questions and techniques with me as opposed to students who may have taken longer to refine their investigative instruments (e.g., Hanks, 2017b). There were time constraints linked to the demands f th syllabus and the cheme of work (though we had fredom to adapt and design materials). In Hanks (2017a), the EAP postgraduate students seemed to have some leeway with the Language Development module which occurred daily for 1h30. On PS6, we only had 9 h class time for the British culture-related EP practice and $^ { 3 \mathrm { h } }$ for the academic purposes one. This observation echoes Rose's (2007, p499) experience of her EP study where she acknowledges that students can indeed 'shape lessons (...) providing the course structure is sufficiently flexible'.

Nonetheless the EP experience reported here remained fruitful for these students. As such, I now outline the key motivational dimensions of EP for pre-sessonal learners who, in this study, happened to be Chinese, one of the largest demographics of UK presessionals. EP can potentially motivate EAP students because it provides:

Relevant practice, EP invites learners to explore and understand what matters to them. These Chinese learners exhibited an array of individual and unique interests, and EP allowed them to et the genda and fulfil their curiosity (e.g., British culture) or needs (e. 8., academic puzzles).   
Social practice, EP invites learners to work with others, a skil which EAP international students may aspire to develop but with difficulty and shyness, hence EP may create the perfect educational arena for socialisation. For this to happen, however, trust is fundamental (Candlin & Crichton, 2013).   
Skills development, a safe EP environment allows pre-sessional learners to practise and develop their language skill (e., speaking through interviewing), whilst developing other academic skill typical of a university community (e.g., debate and group discussion skills).   
: Clarity, thanks to the nature of understandings which are garnered through EP, learners may develop a sense of acceptance, calmness, or resolution. This is beneficial for those who have experienced some form of culture shock or bump and may need a renewed sense of security in the new learning and social environments.

# 4. Conclusion

Overall it i evident that EP can bring mutual benefits for both students and teachers. By engaging in EP, students were able to satisfy their curiosity about ritish culture and addres their concerns about academic norms. The compatibilit between EAP and EP has already ben established (eg., Baniser, 2021; Hanks, 2017a), and here I foregrounded four dimensions which confirm this synergy (i.e., relevance for practice, social practice, skils development, and clarity). Importantly, P helps teachers investigate dimensions of their classroom life, in my case students' motivation, and PEPAs facilitated the integration of pedagogy and research without compromising the former. However, as soon as I realised the benefits of doing EP to pursue my reearch agenda, I elt the ethical need to share the experience with my students more explicitly so that they may benefit more squarely from the approach. This meant that when  began supporting the students in explorig their own puzzle, I gave esattention to the development of new PEPAs to research motivation (my own interest. As such, the EP principle of mutual development of puzzes was not sustainable at all times in this pre-sessional. Furthermore, while I ttempted to keep all EP-related work within the classrom setting without asking for extra work as recommended by the approach, I sometimes asked for a ittle extra of my students. For instance, I invited them to write short reflectie tatements about the experience of doing EP. Despite these dilemmas, EP remains a valuable and feasible form of practitioner research which may support pre-esional students in thir rt encounters with acadmic life as well as the social challenge of setling down as international students in a new society. This study also indicates that EP may be congruous with the time and workload constraints of pre-sessional teachers, and therefore, EAP course managers could promote EP as an approach to foster aculture of EAP scholarship which may lead to deeper understandings of practice and good quality of life for all.
