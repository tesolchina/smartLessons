In this commentary, I discuss the value of Chan’s (2009) research-informed checklists for evaluating business English materials by providing a practitioner’s approach to using the checklists. I adapted the checklists for three different uses. The first was to evaluate the teaching methodology followed in a business English textbook from an ESP series. The second use was as a guide and evaluation tool for my in-house business English material development. The final use was also to support the design and then evaluation of custommade banking English course materials. In conclusion, I found that adapting these research-informed checklists, based on local needs, creates opportunities for professional development, tailored courses, and transferability to other ESP genres.

# 1. Introduction

Chan’s (2009) pedagogical and discourse checklists, which were compiled according to the model and framework she proposed (see Chan, 2024), were designed to evaluate business English training materials. This commentary showcases how the checklists were used and adapted to evaluate the teaching methodology in a business English textbook from an ESP series, then as a guide and evaluation tool for in-house business English material development, and finally, to support the design and evaluation of custom-made banking English course materials. These examples are evidence of how the use and adaptation of such research-informed checklists can improve pedagogical practice and support practitioners’ professional development.

# 2. Significance of practice

Chan’s (2009) checklists provide a structure which can be used to refer to research findings to develop and evaluate teaching materials. Chan’s pedagogical considerations of how to evaluate business English materials in teaching the discourse of meetings include needs analysis to evaluate whether the materials are appropriate for the target learners’ needs, learning objectives, teaching methodology, naturalness and contextualization of language models, and learner autonomy. The discourse checklist includes an evaluation of transactional and phatic talk, realistic meeting chair and participant language, politeness strategies, formality, meeting structure, and cultural difference sensitivity. The checklists provide key findings on the topic of business meetings. With some work on adapting the checklists for the local context, they can be used as a supportive framework for deeper analysis to identify gaps in learner needs and materials. In my work as an in-house English trainer at a large Japanese engineering company, the checklists enabled me to concentrate on developing pedagogical tasks, for example in the category of phatic talk, such that I could coach trainees to bridge small talk topics by listening carefully and giving spoken responses, then asking connected follow-up questions and moving towards leading discussions by extending their talk or asking for opinions. For Chan’s (2009) naturalness of language model category, I could concentrate on explicitly teaching pronunciation varieties (which trainees were exposed to), and repair strategies (Wong and Waring, 2010) to clarify and check their comprehension through repetition and paraphrasing.

# 3. Practical applications

In one application of the checklists, for example, I was working as an in-house English trainer for Japanese engineers. One group of contact lens researchers had frequent project update video conferences with their head office in the States. The senior researcher and manager in the U.S. had Chinese-English accents, which caused comprehension difficulties for the Japanese researchers. Therefore, for my Masters in TESOL thesis, I obtained consent, and studied video conference audio extracts together with the students, as we decoded what was said (Simpson, 2017). This allowed me to develop various pedagogical activities and materials focused on the students’ needs. However, when I wanted to review a textbook that I thought could be relevant for the target students, I needed to consider their English usage context and, importantly, whether the textbooks represented how language was used in business. Chan’s (2009) framework resonated with me, as it allowed me to combine research-informed pedagogical and discourse considerations into a useable framework. Since the framework was based on business meeting research, it helped to justify the categories that I included in my adapted checklists. Overall, I have found that I could trust, apply and adapt the checklists for three projects: Simpson (2016, 2018), and Simpson and Mork (2021). These are discussed in more detail below.

# 3.1. Evaluating a business English textbook

Cornelsen has an ESP textbook series which includes Technical, Industry, Trade, Electricity, Office, Money, Shopping, Legal, Metal, Insurance, Mechatronics, Health, Dentistry, Logistics, IT and Hotel Matters. In Simpson (2016), I focused on evaluating the methodology in Cornelsen’s business English textbook, Business Matters (Thomson and Haill, 2015) using a generalised version of Chan’s checklist. While the pedagogical categories were primarily the same, the discourse features, ‘Language used by chairs and participants’, were modified to become ‘Specific situational language.’ As Chan’s checklist is based on business meetings, and the textbook included other topics, the ‘Structure of meetings’ criterion was expanded to include the structure of emails and telephone conversations. Formality and cultural differences were still included.

As some of my Japanese engineering students were expanding their chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing partnerships in China and India, I evaluated whether the materials were suitable for them, by conducting a Needs Analysis and reviewing eight Asian-based ESP needs analysis research papers. These included interactions between Japanese and Hong Kong construction workers (Handford and Matous, 2011), university civil engineers in Thailand (Kaewpet, 2009), semiconductor engineers in Taiwan (Spence and Liu, 2013), chemical engineers in Malaysia (Kassim and Ali, 2010), multinational workers in India (Nickerson, 2009), call centre staff in the Philippines (Forey and Lockwood, 2007), professional meetings in Hong Kong (Warren, 2014) and Japanese business interaction (Du-Babcock and Tanaka, 2013; Tanaka, 2009). Although the corporation that I was training for had limited access to academic journals, I was able to access the above research papers through the Master’s program university access, open access, or with the support of other teacherresearchers from a language teaching association’s Business English special interest group.

General findings included: structuring written and spoken language; interaction (interruptions and turn-taking); Q&A clarification; understanding accents; showing understanding (backchanneling); following changes in topic; awareness of cultural norms; (in)directness; politeness and face; adapting language for different situations. These findings helped to refine some of Chan’s categories and criteria, such as the naturalness of response tokens and structured writing usage for business interactions other than those that took place through business meetings.

The evaluation revealed some strengths and problems with the materials, for example:

Within units, such as ‘Getting to know a company’ and ‘Customer care’, tasks provided short background contextual settings but the introduction of formulaic phrases and collocations seem to have been contrived rather than being corpus-driven. There was autonomy for the students to generate their own language and some transactional and social talk, e.g., by showing interest, but there could have been more tasks for students to visualise the situation, recall vocabulary and prepare for their role-plays. The learning objectives were unclear, and the audio material provided was staged and artificial. However, feedback from my intermediate-level students was that it was useful for them, as more hesitations and overlap would have made it more difficult. C A student’s self-evaluation end-of-unit checklist would have given them more support to be responsible for their own learning.

Formal and indirect language were presented with structured (salutations, sequenced actions, and valediction) emails and telephone calls. However, emails and telephone calls are not always straightforward and require multiple emails/ calls with changes in direction and formality, and this was not taught.   
$\bullet$ Cultural differences in social interaction were mentioned, but no examples were provided.   
$\bullet$ There was a range of accents, and clarification was taught, but this could also have been modelled throughout the textbook.   
$\bullet$ There was an interesting task with a customer requesting to change an order with imposition and inconvenience, thus modal verbs were required to reflect the social relationship. It was a great task, but the function of the modal verbs could have been explicitly explained to the students.   
$\bullet$ Another good example was one in which a Brazilian and German businessman engaged in small talk. There was good advice about giving response tokens, but this was again not modelled in the audio samples.

# (Simpson, 2016)

Overall, Chan’s checklist helped me to identify the lack of student self-evaluation tasks and to include many topic-specific discourse features that traditional checklists do not consider.

# 3.2. Using the checklists as course development guidelines

In Simpson (2018), I show how I developed a business English course for Japanese engineers, as I felt that Chan’s (2009) material evaluation checklists could be reverse-engineered as course development guidelines too. I conducted an in-depth ESP needs analysis of my Japanese pharmaceutical and electrochemical engineering students and I compared this with the literature review of ESP needs in Asia that I discussed in Section 3.1 above. Commonalities included listening comprehension with various accents, adapting written and spoken speech to fit the situation, having dynamic interaction skills such as knowing how and when to start talking in a conversation, and developing cross-cultural sensitivity. I then used the information about these needs to develop email writing practice, accent training, and interaction course objectives. The methodological approach was project-based learning with explicit training in key areas through an experiential learning process.

The six areas for each checklist I developed were basically the same as Chan’s, but some of the criteria were adapted and expanded because my course involved emails, telephone calls and meetings too, as shown in Appendix 1.

In using the checklists as guidelines for my materials development, I opted to model the naturalness of language through authentic audio samples and through practising Chinese English pronunciation features (because the students were often in Taiwan and China trying to maintain or expand their manufacturing capabilities). The analysis of overlap and turn-taking power dynamics through transcripts is shown in Appendix 2. Relating to Chan’s criteria, this task’s aim was to introduce the students to authentic language and discourse structure models. The scenarios were contextualised and co-constructed with them based on their real-life projects to expand manufacturing in China. Throughout the course, autonomy was encouraged, with grammar and vocabulary generated by the students, with post-task feedback. They also needed to take effective meeting notes to be used in writing follow-up emails and were encouraged to critically engage by asking questions about the values exhibited in the different scenarios, to deepen their understanding of actions and behaviours. The local situation was created by students who had to adapt their language for different functions and situations. There was no explicit teaching of politeness but there was an email writing task requiring the rescheduling of a business meeting at short notice, creating imposition, and requiring students to use modality and indirect requests. Different levels of formality were also included in the activity in Appendix 2. Chan’s ‘Structure of Meetings’ criteria was modified to include the structure of emails, including initial and follow-up emails to set up and reschedule a meeting, and then send post-meeting summary and action points. Bridging between small talk topics highlighted social skills, and pronunciation varieties were included in the materials to address trainees’ needs.

After course development and completion, the materials were also evaluated using Chan’s (2009) principle of identifying (further) gaps and then improving them, for example, in managing topics and supporting participants in a discussion, developing more customer intercultural role-play characteristics, and deciding whether to present results or rationale first in a meeting.

# 3.3. Designing and evaluating a tailor-made course

In Simpson and Mork (2021), Chan’s (2009) checklists were again used, building on our previous experience; we opted to do this as we knew that they could be adapted to suit our purpose, and there were no other comparable frameworks. This time the checklists were used to develop and evaluate banking English training materials for a short, tailor-made course for bank staff attending training at their Japanese bank’s head office. We paid attention to several pedagogical areas, e.g. needs analysis, methodological approach, and course objectives; the discourse checklist helped us to focus on transactional, formal and task-specific features.

# 3.3.1. Needs analysis and course objectives

The needs analysis showed that the trainees were on average at the CEFR A2 level (Council of Europe, 2020). The course was limited to two or three hours and was primarily task-based, focusing on helping customers to open a bank account, use the ATM, make a balance inquiry, and make a deposit/withdrawal. Language included giving instructions, explaining, answering questions, clarifying, and repairing breakdowns in communication. Course objectives were to support the employees and build their confidence when interacting with foreign customers.

# 3.3.2. Methodological approach

The methodological approach we used included using authentic Japanese banking forms, with vocabulary and phrases presented as scaffolded models, with translations, due to the trainees’ level of language proficiency, and the course length. Some scripts, e.g. scripts of small talk, were written by the authors incorporating natural features such as repetition and clarification.

We developed role plays that were based on their actual banking tasks and trainees had some opportunities to generate their own language to complete tasks, but after we had completed the training course, we felt that there could have been more advice about learning strategies by adding tip boxes to some pages, along with a can-do statement checklist. The trainees were encouraged to self-study the take-away materials, with follow-up options to develop email writing and intercultural awareness.

# 3.3.3. Discourse features

In terms of discourse features, it was difficult to include enough fluency activities in such a short course with a functional focus, but there were small talk warm-up tasks. There may be more opportunities to include small talk in banking encounters in higher-level courses when taking out a loan, or opening an investment account which takes more time. The tasks used formal language with positive politeness shown after direct requests by paraphrasing and showing understanding through clarification, and negative politeness through indirect questions such as, “Would you mind if we take a photocopy of your resident’s card?” and apologising for an imposition, e.g., “I’m sorry but we have to follow the bank rules.” In general, the focus was on interrogative questions and functional imperatives.

After each time the course was taught, (six times over two years), the teachers reflected on ways to improve it. In addition to analysing student performance, we revisited the research-informed checklists adapted from Chan (2009) to find ways to improve the course and teaching methodology. This research-informed reflective practice led to natural responses and clarification questions being added to the model conversations and the learning objectives were adjusted to create more autonomy in the speaking practice tasks. Furthermore, the trainees suggested in their post-course evaluation, that they could also have been taught that the reason for using indirect questions was for politeness. Similarly, we felt that the structure of interactions including signposting openings and closings, and functional moves, as well as examples of other cultural norms of ‘doing banking’ could have been presented, through diverse role-plays, with participants who could model questions about the local banking practices. To highlight the value of research, post-course research-informed teacher reflection provides a good standard for pedagogical improvement cycles by identifying opportunities to use the different research categories to creatively further develop interesting tasks for the students.

# 4. Possible future directions

In these pedagogical examples, it was important to conduct an in-house needs analysis (Chan, 2018) and then adapt Chan’s (2009) checklists for the situation-specific course. The needs analysis included trainee and stakeholder opinions as well as relevant local discourse research. Research should also be consulted to identify how or why certain language functions are used, such as indirect language being useful for politeness and showing respect, ‘we’ pronouns being used to increase group inclusiveness, and the presentation of models with appropriate cultural norms of small talk.

The courses can be evaluated with post-course trainee surveys and teacher self-reflection, using research-informed checklists for pedagogical improvement cycles. Furthermore, using and referencing adapted checklists can add credibility to these pedagogical developments while publishing and presenting about them can create professional development opportunities to explain, justify and improve teaching methodology.

Overall, research-informed checklists should be extended beyond Business English, into other LSP areas. For example, there are clinical communication speaking assessment criteria for healthcare workers (Occupational English Test, 2018), which include relationship building, understanding and incorporating the patient’s perspective, providing structure, and information gathering and giving. There is a need for pedagogical and discourse checklists in English for Medical and Nursing Purposes including authenticity, naturalness and cultural variation language models, as well as self-reflection guidance.

Using Chan’s checklists over five years, in developing various courses, gave me a foundation, as well as a framework that I believed in because of my business English knowledge, and one that I trusted because it was based on similar research contexts to those I was familiar with. Most importantly, it enabled me to evolve from a textbook-using teacher to a materials evaluator, course developer, materials writer, and coach of English for Specific Professionals, focusing on their needs, their level, and their context. Therefore, I call for more accessible and adaptable research-informed checklists and frameworks like these, especially for BELF and other important topics such as email writing, to support and guide practitioners to use research findings for pedagogical and professional development.

# Appendix 2. Relational activity

In the following three discussions, the dots mean silence, square brackets show overlapping talk between speakers, double brackets describe unspoken events, and equals means a quick continuation of talk. Notable features are how the speakers overlap their talk, give responses, and take turns. These conversational styles reveal the speakers’ relationships (This task is adapted from Angouri’s (2010) transcripts and activity).

# Part A

In the following discussion, the three speakers are discussing an overseas member of staff’s technical knowledge. Students were asked to notice how the speakers overlap their talk and give responses. These interaction features were used to show the speakers’ equal status.

1. L – yeah, I mean it could improve her technical know[ledge   
2. N - .. [hmh [yeah.   
3. S - . [hmh yeah I mean   
4. why doesn’t she come here for train[ing.   
5. L - [I mean it’s fine her work   
6. .b[ut.   
7. N - [y[eah of c[ourse   
8. S - ..[hmh.   
9. L - [is she ready to face problems [like this   
10. S- . [and to commit to these pr[oblems   
11. N - [hmh yeah   
12. yeah I think so [too   
13. L -. [hmm y[eah right ]   
14. N - .[and I mea]n I thought as you did that she was   
15. a bit [rude]   
16. S - .[hmh] (.) hmh

Note: The way these people interacted shows that they are equals because there is overlap and lots of backchannels/response tokens (Angouri, 2010, p. 382, p. 382).

# Part B

In the next discussion, the managers, J & P, are discussing with their staff F & L, a claim about damage to a manufacturing sample. Students were asked to notice how the speakers overlap their talk and lack of responses. These interaction features were used to show the speakers’ turn taking style, and unequal status.

1. F- ahmmm the latest sample anal[ysis   
2. J- ((All examining pictures)).... [but you didn’t find any impu[rities ] uhh? ((to P))   
3. P- [no n]one.   
4. L-What’s this? ((pointing at the picture))   
5. F-That’s uhm (.) how shall I put it, what can I s[ay(.) ]   
6. P- ((There’s a rip in the bag)). ..[looks] perfe[ct ]   
7. ((general laughter))   
8. J- ..[thi]s bag is not strong   
9. eno[ugh]   
10. F- ..[or i]t should be double bag[ged ]   
11. J- . ..[yes b]ut two bags will cost mo[re ]   
12. P- .. .[I’m] more   
13. worried about the corrective action.

From Angouri (2010, p. 384)

Note: This transcript shows that the managers didn’t monopolise the conversation. There was overlap but a lack of backchannels and hesitations, showing respect, and distance, but a natural turn-taking style (Angouri, 2010, p. 384, p. 384).

# Part C

In the final conversation, some managers are discussing getting security clearance for a new member of staff. Students were asked to notice how the speakers overlap their talk. These interaction features were used to show the speakers’ respect and formal turn taking style.

1. J- who is going to arrange i[t ]   
2. L- . ..[xxx]x and xxxxxx   
3. D- What type of security is there $: =$   
4. P- $\backsimeq$ they’ll need to get a security pass or just [sign in ]   
5. K- . [you know] that it takes a few   
6. wee[ks ]   
7. F- ...[yes] we did it with xxx.   
8. P- Ok, fine. And she’ll need to take the pre-departure training course.

From Angouri (2010, p. 385)

Note: This interaction was more formal as shown by the roundtable style discussion format, and represents equal status managers from different companies meeting for the first time. There was still some overlap showing natural turn-taking interaction appropriate for this context (Angouri, 2010, p. 385, p. 385).
