This study has explored the syntactic complexity features of English learners at the B1 Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) (CoE, 2001) level from both Pakistan and Finland. The learners in question were taught English as a Foreign Language (EFL) using different pedagogical methods. This study took into account various factors including the learners' proficiency level, age, and grade, as well as variations in their native language. To assess the impact of the learners' native language and pedagogical methods on syntactic complexity features, twelfth grade EFL students from Upper-Secondary schools in both nations were given identical instructions and time limits to complete an English academic essay on the same topic. The study utilized L2 syntactic complexity analyzer (L2scA) to extract fourteen syntactic complexity features, and MannWhitney U Tests were used to analyze the differences in the syntactic complexity features between the two groups. The study has revealed significant differences between Finnish and Pakistani EFL learners due to variations in their native language and the effects of pedagogical methods on syntactic complexity features. The implications of this study extend to language testing and assessment, the CEFR framework, and pedagogy in both Finland and Pakistan.

# 1. Introduction

A plethora of scholars who specialize in second language acquisition (SLA) and language testing have conducted extensive research regarding the correlation between second language (L2) complexity and proficiency, particularly in the context of L2 writing. Noteworthy contributors to this field include Bulte and Housen (2014), Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998), and Ortega (2003)

Bulte and Housen (2012, Fig. 1) have delineated L2 complexity into relative and absolute complexity, with the later comprising of three branches. Recent studies have homed in on lingustic complexity, which is a subdivision of asolute complexity. Among the elements of linguistic complexit, syntactic complexity has ben meticulously investigated in L2 development and writing proficiency by diverse scholars, including Crossey et al. (2008, 2014, 2015), Guo et al. (2013); Lu (2011), and Khushik (2023); Yang, Lu and Weigle (2015). Ortega (2003) has defined syntactic complexity as "the spectrum of forms that evolve throughout language formation and their degree of sophistication.".

This study adheres to the definition of complexit, as stated by Bulte and Housen (2014), that complexity is a quantifiable and factual atribute f language unit, features, and systems. This defintion takes into account the discret components that constitute the unit/feature/system, as well asthe nature and number of inerconnections between these omponent. This study focuses on syntactic complexity, a multidimensional construct introduced by Bulte and Housen (2012) and Norris and Ortega (2009). From a language testing research perspective, this construct is not typiclly employed in the written texts of EFL learners concerning ommon European Framework of Reference (CEFR) (CoE, 2001) levels (Khushik & Huhta, 2020). Language testing research aims toascertain the syntactic haracteristics of test takers at varying skillevels By analyzing written texts categorized based on the CEFR levels, language testers can better understand CEFR skill levels.

The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) has established itself as a widely recognized and influential standard in European language education, with far-reaching implications for non-European language education programs as well. It has provided the international language testing community with an essential reference and has significantly impacted high-stakes assesments (Hulsijn & Little et al., 2010, p. 648; North, 2007; Wisniewski, 2017). These scales define each proficiency level's functional competence and communicative functions, with learners at the A2 communicative proficiency level expected to have equivalent abilitie rardes of their first language. The leels alo lucidat th information and abilities lener ned to deelop to learn and acquire a language effectively (see Table 1).

Despite the usefulness of the CEFR, there remain certain challenges and a need for more research to refine and enhance the CEFR proficiency levels. For instance, the CEFR does not provide information on the specific language features that learners at each competency level are expected to use, as outlined in Table 1. According to Hulsi et al. (2011, p. 204), it is unclear whether leaner performance at the six functional levels defined in Chapter 4 corrsponds to the linguistic characteristics defined in Chapter 5. Additionall, researchers such as Lah (2016, p. 66) and Pizorn (2014, p. 244) note that the CEFR levels do not consider the context, language, or nationalit of the learners. It i also important to note that the CEFR's descriptors for written production were mainly developed from those for spoken production and were not a major focus of the study (CEFR, 2001, p. 220). As such, ther is a need for further research to address these issues and inform the development of more accurate and applicable language proficiency standards. However, it i important to note that the CEFR does not determine the linguistic qualitie of competency levels nor consider learners native languages (L1).

This study investigates the syntactic complexity characteristics of English as a foreign language (EFL) learner who have achieved the B1 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) in Finland and Pakistan. The learners in both countries were of the same age, proficiency level, and grade, and were given the same topic, time constraints, and guidelines to follow. The contextual differences, native language (L1), and teaching methods were the only factors that varied between the two groups. The objective ofthis research is to analyze and compare the syntactic complexity of the written output produced by EFL learners in these two countries, in order to identify any differences that may exist due to these contextual factors.

# . Effect of L1 on syntactic complexity in CEFR-related research

This review provides a comprehensive analysi f research conducted on the syntactic complexity features present in the writing of EFL learners across varying CEFR level. While the studies focus on different aspects, they ffr valuabl insights into the syntactic complexity features in learners' writing from diverse 1 backgrounds, contexts, and teaching methods. Specifiall, research con ducted by Bardovi-Harlig & Bofman (1989), Banerjee, Franceschina, and Smith (2007), and Khushik et al. (2020 & 2022) explored the syntactic complexity present in EFL learners' writing among individuals of diverse irst languages. However, only the ltter explicitly established proficiency levels according to CEFR.

In 1989, Bardovi-Harlig and Bofman conducted a study on a group of EFL writers with diverse L1 backgrounds, including Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Malay, and Spanish. The primary focus of the study was to analyze the average number of clauses per T-unit in the written texts of the learners. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that the clause/T-unit ratio was fairly consistent acros all L1 groups, varying only slighly from 2.57 to 2.85. However, i is important t note that the sample size was relatiely smal, with only ix learners in each L1 group. The writig task that the learners were assigned involved describing and arguing for an opinion, and their proficiency level was primarily determined by their TOEFL score, which averaged approximately550, equivalent to a B2 level on the CEFR.

In the year 2007, Banerje and colleagues conducted a comprehensive study on the usage of dependent clauses and clauses per Tunits in two distinct groups of individuals. These individuals had Chinese and Spanish as their primary language of communication. The data for this research was extracted from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examination. The IELTS test required the candidates o undertake two tasks: describing a graph (task 1) and expressing an opinion with supporting evidence (task 2). The comparative statistical analysis of the usage of dependent clauses was not carried out between the two language groups. However, the decriptive statistics revealed the possbilit of a variance in the usage of dependent cluses between the two language groups and task types. The study discovered that individuals who spoke Spanish as their primary language and were using English as their second language had  higher mean ratio fr clauses per T-unit acros levels 4 to 8 of the ELS exam, which coresponds to CEFR A2-C1. This was particularly evident in task 2. Upon reaching level 6 of the exam, which is quivalent to B2, both language groups had nearly identical scores for this indicator.

The investigation carried out by Khushik et al. (2020) delved into the impact f a learner's first language (L1) on their syntactic complexity in the context of English as a foreign language (EFL) writing. The study's participants were drawn from both Pakistan and Finland and ranged from the 8th to the 12th grade. Regrettably, the study failed to account for both age and grade, which have been established as sgnificant factors in prior rearch Furthermore, the study sought to scrutinize the devloment of syntactic complexty across a variety of Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) levels, with a nominal emphasis on L1 groups.

The present study diverges from Khushik et al.'s research in that i concentrates on only 12th-grade learners from Pakistan and Finland whil simultaneously contolling for age and grade. Additionall, our study aims to identify the istinct yntactic features evident in Sindhi and innish lerner at ne CEFR proficiecy level. Specifially, we examine the featres that differentiate at B1 lvel and the common changes in feature ttributable to the L1 and pedagogical method'seffect. Furthermore, this study presents succinct summary of antecedent research undertakings that have delved into the extent f syntactic complexity present in each proficiency tier as specified by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).

Despite the dearth of available data regarding how the non-native English background of a writer may influence sentence complexity, it remains possible to compare syntactic characteristcs at each CEFR level, taking into account the diverse native languages of the learners (see Table 6).

In a study conducted by Kim in 2004, 33 written cripts of Chinese (L1) universty students who were pursuing Englishfor specific purposes (ESP) at CEFR levels A2, B1, and B2 were subjected to analysis using clause- and T-unit-based indices. Kim's analysis focused on various clauses, such as adverbial, dependent, and adjective clauses per clause, the amount of subordination, and phrasal sophistication.

The scripts belonging to the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) underwent analysis by Hawkins and Filipovi (2012) and Green (2012). This investigation anylysed an undisclosed number of CLC scripts, consisting of exam responses on varied topics from students of diverse nationalities and varying L1s. English served as their secondary or foreign language. Hawkins and Filipovi (2012) and Green (2012) evaluated only those learners who achieved grades A, B, and C, isregarding the unsuccessful participants assgned to CEFR levels A2 to C2. Hawkins and ilipovi (2012)discovered that there were noticeablealterations in sentence length for leaners at A2, B1 B2, C1, and C2 levels (refer to Table 6). Similarl, Green (2012) identified sigficant disparities in sentence length for lrners at B2 and C1 levels, sentence syntax similarit (across adjacent and all paragraphs) for B2 and C1, and noun phrase incidence for leaners at

B1 and B2 levels (refer to Table 6).

In the year 2017, an analysis of written work produced by a significant number of students, was conducted by a research team led by Alexopoulou. The findings of the study revealed that approximately two-thirds of the scripts contained corrctions made by the teachers, who utilized a istof 24 error label to effect the necessary changes. The scripts were subjected to a rating system, which ranged from A1 to 2, with shorter scripts comprising 20-40 words) receiving lower ratings and longer scripts (consistig of 150-180 words reeiving higher ratings. The data collected included 128 individual tasks, each comprising three pairs of narrative, descriptive, and professional tass. Upon comparing A1 to A2, A2 to B1, and B1 to B2, the researchers observed significant ifferences in average sentence length, mean clause length in words, and subordinate clauses per T-unit. A comprehensive summary of the descriptive information can be found in Table 6.

This overview presents valuable analysis of various studies that demonstrate notable variations in result, as ilustrated in Table 6. It i crticl toconsider the possble factors that could contribute to these disparities. ne such factor could be the informants primary language of communication, as highlighte in studies that have compared learners with different L1s but the same proficiency level. In some studies, the learners had only one mother tongue, while in others, the corpora included multiple L1s. For instance, when examining the mean sentence length of B1-level EFL learners, the highest values were observed in Sindhi L1 learners (18 words per sentence) by Khushik et a.(2020), whereas Polat (2019) reported 11.4 words per sentence for Turkish L1 leaners at the B1 level. Therefore, differences i 1 may have a significant impact on the findings regarding the relationship between Sc, L1 and context of the learners at particular  level. otably, prir reerh foused n only  few indces, mployd diffrent methodologie, and utilized slightly distinct indices.

# 3. Teaching writing in Finland versus Pakistan

A recent study by Khushik (2023) has shed light on the teaching of writing in English in Finnish and Pakistani context. It was noted that although the communicative approach to language instruction has gained popularity, traditional grammar-focused instruction still holds a significant place in education in Finland. According to Korhonen's (2010) research, students often improve their writing skills through individual, pair, or group sesions. However, in Finland, writin instruction does not receive as much attention as other language abilities. In primary schools, only $7 \%$ of instructional time is allocated for writing instruction, while in lower secondary schools, it is $4 \%$ or less (OECD, 2018). For EFL, writing receives even less time, at approximately $^ { 1 \% }$ of instructional time in primary education and around $5 \%$ in lower secondary schools. Nevertheless, writing gains importance in upper secondary school, especially for the Matriculation Examination, which includes a writte component for English. The student's performance on the writing task heavily influences the final test scores, accounting for about one-third of the grade. Although writing may vary in emphasis in primary and comprehensive education, the ability to produce spoken and written texts remains a crucial criterion outlined in the national curriculum (OECD, 2018).

The English language as spoken in Pakistan has undergone a notable divergence from its origins, with distinct syntacticstructures and word choices within sentences that set it apart from native English varietes. Extensive research has identified numerous varieties of Pakistani English that have developed over time, with linguistic challenges attributed to the vast array of English spoken in the region (Muhammad et al., 2012). Rahman (2016) conducted a study on the syntactic use of English by Pakistanis, indicating that their L1 might inluence their English, particularly regarding the relative proportions of parts of speech they use. Factors such as varying teaching standards and proficiency levels also play asignificant role. Nayyar et al. (2005, p. vi) highlight that "inconsistent teaching standards and poor English" can hinder the development of English as a foreign language among students.

The differences in curricula and textbooks contribute to the considerable diversty in Pakistani English and ongoing changes. The curricula and textbooks used by English language leaners in Pakistan vary by school and study level, leading to significant disparities in language quality across educational materials. Nayyar et al. (2005, p. vi) note stlistic flaws, apparent inaccuracies, and peda gogically inapproriate content, as well as"outdated and incoherent instructional pproaches that hinder the development of students attention and insight" Furthermore, Pakistani English students often need to acquire advanced vocabulary and grammar knowledge, along with the ability toconstruct complex sentences and paragraphs (Siddiqui, 2016; Muhammad et al., 2012). Proper punctuation, phrasing, and paragraph structure are alsonecesary kills. When translating from ther native languages to English, EF leaners often demonstrate L1 interference, adherence to L1 grammar rules, and unconventional spellings.

In conclusion, the linguistic qualities of English writing in the Pakistani context exhibit unique features. The syntactic complexity features analyzed in ths study have underone several syntactic alterations due to the language's use in diverse cultural contexts and by speakers with a range of native tongues (Anwar, 2009, p. 3). Pakistani English is a prime example of this phenomenon, as speakers and writers often switch between their native tongue and English, resulting in noticeable modifications (Anwar, 2009, pp. 2-3) Additionall, ocal language patterns can evolve and alter grammatical norms, leading to the emergence f a distinct variety of English (Mukherjee & Huber, 2015, p. 412; Mahboob, 2004, p. 1052). Finall, Pakistani English has incorporated several terms from indig. nous languages, whichi reflected in its increased usage of prepositions observed by Asghar et al. (2014) compared to British English.

# 4. The current study

The present research endeavours to investigate the syntactic complexity (SC) of academic writing among EFL leaners. Specifially the study eeks to examine fourteendistinct SC indices in written compositions generated by students at the B1 level in12th grade who possess ifferent native languages but are of the same age and competency level. The ultimate objective is to ascertain whether the student's L1 influences their syntax at this level.

To achieve this objective, the study evaluates the wrten essays against the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) skill lvels which enables a global perspective on language leaners proficiency. This approach facilitates cross-country comparisons of the findings, unlike previous research. To control for genre, discourse mode, and topic effcts, students from Pakistan and Finland are directed to write on the same argumentative topic in academic English with identical task instruction.

The study takes into account insights from Ortega (2003), Norris and Ortega (2009), and Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998 to ensure that the overall nature of SC is adequately reflected in the analysis of various SC indices. By doing so, the study aims to comprehensively evaluate the syntactic complexity of academic writing among EFL learners.

Encountering research that compares learners of identical proficiency levels to determine the comparability of their linguistic attributes, particularly regarding syntactic complexity, is a rarity. Such a study would provide invaluable insights into learners performance levels within specific competency tiers. As Huhta (2013, p.1) noted, "Learners do not acquire knowledge through identical methodologies, nor do they master comparable concepts.".

# 5. Methods

# 5.1. Goal and research question

The principal objective of the present investigation was to explore the syntactic ntricacy characteristics manifested by individuals from Finland and Pakistan, who are learning English as a non-native language. The following question is addressed:

Which syntactic complexity characteristics can distinguish Finnish and Pakistani EFL learners who exhibit similar levels of age and proficiency, but distinct native languages?

# 5.2. A plan for attaining the objective and addressing the research issue

It is widely held that individuals who posses the same level of proficiency within the CEFR necessarily exhibit equivalent linguistic abilities. The cEFR proficiency frameworks employ universally applicable scales to delineate language skill levels across multiple languages. These levels demonstrat that linguisic attributes are comparable among learners of the same language, irrespective of their native language, background, and context. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that learners in disparate regions of the world may develop language skill diffrently due to divers contextual seings, ducational environments, and mother tongues all of which can significantly impact the development of foreign language skills.

A comprehensive research endeavour was initiated with the objective of exploring and contrasting the impact of an individual's primary linguistic medium on the level of syntactic complexity evident in the writtendiscourse of Finnish and Sindhi pupils who have attained a B1 standard of competence in English as a second language.

# 5.3. Participants and writing task

An analysis was conducted on twelfth-grade students in both Finland and Pakistan who were studying English as a foreign lan guage. Participants were pecifically elected based ontheir language learning backgrounds and ranged in age from17 to 18 years see, Table 2). This study is unique in its focus on this particular group of leaners. It was observed that English is a compulsory subject in Pakistan, beginning in primary and continuing through the final year of upper secondary school. Conversely, in Finland, English is not mandatory, yet a significant majority of students learn it from elementary through secondary school.

The writing topic at hand was derived from a project, which was carried out at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland. As acrucial component of this project, Finnish students, who were in the process of acquiring English language skill as a foreign language, were assigned with the task of composing an argumentative essy in English concerning the topic of "No mobile phones in clas." The data pertaining to Pakistan was procured through the implementation of the uniform parameters that were previously utilized in the previous project. The students were closely monitored by both teachers and researchers during the writing process Uniformity was ensured by providing all students with identical instructions and time limits, and the topic was deliberately kept singular to eliminate any potential impact arising from the genre or mode of discourse. To protect the students' privacy, their identities were substituted with code numbers during transcription.

# 5.4. Rating of essays

The assessment methodologies and training regimens employed in the rating proces were similar in both Pakistan and Finland. It is imperative to note, however, that the Finnish data had previously been colected in DIALUKI project conducted in Finland, whil the same procedures were employed to gather and evaluate data from Pakistan. A total of seventeen Pakistani and three Finnish raters employed a six-point CEFR writing scale t assess th scripts. The Finnish texts were evaluated by aminimum of three raters, whereas the Pakistani texts were rated by four raters. Additionall, two Finnishraters (out of a poo of thee valuated roughly one-third of the Pakistani samples, with two of the aforementioned raters having assessed the Finnish scripts in the previous research project. The evaluators, who originated from the nation of Pakistan, posesed plethora of diverse qualifications, ranging from the master's degree programs to the attainment f doctorate degres. Furthermore, their extensive backgrounds in instructing EFL spanned five to fteen years. In contrast, the raters from Finland were university EFL teaching staf members proficient in English, who participated in both prior and ongoing research projects.

An analysis was conducted of allratings using Facets, a Multifaceted Rasch analysis software developed by Linacre (2009). The purpose of this analysis was to measure the writing abilit and text quality of each cript, with the measurements being rounded to the nearest CEFR level. To ensure the qualit of the ratings, we used Infit Mean Square values, as recommended by Engelhard (1994) and Lunz et al. (1990). During the analysis process, i was discovered that two of the 17 Pakistani raters exhibited significant harshness or leniency compared to the others. Consequently, these raters were excluded from the data analysis. However, the remaining Pakistani and Finnish raters accurately applied the CEFR scales, with only minor differences in their strictness and leniency.

Throughout the entirety of our analysis process we made a concerted efort to uphold the utmost accuracy of our data. This was a pivotal aspect of our work, and we took great care to ensure that our findings were founded on reliable and trustworthy information.

# 5.5. Cleaning of the written corpus

According to the research conducted by McNamara et al., (2014, p.155-6), it is highly recommended that automated toos with precise capabilities be utilized to systematically clean at least $9 5 \%$ of corpora in order to extract linguistic features. As a result, the scripts were thoroughly analyzed to remove endnotes, topic names, and topic numbers, whil missng punctuation marks were added and spelling errors were corrected to ensure proper word recognition.

In line with the recommendations of Banerje et al. (2007), exhaustive tests were carried out to ensure that the indexes were not impacted by fragments, erors, or missing punctuation. The automated applications were rigorousl assessed to validat their eficacy in detecing and eliminating these errors. To further enhance the accuracy of the corpus, sample texts from the actual data set were scrutinized multiple times, both with and without erors, to determine the categories of mistakes that required rectification.

Additionall, texts that were concise, written in the participants' native language, or contained duplicated instructions and concepts were disqualfie. The reearcher atended all datacollection sessios t identify off-topic texts that could have en detected as plagiarism. Finally, SPs normality checks were performed on each SC index, and one to three outliers per index were removed as the final step in the data cleaning procedure.

# 5.6. Linguistic computation

The process of computational linguistics entails the automated identification of linguistic features from a corpus of written or spoken language samples. This is achieved by assgning numerical values to various indices of syntactic complexity (SC), such as sentence length and the number of adverbial phrases. The calculations are based on the ApplePie parser (Sekine & Grishman, 1995) and the POS tagger (Brill, 1995).

In the present study, fourtee features of syntactic complexity were extracted from each text to examine how syntactic complexity features vary de to the ffct of th1 across iffen CF proficiency les for lgage ners. This stgtion uilised te 2 Syntactic Complexity Analyser (L2SCA).

Table 3 presents the indices calculated using L2SCA, a tool developed by Lu (2010) that generates results for fourteen SC indices including those recommended by Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) and Ortega 2003. The outcomes from L2SCA were exported to SP for statistical analysis.

# 5.7. Statistical analyses

The procedure of data analysis necesitated the performance of normality tests for each syntactic complexity characteristic. Within the Pakistani dataset, two extreme outliers were identified and removed. However, the majorit of syntactic complexity variables in the Pakistani context were observed to be skewed, rendering T-tests unsuitable for data analysis As an alternative, the Man-Whitney U test was utilized, which isa non-parametric examination that evaluates the variance between two independent groups based on ordinal or non-normal continuous data. Unlike the t-test, which scrutinizes means, the Mann-Whitney U test asseses medians and verifies whether a significant difference exists between the rans of the two groups. This is accomplished by converting scores into ranks, thereby rendering the actual distrbution of the scores irrlevant. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to compare the syntactic complexity features of Finnish EFL learner from Finland and Sindhi EFL leaners from Pakistan. The Z-value methodology as delineated in Lenhard and Lenhard (2016) was implemented to calculate the effect size.

# 6. Results

The pedagogical domain of language education holds immense significance in the meticulous analysis of how an individual's primary language (L1) impacts the intricacy of their writing, particularly with reference to the B1 proficiency level, as designated by the Common uropean Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). It i imperative to note that the previous research undertaken in this domain has not yet been able to compare two distinct L1 groups in a controlled seting whil taking into account various factors such as age, task type, topic, task time duration, task planning, and instructional settings in English or the native language. These factors have been scrupulously regulated to isolate the impact of L1 and teaching techniques. ur study presents findings in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, which contain crucial statistical values, including P, t and Cohen's d, as well as descritive statistics. The results of our study reveal significant differences and simlarities in sentence structure complexit at the 1 CFR level, with notable differences based on L1. The results presented in Fig. 2 are clearly depicted and easily interpretable at the CEFR level B1 for 12th-grade students, encompassing two distinct L1 groups (Finnish and Sindhi). Each individual syntactic complexity feature is graphicall represented, providing a comprehensive view of the differences between the two language groups at this intermediate proficiency level. In addition to that, the descriptive findings are presented in Table 5.

# 6.1. A notable discrepancy exists in the syntactic proficiency between Finnish and Pakistani EFL learners

To addres the RQ, we conducted a comparaive analysis of the Finnish and Sindhi 12th-grade students at the B1 level o explore the influence of different L1 backgrounds on syntactic complexity characteristics. Our findings indicate that the learners' L1 backgrounds significantly impacted most of the SC indices. We administered a Mann-Whitney U test on each of the fourteen syntactic complexity variables to assess these disparities (see, Table 4 and for descriptive statistics Table 5).

# 6.1.1. Length production units

The data presented in Table 6 reveals several significant trends regarding the writing abilities of Pakistani EFL learners. Specifically, these nrs tend to proce onger units, inig sentence, clause, and -unts, due to the inlunce f thr . his trend was evident in most cases, with Pakistani learners consistently generating longer units than their Finnish counterparts of similar age and proficiency.

The results indicate that the Sindhi L1 group of EFL learners from Pakistan exhibited significantly longer sentence lengths than the Finnish L1 group of EFL learners from Finland, with a z-score of 6.248 and a p-value of $< . 0 0 1$ . The Sindhi L1 group also displayed significantly greater T-unit length than the Finnish L1 group, with a z-score of 3.697 and a p-value of $< . 0 0 1$ . Interestingly, the Sindhi L1 group also demonstrated greater syntactic complexity in thir writing, despite the length of their production units diffring from those of the Finns.

Overall, these findings suggest that L1 influence is crucial factor in EFL writig, particularly in the case of Pakistani learners. By recognizing this trend, educators can better tailor ther teaching aproaches to addressthe unique challenges and trengths of leaners from different linguistic backgrounds.

# 6.1.2. Complexity of sentences

The study focused on analyzing the complexity of sentences the number of clauses per sentence, and the length of production units. The findings indicated that the group of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) leaners from Pakistan with Sindhi as their first language exhibited a substantiall higher number of clauses per sentence in comparison to the EFL leaners from Finland with Finish as their first language $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = 4 . 1 5 4$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \check { \iota } }$

# 6.1.3. Subordination

This study investigated the role of subordination in the writing patterns of EFL learners, focusing on factors such as clauses per Tunit, complex T-unit per T-unit, dependent clauses per clause, and dependent clauses per T-units. The findings revealed that EFL learners from Finland, whose native language is Finnish, demonstrated higher complexity in their T-units than EFL learners from Pakistan, whose L1 is Sindhi. This discrepancy was statistically significant ${ \bf \ ( z = - 3 . 0 9 }$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ . Moreover, the Finnish group exhibited a significantly larger number of dependent clauses per clause in comparison to the Sindhi group $( \mathbf { z } = - 3 . 6 2$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ , as well as more dependent clauses per T-units $\mathbf { \tilde { z } } = - 2 . 1 1$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 3 5$ . However, the two groups did not show any significant differences in terms of clauses per T-unit.

# 6.1.4. Coordination

This study examined the use of coordinate phrases in clauses and T-units per sentence among EFL learners from Pakistan and Finland. The results showed that the Sindhi L1 group from Pakistan used more T-units per sentence compared to the Finnish L1 group, with a significant difference ( $\mathbf { \zeta } _ { \mathbf { Z } } = 6 . 7 5$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ . Additionally, the Sindhi L1 group also had a significantly higher number of coordinate phrases per T-unit $z = 4 . 2 6$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 $ ) and per clause ( $\mathbf { Z } = 4 . 2 6$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ compared to the Finnish L1 group.

# 6.1.5. Particular structures

Finally, this study investigated the complexity of nominals and verb phrases among EFL learners from two different L1 groups,

Sindhi speakers from Pakistan and Finnish speakers from Finland. The research evaluated complex nominals per clause, complex nominals per T-unit, and verb phrases per T-unit. The results indicated that the Sindhi group had significantly higher instances of complex nominals per clause and T-unit than the Finnish group ${ \bf \left( z = 2 . 0 8 \right. }$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 3 7$ and ${ \bf z } = 2 . 0 4 $ $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 0 4 2$ ,respectively). Conversely, the Finnish group exhibited significantly more verb phrases per T-unit than the Sindhi group $( \mathbf { z } = - 2 . 0 4 $ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 4 2 )$ These findings suggest that L1 influence plays a significant role in the complexity of nominals and verb phrases in EFL learners.

# 7. Discussion

The focus of this study i centred on a crucial area of research, namely the language foundation of the CEFR levels (see, Hulstijn, 2007; Bartning et al., 2010; Wisniewski, 2017). Prior research (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2007) has delved into the correlation between language proficiency and syntactic complexity, with specific emphasis on CEFR levels (e.g., Alexopoulou et al., 2017; Hawkins et al., 2012; Green, 2012; Gyllstad et al., 2014; Verspoor et al., 2012). In order to further advance the discourse on this subject, the present study analyzed fourteen indices of syntactic complexity utilizing automated natural language processing systems in order to scrutinize syntactic complexity as an entity with multiple dimensions (see Norris & Ortega, 2009; Bulte & Housen, 2012). The objective of the study is to investigate whether the native language of EFL learners has an impact on their writing's syntactic complexity while taking into account that their overallEFL writig ability, age, and grade are equivalent. To accomplish thi oal, learners from two distint countries were observed.

To better align the findings of this study with prior research, the most pertinent findings from the literature that preceded it are presented. Previous research has compared EFL learners of diffring L1 backgrounds with the same abilit to learn English as a second language. However, this study is unique in that it compares foreign language learners with disparate L1s while preserving their competency level, age, and grade. The research conducted by Bardovi-Harlig & Bofman (1989), Banere, Franceschina, and Smith (2007), and Khushik et al. (2020) are the only ones to have undertaken such a comparison.

The present discussion centers around the potential impact of different L1s amongst EFL learners on the syntactic complexity of their written texts, when the overallquality of the texts is held constant. This isue has been a topic of interest among scholars in the field of second language acquisition and has led to a number of studies exploring the relationship between L1 background and the syntactic features of EFL learners' written output.

The present study serves to present a thorough comparison of the findings on syntactic complexity in the writing abilities of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners with previous research related to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). To this end, Table 6 display the values for the same SC indices explored in both the current study and past studies including a non-CEFR-based study conducted by Banerje et al. (2007), which compared EFL authors with different frst languages. The inclusion of this study permits a related comparison to the CEFR scale. Furthermore, a study by Khushik et al. (2020) has investigated EFL learners from the same first language backgrounds as the current study, albeit wit a mix of younger and older leaners (ee, Table 6).

It i crucial to not that this research focuses specifically on the writing abilitie of young F leaners, as their skill are ften less advanced. In order to provide further context, the study compares their syntactic complexity at CEFR levels B1. The purpose of this comparison i to identify any areas in which young EFL learners may require additional suport or resources to improve their writing abilitie. By conducting this analysis, the study aims to contribute to the development of effective language education practices, particularly for young learners.

The conducted investigation has uncovered notable variations in the syntactic complexity of learners' written works, which were found to be contingent upon their native language and consequently impacted their CEFR level. The writing proficiency level was also considered when comparing various syntactical features. The inquiry has demonstrated that the learners' L influenced most of the indices for syntactic complexity. Specifically, the length indices were significantly impacted, with Pakistani students tending to compose longer clauses, T-units, and sentences than their Finnish counterparts. The authors conducted an analysis of syntactic complexity, comparing subordination, coordination, and particular structures between Finnish and Sindhi L groups at the B1 level (see Table 7). The study revealed sigficant dfferences between the two groups acros various syntactic feature, as demonstrated by the p-values:

These results provide insight into the unique linguistic characteristics of Finnish and Sindhi L1 groups at the B1 level. They emphasize the importance of examining various syntactic features when analyzing language complexity.

Table 6 presents a comprehensive overview of previous research regarding the impact of an individual's native language on their proficiency in writing English as a foreign language. In the reviewed studies, Banerje et al. (2007) and Khushik et al. (2020) are particularly relevant. However, the table did not include Bardovi-Harlig and Bofman's (1989) study, which examined higher-proficiency EFL learners (B2). Nevertheless, the above study did not ascertain any significant syntactic complexity (SC) dif ferences among the various L1 groups examined. It is imperative to note that, due to the limited sample size it is impossible to determine whether subtle or non-existent differences in SC exist based on 1 at higher proficiency levels. Banerje et al. (2007) caution against such an assumption, as they observed diffrences in SC between Spanish and Chinese EFL learners at IELTS levels corresponding to B2-C1.

Table 7 presents an analysis of syntactic complext, comparing subordination, coordination, and pecific tructure etween the inish and Sindhi L1 groups at the B1 level.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>subordination</td><td>coordinatione</td><td>particular structures</td></tr><tr><td>- Complex T-unit per T-unit: p = 0.002</td><td>- T-unit per sentence: p &lt; .001</td><td>- Complex nominal per T-unit: p = 0.042</td></tr><tr><td>- Dependent clause per clause: p &lt; .001</td><td>-Coordinate Phrase per T-unit: p &lt; .001</td><td> - Complex nominal per clause: p = 0.037</td></tr><tr><td>- Dependent clause per T-unit: p = 0.035</td><td> Coordinate Phrase per clause: p &lt; .001</td><td>- Verb Phrase per T-unit: p = 0.042</td></tr></table></body></html>

Nevertheless these dfferences were not subjected to statistical analysis. Banerjee et al. (2007) also discovered differences in syntactic complexity (measured by clauses per T-unit) between Spanish and Chinese EFL writers at IELTS levels comparable to CEFR levels A2 and B1. Although the significance of these differences was not tesed, the 31 level discrepancy (1.71 clauses per T-unit for Chinese vs. 2.59 clauses per T-unit for Spanish) was significant enough to warrant attention.

In contrast, Khushik and Huhta (2020) ascertained significant dierences in SC between two L1 groups across CEFR levels A1 to B1 Unlike the present study, which solely concentrates on specific age groups, both L1 groups in Khushik and Huhta (2020) were composed of learners from grades eight to twele, regardles f age control. The indhi-speaking group included learners from allfie grades, while the Finnish group only had learners from grades eight and twelve.

Despite the variances between the investigation conducted by Khushik and Huhta (2020) and our current research, which primarily lie in theexcusive utilzation of  lvels y the former and he absence of lenr agas lasification facto, we afirm that the outcomes of both studies are comparable. Our inquiry further corroborates the conclusions drawn by Khushik and Huhta (2020) by delving into the impact of learners' primary language on syntactic complexity. Furthermore, we ensured that the age of the learners was duly taken into account during our analysis, thereby reinforcing the credibility and validity of our findings.

Throughout our discourse, we shall delve into the inricacies surrounding th factors that contribute to the disparities in English language aptitude exhibited by Sindhi and Finnish EFL learners. The study has revealed that the utilization of the English language in Pakistan is characterized by distinctive atributes. Furthermore, the linguistic background of the Pakistani participants, whose frst language is Sindhi, may have exerted a discernible influence on the incongruities that were identfied during the course of the research.

Cultural, linguistic, and pedagogical factors can significantly impact the composition of the writing of those acquiring a foreign language. Using a language in varying cultural and educational contexts may result in various syntactical shift, leading to diverse English variations (Anwar, 2009). Pakistani English, for instance, exhibits notable differences and variants due to the practice of code switching from the writers mother tongue to English (Mukherjee & Huber, 2015). Additionall, local linguistic patterns may contribute to grammatical changes and the emergence f a new variety of English. Pakistani speakerstend to use alternate prepositions compared to their British counterpart, and Pakistani English has integrated numerous words from indigenous languages (Mahboob, 2004). Consequently, prepositions play a more prominent role in Pakistani than in British English (Mahboob, 2004; Mahmood & Ali 2011). Furthermore, Pakistani leaners may demonstrate interference from their primary language and follow its grammatical rules and irregular spellings when engaging in English translation (Muhammad et al., 2012).

A notable variance was observed between Sindhi and Finnish EFL learners regarding their production unit indices. Despite comparable writing levels and ages indhi learners displayed a proclivity towards generating longer clauses, T-units, and sentences than their Finnish counterparts. Khushik and Huhta (2020) attribute this incongruity to the predilection of Sindhi EFL learners towards producing longer phrasal-level units in their writing. In the ensuing deliberation, we shall crutinize some of these phrasal-level occurrences and their potential causes arising from Pakistani English usage.

A study conducted by Baumgardner in 1993 discovered that individuals who speak English in Pakistan exhibit a greater propensity for utilizing gerunds whil displaying a tendency to employ fewer infinities in comparison to their British counterparts. The findings of Mahmood's and Ali's (2011, p. 98) and Talaat's (2002) research indicate that there exists a noticeable contrast in the frequency of nominal and noun phrases between Pakistani corpora and British and American corpora. This observation suggests that there might be significant disparities in the utilization and ocurrence of particular linguistic tructures among diverse languages and cultures.

Notable disparities in various indices related to second language acquisition have been observed among individuals who speak Sindhi as their first language and are attempting to learn English as a foreign language. These differences in performance may be attriuted to specific underlying factors. One potential reason for this discrepancy is that Pakistani students in this study attended schools of varying types, including public, semi-privat, and private institutions. Diferences in curricula,textbooks, and instructor quality across these chools contributed to inconsistencies in the way these students acquired and utilized English language skills For example, Nayar et al. (2005) documented those certain institutions in Pakistan struggle with uneven lesson standards and subpar English instruction, which may impede the development of students' English proficiency. Nayyar e al. (2005) have ben researching Pakistan's English curriculum and textbooks, which are predominantly used for teaching English in educational institutions. The researchers discovered that books aimed at specific grade levels in different schools had varying levels of language complexity, resulting insignificant disparities in English proficiency standards from one schol to another in Pakistan. Consequently, the more substantial variations in competence levels among Pakistani EFL learners may be directly linked to these discrepancies.

The development of writing skill among students in Pakistan, particularly in the English language, necessitates significant improvement in numerous areas, including syntax, coherence, content selection, idea expansion, topic sentences, rhetorical con. ventions, mechanics, organization, and vocabulary usage (Ahmad et l., 2013; Javed et al., 2013), and Siddiqui, 2016). Moreover, the issue of inappropriate word selection remains a primary concern. Also, English proficiency among teachers is a significant issue in Pakistani English. Incompetent English language teachers are increasingly prevalent nationwide (Siddiqui, 2016). The root cause of these deficiencies in writing can be attributed to the inadequate pedagogical methods employed by educators who lack appropriate methodologies for teaching writing, as emphasized by Ahmad et al. (2013), Javed et al. (2013), and Siddiqui (2016).

# 8. Limitations

The study at hand, though insightful, is subject to certain imitations that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, the sample size, which consisted of twelfth grade EFL students from Upper-Secondary schools in Finland and Pakistan, may not be full repre sentative of all CEFR level learners. In addition, the study had limited control over the variables such as individual learning styles, motivation, and previous language exposure, which could potentiall inroduce onfounding factors. Furthermore, the homogeneity of the participant groups and the limited scope of the analyzed features may limit the breadth of insights that can be gained from the study. Lastly, it is worth noting that the study did not fully address cross-cultural factors that could influence writing styles and syntactic complexity, espcill n a comparative analysis between Finnish and Pakisani EFL leners. I is worth oting, hweer, that any single study can only provide a limited perspective and may not account for al relevant facors. Therefore, it is recommended that the investigation of syntactic complexity features in EFL learners be approached from multiple angles that take into consideration various factors that may influence syntax. For further insights on this topic, interested readers can refer to the works of Khushik and Huhta (2020 & 2022), and Khushik (2023).

# 9. Conclusion

The present investigation endeavors to scrutinize the influence of the irst language on the syntactic intricacy of Pakistani and Finnish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners at Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) level B1. The writing samples of both cohorts were methodiclly scrutinized, whil taking into account variables such as age, grade, and proficiency level. The results have brought to light significant disparities between Sindhi-speaking and Finnish-speaking EFL students, implying that the native language plays an indispensable role in the cultivation of writing sill in EFL. These findings make a meritorious contribution to the existing corpus of iterature on the liguistic underpinnings of CEFR levels in EFL writing, as anteedent reearch faild t take into account the learners' first language and pedagogical practices.

In summary, this study aimed to explore how the firt language affects the syntactic complexity of B1-level Pakistani and Finnish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners acording to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). By carefully analyzing written samples from both groups and accounting for variables such as age, grade, and proficiency, notable differences between Sindhi-speaking and Finnish-speaking EFL students were identified. Specificall, measures of syntactic complexity such as Tunit length, subordination ratio, and type of subordinate clauses were found to beeffctive discriminators. These findings suggest that a learner's native language is a critical fctor in developing writing abilities in EFL education. This study contributes to the existing research on CEFR levels in EFL writing, emphasizing the significanceof considering firs language and pedagogical methods for a more nuanced comprehension of syntactic complexity.
