# Problem questions for law students: A study guide, Geraint Brown. Routledge (2022). 246 pp ISBN: 978- 0-367-64671-4 (hbk.) 978-0-367-64670-7 (pbk.) 978-1-3003-12574-7 (ebk.)

A key challenge for those teaching or designing courses for law-focussed EAP is the need to addressarange of multiple highly specific sub-genres of writing Brown & Raza, 2020, p. 39). This boo focusses specificall on the subgenre most common in university law schools: the problem question (PQ). Here students are presented with meticulously detailed and plotted scenario-based legal conundrums which require careful consideration of the implications of the specific situation in order to provide legal advice to a specific party larke, 2017, p. 67). When settingQs, a tors are seeking tmlat the reallife process o deli with el isues that is an essential part of a lawyers practice (Bruce, 2002 . 324). he prefaceo this book acknowledge that s are  hllenge for students new to studying law or to studying law in English in a common law context: PQ tasks are ticky puzzles, deliberately open to interpretation, and rubrics may contain extra information specificlly designed to mislead. As this task requires a diffrent approach to that for typical academic essays, PQs can be problematic, even for students with prior academic writing experience. Moreover, the process of novice writers learning to become proficient in them is ofte lft up to a processof trial and error (Howe, 1990, p.216).

The difficulty finding adequat resource to use for teaching the specifics of PQs, despite a range f publications from law specialists and EAP/ESP textbooks, has often been noted (e.g., Candlin, Bhatia, & Jensen, 2002, p. 302). Law style guides and writing skills handbooks (e.g., Askey & McLeod, 2014; Finch & Fafinski, 2013; Foster, 2009; Strong, 2008) typically focus on rhetoric argumentation patterns rather than language and present few exemplars, usually on criminal law (not usually studied by international students, especially not in postgraduate contexts). Moreover, pecialist guides for law are ften not that ccessible for EAP practitioners without an academic law background. In mainstream EAP coursebooks, law essay examples occur rarely and may not match with what the PQs students ally have  work on, sice th tend to fos more n diss ess tye asments , let, Hamond,  Martala, 2009).

Brown's book aims tofill this gap in available resources, breaking down the process of unpacking a PQ task and constructing a coherent answer. The writer is an EAP practitioner and therefore this book foregrounds language as integrated in content. This is typically not the case in previously published legal EAP resources, as Candlin et al.noted (2002:302). The book is therefore clearly distinguishable from other available writing guides from law content specialist authors, which often provide only a few cursory, separate notes on language t also presents law content and sections on referencing and study skils, ., rearching law databases). Overall this book is focussed on academic language and literacy development for law within a process writing approach.

The content of the book is detailed, carefully cffolded, and differntiatd for beginner and more xperienced students. It considers a range of linguistic, paralinguistic and rhetorical aspects of answering PQ tasks. It comprises five main sections: a short introductory section on problem questions where theCLEO (Claim, Law, Evaluation, Outcome) stages are introduced (Section A); then the practice of research and writing responses is examined step by step framed within an example of a whole problem question response (Section B). The following section (C) considers good academic practice' providing a good deal of law content (information about UK courts and OscoLA referencing) as wl as linguistic and stylistic recommendations. This is fllowed by a substantie Section D that includes annotated exemplars of answers, sixteen problem question rubrics related to different ares of law, and templates for note taking and organisers. Throughout the book, within and at the end of each section, there are numerous tasks (self-study questions), and the final section (E) provides answers to most of the self-study tasks, although a few would have benefitted from some additional guidance.

Clearly stated aims are isted at the beginning of each section and within the sections a series of 'self-check' exercises appear at regular intervals, designed to encourage recall and reflection about the preceding content. Rather than lengthy prose explaining approaches or providing information the content is broken up into manageable chunks, with short paragraphs, bulleted lis of key points and frequent breaks for additional explanations, tasks and tips, with some colour coding. The formatting is reminiscent of textbooks such as those by Bailey (2018), where content incorporates exercises and tables to be completed by the reader as they go along, lending t a recognable elf-tudy, hndbook like fee. Differnt topics are dealt with in a logil order through sctions  C, and the tet is broken up by frequent self-check tasks. However, the signposting of thematic subsections divisions could be clearer, and the two main sections (B and  are rather long. his might make it dfficult if using this ook a courseboo to break up the content to teach in a class.

The book reiterates main points across the five sections; for example, in Part B Researching and writing which goes stage by stage through CLEO related to one example of a whole problem question esay plit up). Content is scafolded; tas frequently refer back to previous questions with built-in provision for differentiation. Tass are specificallydesignated for beginners or more experienced students, (a typical instruction being if you have some prior knowledge of Contract law, attempt task X'). Alternatives are acknowledged throughout, e.g. diffrent areas of law or types of law assignment a student might face (essays, multiple choice questions, presentations and reflective writing) and even diffrent law-related study contexts (LLB, LM and SQE-solicitor qualification exams).

A key challenge when teaching academic writing to international students in the UK is that they typically study civil law subjects, and there i dearth of appropriate, relevant exemplars in available materials. Criminal law is over-represented, presumably because textbooks published for this market are primarily aimed at UK students studying for an LLB, where criminal law is a core unit. Ths book, however, covers a range of different law specialisms, providing numerous examples of PQ rubric for different areas in the appendices. The PQ format i even first inroduced i ectio  with an easily accessble, eryday example of PQ answer, based on a scenario of astudent filing for submitting a late university assgnment. The final appendix section (E) includes three exemplars of student responses to a PQ question on contract law. These are accompanied by authentic tutor feedback, with in-text and overall comments, and this could be useful for generating discussion in class about what constitutes an effective PQ answer.

This book presents PQ tasks and deconstructs how to approach them with a good level of background and full explanations written in clear, accessible language. This makes it suitable both for those with some experience of PQ assgnment types and those new to studying law or teaching law students. At times explanation is perhaps a littl lengthy, and more diagrammatic support could have helped. The positioning of the author as language expert working in the context of law ocasionall provides nuggets of insider knowledge, e., suggesting that assessors of exams and assgnments that feature PQs often read the claim and outcome sections first before approaching the main body. One particularlyeffective task in Section B focuses on analysing instructions in a PQ regarding which specific aspect of the problem scenario should be addressed, with a full consideration of the implications of this for effective organisation and communication of ideas in the written response. Indeed, throughout this book language points are fully contextualised. For example, different linguistic and rhetorical features are preented when relevant to moves within the text or functional aspects of part f an answer. Again, the benefit of an EAP practitioner's specific insights within a specific academic domain isa defining feature of this publication.

A large proportion of the Good academic practice section deals with referencing conventions and areas. From experience of teaching law-specific AP these topics are often covered by specialist law librarians or content lecturers, so this part of the book may not be as useful for AP practtioners, dending on the remit f ther teaching. Hwver, if this book is being evaluatd as a self-stuy guide it stated aim) then this feature fits well wit its integrated language and content approach. Unfortunately, the self-study content, e.g, numerous editable table, anotatable texs and gap fil or matching exercises, although well-constructe is not designed with online contexts in mind. This might be a point to address in any future editions.

In conclusion, this book fils a clear gap in the market as a language in content approach to a specific subgenre of academic law writing. Its greatest value derives from how it comprehensively and expertly deconstructs PQ tasks, walking students through the process of writig. Language i integrated and fully contextualised within content, and explanations draw on the EAP author's insider knowledge about the genre in practice. It s suitable for non L1 students and beginner/returning law students and provides for arange of law study contexs and areas of law. For EAP practitioners this book could be used for teaching, although probably not as a complete textbook. The best approach might be t allow students to work through certain parts by themselves as self-study resource and use other subsections of the book in class-based teaching. For EAP practitioners new to working in a law context, this book would also be helpful to bridge any discipline specific knowledge gaps regarding problem questions and academic legal writing in context in general.
