Syntactic complexity

An increasing body of genre analysis research within English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has attended to the relationship between linguistic features and their rhetorical functions in academic writing. Previous studies along this line have focused primarily on lexical or phraseological features and less on syntactic complexity features, with few exceptions. This study contributes to this body of research by investigating the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in science research article (RA) introductions, using a corpus containing the introduction sections of 300 published RAs in six science disciplines. The corpus samples were annotated for rhetorical move-steps using an adapted version of the Create a Research Space model (Swales, 2004) and analyzed using five indices tapping into different aspects of syntactic complexity. Results showed that the syntactic complexity indices varied significantly among the rhetorical move-steps but remained stable across hard-pure and hard-applied disciplines. Furthermore, science RA writers employed different types of syntactic complexity features more often for achieving different rhetorical functions. The implications of our findings for academic writing research and pedagogy are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Within the field of English for Academic Purposes (EAP), genre analysis research has striven to make genre knowledge available to novice academic writers (Shaw, 2016) by providing \*insights into important characters of genres, including the organizational structure and linguistic features (Le & Harrington, 2015, p. 45). A heavily-studied genre of academic writing in this body of rearchis research articles (RAs) (Cotos, Huffman, & Link, 2017). Many earlier studies have focused on rhetorica structures or formal linguistic features of RAs on their own (e.g., Hirano, 2009; Ozturk, 2007; Samraj, 2002). Responding to the call for atention to contextualized connections between formal inguistic features and their communicative functions in genre analysis research (e.g., Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2021; Moreno & Swales, 2018), some recent studies have examined the rhetorical functions of lexical and phraseological features in RA writing (e.g., Cortes, 2013; Le & Harrington, 2015; Lu, Yoon, & Kisselev, 2021; Omidian, Shahriari, & Siyanova-Chanturia, 2018) With few exceptions (Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2020; Rshina-Pankova, 2015), however, les atention has been paid to the rhetorical functions of complex syntactic structures in RAs. Several researchers have highlighted the importance of analyzing the meaning and function dimensions of syntactic complexity in second language (L2) and/or academic writing research and pedagogy (Ortega, 2015; Ryshi na-Pankova, 2015), arguing that disconnecting the formal dimension of syntactic complexity from these dimensions could negatively impact writing pedagogy in that learners may deploy complex syntactic structures in contextuall inappropriate ways (Lu, 2021) While Lu et al. (2020) examined the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in social science RAs, rhetorical functional analyses of complex syntactic structures in science RAs do not yet exist. As Hyland (2004, p. 145) argued, academic writing reflects "social and institutional practices derived from contexts which are principall disciplinary, and academic writing learners need to \*gain an awareness of the discipline's symbolic resources for getting things done by routinely connecting purposes with features of texts' to sucessully achieve aademic litrcy. This argument finds support in Lu et al's (2021b) findings pertaning to disciplinary variation in the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in social science and engineering RAs (see Figs. 3-11).

In light of the pedagogical usefulnes of rhetorical functional analyses of complex syntactic structures in academic writing and the importance of discipline specificity of such analyses, this study sets out to examine the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in the introduction sections of published RAs i si science disciplines. We also take the opportunity to examine whether the syntactic complexity of RA introductions varies significantly between hard-pure and hard-applied science disciplines. Our analyses aim to help further our understanding of the relationship between syntactic complexity and rhetorical functions in science RA in. troductions and inform genre-based English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) pedagogy.

# 1.1. Rhetorical functional and formal linguistic analysis of research articles

The Create a Research Space (CARS) model proposed by Swales (1990, 2004) for analyzing the rhetorical move structures of RA introductions has played a prominent role in the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) school of Genre Analysis research. Broady speaking, the model was designed to \*describe the communicative purposes of a text by categorizing the various discourse units within the text according to their communicative purposes" (Biber, Connor, & Upton, 2007, p. 23). A major component of the model is rhetorical moves, which are \*discoursal or rhetorical units performing coherent communicative functions in texts" (Swales, 2004, pp. 228-229). A rhetorical move may be subdivided into steps that serve to "achieve the purpose of the move to which it belongs" (Biber et al. 007, p. 24) Following the introduction of the CARS model, many studies have examined the rhetorical move structures of RA introductions with different foci such as cross-inguistic differences (e.g., Hirano, 2009), iner-disciplinary variation (e.g., Samraj, 2002), and intra-disciplinary variability (e.g., Kanoksilapatham, 2012; Ozturk, 2007). These studies have shed useful light on the variation of rhetorical structures of RA introductions across languages, disciplines, subdisciplines, and RA types.

Meanwhile, many studies have taken advantage of automated linguistic analysis tols to examine formal linguistic features of RAs. Much research in this area has focused on the types, structures, and discourse functions of various phraseological units in RAs in specific disciplines, such as lexical bundles in telecommunication (Pan, Reppen, & Biber, 2016) and psychology RAs (Esfandiari & Barbary, 2017) and phrase-frames in mathematics (Cunningham, 2017), higher education (Golparvar & Barabadi, 2020), and social science RAs (Lu, Yoon, & Kisse, 2018). Some studies have examined the inter- and inra-disciplinary variabilit of such phraseological units and their discourse functions in RAs (e.g., Ren, 2021; Shirazizadeh & Amirfazlian, 2021). Two recent studies have also profiled differences in the syntactic complexity of different RA part-geres across social science isciplines (Casal, Lu, Qiu, Wang, & Zhang, 2021) and between emerging and expert applied inguistics international publication writers (Yin, Gao, & Lu, 2021). Taken together, these studies have contributed valuable insights into important linguistic patterns characterizing the RA genre in different disciplines and by writers at different expertise levels.

Swales (2019) suggested that the genre analysis literature has "over-explored" the rhetorical functional and formal inguistic as. pects of RAs in isolation, failing to capture genre knowledge in its fulles sense (p. 76). In response to the cal for more research to address the \*function-form gap in genre analysis research (Moreno & Swales, 2018, p. 3), some recent studies have examined the linguistic foms used by expert RA writers to accomplish diverse rhetorical goals. Most of these studies again focused on various types of phraseological units such as lexical bundles and phrase-frames and explored the rhetorical moves and steps these units are used to realize in different RA part-genres, such as abstracts (Omidian et al., 2018), introductions (Cortes, 2013; Lu, Yoon, & Kissele, 2021), and discussio sections (Le & Harrington, 2015). Arecent study by Lu, Yoon, e al. (2021) also examined interdisciplinary variation in the connection between phrase-frames and rhetorical move-steps in social science RA introductions.

The expansion of rhetorical functional analyses of linguisti forms in RAs to the syntactic level has only occurred more recently Lu et al. (2020) investigated the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in a corpus of social science RA introductions and reported that social science RA writers tended to employ sentences with diffrent types of complex structures to realize different rhetorical move-steps. In a subsequent study, Lu, Casal, Liu, Kise, and Yoon (2021) reported significant disciplinary variation in the connection between syntactic complexity and rhetorical move-steps in RA introductions. The findings from these studies point to the importance to go beyond lexical and phraseological features to attend to the connection between syntactic complexity features and rhetorical move-steps in RA writing in different disciplines. To the best of our knowledge,studies of this connection in science RAs remain absent.

# 1.2. Formal research on syntactic complexity

Syntactic complexity has generally been defined as the range and degree of sophistication and elaboration of the grammatical structures employed in language production (Ortega, 2015). In contrast to usage-based measures of syntactic sophistication that gauge the relative complexity of syntactic constructions, syntactic complexity measures gauge the absolute complexity of inherent inguistic features (Bulte & Housen, 2012; Housen & Kuiken, 2009). Viewed as a multidimensional construct encompasing complexity at various structural levels (e.g., global, clausal, and phrasal), syntactic complexity has b operationalized using a large set of holistic and fine-gained indices that tp into different syntacti structures (g., Lu, 2017). For example, the L2 Syntactic omplexity Analyzer (L2SCA; Lu, 2010) provides 14 holistic indices of five types: length of production unit (eg, mean length of sentence), global complexity (e.g., clauses per sentence), subordination (e.g., dependent clauses per clause), coordination (e.g., T-units per sentence), and phrasal complexity (e.g., complex nominals per clause). The Biber Tagger (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999) provides a comprehensive set of fine-grained grammatical complexity features based on various lexicogrammatical structures. Additionall, both Coh-Metrix (Graesser, McNamara, Louwerse, & Cai, 2004) and the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAssc; Kyle, 2016) offer a large set of holistic and fine-grained indices of syntactic similarity, clausal complexity, phrasal complexity, and syntactic sophistication. Many studies have employed these indices and tools to examine the quantitative relationship of syntactic complexity to language proficiency (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014), development (e.g., Crossley & McNamara, 2014), and production quality (e.g., Kyle & Crossey, 2018; Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015). These studies have yelded rich findings that dramatically expanded our understanding of syntactic complexity.

Meanwhile, Ortega (2015) suggested that such an understanding remains "astructural, form-only one (p. 86). Ryshina-Pankova (2015) called for a shift of focus of syntactic complexity research to the meaning dimension of syntactic complexity and examined how nominalizations are used to convey different meanings and communicative functions in L2 writing. Lu e al. (2020 further clld for a functional turn in syntactic complexity research, arguing that quality writig isassociated with not only the use of complex sructures but more importntly the genre-appropriatenesand functional effctiveness of the structures used. They cautioned that "over-- emphasis on formal syntactic complexity alone could lead to negative pedagogical consequences, as learners may be tempted to insert functional inappropriate complex tructures to increase the syntactic complexity of their writing (Lu et al., 2020, p. 2). The current study builds on this promising emerging line of research to explore the relationship of syntactic complexity to rhetorical move-steps in science RA introductions.

# 1.3. Disciplinary variation in academic writing

Multiple studies reviewed in Section 1.1 have already hinted at the importance of disciplinary variation in the genre- and corpus based studies of the RA genre. Indeed, the existence of disciplinary variation that characterizes disciplines with inherently stable features has long been recognized (e.g., Becher, 1989. Researchers have commonly clasified disciplines into hard/soft and pure/- applied disciplines in examining disciplinary variation, where the former is associated with the degree to which a disciplinary paradigm exsts and the ltter is rlated to the extet to which the discipline is oriented toward basic reearch or practical applications (e.g., Biglan, 1973). With these two classfications, previous research has yielded rich findings pertaining to disciplinary variation in the genre structures, linguistic features, and interactive metadiscourse features of academic discourse (e.g., Ca0 & Hu, 2014; Hland, 2005). Effective academic communication relies on writers employment of \*community-sensitive inguistic resources to represent themselves, their positions and their readers' (Hyland, 2006, p. 39), and better conformity to the disciplinary community's culture brings about a greater possibility for writers to persuade readers (Hyland, 2002). As such, explorations of disciplinary variation have meaningful implications for academic writing pedagogy, particularly in terms of helping learners improve their awareness of the practices and conventions of their disciplinary communities. ur secondary focus on the potential variation in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions between hard-pure and hard-applied science disciplines aims to fll a gap in disciplinary variation research.

# 1.4. Research questions

In light of the research gaps discussed above, the current study aims to investigate the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in science RA introductions and disciplinary variation in the syntactic complexity of science RA introductions. The specific research questions addressed in the current study are as follows.

(1) Are there any differences in the syntactic complexity of sentences that realize different rhetorical functions in science RA introductions? If yes, what are the differences?   
(2) What rhetorical functions are realized by the most syntactically complex sentences in science RA introductions?   
(3) Are there any diffrences between hard-pure and hard-applied science disciplines in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions? If yes, what are the differences?

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Corpus design

Following the discipline selection practices of several previous studies (Becher, 1989; Dang, 2018; Hyland, 1998, 1999), we selected three hard-pure i.., chmistry, mathematics, and physics) and three hard-appied isciplines (i.e, chemical engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineering). Guided by Nwogu's (1997) principles of representativity, reputation, and acess. bility, we sampled 300 RA introductions published between 2015 and 2019 from 30 journals, with five journals and 50 samples per discipline. The journals were selected based on their five-year impact factors from the Web of Science, and 10 texts were randomly sampled from each journal, with two texts from two different issues each year. These samples comprised the Science Research Article Introductions Corpus (SRAIC). As shown in Table 1, SRAIC contains a total of 251,138 words $( \mathbf { n } = 3 0 0$ ; mean $= 8 3 7$ $\mathrm { S D } = 4 6 8 $

# 2.2. Rhetorical move-step annotation

Each sample in the SRAIC corpus was annotated for rhetorical moves and steps using an adapted version of Swales (2004) revised CARS model (see Table 2). Following Cotos et al. (2017) and Lu et al. (2020), we adopted the sentence as the unit of annotation. The move-step framework was finalized through a pilot coding proces, in which two researchers independently annotated 60 texts (10 per discipline) randomly selected from the corpus. Inter-rater reliability was also computed as part of this process. For moves, the per. centage agreement and Cohen's Kappa reached $8 8 . 2 8 \%$ and 0.809, respectively. Given the large number of steps, we calculated percentage agreement for steps only, which was $8 5 . 2 0 \%$ . The two researchers resolved differences through discussion and in some cases consulting other researchers. At the end of this process, four steps were added to Lu et al.'s (2020) framework to capture new rhetorical functions that emerged in our corpus (see Table 2). For example, M3_S12 Ilustrations of notation and convention" was infrequent in most disciplines but rather common in mathematics RA introductions. The remaining 240 samples were manually an. notated by one researcher and checked by another researcher using the move-step framework in Table 2.

# 2.3. Syntactic complexity indices

Each sentence in each sample was analyzed using five indices that represent different dimensions of syntactic complexity. Following Lu et al. (2020), we calculated the length of each sentence and counted the number of nominalizations, finite dependent clauses, and nonfinite dependent clauses in each sentence. In light of the important role of phrasal complexity features in advanced academic writing (e.g, Biber & Gray, 2016), we also counted the number of complex nominals in each sentence. We adjusted Lu's (2010) definition of complex nominals by adding nominals containing nouns as nominal pre-modifiers based on Gray's (2015) finding that such nominals are especially important in hard sciences academic writing. As summarized in Table 3, these five indices represent global complexity, phrasal complexity, finite subordination, and clausal elaboration, respectively (Norris & Ortega, 2009).

Each sample was part-of-speech (POS) tagged and syntacticallyparsed with the Stanford Parser (Klein & Manning, 2003). We counted the number of words, finite dependent clauses, complex nominals, and nonfinite dependent clauses by adapting the Python code for the same or similar purposes in L2sCA (Lu, 2010), which has reported F-scores of 0.925, 0.830, and 0.926 for identifying finite dependent clauses, complex nominals, and verb phrases. In particular, for complex nominals, we added a Tregex pattrn (Levy & Andrew, 2006) to capture nominals with one or more noun pre-modifiers For nonfinte dependent clauses, we included the Tregex patterns for identifying non-finite verb phrases (i.e,verb phrases with gerunds, infinitives, or past participles) in L2sCA only. For nominalizations, we first extracted llunique nouns with the suffix tion, sion, ity, -ment, or -ess (Biber e al., 199 from the corpus using regular expressions in PowerGREP and manuall filtered all false positives e., nation). We then used a Python script to count the number of nominalizations in each sentence in each sample by consulting the final list of nominalizations.

# 2.4. Analytical procedure

To addres the first research question, we frst calculated the mean for each measure for each rhetorical move and step in each discipline and performed Kruskal-Wallis $H$ tests to determine whether significant differences existed in each syntactic complexity measure among different move and stes. Next followingLu et al. (2020), we ientifidthe rhetoricl sts that differed signficanly from the group for each syntactic complexity measure by comparing the mean of each step to that of all steps. To answer the second research question, we considered a sentence as syntactically complex based on each measure if its value for that measure was among the top quartile of al sentences. For each measure, we ran a simple linear regression analysis on the number of comple sentences and the total number of sentences across rhetorical steps. We then identified steps lying outside of the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of the regression line as those containing a significantly higher or lower proportion of complex sentences in comparison to the fulldataset. Finally, for the third reearch question, we frt calculated the mean for each measure in the pure cience group and the applied science group and then performed Mann-Whitney $U$ tests to determine whether significant differences existed between the two groups.

For the global complexity measure, sentences realizing M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments" $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 3 1 . 6 4 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 1 7 , p =$ .004, $\pmb { r } = 0 . 8 3$ ) were significantly longer than the overall mean ( $\mathrm { \ m e a n } = 2 4 . 5 9$ $\mathbf { S D } = 0 . 9 4 $ , while those realizing \*M1_S2 Making generalizations about research area" (mean $_ 1 = 1 6 . 5 8$ $\mathbf { S D } = 3 . 9 9$ $p = . 0 1 6$ $\pmb { r } = 0 . 6 9$ ) and M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper - $\mathrm { m e a n } = 1 6 . 4 4$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 8 3 $ $p = . 0 0 6$ $r = 0 . 7 9$ ) were significantly shorter than the overall mean.

For the first phrasal complexity measure, sentences realizing \*M2 S1d Continuing a tradition" $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 0 . 4 1$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 3 6$ A $p = . 0 2 8 , r$ $= 0 . 6 3 \mathrm { \ : }$ and "M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' (mean $= 0 . 5 8$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 1 $ $p = . 0 1 1$ $r = 0 . 7 4 $ ) contained significantly fewer nominalizations than the overall mean $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 1 . 0 2 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 2 6 $

For the second phrasal complexity measure, sentences realizing \*M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments" $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 5 . 5 2 $ $\mathbf { S D = }$ 0.94, $p = . 0 3 7$ $\pmb { r } = 0 . 5 9$ ) contained significantly more complex nominals than the overall mean (mean $= 4 . 8 3$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 4 2 )$ , while those realizing \*M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' (mean $= 2 . 5 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 4 1$ 3 $p = . 0 0 6$ $r = 0 . 7 9$ ) contained significantly fewer complex nominals than the overall mean.

In terms of finite subordination, sentences realizing "M2 S1e Pointing out limitations of previous research" $\mathrm { ( m e a n = 0 . 7 1 }$ $\mathbf { S D = }$ 0.14, $p = . 0 1 6$ $r = 0 . 6 9$ ) and M3_S10 Limitations of the current study" (mean $= 0 . 8 9$ 3 $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 1 6$ $p = . 0 4 6$ $r = 0 . 5 8$ ) employed significantly more finite dependent clauses than the overall mean $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 0 . 4 5$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 1 2 $ , while those realizing "M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' (mean $= 0 . 2 8$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 0 9 4$ $p = . 0 2 8$ $\pmb { r } = 0 . 6 3$ ) used significantly fewer finite dependent clauses than the overall mean.

# 3.2. Patterns of rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences

To address the second reearch question, we extracted syntactically complex sentences using the thresholds established for the five syntactic complexity indices (see Table 7).A pair of figures is presented for each index, the irst showing the istribution of sentences meeting the threshold and the total number of sentences for each ste, and the second displaying the results of the linear regression analysis.

In terms of global complexity, M1 S1b Importance in real world, \*M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research", \*M2_S1b Indicating a gap", \*M3 S1a Stating goals or main arguments", and M3 S4b Describing analyzed scenario" had asignificantly higher proportion of sentences meeting the sentence length threshold (i.e., 27 or more words) than the group (i.., al stes combined). By contrast, M3 S5 Announcing and discussing results" and M3S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' had a significantly smaller proportion of such sentences.

A close look at the sentences meeting the threshold revealed that long sentences were commonly used to provide multiple sources or types of information relevant to the rhetorical aims of different steps. For example, in M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research', writers ofen reviewed several related studies within one long sentence (see Example 1), and in M3 S1a Stating goals or main arguments", they often incorporated some information about research procedures while stating research goals.

Ex.1. Especially, $\mathrm { C u _ { 2 } O }$ nanocubes attain great interest from various fields; hence, Song Li et al. prepared the $\mathrm { C u _ { 2 } O }$ nanocubes by chemical method using polyvinyl pyrrolidone as capping agent and $\mathrm { N a B H } _ { 4 }$ as reducing agent and Minmin Liu et al. used sodium dodecyl sulfate as surfactant and hydroxylammonium hydrochloride as reducing agent. (Chemistry, M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research)

In terms of nominalizations, \*M1 S1b Importance in real world, \*M3_S6 Stating the value of present research', and \*M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' had a significantly higher proportion of sentences meeting the threshold than the group. Conversely, M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research', \*M3_S1b Announcing present research', \*M3_S2 Presenting research questions or hypotheses, "M3_S3 Definitional clarification, \*M3S4b Describing analyzed scenario", "M3_S5 Announcing and discussing results, and M3_s12 Ilustrations of notation and convention" contained a significantly lower proportion of such sentences.

Fig. 9.

The nominalizations used in the corpus largely fell into four types: (1) nominalizations related to research topics, primarily technical terms, which constitute \*an essential part of scientific language" (Halliday & Martin, 1993, p. 4) (se Example 2) (2) nominalizations related to research processes (e.g., application and implementation); (3) nominalizations used for descriptions or evaluations (e.g., capabiliy and practicabilit); and (4) nominalizations related to the structure of RAs (e.g., organization and conclu. sion). Consistent with Biber and Conrad's (2019) finding that nominalizations with the suffix tin are especiall common in academic prose, such nominalizations accounted for the greatest proportion of all nominalizations identified in our analysis.

A close look at the sentences meeting the nominalization threshold suggested that writers commonly employed diffrent types of nominalizations to realize the rhetorical aims of diffrent steps. For example, they used many nominalizations of the first and thrd types in M1 S1b Importance in real world to describe and evaluate research topics, many nominalizations of the second and third types in M3_s6 Stating the value of present research' to describe the processes and contributions of their research, and many nominalizations of the fourth type in M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper' to outline the organization of the RA.

For the complex nominal index, \*M1_S1b Importance in real world", \*M1 S2 Making generalizations about research area", and M3 S1a Stating goals or main arguments" had a significantly higher proportion of sentences that met the threshold than the group. By contrast, \*M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research", \*M3_S1b Announcing present research", and M3 S7 Outlining thestructure of the paper' contained a significantly lower proportion of such sentences.

Of the three catgories of complex nominals examined, the irst category (i.., nouns plus noun, adjective, possessie, prepositional phrase, relative clause, participle or appositive) accounted for the overwhelming majorit of the complex nominals identified, echoing findings from previous studies that a large proportion of noun phrases in academic writing contain pre-noun and/or post-noun modifiers (Biber et al., 1999; Biber & Gray, 2011). In particular, nouns plus noun and adjective constituted the most prevalent subtype, confirming previous findings that nouns plus premodifiers are more common than those plus postmodifiers (Biber et al., 199, p. 578) and that adjectives are the most frequent pre-noun modifiers (Gray, 2015, p. 123). Aside from common adjectives, many pre-modifying adjectives were topic- or research-oriented (see Example 3). These two types of adjectives were frequently juxtaposed in sentences realizing such steps as M1 S1b Importance in real world", M1 S2 Making generalizations about research area", and M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments" along with topic- and research-oriented pre-modifying nouns (see Example 4).

In terms of finite subordination, M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research", M2 S1e Pointing out limitations of previous research", \*M3_S1b Announcing present research", M3_S4b Describing analyzed scenario", M3_S5 Announcing and discussing results", and M3 s12 llustrations of notation and convention contained asignificantly higher roportion of sentences with one or more finite dependent clauses than the group. Conversely, \*M1 S1a Claiming centralit or value of research area", \*M1 S1b Importance n real world, M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments", and \*M3_S7 Outlining the structure of the paper" contained a significantly lower proportion of such sentences.

Finite dependent clauses frequently served two common functions in science RA introductions. The first function was to add more detailed information about the research aspect being described, and the second was to introduce or specify conditions, assumptions, and questions. This second function was especially common in M3_S1b and M3 S5 sentences, as illustrated in Example 5.

Ex.5. Since autogen testcases include meaningles identifiers (e.g., x0, x1) that are generated automatically by tools, we also investigated, in a separate experiment, whether the obfuscation of identifiers in the test cases has any negative impact on debugging.

Finall, in terms of clausal elaboration, M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments", M3_1b Announcing present research", "M3_S4a Summarizing methods, "M3_S4b Describing analyzed scenario", and "M3_S6 Stating the value of present research" contained a significantly higher proportion of sentences with one or more nonfinite dependent clauses than the group. Especially notable was the use of by-phrases (e.g., by exploiting and by comparing) and for-phrases (e.g., for predicting and for detecting) in these Move 3 sentence to elaborate on various aspects of current or previous research such as methods, procedure, and contributions. By contrast, M3 S5 Announcing and discussing results, M3 S7 Outlining thestructure of the paper', and M3_S12 Illustrations of notation and convention' contained a significantly lower proportion of such sentences.

# 3.3. Comparison of syntactic complexity in pure and applied disciplines

To address the third research question, we divided the dataset into two groups, namely, the pure-science group and the applied. science group. A series of Mann-Whitney $U$ tests revealed no significant difference in any of the five indices between the two groups (see Table 8), indicating that the pure and applied science disciplines represented in our corpus displayed comparable levels of

syntactic complexity for the five indices considered.

# 4. Discussion

Results for our first research question indicated significant differences in syntactic complexity among different rhetorical moves and steps in scienceRA introductions. At the move level, Move 1 Establishing atrritory" was the most syntactically complex in terms of the use of nominalizations and complex nominals. In other words, science scholars employed these two types of complex structures more often to realize the rhetorical aims of Move 1, namely, introducing the research topic, claming its centrality, generalizing previous research, and reviewing specific studies. This is the case as nominalizations and complex nominals allow researchers to package research-related information, which is denser in Move 1 than in Moves 2 and 3, in an effective and precise manner.

At the step level, two findings are especially noteworthy. irst, M3_S1a Stating goals or main arguments" was the only step that showed significantly higher means in multiple measures than the group, indicating that science writers tended to employ multiple types of complex structures to convey rich, detailed information in stating their research goals. For example, 93 of the 158 M3_S1a sentences met the sentence length threshold (i.e., 27 or more words), and the majority of them used a combination of nonfinite dependent clauses and complex nominals with multiple modifiers to state research objectives (e.g., the key objective of this sudy s t..) and describe relevant research-related information (e.g., the presece of simple feedbacks between asst prices and cost of borrowing, a compltlive dtc w, the   pl e nllsing bes ed nrashe).his ders mLu et al.'s (2020) finding that social science RA writrs employed significantly more nonfinite dependent clauses only in this step, suggesting some level of disciplinary variation. Meanwhile, M3 7 Outlining the structure of the paper" showed significantly lower means in allfive measures than the group, suggesting that science writers tended to be more straightforward and succinct in outlining the structure of the paper. Lu et al. (2020) als found that \*M3 S7 Outlining the structure of the paper exhibited significantly lower means in several syntactic complexity measures in social science RA introductions. However, the other steps that showed significantly lower means in one or more syntactic complexity measures in their study (e.g., several Move 2 steps) alldiffered from those in our results, again suggesting the existence of disciplinary variation. Second, similar to the findings reported by Lu et al. (2020) on social science RA introductions, there i no overlap between the two sets of steps showing significantl higher or lower means of one or more indices than the group. This finding is interesting in that it suggests a good level of consistency in how science writers engage with syntactic complexity in realizing specific rhetorical aims, similar to social science writers.

Results for our scond research question showed that, for each measure, science RA writers tended to produce  significantly higher proportion of syntactically comple sentnce to relize therhetrical ams associatd wth a small number of stes relative to allstes. Different from the results for the first research question, where the stes exhibiting ignificantly higher yntactic complexity than the group were in Moves 2 and 3, here the steps with asignificantly higher proportion of sentences meting the complexity thresholds of one or more measures were in Moves 1 and 3. This discrepancy confirms the usefulnes of examining the association between syntactic complexity and rhetorical functions in the two different ways we used. More importantl, the results suggest that while some steps (e. g, M2 S1e) may have a consistently high level of complexity as defined by a specific measure, others may have more intra-step variation, with a larger proportion of sentences exhibiting a particularly higher level of complexity driven by context.

The steps with a significantly higher proportion of sentences meeting one or more syntactic complexity thresholds can be cate. gorized into two groups. The firs includes \*M1 S3 Reviewing items of previous research", M3S1aStating goals or main arguments" "M3_S1b Announcing present research", \*M3_S4b Describing analyzed scenario", \*M3_S5 Announcing and discussing results, and M3 S6 Stating the value of present research'. These steps allcontained a higher proportion of sentences with one or more finite and nonfinite deendent clauses relative to all steps to elaborat on such reearch aspects as procedures, conditions, and scenario. mong these, M3 S4b and M3 S6 sentences were also more likely to contain multiple complex nominals and/or nominalizations to package topic- or research-related information. Notably, nominalizations in M3_S4b were frequently used as premodifiers e.g., absorption properties) to elaborate on analyzed scenarios, and those in M3 S6 sentences were frequently fllowed by a postmodifying prepositinal phrase g., th practicit of .. to explicily state the specific contribution of the reearch. Addtionally, nonfinite deendent clauses with gerunds or past participles were often used in M3 S4b sentences as postmodifier of nouns to provide specific information about analyzed scenarios. The second group consists of M1 S1b Importance in real world, which had a higher proportion of sentences meeting the complexity thresholds for nominalizations and complex nominals only. These structure are frequently used to specify the subject matter or context in M1_S1b sentences.

Biber (1988) noted that complex noun phrases with pre-noun or post-noun modifiers are prevalent in informational discourse, and Halliday and Martin (1993) further illstrated that nominal elements are commonly used in scientific writing to \*form technical taxonomies" and "summarize and package representations of processes' (p. 64). Our findings confirm the importance of phrasal complexit features for compresing information in academic writing (Biber & Conrad, 2019; Biber & Gray, 2011, 2016; Gray, 2015) Meanwhile our findings also highlight the important role of clausal complexity features in realizing various rhetorical aims inscience RA introductions, consistent with Jiang's (2020) finding that science RA writers are increasing their use of more elaborated clausal features to help improve the readability of RAs to reach a wider audience. Most importantly, our results yielded evidence that science RA writers tended to employ some complexity features more often than others in realizing specific rhetorical steps.

Results for our third research question showed no significant variation in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions between pure and applied disciplines. Casal et al. (2021) reported variation in syntactic complexity acros RA part-genres and among ifferent social science disciplines. Our results indicated that science scholars from both pure and applied disciplines engaged with syntactic complexit at comparable levels in writing RA introductions, and it remains to be seen whether variation in the syntactic complext of other RA part-geres may exist between these disciplines. Additionall, Lu, Casal, et a. (2021) reported variation in the rlationship between syntactic complexity and rhetorical functions in RA introductions between social science and engineering disciplines. As mentioned briely earlier, a comparison of our results for research question two against those reported by Lu et al. (2020) suggested that such variation exists between science and social science disciplines as well.

The findings of our study have useful implications for syntactic complexity and genre analysis research as wellas potential ap. plications in academic writing pedagogy and asessment irs, our findings confirm the usefulness of function-oriented approaches to syntactic complexity research (Lu et al., 2020; Ryshina-Pankova, 2015) and expand our understanding of the specificrelationship between syntactic complexity features and rhetorical functions in science RA writing. Second, they also shed light on the intra disciplinary consistency in science RA writers' engagement with syntactic complexity overall and interdisciplinary variation in RA writers' employment of specific syntactic complexity features for different rhetorical aims between science and social science disciplines (through comparison with Lu et al.'s (2020) findings). Third, for academic writing pedagogy, our findings add to existing evidence of the importance of helping novice ERPP writers develop an awareness of the relationship between syntactic complexity features and rhetorical functions and, more importantly, the abilit to employ syntactic features in ways that are appropriate for the genre and discipline and effective for the intended rhetoric functions (e.g., Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu et al., 2020; Tardy, 2016). Our findings can be used to inform the design and implementation of genre analysis activities in academic writing classrooms aimed at helping novice science RA writers develop such awareness and ability. In particular, using such findings, teachers can help learners see why certain syntactic complexity features are used more frequently in some rhetorical moves and steps than others by expert science RA writers. They can also draw learners' atention to the functions of specific syntactic complexity features in different rhetorical moves and steps (e.g., the functions of nonfinite dependent clauses in M3 S4b sentences). As Casal and Lu (2021) demonstrated, such genre analysis activities can facilitate novice A writers development of gre comptence. Final, for academic writing assessment our findings suggest the need to explicitly highlight the writers ability to use complex structures to effectively achieve specific rhetorical functions in genre-appropriate ways in the rating scale and to promote rater awarenes of the importance of this bility. They also imply that the relationship between syntactic complexity measures and human ratings of academic writing quality should not be expected to be linear (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Crossey & McNamara, 2014; Deng, Lei, & Liu, 2021) but may vary across genres with different communicative functions (e.g., Lu, 2017).

# 5. Conclusion

This study investigated the connections between syntactic complexity features and rhetorical functions in cience RA introductions and secondarily variation in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions betwen hard-pure and hard-applied science disciplines. Our findings revealed that science scholars varied their engagement with diffrent types of syntactic complexity features in realizing different rhetorical aims in RA introductions. The overall level of syntactic complexity of RA introductions remained comparable between pure and applied science disciplines, but a comparison with previous results indicated interdisciplinary variation in the rhetorical functions of syntactically complex sentences in RA introductions between science and social science disciplines. These findings support the usefulness of function-oriented approaches to syntactic complexity in discipline-specific, genre-based academic writing research and pedagogy.

Several avenues for future research exist. First, the analytical scope can be expanded to include ther cience RA part-genre s wel as other genres of science writing. Second, additional syntactic complexity indices can be considered in future research, including in partiular finerand clausal and phral complexty indices that differentiate ifferent structural types f clause ndphases. Third, direct comparisons with other disciplinary fields can shed more light on the variation in the linguistic realizations of rhetorical goals between science disciplines and other disciplines.

However, up to now, there have been no detailed studies of the structure of InAs/AlAs heterostructures with quantum wells (QWs) and the effect of the structure on the energy spectrum</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td> Question-raising</td><td>Of the systems. This raises a natural question: What are the optimal coding functions for C-ToF imaging?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S1c S1d</td><td>Continuing a tradition</td><td>In this work, we take this idea a step further and expand the methodology to cases where stationary solutions co-exist with periodic ones.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S1e</td><td>Pointing out limitations of previous research</td><td>However, none of the above-mentioned techniques are able to simultaneously measure particle size distribution, particle concentration (particles mL-1), and mass content of TiO2 rapidly in a</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>s2</td><td>Providing positive justification</td><td>single method. Thus, with the above observations in perspective and given the recent success achieved in. applying SVM to thermosiphon data to predict circulation rate, it was decided to use this technique for developing a unified correlation, for predicting more accurately, the boiling heat transfer coefficient in a thermosiphon reboiler..</td></tr><tr><td>M3</td><td></td><td>Presenting the present work</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S1a</td><td> Stating goals or main arguments</td><td>The aim of this paper is to put the results about free groups and about the finite groups in a natural common context.

This article covers a complete formalization of the main algorithm along with detailed proofs,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S1b</td><td>Announcing present research</td><td>reports on additional experiments, and additional subject programs in experiments reported on previously. We further investigate the following questions: What are the used text sources and which data.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>s2</td><td>Presenting research questions or hypotheses</td><td>transformations are applied in order to investigate text analysis research questions with close and distant reading visualizations?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>s3</td><td>Definitional clarification</td><td>In this study, the optimal flow pattern refers to the velocity field with minimum viscous dissipation.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S4a</td><td>Summarizing methods</td><td>Herein we use two methods to adsorb Apt on AuNPs surface, in the first method T-Apt conjugated to AuNPs, while in the second method polyA modification-free Apt conjugated to AuNPs prior to target addition.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S4b</td><td>Describing analyzed scenario</td><td>Therefore, in order to answer RQ2, we derive the testing level of a test case from its method coverage information; specifically, we base it on the number and frequency of execution of the methods it covers.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S4c</td><td>Explaining a theoretical model or analytical perspective</td><td>The MCDC requires that each decision takes every possible outcome, each condition in a decision takes every possible outcome and each condition in a decision is shown to independently affect the outcome of the decision.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S5</td><td>Announcing and discussing results</td><td>Our results showed that low-molecular-weight compounds can be unambiguously detected in biological samples.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S6</td><td>Stating the value of present research.</td><td>The main contributions of this article are as follows:We present a novel CNN-based approach to identify SATDs from source code comments, which is an imbalanced dataset.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S7</td><td>Outlining the structure of the paper</td><td>The organization of the present paper is as follows.
