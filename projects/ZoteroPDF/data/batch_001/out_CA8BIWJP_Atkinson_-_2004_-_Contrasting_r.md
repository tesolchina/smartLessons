# Abstract

This paper deals with an underdeveloped notion in the EAP sub-discipline of contrastive rhetoric: culture. It argues that a better conceptualization of contrastive rhetoric needs to include a better conceptualization of culture. After engaging with the complex question ‘‘What is culture?’’ the paper moves on to consider four sets of current issues regarding the concept of culture: (1) received culture versus postmodern culture versus cultural studies culture; (2) culture as product versus culture as process; (3) culture in the head versus culture in the world; and (4) big culture versus small culture. The paper then ends with a call for greater attention to the culture concept in contrastive rhetoric studies.

# 1. Introduction

Let me begin with a short personal narrative which, in the present context, is also an embarrassing public confession: in my 15 years of speaking at academic conferences and 13 years of publishing in academic journals, I have done my best to avoid a concept of central interest in EAP: contrastive rhetoric (hereafter CR). This despite the fact that the ‘‘eureka!’’ experience that led me to do my doctorate back in the 1980s was reading Robert Kaplan’s (1966) classic CR article while teaching L2 writing in Japan, and this despite the fact that I then went happily off to the University of Southern California to study with Kaplan himself, thinking to do a CR dissertation. Unfortunately, I cannot recall everything that subsequently happened in my up-and-down relationship with CR, but there are two things I do remember: having some of the shortcomings of CR rather graphically pointed out to me in the intervening years; and my own growing sense that I could not very well compare or contrast rhetorics and genres across cultures and languages if we did not have good baseline descriptions of those rhetorics themselves within cultures and languages. These are perhaps two of the reasons why I branched off into the area of scientific writing (e.g. Atkinson, 1996, 1999a), which luckily my dissertation advisor was both interested in and publishing in (e.g. Kaplan & Grabe, 1991) at that time.

But, generally speaking, I think I avoided the field of CR for so long mainly because of its overwhelming complexity. After all, this is a field which combines at least three large areas, each enormously complex and variegated in itself: (1) writing (especially in EAP/ESP contexts); (2) learning and using second/additional languages (not to mention language itself); and (3) culture. Whereas any of these topics would be enough to spend a lifetime trying to unravel, what is my weak human mind to make of a field that combines all three of them? And—I almost forgot—I have not even mentioned teaching! Having spent all my energy trying to climb the first three Himalayas of understanding, how would I then be able to convey in the classroom whatever small, but unquestionably complex, wisdom I might manage to achieve?

Fortunately, I hope, I have more recently started to feel a bit differently about CR. This is perhaps because one of the few joys of aging is learning to be less afraid of complexity. My own solution, therefore, to the problem of CR’s overwhelming complexity—a weak, insufficient human solution, to be sure—is to start right here with just one of its components (i.e. culture) and to try to understand it better. As Paul Matsuda (2002) argues, it is important to think of CR as a communal endeavor—a field in which each of us does our own small part to build a community-wide repertoire of tools and resources. It is only in this way that the tremendously complex issues underlying CR will open up to our better understanding and better teaching. Let me add, however, that my discussion in this article will be unapologetically theoretical; culture has not yet been adequately theorized in CR specifically or EAP or applied linguistics more generally (Atkinson, 1999b, in press), so, it is with a better theorization of culture that our venture must begin.

# 2. What is culture?

One of the founders of cultural studies, Raymond Williams, said that culture was one of the two or three most complex words in the English language (Williams, 1983: p. 87). I tend to agree. The pioneer anthropologists Alfred Kroeber and Clyde Kluckhohn would no doubt have agreed as well: in the mid-1950s, they wrote a monograph (Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952) in which they culled some 160 different definitions of culture from English-language authors, stretching from

Tylor’s famous 1871 definition of culture as ‘‘that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society’’ (Tylor 1871, quoted in Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952: p. 43), to Bryson’s 1947 definition, ‘‘human energy organized in patterns of repetitive behavior’’ (Bryson 1947, quoted in Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952: p. 72).

Although Kroeber and Kluckhohn’s main reason for collecting these definitions was to establish a firmer basis for their own definition, it is fair to say that neither they nor any other expositor has provided in the interim a version of the culture concept which has commanded universal assent, or in most cases, even general respect (although, as I will suggest below, there is still something like a ‘‘received’’, almost pre-theoretical notion of culture which continues to exert powerful effects). This fact—along with the various controversies surrounding the culture concept I will describe in a moment—has lead some (e.g. Abu-Lughod, 1991; Fox & King, 2002) to call for its abandonment.

Despite the lack of any single broadly agreed-upon definition, culture has become, in the second half of the 20th century, one of the most contentious concepts in academia, not to mention the rest of the world. Thus, academics (e.g. Abu-Lughod, 1991) have argued that most, or all, cultural description is at base deterministic and therefore anti-human, reducing human beings to ‘‘cultural dopes’’. In some instances (e.g. Michaels, 1995), they have even argued that the notion of culture is fundamentally racist; this despite the fact that the original popularizers of the concept (i.e. Franz Boas and his students) developed it largely to oppose the idea that putative racial differences in intelligence and social development existed, and were natural and innate (e.g. Boas, 1940, 1974; Benedict, 1940). Beyond the academic world, ‘‘culture wars’’ have raged in multicultural settings like the US over whether children should be educated in ways that meaningfully address this multiculturality, or according to more specific (usually ‘‘western’’) norms. Suffice it to say, that both in and beyond academia, culture is very much a burning issue at the beginning of the 21st century.

In a short article like this one, there are obviously limits to how far one can go in discussing culture. For purposes of convenience then, I will divide my discussion of current issues in the study of culture into four sets of binary oppositions (the first is, in fact, a ‘‘trinary’’ opposition): (1) received culture versus postmodern culture versus cultural studies culture; (2) culture as product versus culture as process; (3) culture in the head versus culture in the world; and (4) big culture versus small culture.1 Although along the way I will try to draw relevances to CR, I must admit that this article is primarily about culture ‘‘something I would argue CR needs to think more about’’ rather than about CR, per se. It cannot be primarily about CR as it stands, because CR itself has not yet engaged the notion of culture in a serious, critical way.

# 3. Received culture versus postmodern culture versus cultural studies culture

This trinary contains three current views of culture that differ from each other in crucial ways. Whichever of these perspectives (singly or in combination) one assumes will strongly influence both how one goes about studying culture/s and what one finds when one does so.

By received culture, I mean something like the traditional, commonsense notion that still seems dominant in applied linguistics, EAP, and second language education, among many other fields (Atkinson, 1999b, in press). Critical anthropologists have nominated this the ‘‘peoples and cultures’’ view of culture, defined, in the words of two of them, as ‘‘the idea that a world of human difference is to be conceptualized as a diversity of separate societies, each with its own culture’’ (Gupta & Ferguson, 1997: p. 1).2 While I call this a traditional, received view, it by no means covers all (or perhaps even much) of what has been written and thought about culture in the 20th century; pioneer cultural anthropologists like Boas, for example, emphasized the intense hybridity and cross-cutting influences of smallscale cultural groups, as seen in their histories of intermarriage, trade, and ritual, technological, and aesthetic diffusion and transfer (e.g. Boas, 1974). We have nonetheless come to a point where cultures are often conflated with big-picture political groupings like nation states and ethnic communities (American culture, Japanese culture, Latino culture, African-American culture, etc.). As pointed out by Connor (2002), CR has largely assumed such a ‘‘received culture’’ perspective.

What, then, are some current alternatives to such a received view? One major one, which in fact has arisen significantly in opposition to it, is what I will call a ‘‘postmodern’’ view of culture.3 Postmodern views of culture (e.g. Appadurai, 1996; Lyotard, 1984) highlight radical change, disruption, discontinuity, inequality, movement, hybridity, difference, and deterritorialization. In other words, they directly address the relentless, chaotic mixing-and-matching that globalization, world capitalism, neo-imperialism, and the diffusion of ‘‘western’’ popular culture through the media provide at the beginning of the 21st century. When one considers, for example, that in the US alone reside some half-a-million or more Central American immigrants, who, in one of the greater ironies of the 20th century, fled their homelands in fear of armies and death squads materially and morally supported by the US, only to arrive at the end of their journey in that very same country, one gets a sense of the unpredictable chaos and disruption that postmodern culture theory attempts to capture. Global flows of people, media, ideas, technology, and money are endemic aspects of the late $2 0 \mathrm { t h }$ and early 21st centuries (Appadurai, 1996), and any definition of culture which ignores their unforeseen and often-chaotic character does so at the cost of its own relevance.

But perhaps this is putting it a bit too grimly. According to theorists of postmodern culture like Appadurai (1996), globalization has also led to all kinds of fortuitous and interesting cultural synergies and combinations. For example, the ways in which youth culture practices like rap and hip-hop have been universalized and radically indigenized across the world; the popularity and cultural adaptation of East Asian martial arts traditions throughout much of the world; and the internationalization of academics, although of course on a highly Western model (see Canagarajah, 2002). Or consider the case of those fascinatingly hybrid world citizens we meet in EAP, TESOL and L2 writing these days, such as Ulla Connor or Paul Matsuda, who defy neat categorization as this or that, no matter what passport they are carrying or what language they happen to be speaking at the moment. If this is the world we are actually now living in—and for more and more of us, it is—then shouldn’t our notions of culture actively reflect it? This, in short, is the argument for the postmodern view of culture.

The third view of culture I wish to describe is cultural studies, a field which, despite its name, has taken a rather particular view of culture since its beginnings in 1950s Britain. Heavily influenced by a Marxist view of culture as ‘‘a contested and conflictual set of practices of representation bound up with the processes of formation and re-formation of social groups’’ (Frow & Morris, 1996: p. 356), it was initially interested in the effects of consumer-oriented democratic capitalism on the ways of life of the British working class. Since mass, popular culture appeared to be playing a determining role in the alienation of this group from its traditional class consciousness, the focus was on how such forms of culture were ideologically employed to naturalize forms of thought and behavior.

Cultural studies has changed and broadened over the years, in part due to the influence of postmodernism, but its focus is still substantially on viewing ‘‘contemporary culture’’ (During, 1992: p. 1) from an ideological and hegemonic perspective, the underlying claim being that cultural beliefs and practices are developed predominantly under the influence of exposure to mass, popular culture in all its forms and all its power. This does not mean that we cannot resist, or even go so far as to appropriate, contemporary cultural forms for our own purposes—indeed, much of current cultural studies has been at pains to describe such resistance and agency. But it certainly does mean that mass culture is a dynamic, ideological, power-involved force, and quite differently organized than it was, say, 50 years ago, before the television became a central fixture in our lives.

# 4. Culture as product versus culture as process

Much of the work of those studying culture has historically been to describe the product-oriented side of culture. Kinship systems, myth systems, linguistic systems, belief and cultural rule systems of everyday life (e.g. Frake, 1964), as well as the powerful organizing properties of rituals, both formal and informal (e.g. Geertz, 1973), have been the mainstays of cultural anthropology and anthropological linguistics. Other fields, such as cross-cultural psychology and intercultural communication, have also tried to develop taxonomies and formal models of cultural behavior. Written texts, of course, have been massively studied across fields that concern themselves with culture; CR is merely one of the areas that have taken written texts seriously.

Analyzing cultural artifacts is an important endeavor to undertake; this is beyond question. As a way of studying culture, it is also in and of itself insufficient. The main reason of course is that such products are residues or byproducts—if not downright after-the-fact constructions—of historical (including political, social, and economic) processes which are ongoing, ever-changing, and non-systematic in many ways; they can hardly be considered fair representations of the multifarious activities that actually went into producing them (e.g. Hutchins, 1995). As Connor (2002) points out in her recent attempt to update CR, we need to refocus our vision on the processes that produce the products, rather than looking solely at the products themselves. I believe that this will be a highly challenging endeavor, given that CR has had a strongly product-oriented, structuralist bias since its inception 37 years ago.4

Various ways of conceptualizing culture as process have arisen in recent years, one important one being the postmodernist-influenced notion of identity (e.g. Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Cain, 1999; Norton, 2000). I believe the popularity of this concept comes largely as a response to the shortcomings of studying culture as product—from a collective desire for more dynamic and less top-down ways of thinking about cultural activity, especially the individual’s role in such activity. I cannot describe the contemporary identity concept at length here, but briefly, it does not assume a modernist, unitary, rational self. Rather, it assumes a more or less postmodern, decentered, disunified individual who, at the same time as she is subject to multiple (and often contradictory) sociocultural influences, is also somehow able to creatively use these influences to shape herself into something resembling an agentive actor. At any rate, the concept of identity refocuses inquiry from the impact that big-picture cultural or social forces have on the person to the ways that people actually fashion themselves into social agents by using whatever resources and responding to whatever constraints they have.

This revised focus, however, is no more sufficient in itself than the one it is rejecting. We still need to understand both how individuals and social structures work—both product and process—and especially how they work in relation to each other. This is why I value synthetic models of society and culture like Anthony Giddens’ structuration model. According to Giddens (1979), in order to adequately conceptualize either social structure or individual action, we need a model which treats them both in interaction. In this model, the only actual social activity is individual social activity, captured in the concept of agency (i.e. individuals’ capacity to act as they do). Individual human activity is messy, in many ways non-systematic and non-rational. But it is not unguided; it is ‘‘activity’’ only in relation to a social definition of what activity is.

To put it more directly, individual social activity is influenced by social structures or systems—by more or less durable social products such as laws, rules, social practices, social roles, institutions, marriage and child rearing norms and practices. These entities exist at a virtual level as resources for and constraints on social behavior, but they do not simply determine it. Human beings are hardly robots or computers that simply execute their social or cultural programs algorithmically. Rather, they interpret, adapt, forget, make mistakes, resist, subvert, improvise—the typical stuff of everyday life. So far then we have a unidirectional chain of influence (but by no means absolute control or determination) from structure to activity.

Giddens now goes one step further. He hypothesizes that what human beings do in their messy, everyday human activity feeds back into the social structures/systems level, sometimes incrementally, sometimes radically changing the nature of the social structures themselves. We therefore have a total feedback loop which accounts not only for how humans act under the influence of (capital-S) Society and (capital-C) Culture, but also how Society and Culture adapt and change according to individual human agency and action. The real society or culture therefore becomes the whole thing: the full feedback loop comprising both concrete human activity and abstract social or cultural structure.

# 5. Culture in the head versus culture in the world

A recurring question in the study of culture has been its proper location: is it something residing mostly in the minds and brains of people, or does it somehow exist mostly out in the social world? For influential anthropologists such as Clifford Geertz (e.g. 1973), the answer was clear—culture is embodied in public symbols and institutions:

[My] view of culture begins with the assumption that human thought is basically both social and public—that its natural habitat is the house yard, the marketplace, and the town square. Thinking consists not of ‘‘happenings in the head’’ [. . .] but of a traffic in what have been called [. . .] significant symbols—words for the most part but also gestures, drawings, musical sounds, mechanical devices like clocks, or natural objects like jewels—anything, in fact, that is disengaged from its mere actuality and used to impose meaning upon experience. From the point of view of any particular individual, such symbols are largely given. He finds them already current in the community when he is born, and they remain, with some additions, subtractions, and partial alterations he may or may not have had a hand in, in circulation after he dies (Geertz, 1973: p. 45).

Geertz’s ideas, often described under the rubric of symbolic or interpretive anthropology, have been deeply influential in the late 20th-century social and cultural thought, although they have also been criticized as simply re-inscribing more or less ‘‘received’’ views of culture (e.g. Kuper, 1999).

Another branch of anthropology, cognitive anthropology, has been concerned with locating culture largely in the heads of individuals, whether through schemas, cultural models, or—more recently—connectionist networks (e.g. Strauss & Quinn, 1997). Following the lead of Ward Goodenough, cognitive anthropologists have argued that culture is basically shared cognitive knowledge rather than anything external: ‘‘What people must know in order to act as they do, make the things they make, and interpret their experience in the distinctive way they do’’ (Quinn & Holland, 1987: p. 4; italics added).

Here is one instance in which I will try to break down a binary opposition I have set up: it seems pointless to try to argue for the primacy of culture in the head or culture in the world—can only be in both. Even if culture is made up in large part of public symbols, as Geertz claimed (for his more recent views, see Geertz, 2000), we need to be able to make sense of those symbols; they have meaning only for actively cognizing, interpreting, complex pattern-recognizing beings. Thus, Geertz’s privileged example of social symbols in the above quotation (i.e. language) obviously not only has an active public life in the world, but also a dynamic private life in the head. In fact, I would argue against setting the head and the world in any kind of a fundamentally oppositional relationship here: it seems far more sensible to say that culture exists co-constitutively in the world and in the head, and that heads and worlds may therefore not really be such separate and isolated locations after all. At any rate, this is the argument I have made in several publications (e.g. Atkinson, 1999b, 2002, in press), and one that is becoming increasingly popular and increasingly important across the social and behavioral sciences (e.g. Clark, 1997, 2001; Gee, 1992; Hutchins, 1995; Rogoff, 1998; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991).

As for what this has to do with CR, I am not completely sure. But here is one possibility: it gives us another way of thinking about such things as the widely known gap between textual coherence or social meaning and the formal characteristics of text (e.g. Carrell, 1983). As Kaplan (e.g. 1987) has pointed out many times since, the straight-line English-language rhetoric in his notorious squiggles diagram (Kaplan, 1966) was ‘‘straight’’ not because of any special intrinsic quality of the text, but because it was interpreted in that way by the cultural insiders for whom it made sense as a means of expression, or because of what was in those insiders’ heads, although it was a very socially shared kind of knowledge. We could also view the interaction as actually having something to do as well with the formal nature of text itself, with its formal properties as a culturally produced set of symbols (e.g. top-down forms of organization including thesis statements, topic sentences, and point-driven prose—see Atkinson, 2003). It is, therefore, the interaction of mental models or schemas for directness (and since communication and values are usually elided in everyday thought, perhaps straightforwardness or honesty as well) with socially designed and socially construable symbols on the page that constructs the kind of coherence which leads a cultural insider to say: ‘‘Ah, that’s good, direct American academic prose’’.

# 6. Big culture versus small culture

My last binary opposition involves an attempt to make the notion of culture a more flexible analytical tool by varying its scale of application. The basic idea is that: (1) various social scenes, big and small, seem to have many of the same characteristics as (usually more or less received versions of) culture: methods of socialization; more or less durable norms, values, and social practices; well-defined roles and hierarchies; symbolic and material artifacts; and (2) we should therefore be able to use the concept of culture to study these phenomena, and to adjust the scale of the notion to fit our analytical needs. Similar ideas have also been actively endorsed in popular usage and the media, where we hear, for example, of hip-hop culture, legal culture, the culture of dependency, drug culture, etc. In education, the idea of classrooms as cultures has been an important concept, although it has also undergone critique (e.g. Heath, 1982; see also Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999).

One of the best and most concrete conceptualizations of ‘‘small cultures’’ in educational settings comes from the work of Adrian Holliday, also the author of a recent article of the same title (Holliday, 1999). In earlier work on developing culturally appropriate teaching methodology in EFL settings, Holliday (1994) discussed the array of complex and overlapping social institutions that any truly appropriate methodology would have to take into account. Fig. 1 is a substantially modified version of Holliday’s (1994: p. 29) diagram; it indicates both the different sizes and levels of these interacting cultures, from the culture of individual classrooms to national culture (the latter not a small culture at all), and the partially overlapping relations among them.5

Fig. 1. Complexly interacting small cultures in an educational setting.

Thus, for example, student culture (near the bottom of the diagram) would have both its own unique internal norms and practices—e.g. particular interaction patterns, particular socialization practices—in any particular education situation, and these would overlap (but not be subsumed under) national cultural norms and practices, those of youth culture (which would themselves partly overlap with national culture, but by no means be subsumed by it since youth culture spreads well beyond national boundaries), etc. Likewise, the professional–academic culture of teachers/professors in a particular situation would partly overlap with national culture, but would also in part be shared with other professors in other parts of the world:

Professional–academic cultures [. . .] are the cultures connected with professional peer and reference groups, schools of academic thought and practice, professional approach etc., generated by professional associations, unions, university departments, publishers etc. It is significant that these extend beyond the boundaries of the national culture: in particular, English language teachers, in countries where English is not the mother tongue, where the subject matter, the language, is considered to be foreign, have international links which they depend on for much of their sense of professional-academic belongingness (Holliday, 1994: pp. 29–30).

The idea behind the notion of small cultures, then, is that when we break our analysis down into complexly interacting small, medium-sized, and large cultures, we get a much more complex (if still probably somewhat structuralistic) notion of the interactions of different cultural forces. In no sense, then, could the ‘‘cultural action’’ taking place in any particular educational setting be accounted for solely in terms of the national culture in which that educational setting appeared to be located, as has so often been done in the past. If Holliday’s assumptions are correct, then small cultures have crucial roles to play in our analysis of any particular educational practice or educational scene.

# 7. Conclusion

My purpose in this paper has been to briefly sketch out some of the complexities and current issues involving the notion of culture, one of the important (but largely unexamined) concepts in the study of CR, as well as in many other areas of EAP and applied linguistics. I have not attempted to lay out a theoretical proposal or model (for which see Atkinson, 1999b, in press), but rather have tried to offer a range of thinking tools: new and perhaps different ways of thinking about culture which I would suggest do justice, or begin to do justice, to the ways cultural phenomena currently impact peoples’ lives.

One of the distinctive characteristics of CR is that it actively uses the notion of culture to explain differences in written texts and writing practices. So far, however, CR has been seriously limited in this respect—the view of culture most widely assumed in accounting for textual forms and practices has been overwhelmingly a received one (Connor, 2002). As a result, real problems have arisen: cultures have been unproblematically conflated with national entities; internal consistency and consensuality within cultures have been assumed or valorized, in tandem with differences and even incommensurability between or across them; and CR practitioners have neglected the place of unequal power relations and the role of conflict in describing cultural influences and processes.

It may also be that as our text-analytic tools become more powerful and wideranging (witness, for example, the growing emphasis on corpus analysis in CR studies: e.g. Connor, 2002, this volume; Moreno, 1998), there will be a temptation to pay even less attention to culture than previously. This, to my mind, would be a grave mistake. To me, at any rate, the notion of culture is still a ‘‘great unknown’’ in CR studies, and increased attention to it and its analysis will do much to put the field on a more secure and better-recognized academic footing, as well as to make it more relevant to our students’ lives.
