Syntactic complexity

This study examined diachronic changes in the syntactic complexity of research article (RA) introductions produced by emerging and expert international publication (IP) writers over the past two decades. Our data consisted of 90 RA introductions published in an emerging international journal by Chinese applied linguists without prior IP experience and $9 0 ~ \mathrm { R A }$ introductions published in a leading international journal by applied linguists with multiple prior international publications. In each corpus, 30 RA introductions were collected from 1998, 2008, and 2018, respectively. These samples were analyzed using seven holistic indices covering multiple dimensions of syntactic complexity and annotated for rhetorical moves and steps. Our analysis revealed important differences between emerging and expert IP writers both in their levels of syntactic complexity at each time point and in the patterns of their diachronic change. Furthermore, our analysis also revealed differences in the rhetorical strategies used by the two groups as well as a close relationship between the changes in emerging Chinese IP writers' syntactic complexity and changes in their rhetorical strategies. These findings shed light on emerging IP writers' rhetorical and linguistic practices in RA writing from a diachronic perspective, with useful implications for English for Research Publications Purposes pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

The past few decades have witnessed a burgeoning interest in examining academic discourse from a diachronic perspective to trace how academic language features have changed over time and understand how such changes may berelated to and/or rflect changes in academic writing and publication conventions and practices (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2016; Hyland & Jiang, 2017; Seone, 2013). Existing studies have focused heavily on changes in lexical, phrasal, and discourse features e.g., Gilaerts & Van de Velde, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2016, 2018), with les attention paid to those in syntactic complexit features. In addition, this body of research has primarily analyzed academic discourse produced by expert academic writers, while that produced by emerging international publication (IP) writers, i.e., scholars who are starting their IP journey, remains understudied.

Both of these two research gaps are worthy of further investigation. First, syntactic complexity has been shown in second language (L2) writing research to be significantly indicative of language proficiency, language development, and writing quality (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu, 2011; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Vyatkina, 2013; Yoon & Polio, 2017), and the use of complex syntactic features has also been shown to be highly characteristic of academic writing e.g., Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011; Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2020). Second, publication of peer-reviewed articles in intenational jounals has become critical for knowledge dissemination as well as for career advancement in academia, and for emerging IP writers, mastery of the inguistic features and rhetorical pattens characteristic of academic writing would prove especiall important for developing their academic writing competence and achieving the next lvel of uces in their IP journey (e.g., Flowerdew, 2013; Loi & Wweetnam Evans, 2010). A diachronic analysis of the changes in the syntactic complexity of academic discourse produced by emerging and expert IP writers would thus not only expand our existing knowledge base for understanding the historical trends in academic language use by such writers but may also yield useful insight for helping emerging IP writers further develop their academic writing competence and informing English for Research and Publication Purposes (ERPP) pedagogy.

The current study contribute to filling these research gaps by examining changes in the syntactic complexity of research article (RA) introductions produced by emerging Chinese IP writers and expert IP writers across three time points between 1998 and 2018, with comparisons of the two groups both in terms of thir ifference at ach time point and in terms of differences in their patterns of change Furthmore, in reonse t reent call for a functionl tur in syntactic complexty reearch (eg., L e al., 2020), we inquire into how the patern of diachronic change in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions writen by Chinese emerging IP writers may be accounted from a rhetorical strategic' perspective. We operationalized emerging and expert IP writers in reference to prior IP experience in the current study rather than the writers educational level (e.g., graduate student status), with emerging IP writers defined as those who have published their frst-ever English RA in an emerging international journal, and expert IP writers defined as those who have published three or more English RAs in leading international journals.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we first provide an overview of relevant prior research on diachronic changes of academic language feature, syntactic complexity in L2 writing development, and RA rhetorical functions and linguistic features, and then present the three specific research questions of the current study motivated by these three lines of research. A description of the research methodology is offered in Section 3, including details of our corpus design, the selection of syntactic complexity measures, and our data analysis procedures. Section 4 reports and discuses the findings for each of our three research questions, and Section 5 concludes the paper with a summary of the contributions and implications of the study and a discussion of directions for future research.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Diachronic studies of academic discourse

Recent diachronic investigations into academic discourse have traced patterns of historical change in academic language features, an important endeavor that allows us to examine the dynamic evolvement of the conventions, practices, and expectations of academic writing and publication (Hyland & Jiang, 2016, 2018). Focusing heavily on features at lexical, phrasal, and discourse levels, this line of research has explored the changing trnds in divere aspect of RA writing ., Bondi, 2014; ilars, 2014; illarts  Van deVeld, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2017, 2018; Su, Zhang, & Lu, 2021; Wen & Lei, 2022). For example, in a diachronic investigation of self-mention and authorial voice in RA abstracts in history, economics, and linguistics over a 20-year period (1987-2007), Bondi (2014) reported an incrase in first-erson markers (particularly we) and personal references as well as in other voice markers that highlight the athors aguer role  reearch verbs)  rearch novelty and sigficance ., evaluative adjectives). She ributed these trends to academic writers increasing awareness of "the need to compete with other researchers in attracting the reader's attention within a growing body of publications (p. 269). In a study of the changing patterns of disciplinary metadiscourse using a corpus of RAs from four disciplines over a 50-year period (1965-2015), Hyland and Jiang (2018) reported a significant increase in interactive features that help organize discourse and guide readers but a significant decrease in interactional features that allow authors to take a personal stance. They argued that these changes show how the conventions of academic writing have shifted \*in response to major changes in the nature of publishing, the expansion of audiences, institutional measurement imperatives, and research practices which favour increasing co-authorship" (p. 29). In an examination of the changing pattrns of exemplification in linguistics RAs acros two 15-year time periods (i.e, 1980-1994 and 200-2014), Su et al. (2021) found that more rcent RAs tended to \*exemplify in simpler and more explicit ways, likely in response to the need for greater accessbility as a result of \*the interdis ciplinary turn in academic research' (p. 130). More recently, Wen and Lei (2022) performed a diachronic analysis of linguistic pos. itivity bias in a corpus of lif science A astracts and reorted sinificant upward trend of linguistic positivity bias over the past five decades, which they atributed to publication pressure and the need to use linguistic devices for research promotion and political correctness. Collectively, these studies revealed important patterns of historical change in a range of academic language features and shed light on the potential rlations of such patterns to changes in academic writing and publication conventions, practices, and expectations. Notably, however, this body of research has not yet examined diachronic changes in syntactic complexity features of academic discourse, nor has it focused on academic discourse produced by emerging IP writers.

# 2.2. Syntactic complexity and L2 writing development

Syntactic complexity refers to the degre of variety, sophistication, and elaboration of the syntactic forms used in language production (Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003). There i a general consensus that syntactic complexity is a multidimensional construct encompassing global complexity, complexity by subordination and coordination, as wel as phrasal complexity (e. g., Norri & Ortega, 2009. Numerous measures have been proposed for assessing each of these dimensions, as reflected in the large pool of indices incorporated in some of the commonly used computational toos for syntactic complexity analysis. For example, the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyer (LsCA; Lu, 2010) provides 14 holistic measures f five categories, including length of production units (e.g, mean length of sentence), overall sentence complexity (e.g, clauses per sentence), coordination (e.g, T-units per sentence), subordination (e.g, dependent clauses per clause), and phrasal complexity (e.g., complex nominals per clause). The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAAssc; Kyle, 2016) offrs a large set of fine-grained indices of clausal complexit e.g., clause complements per clause) and phrasal complexit (e.g, adjectival modifiers per nominal) that tap into specific subtypes of clauses and phrases.

Many L2 writing studies have taken a developmental view to investigate crossproficiency differences (e.g., Diez-Bedmar & Perez-Paredes, 2020; Jiang, Bi, & Liu, 2019; Lu, 2011; Youn, 2014) or longitudinal changes (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Menke & Strawbridge, 2019; Vyatkina, 2013; Yoon & Polio, 2017) in the syntactic complexity of L2 writing. Although these studies oten varied with respect to the syntactic complexity indices adopted, the proficiency levels of the L2 leaners examined and the writing tass used, they have revealed some general trends of syntactic complexity development. For example, previous studies have noted that the length of production units (e., sentences, T-units, or clauses) and the density of complex phrases tend o increase along with proficiency (e.g., Jiang et al., 2019; Lu, 2011) and learning time (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Vyatkina, 2013; Yoon & Polio, 2017). Coordination and subordination have been found to be indicative of beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency, respectively, while phrasal-level complexification is the most pervasive means of syntactic complexity for advanced learners (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Lu, 201; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Ortea, 2003; Vyatkina, 2013). Notably, this body of research has focused on L2 writers at secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels, and litte research has examined L2 writers at more advanced proficiency levels, such as emerging L2 IP writers (Yin, Gao, & Lu, 2021).

# 2.3. RA rhetorical functions and linguistic features

Recognizing the importance of RA rhetorical strategic knowledge for novice academic writers to produce genre-appropriate RA writing (e.g., Amnuai, 2017, 2019; Ren & Li, 2011; Wannaruk & Amnuai, 2016), some studies have compared differences in the rhetorical structures of RAs written by L1 and L2 academic writers. The Create a Research Space (CARS) model (Swales, 1990, 2004) has been commonly used in such studies to identify rhetorical functions in RAs. Taylor and Chen (1991), for example, compared the rhetorical structures of RA introductions writen by Chinese and L1 English researchers in hard sciences. They found that Chinese researchers provided lessextensive discussion about existing literature than L1 English researchers. Sheldon (2011) analyzed the rhetorical differences in applied linguistics RA introductions written in English by L1 English and Spanish-background L2 English researchers and in Spanish by L1 Spanish researchers. The analysis revealed a close affinity of L1 English texs to the CARS model and CARS-like control of RA introductions in the L2 English texts with mixed features that \*respond to the conventions of the discourse community and readership at a national level but may obstruct gaining international publication" (p. 247). Abdi and Sadeghi (2018) compared differences betwen Iranian and L1 English writr in their use f trategie for claming centrality in applied inguistics RA introductions. Their study revealed that 1 and L2 RAs were similar in the mean occurrence of cenralit claims; however, 1 RAs made more frequent apels to maude ., nmber of releant studs) and topiclity ., nes of rearch topic) i their centrality claims, while L2 RAs made more frequent appeals to salience and problematicity (e.g., challenges in the field). Other studies have examined the rhetorical structures of RAs written in languages other than English to understand whether researchers from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds may employ diffrent rhetorical strategies than those outlined in the CARS model. Ahmad (1997), for example, analyzed the introduction sections of 20 RAs written in Malay and found that $3 5 \%$ of the samples lacked Move 2 (Establishing a niche), and even those with this move tended to summarize others' work only without explicit evaluation or criticism. Loi (2010) compared the rhetorica organization of educational psychology RA inroductions written in English and Chinese and found that overall the moves and steps in the CARS model were used in fewer Chinese texts. Sheldon (2011) found that while L1 Spanish RA introductions displayed "a movement towards the parameters of English academic discourse' in terms of the rhetorical moves used, they have also resisted standardization with the English register by not producing cyclical patterns" typically found in English RAs, reflecting the effort of the linguistic community in Spain' to \*maintain the dynamism of its own cultural discourse" (p. 247).

Recent English for Academic Purposes (EAP) scholarship has argued for the need to analyze linguistic forms and rhetorical structres of academic writing in tandem, noting that a focus on ither rhetorical stuctures or linguistic fatures of acadmic writing in isolation fals short of capturing genre knowledge (e.g., Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2021; Swales, 2019). Several studies have demonstrated an intimate tie between specific linguistic features and rhetorical moves in RAs and RA part-genres (e.g., Hirano, 2009; Samraj, 2002), mostly concentrating on such lexical and phraseological features as exical bundles and phrase-frames. For example, Cortes (2013) extracted a lis of lexical bundles from a corpus of RA introductions and aligned them with different rhetorical moves and steps. Lu, Yoon, and Kisselev (2021) identified a list of phras-frames from a corpus of social science RA introductions and matched them to different rhetrical move-steps. A few studies have also examined the syntactic realizations of rhetorical moves in RAs. In particular Lu et al. (2020) called for a functional turn in syntactic complexity research, arguing that \*whil formal measures of syntactic complexity may mark progression toward higher writing proficiency, quality writing is characterized by genre-appropriate and functionally effectie usage of complex syntactic structures, rather than th frequency of such structures alone' (p. 2). They analyzed the rhetorical functions f yntactically complex sentences in a corpus of social science RA introductions and revealed how expert RA writrs employ various complex structures (i.e, long sentences, left-embeddedness inite subordinate clauses, non-finite elements, and nominalizations) to effectively achieve diffrent rhetorical goal. In a similar vein, Fauzan, Lubis, and Kurniawan (2020) reported that the distribution of some grammatcal features (e.g., different verb tenses varied substantiall across ifferent rhetorical move-steps in RA abstracts, while that of others (.g., the use of base, transitive erbs) was more uniform acros al rhetorical move-steps. Notably, the body of research on linguistic realizations of rhetorical functions in RA writing has not yet targeted RAs produced by emerging IP writers, nor has it adopted a diachronic perspective to explore the potential influence of changes in RA writers' rhetorical trategies over time on changes in their use of linguistic features.

# 2.4. The current study

The three lines of research reviewed above have convincingly showcased the value of diachronic studies of academic discourse, the importance of syntactic complexity in L2 writing development, and the need to examine academic language features (including syntactic complexity features) in light of the rhetorical functions they are used to realize. These insights and the research gaps identified above provide strong motivation for us to pursue a diachronic analysis of the patterns of change of syntactic complexity in academic discourse produced by emerging and expert IP writers and to seek arhetorical strategic acount of the changes observed. The specific research questions addressed in the current study are as follows:

1. How does the syntactic complexity of RA introductions produced by emerging and expert IP writers differ at each of the following three time points: 1998, 2008, and 2018?   
2. How does the syntactic complexity of RA introductions produced by emerging and expert IP writers change across the three time points: 1998, 2008, and 2018? In what ways do the patterns of change for emerging and expert IP writers differ?   
3. How might the diachronic changes in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions produced by emerging IP writers be explained by diachronic changes in the rhetorical strategies employed by such writers?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The corpora

Our dataset consisted of two self-compiled corpora, each containing 90 RA introductions sampled from Chinese Journal of Aplied Linguistics (CJAL) and Applied Linguistics (AL), respectively. Our decision to focus on RA introductions was informed by two consid erations, namely, the existence of the well-established CARS model for analyzing the rhetorical move-steps in RA introductions, and the better consistency in clearly marking the boundaries of the introduction section than in marking those of other part-genres in the RAs in CJAL acros our data collection time span.These two journals were selected out of consideration for ther representativeness for sampling emerging and expert RA writig as well as the comparabilit i terms of aims and scope, as detailed by Ruan (2018) and Yin et al. (2021). CJAL constitutes an appropriate source for selecting emerging IP writers RA writing because many Chinese applied linguistics scholars have chosen it as their first IP veue, while AL is ideal for sampling expert IP writers RA writing beause it appeals to experienced applied inguistic researchers and expert IP writers with its broad international scope and high impact in the field. For RA introductions in the CJAL corpus, all authors had Chinese names and affliations with Chinese institutions, and no author had published any other English RA before their first publication in CJAL. For those in the AL corpus, l authors had three or more prior publications in high impact international applied lingusics journals. Given our focus on comparing emerging and expert IP writers rather than L2 and L1 IP writers, we did not restrict the L1 background of expert IP writers, in line with the common practice to not limit the authors L1 background when investigating features of expert RA writing (e.g., Ansarifar, Shahriari, & Pishghadam, 2018; Lu et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2021).

To investigate changes in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions written by emerging and expert IP writers over the past two decades, we sampled 30 RA introductions published in each journal in each of the following three years: 1998, 2008, and 2018. We decided on two 10-year intervals to ensure adequate time for meaningful (., statistically significant and substantial) changes to potentially take place based on findings from previous diachronic studies (e.g., Bondi, 2014; Gillaerts, 2014), and we decided on a 20-year time span because the RAs in the CJAL were available from 1994 only. To avoid ambiguity and inconsistency in identifying he introduction sections, we collcted RAs with separate inroduction and literature review sections from the two journals only. Table 1 summarizes the composition of the final dataset. For either journal, if not enough RAs met the citerion for emerging or expert IP writer selection for any of the three time points, a few RAs were sampled from the prior or following year to reach a total of 30 RA introductions for that time point to ensure an adequate sample size for our quantitative analysis (e.g., Qin, 2004) and reasonable generalizations (e.g., Hyland & Jiang, 2016, 2018). For the CJAL corpus, the 2018 subcorpus contained 11 samples from 2017 and two samples from 2019. For the AL corpus, the 1998 subcorpus contained 11 samples from 1997, the 2008 subcorpus contained three samples from 2007, and the 2018 subcorpus contained two samples from 2017. ltogether, 128 different authors were represented in the CJAL corpus (31 in 1998, 41 in 2008, and 56 in 2018), and 170 different authors were represented in the AL corpus (49 in 1998, 61 in 2008, and 60 in 2018). These numbers suggest that the RAs published in AL tended to be more collaborative than those published in CJAL, but the difference has become smaller over time. From a design perspective, the larger number of authors than samples represented in the CJAL and AL corpora could help enhance the representativenessof emerging and IP writers of the two relatively small specialized corpora (Egbert, 2019).

# 3.2. Syntactic complexity measurement

Each sample in the dataset was assessed for syntactic complexity using L2SCA (Lu, 2010). As mentioned earlier, this computerized tool generates numeric values for 14 holistic syntactic complexity measures. We selected seven indices (see Table 2) for our analysis based on previous recommendations concerning the validity, redundancy, and complementarity of the L2sCA indice (eg, Lu, 2011; Lu & Ai, 2015; Norri & Ortega, 2009; Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015). Two length of production unit indices, i., mean length of sentence (MLS) and mean length of T-unit (MLT), were selected to measure global sentence and T-unit complexity. T-units per sentence (T/S) was selected to measure sentential coordination. Clauses per T-unit (C/T) was selected to measure clausal subordination as Lu (2011) and Lu and Ai (2015) reported redundancy among the four subordination measures in L2SCA and several studies reported evidence of the abilit of C/T to differntiate proficiency levels and index developmental changes (Casal & Lee, 2019; Yoon, 2017). Mean length of clause (MLC) was selected to measure elaboration at the clause level, and coordinate phrases per clause (CP/C) and complex nominals per clause (CN/C) were selected to measure phrasal coordination and elaboration (Yang et al., 2015; Yoon, 2017).

# 3.3. Move analysis

To explain potential historical changes in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions written by emerging and expert IP writers from a rhetorical strategic perspective, we conducted a move analysis of each sample fllowing Swales (1990, 2004) CARS model (see Fig. 1). Two researchers independently coded all samples in both corpora. Following Cotos, Huffman, and Link (2020) and Lu et al. (2020), we treatd the rhetrical chunk as the unit of rhetorical analysis but used the sentenceas the unit of anotation to facilitate the examination of the relationship between rhetorical functions and the syntactic complexity features used to realize them. Specifically, we firs identified rhetorical steps at the rhetoricl chunk lel, and then annotated a sentence with the steps that occurred in it. When multiple steps occurred within a single sentence, the sentence is annotated with alit of those steps, and the step realized by the main clause was considered as the main function of the sentence. This methodological choice not only allowed us to compute syntactic complexity indices eficiently, as the sentence is a fundamental unit of syntactic complexity analysis, but also made it possible to examine how a RA writers' use of complexstructures in a sentence may be related to the juxtaposition of multiple rhetorical steps within that sentence. Inter-rater reliability, calculated using Krippendorff'salpha, reached 0.9. The two annotators resolved lldis agreements through extensive discussion.

# 3.4. Statistical and qualitative analysis

To addressthe frst two research questions, atwo-way multivariate analysis of variance (MAnovA) was conducted along with a series of follow-up univariate F tests and Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine whether significant differences in the syntactic complexity of R inroductions exist between the two corpora a ech of the thre time points a ell as among the three time points for each corpus. To address the third research question, a qualitative analysis to find out whether and how differences in rhetorical strategies may have influenced the differences in syntactic complexity observed was conducted on a subset of the samples in each corpus. Specifically, ollowing the practice in previous studies to make the manual analysis manageable while maintaining repre. sentativenessof the results (e.g., Wen & Lei, 2022; Adel, 2014), we randomly selected 10RA inroductions from each time point in each corpus for a close comparative move-step analysis. This analysis involved examining changes in the distribution of move-steps in the samples from the two corpora across the three time points and relating such changes to the changes i syntactic complexity observed.

# 4. Results and discussion

The results of the two-way MANOVA showed significant main effects of journal (Wilk's $\Lambda = 0 . 7 3 6$ $\mathrm { F } = 4 . 1 2 5$ $p < . 0 0 1$ $\eta 2 = 0 . 2 6 4 )$ and year (Wilk's $\Lambda { = } 0 . 7 1 8$ $\mathrm { F } = 2 . 0 7 5$ $p = . 0 0 1$ $\eta 2 = 0 . 1 5 3 \AA$ on the seven syntactic complexity measures, with large effect sizes $( \eta 2 >$ 0.14) (Cohen, 198), indicating substantial dfferences in syntacti complexity between the two corpora as well asacrossthe three time points. Moreover, the interaction effect between journal and year (Wilk's $\Lambda = 0 . 7 5 6$ $\mathrm { F } = 1 . 7 2 3$ $p = . 0 1 5$ $\begin{array} { r } { \eta 2 = 0 . 1 3 0 \mathrm { ) } } \end{array}$ was also significant, with a medium effect size $( \eta 2 > 0 . 0 6 )$ (Cohen, 1988), indicating moderate variation between the two corpora in how syntactic omplexity differed acrossthe three time points. A series f follow-up Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to further explore the specific efects of journal and year on the syntactic complexity of RA introductions in the seven measures (seeTables 3 and 4 for the significant results).

# 1.1. Comparisons between emerging and expert ${ \cal I P }$ writers at each time point

Table 3 summarizes the comparisons etween the CJAL and AL corpora at each of the three time points. Our results revealed several similarities and differences in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions written by emerging Chinese IP writers and expert IP writers at the three time points.First, the two corpora did not differ significantly in the two sentential and phrasal coordination measures (i.e, T/S and CP/C) at any of the three time points, indicating that the use of coordination was consistently comparable between emerging Chinese P writers and expert IP writrs over the past two decades. This finding is in line with previous results from L2 writing studies that advanced L2 English writers tend to use comparable amounts of coordination as L1 English writers e.g., Ai & Lu, 2013; Mancilla, Polat, & Akcay, 2015; Norris & Ortega, 2009).

Second, the CJAL corpus showed significantly lower values of C/T than the AL corpus at all three time points, indicating that emerging Chinese IP writers consistently used lower amounts of finte subordination than expert IP writers. Although some scholars have argued that subordination is not an important feature of academic writing (e.g., Biber et al., 2011), other studies have reported significantly lower usage of finite subordination by emerging/L2 academic writers than by expert/L1 academic writers (e.g., Wu, Mauranen, & Lei, 2020; Yin et al., 2021) and demonstrated important functional roles of finite subordination in RA writing (e.g., Lu et a., 2020; Yin et al., 2021). For instance, Lu et al. (2020) found that finit dependent lauses are frequently used by expert RA writers to articulate research questions/hypotheses and explain results. Yin et al. (2021) noted that expert IP writers are beter at "comb. nations of different types of dependent clauses within a single sentence to present complex information, explain relationships, and discuss onditions' (p. 9). Further analys is necessary to understand whether the consistent lower usage of finite subordination is unique to 1 Chinese emerging IP writers or applicable to ll emerging IP writers. A fine-grained analysis of the specific types of finite subordinate clauses consistently used more frequently by expert IP writers as well asthe functions they are used to realize can yield useful findings to help emerging Chinese IP writers more efectively engage with finite subordination in RA introduction writing.

Third, for the two global complexity indices i.e, MLS and MLT), the CJAL corpus showed significantly lower values than the AL corpus at two time points (i.., 1998 and 2018), indicating that emerging Chinese IP writers tended to produce shorter sentences and Tunits than expert $\mathrm { I P }$ writers at those time points. Yin et al. (2021) reported similar differences in a synchronous study. Lu et al. (2020) found that long sentences in RA introductions written by expert IP writers usuall result from the use of acombination of complex structures to integrate diverse piees of infomation and/r richer dtail. t would thus appear useful for further qualitatie analysis to shed light on whether the shorter sentences produced by emerging Chinese IP writers resulted from a weaker tendency to integrate more informative details within each rhetorical step.

Finally, while in 1998 the CJAL corpus showed significantly lower values for MLC and CN/C than the AL corpus, in 2008 and 2018 the values of these two measures became comparable between the two corpora, with the exception that in 2008 the CJAL corpus showed a higher value of MLC than the AL corpus. These results indicate that in more recent years emerging Chinese IP writers increased their engagement with clausal elaboration and complex nominals, both of which are highly important characteristics of academic writing g., Biber et a., 2011; Biber & Gray, 2010; Halliday & Martin, 2003; Lu e al., 2020; Wells 1960). These patterns of difference appear positive from a quantitative perspective, and it would be useful for further qualitative analysis to reveal whether emerging Chinese IP writers and expert IP writers also used these complex structures to achieve similar rhetorical functions.

# 4.2. Syntactic complexity changes over time for emerging and expert ${ \cal I P }$ writers

Table 4 summarizes the comparisons acros the three time points fr each corpus, and Figs. 2-4 graph the changes in the syntactic complexty indices across the three time points for each corpus. These reults revealed some differences and similarities in thepatterns of diachronic change of the syntactic complexity of RA inroductions written by emerging and expert IP writer from 1998 to 2018. For the AL corpus, the only significant diachronic change observed was the significant increase of the phrasal coordination measure (i., CP/C) from 1998 to 2018, indicating that the syntactic complexity of the RA introductions produced by expert IP writers remained largely stable in the past two decades. Meanwhile, in addition to the significant increase in CP/C, a declining trend for the finte subordination measure (i.., C/T) and a rising trend for the complex nominal measure i., CN/C can also be observed, and it remains interesting to se if these trends would lead to significant changes in the future. These trends align with the view that the compact inexplicit discourse style of RAs i efiet and functional (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016) as well as previous findings that phrasal features tend to be associatd with higher writing quality and proficiency in L1 and L2 academic writig (eg., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples & Reppen, 2016).

Similar to the AL corpus, the CJAL corpus showed no significant change in the sentential coordination and finite subordination measures (i., T/S and C/T). The other five measures all showed different patterns of diachronic change in the CJAL corpus than in the AL corpus. Notably, allfive increase significantly from 1998 to 2008 in the CJAL corpus, indicating that Chinese emerging IP writers produced longer sentences, T-units and clauses and employed more coordinate phrases and more complex nominals in 2008 than in 1998. In 2018, the two global complexity measure i., MLS andMLT) decrease significantly from 2008 back to levels comparable to those in 1998. Overall these patterns of change could be regarded as positive, as they brought emerging Chinese IP writers use of syntactic features more in line with expert IP writers use of such features over time: While five of the seven syntactic complexity measures showed significantly lower values in the RA introductions produced by emerging Chinese IP writers than in those produced by expert IP writers in 1998, this number reduced to thee in 2018. Further qualitatie analysis i needed to shed light on the rhetorical strategic reasons underlying the simultaneous increase of multiple measures from 1998 to 2008 and the simultaneous decrease of multiple measures from 2008 to 2018 in the CJAL corpus.

# 4.3. Rhetorical strategic interpretations of cross-time syntactic complexity changes

Table 5 summarizes the number and percentage of introductions (among the 10 random sample from each corpus) that included each move-step in the CARS model. Several important observations can be made regarding the move-step distribution in the two corpora. irst almostall move-steps in the CARS model were utilized by a greater proportion of RA introductions in the AL corpus than in the CJAL corpus at all three time points, indicating beter alignment of the rhetorical strategies used by expert IP writers with the CARS model. Second, thedistribution of the move-steps was more stable acrossthe three time points in the AL corpus than in the CJAL corpus, in line with the greater cos-time syntactic complexity stability observed in the AL corpus than in the CJAL corpus. Third. among the three moves, Move 1 demonstrated the most consistent distribution across the three time points and between the two corpora, with Move 1 Step 2 (making topic generalization(s) occurring in most samples in both corpora. This indicates emerging and expert IP writers' consensus regarding the importance of establishing a research terriory in general and of making topic general. izations in particular in writing RA introductions. Fourth, a greater proportion of CJAL RA introductions integrated more move-steps in the CARS model in 2018 than in the two earlier years, indicating a gradual trend for emerging Chinese IP writers to employ rhetorical strategies in more similar waysto expert IP writers over the past two decades. In particular, Move 2 Step 1 (indicating a gap or adding to what is known) increased from $3 0 \%$ in 1998 to $4 0 \%$ in 2008 to $8 0 \%$ in 2018, indicating greater attention to explicit establishment of research gaps by emerging Chinese $\mathrm { I P }$ writers at the most recent time point. In addition, the CJAL corpus also showed a gradual increase in the diversity and frequency of Move 3 steps across the three time points.

Following the itial quantitative comparison of the distriution of move-steps across the three time points in the two corpora, our qualitative analysis focused on identifying specific cross-time rhetorical strategic differences in the CJAL corpus that may have given rise to the cross-time syntactc complexity differences observed in this corpus. A close reding of thesamples annotated with hetorical move-steps in this corpus revealed a greater rhetorical preference for embedded move-steps within individual sentences in the RA introductions in 2008 than in the other two years. In what flows, we illustrate the thre ways in which this preference manfested and discuss how they each directly contributed to the significant increase in the values of the measures of global complexit,clausal elaboration, and phrasal complexity in the CJAL corpus in 2008 in comparison to 1998 and 2018.

First, emerging Chinese $\mathrm { I P }$ writers exhibited a greater tendency to embed Move 1 (establishing a territory) in Move 3 Step 1 (announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively) sentences in 2008. This functional embedding has resulted in some very long sentences, as illustrated in Example ${ ( 1 ) } ^ { 4 }$ , where two elaborated subordinate clause structures (i.e., an as-adverbial clause and a which-attributive clause) were used to realize the embedding of Move 1 Step 1 (claiming centrality). By contrast, Move 3 Step 1 sentences more commonly followed Move 1 sentences in 1998 and Move 2 sentences in 2018, as illustrated in Examples (2) and (3), respectively. Although the two sentences in Example (2) also each contained a subordinate clause structure (i.e., a that-complement clause for topic generalization and a which-atributie clause to articulat research purpose, respectively), the absence of functional embedding reduced the need for multiplesuch structures to convey extra information and concomitantly the length of these sentences.

Second, while Move 2 was substantially les frequent in 1998 nd 2008 than in 2018, emerging Chinese IP writers tended to weaken Move 2 and embed it in Move 3 sentences in 2008 more ften than in 1998 and 2018. As Sheldon (2011) noted, the role of Move 2isto criticize or refute previous claims of knowledge, allowing writersto create a niche for their contribution' (p. 242). She found that L2 writers tended to employ "a weaker version' of Move 2 compared to L1 writers, who were more likely to explicitly foreground the limitations or gaps of previous research (e.g., directly in a separate sentence) than to weaken it (e.g., embedded in a sentence with different main function). In Example (4), Move 2 Step 1 (indicating a gap or adding to what i known) was weakened and embedded (as a nonfinite subordinate clause introduced by in order to) in a sentence whose main function was Move 3 Step 1. This embedding practice resulted in a much longer sentence than the Move 3 Step 1 entences in Example (2) from 1998, which was not preceded by any Move 2 sentence, and Example (3 from 2018, which was preceded by afull Move 2 Step 1 sentence that explicitly foregrounded the research gap. Embedding Move 2 in Move 3 sentences has also led to a larger number of complex nominals per clause, in line with Gray, Cotos, and Smith's (2020) finding that nominal units such as abstract, proces, and cognition nouns and nominalizations, which are often modified in various ways, are frequently used in Move 2 to frame abstract concepts.

Third, while emerging Chinese IP writers employed fewer types of Move 3 steps in 1998 and 2008 than in 2018, they tended to embed multiple Move 3 steps into a single sentence more frequently in 2008 than in 1998 and 2018. In Example (5), Step 1 (announcing present research descriptively), Step 4 summarizing methods), and Step 6 (stating the value of the present research) of Move 3 were merged into one long sentence. T-unit length and clause length increased along with sentence length in this example, and phrasal cordination and complex nominals also increased as a result of the high lel of information compression. In 2018, emerging Chinese IP writr used more diverse Move 3 stes overall and were also more likely to prent these stes separately, as ilustrated in

Example (6).

Overall, our analysis revealed positive co-evolvement of the rhetorical and inguistic behaviors of emerging Chinese IP writers across the three time points. ver time, their use of rhetorical move-stes has become better aligned with the CARS model and the use by expert IP writers. The low frequency of Move 2 at the two early time points in the CJAL corpus may have arisen from such factors as emerging Chinee IP writers'reluctance to explicitly discuss the weakness or limitations of previous work to avoid creating dis harmonized relationships (Adnan, 2014) and thir lower pressure to compete for research space and publish in international journals at the earlier time points (Jogthong, 2001; Najjar, 1990). Meanwhile, the increased use of Move 2 and the use of more diverse Move 3 steps in more recent years may have partially arisen from the changing prestige and practice of CJAL. Initiallycreated in 1978 as a newsletter with the name Teaching English in China, the journal expanded its scope with a tite change to Chinese Journal of Applied Linguistics in 2010,started publishing with De Gruyter Mouton, an international publisher, i 2011, and has since then been indexed by an increasingly large number of databases (e.g., Scopus). Previous studies have claimed that literacy brokers such as editors and reviewers could influence journal publication opportunities and contribute to shaping text production in rhetorical aspects eg. Lillis & Curry, 2006). While the prestige of academic ournals has en argued to be subjective (eg., Morale, McKienan, Nile, Schimanski, & Juan, 2021), the shift in the journal's publication practice with an international publisher and its increasing international visibility may have jointly triggered greater conformity of its accepted RAs to the linguistic and rhetorical conventions of expert RAs.

The emerging Chinese IP writers' increased use of multifunctional sentences in 2008 has contributed to the increase in syntactic complexity in that yer. While their use of this rhetorical strategy declined in 2018, the bette alignment f their and expert IP writers rhetorical strategy use in 2018 discussed above likely helped consolidate some of the syntactic complexity improvement in 2008 and also contributed to the better comparabilit of syntactic complexity between the two groups in 2018 than in 198. Despite the positive evolvement, mportant dfferences till exis in the rhtorical straegies used by emerging and expert IP writers as well as the yntactic complexit f the RA introductions they produced, suggesting the need for ERPP pedagogy to help further develop emerging Chinese IP writers' genre competence.

# 5. Conclusion

This study examined diachronic changes in the syntactic complexity of RA introductions produced by emerging Chinese IP writers and expert IP writers over three time points in the past two decades. Our analys revealed a number of differences in the patterns of diachronic change between the two groups as well as in their levels of syntactic complexit atdifferent time points. Furthermore, the study also revealed diffrences in the rhetorical trategies used by the two groups and a connection between cross-time changes in emerging Chinese IP writers rhetorical strategy use and the cros-time changes in the syntactic complexit of the RA introductions they produced over the past 20 years. Our focus on syntactic complexity features and emerging IP writers has allowed us to ill two important gaps in diachronic studies of academic discourse. Our attempt to seek a rhetorical strategic account of the syntactic complexity changes observed also helps promote the synergy between diachronic and functional perspectives to the study of academic language use.

Our findings can be of value to genre-based ERPP pedagogy aimed at helping emerging IP writers expand their rhetorical stategies and their rertoire of efective inguistic means for materializing thosestrategie.In terms of syntactic complexity, previous research has emphasized the need to focus on phrasal complexity in academic writing pedagogy (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016). However, the consistent lower usage of finite subordination at al time points by emerging Chinese IP writers than by expert IP writers and the substantial fluctuation of global complexity indices over time in the CJAL corpus point to the need for pedagogical attention to functionally appropriate engagement with finite subordination and global complexity as well Indeed, recent studies have recommended the use of genre-based activities to teach these and other important syntactic complexity features (e.g, non-finite elements and nominalizations) based on the analysis of such features in synchronous expert RA writing data (e.g., Casal, 2020; Casal & Lu, 2021). Our results that the syntactic complexity of the RA introductions written by expert IP writers has remained largely stable over the past two decades indicates that such pedagogical recommendations informed by findings from synchronous studies may well remain valid over time. In terms of rhetorical strategy use, our analysis revealed that emerging Chinese IP writers employed more sophisticated and appropriate rhetorical strategies over time, as evidenced in the increased usage of multifunctional sentences in 2008 and the higher frequency f Move 2 and geater diversity f Move stes in 2019. Despite this positive progress however, further room for improvement with respect to Move 3 steps remains. For example, Move 3 Step 5 (announcing principal outcomes) was deployed in all RA inroductions by expert IP writer in 2018 but was not used by any emerging Chinese writersat any time point. It may be helpful to design genre-based activities to foster stronger awareness of the value of highlighting principal reearch outcomes early on among emerging Chinee IP writers. l i all, along with the findings from recent EAP studies of the connections between linguisti orms and rhetorical structures in academic writing (e.g., Cortes, 2013; Fauzan et al., 2020; Hirano, 2009; Lu et al., 2020), our findings support the view that quipping emerging P witers with arepertoire f nessary rhtrical stratgies as well as efective linguistic means for realizing those strategies should remain an important part of future ERPP pedagogy.

Several limitations and avenues for future studies exist First, regarding the IP writers analyzed in the current study, we targeted a specific group of emerging IP writers, namely, Chinese scholars who have published their first-ever English RA in an emerging international journal, and we did not distinguish the L1 backgrounds of our expert IP writers. As one reviewer noted, graduate student writers with no IP experience, especially doctoral students, constitute an important group of emerging IP writers that can be examined in future research. Another reviewer noted the inability for the current study to examine whether Chinese expert IP writers would be more similar to the emerging group or the expert group in terms of syntactic complexity and the use of rhetorical moves, an interesting issue that is worthy of further investigation. Second, in terms of rhetorical analysis, we used the sentence as the unit of annotation to allow for efficient syntactic complexity analysis and expedient examination of the syntactic complexity features of multifunctional sentences. Future studies could employ the rhetorical chunk as the unit of annotation to bettr examine the relationship between individual rhetrical move-steps and their syntactic complexit features. Third, in terms of syntactic complexity analysis, we analyzed syntactic complexity changes using holistic indices only. It would be desirable for future studies to employ fine-grained indices to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the historical changes in emerging IP writers' use of specific subtypes of different syntactic structures in relation to rhetorical stategies. Fourth, our textual analys did not llow us to systematically explore the possible link between the historical changes observed and various external factors, such as the globalization of English, the increasing pressure for emerging scholars to publish in international journals, and changes in international publication practices (e.g., Wen & Lei, 2022), which is worthy of investigation in future reearch. Finall, the scale and scope of the current study can be further expanded by analyzing RA writers with other disiplinary backgrounds, focusing on other RA part-genres, and extending the length of the historical period (e.g., Hyland, 2016; 2018; Wen & Lei, 2022).
