What does it take to be an effective educator today? It is becoming ever more clear that the answer to this question lies not only in knowing subject matter content or specific strategies. Teachers today also need to know more about the students who currently occupy U.S classrooms and, even more important, they need to challenge the conventional wisdom concerning the abilities and skills of these students. The goal of the textbooks in the Language, Culture, and Teaching Series is to help teachers do these things. Lawrence Berlin’s book, Contextualizing College ESL Classroom Praxis: A Participatory Approach to Effective Instruction, is a valuable contribution to the series. Primarily for preservice and inservice ESL and foreign language teachers working in diverse settings, Berlin’s book focuses its attention on those who want to know how best to reach all their students.

It is becoming increasingly mandatory for preservice and practicing teachers to understand the demographic context of their classrooms and schools. At the dawn of the 21st century, the United States is more ethnically, racially, and linguistically diverse than it has ever been. The 2000 Census, for instance, found that while Whites decreased from $80 \%$ to $7 5 \%$ of the total population in the 10-year period from 1990–2000, the African-American population increased from $1 2 . 1 \%$ to $1 2 . 3 \%$ , and the Native American population grew from $0 . 8 \%$ to $0 . 9 \%$ . Even more dramatic, the Asian population increased from $2 . 8 \%$ to $3 . 6 \%$ and the Latino population grew by more than one fourth, from $9 \%$ to $1 2 . 5 \%$ of the total (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002).

A striking indication of this growing diversity is found in the current number of foreign-born or first-generation U.S. residents, which in 2000 reached $5 6 \mathrm { m i l }$ - lion, the highest level in U.S. history, or triple the number from 1970 (Schmidley, 2002). Unlike previous immigrants who were principally from Europe, more than half of the new immigrants are from Latin America and one fourth are from Asia (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002). The growing immigration has been accompanied by an increasing linguistic diversity: Nearly $1 8 \%$ of the total U.S. population now speak a language other than English at home, with more than half of these speaking Spanish (Snyder & Hoffman, 2001). Cultural, racial, and linguistic differences are no longer confined to urban centers; many suburban and rural schools are also experiencing tremendous demographic changes and every school in the nation will soon be characterized by diversity of all kinds.

Along with the changing complexion of U.S. schools, notions of how best to educate students of different backgrounds have also changed over the years. Although the common school movement of the late 19th century provided educational access to a much broader segment of the population than had been the case previously, a time-honored function of the public schools was to assimilate young people to be more like the “mainstream.” Joel Spring (2004), for instance, has made a compelling case that rather than a noble effort to provide all students with an equal education, the common school movement was primarily an attempt to stop the growing drift toward a multicultural society.

Given this context, it is little surprise that long-held notions about cultural and racial superiority and inferiority have often found their way into teacher education texts. For much of our educational history, the conventional wisdom was that students whose cultures and languages differed from the majority were functioning with a deficiency rooted in their very identities. Consequently, the thinking was that the sooner students assimilated to become more like the majority—in culture, language, appearance, experience, and values—the easier would be their transition to the mainstream and middle class.

The books in the Language, Culture, and Teaching Series resist such traditional views. Instead, these texts challenge negative biases about cultural, linguistic, racial, social class, and other kinds of diversity and about students who embody those differences. Written by educators and researchers from a variety of cultural backgrounds and disciplines, these books attempt to fill the gap that currently exists in preparing teachers for the schools and classrooms of the 21st century. The books focus on the intersections of language, culture, and teaching— specifically, on how language and culture inform practice. At the same time, the series reframes the conventional idea of the textbook by envisioning classroom practice as critical, creative, and liberatory.

Contextualizing College ESL Classroom Praxis takes participatory pedagogy in ESL classrooms seriously. Using the “problem-posing” approach proposed by Paulo Freire (1970), Berlin asks prospective and practicing teachers to think imaginatively and critically about teaching and learning in the ESL classroom. This book, as well as the others in the LCT series, supports the Freirian notion that education is never neutral or objective. The role of teachers is likewise never neutral, but a political project on behalf of, or against, the interests of those they teach. Hence, instead of viewing the textbook as unquestioned authority, Lawrence Berlin asks readers to reflect, question, critique, and respond to what they read through their thinking and practice. The result is a book that teachers will turn to again and again for support and inspiration.

The aim of this book is to provide you (i.e., undergraduate and graduate students, pre-service and in-service teachers) with a model for engaging effective instruction with the variety of students that you will encounter in the college English as a second language or foreign language classroom. While the contexts are clearly different—second language contexts are ones in which the target language is spoken in the external environment and foreign language contexts are ones in which it is typically not—effective language instruction has many common elements which need to be contextualized to any setting as you shall soon see. Along with the model, the book is designed to help you develop the tools to use it within a participatory approach. A participatory approach is a way to teach based on the principles of Paulo Freire’s critical pedagogy (Freire, 1970; Freire & Macedo, 1987); in this text, however, I combine these principles with multicultural education and the general tenets of a communicative approach to language teaching. Thus, from the philosophical to the theoretical to the practical, you will read about a variety of concepts in chapter 1 that combine these several strands into a cohesive framework. Although I provide definitions for you at various points in the book, the best way to develop an understanding of a participatory approach is by engaging in it for yourself. To that end, your participation is essential and the experience you bring to the classroom and the material is invaluable. You will be asked to apply what is called problem-posing throughout the book and the course. In other words, your learning process begins by naming issues, reflecting on them and possible solutions, and acting upon your ideas. This work is not intended to be conducted in isolation, however; it is aided and enhanced by sharing your ideas with your instructor and classmates, and keeping an open mind to analyze their ideas critically.

# NAMING

The book is organized to present some key issues for you to think about. You will be asked to reflect on and respond to the Pre-Reading Questions conscientiously. Following your personal responses, you will be asked to exchange ideas with one or more partners. This will enable you to confirm some of your own beliefs and ideas, or to hear contrasting input arising from the experience of others. This task is designed to help you and your classmates co-construct knowledge, or develop a common understanding from multiple perspectives.

# REFLECTING

As you read the ensuing chapters, allow your mind to return to your responses and those of your partner(s). With a critical mind, consider whether you agree with the material presented and whether the scenarios conform to your own ideas of what teaching can and should be. Try to keep an open mind even if you don’t agree and consider the extent to which you might benefit by incorporating a different perspective into your own teaching (present or future).

At the end of each chapter, you will find some Post-Reading Questions, a topic for a Reflective Journal, and Follow-Up Activities. Use these as an opportunity to enhance your comprehension of the material, to co-construct new knowledge with your classmates, and to review your own beliefs and ideas in an effort to modify or reinforce them in your own developing model for effective language instruction.

# ACTING

Although you may consider some of the end-of-chapter work to be an “action” element, the true acting in a participatory approach will depend on what you do subsequent to your completion of this book. That is, what you do with what you learn, how you process your new experiences, and how you ultimately apply them in your life to transform the classroom and the world around you remains to be seen. Fulfilling the principles of critical pedagogy means that you bring yourself to the task of recreating education in a way that becomes a truly democratizing force for all those whose lives you touch, bringing about the realization of the action element: social justice. Although engaging in a participatory approach does not necessarily entail that you become an activist, per se, it does ask you to be an advocate for your students. It also asks you to accept that engaging education in any form is ideologically and politically informed by the very nature of your choices about which form of the language, which content, and which messages you encourage or avoid. Developing an awareness about the influence that external forces may have on the school or program where you teach, the mission of the program, and your own beliefs will ultimately help you in tandem with your students to make more informed choices (Shor, 1992).

# OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK

Chapter 1 begins with an exploration of the concept of process, and examines how it fits within a larger view of contemporary language education. In this manner, a framework is established for the book and some historical information is provided in order to help you situate a contemporary approach to second and foreign language pedagogy. There are many terms presented in this chapter, and I hope you will persevere and become interested enough to investigate them further. For our purposes here, though, a general understanding will suffice and enable you to explore your own ideas about teaching English language learners.

Chapter 2 continues with an overview of different ideas about effective in struction, developing a rationale for a new definition and model specific to the second and foreign language classroom.

Chapter 3 goes on to develop a deeper understanding by presenting an overview of the individual learner differences found in the second and foreign language classroom and by examining a variety of these factors as they may affect second language acquisition. At the end of this chapter, a list of supplemental readings is included to provide readers with the opportunity to engage in more substantive reading about any of the factors addressed.

Chapters 4 and 5 give examples of what effective means from two perspectives: teachers’ and students’. The material presented here comes directly from interviews and questionnaires of participants in Intensive English Programs and gives insights into how those individuals co-construct their contexts and realities through negotiated interaction.

Chapters 6 through 8 proceed with analyses of different components of effective language instruction, namely, the pedagogical, environmental, and societal functions. The pedagogical function emerges as what you as the teacher bring to the classroom context, on both a professional and human level, a combination of skills and gifts. The environmental function relates specifically to the immediate classroom and the interactions between you and your students. Here, too, can be found the external realities that students bring with themselves, including their previous experiences and various ways of knowing. Finally, the societal function has a multilevel purpose. It serves as the way students’ needs are brought into the learning context in order to transform that context into a useful and meaningful process, and it serves as the locus wherein democracy can be practiced—in the sense of Freire’s critical pedagogy, the basis of a participatory approach—and extended beyond the walls of the school to transform the larger society.

Chapter 9 puts the three functions—pedagogical, environmental, and societal—together as the minimal components necessary for a model of effective language instruction. Principally drawing on the themes identified from student interviews and questionnaires discussed in chapter 5, this chapter explains how they work together and, following a belief of co-construction, inform one another. Finally, chapter 10 re-presents the model in a way that enables you as a pre- or inservice teacher to contextualize what you have gained in order to make it useful and meaningful to your students in your own classroom contexts.

# THE ORIGINAL STUDY

The basis for this text comes from a case study I conducted from 1999 to 2000, using a Grounded Theory Approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). I compiled data from various sources, including interviews, questionnaires, observations, and historical records, to explore how teachers and students characterize effective language instruction in college ESL classrooms. In all, hundreds of hours of data collection, analysis, and verification led to the material you are about to read.

At the time the data were collected for this text, all of the core teachers involved had been working together for a number of years at the Center for English as a Second Language, the shortest tenure having been 10 years. There was a director, an assistant director, 4 office personnel, approximately 20 faculty, and approximately 200 students. The Center, though a self-sustained entity, maintained its affiliation with the University of Arizona through the exchange of faculty on occasion (i.e., Center faculty occasionally taught and/or supervised internships for graduate students working on a TESL degree and interested University faculty and doctoral students would conduct research or teach at the Center when enrollment permitted). Otherwise, the Center faculty worked collectively to establish curricula and policy.

Though officially positioned under one of the deans, the Center maintained a high degree of independence. External sources were sought for both funding and the recruitment of students. To underscore the Center’s level of autonomy further, it was responsible for making admission decisions, maintaining records, and arranging visas for its own international students. Thus, whereas other entities and divisions at the University remained beholden to political and administrative agenda, the Center was less so as it seemed to provide more for the University than it actually received from it. These distinctions are important to note as they allow a freedom that other ESL programs may not necessarily experience.

In many ways, when I initially undertook this project, my own role was coconstructed through my engagement of the process. I saw my status among the students change as they moved from viewing me as an outsider observing their class to a part of the class. While it cannot be said that I ever achieved complete in-group status with the students—they all understood that I, too, was a teacher at the Center and a researcher—I became part of their daily experience in the classroom. To illustrate this fact further, on a few occasions when I was absent for some reason, students would stop me in the hall or come up to me immediately before the next day’s lesson and ask why I hadn’t come to class. Their investment was made apparent by their continued interest in how the study was going, the high percentage of return on the surveys, a willingness to be interviewed, and questions during the interviews about my reasons for doing the study. My answer to the latter question, as I hope yours would be, was to continue to learn and grow, to become a better teacher, and to become a better human.

Throughout the analysis of the data, I found it interesting to note how often students’ concepts about effective language instruction closely matched those of these teachers, suggesting that their belief systems, at least with regards to language teaching, are more in sync with these teachers’ than might otherwise be expected. Are students merely repeating what teachers say language teaching should be, or are these teachers simply effective because their praxis fits with what students want? I would offer that the answer to the former is no, and to the latter is yes—somewhat.

In response to the first question, the answer is based on two factors. First, students were informed that the information they provided would be kept confidential (N.B. All the names provided in this text are pseudonyms). Furthermore, not all the students had only positive things to say about their classes; that does not, however, negate the fact that the teachers themselves are effective. The analysis suggested that student dissatisfaction was more complex. For those particular individuals, certain parts of the Effective Model were not being addressed for a variety of reasons, mostly involving matters beyond the scope of the classroom teacher. For instance, students may have based their negative opinions on (a) a lack of familiarity with American classroom culture; (b) a preference for smaller classes in order to have more personal attention; or (c) dissatisfaction with a curriculum that focuses on the improvement of all skills rather than just those the individuals may want to work on. Unfortunately, though, dissatisfaction with a program can frequently translate into a perceived dissatisfaction with the classroom teacher. Despite intermittent expressions of discontent, however, in no instance did any student actually claim that Csilla, Dean, Kevin, or Laurel were ineffective teachers.

In response to the second question regarding the match of teacher practice with student expectations, I said “yes—somewhat.” That is, in effect, the crux of the issue. As you will see in the following pages culminating in the Effective Model presented in chapter 9, a definition of effective language instruction depends on your meeting students’ expectations through your pedagogy (the pedagogical function), finding a balance between teaching and learning within the classroom environment where a supportive exchange can take place (the environmental function), and making connections between the classroom and the world beyond in order to meet students’ needs for learning the language (the societal function). To reinforce the overall effectiveness of the model, all of these functions must be attended to in context. Any ultimate model or theory that does not attend to context cannot adequately address the functions in a way that will be satisfying.

# MEET THE TEACHERS

The four teachers who were the central focus of the original study are presented here relative to the time when the research was first conducted. As with all things in life, I expect that changes will have occurred and some of them may have moved on. Nonetheless, I will always cherish the knowledge I gained through working with these individuals and I am certain that, wherever they are now, they are no less effective than when they allowed me to share in their classroom teaching experience. You will no doubt come to know them better through their own words presented in different parts of the book. The students who participated in the classes of these four teachers were also instrumental to my own learning experience. I am sure they have all moved on in their lives. The students and their comments will be presented at various places in the text. For reasons of confidentiality, however, their names have all been changed.

Dean was born in the Pacific Northwest. His mother had been a schoolteacher, which, he admits, has undoubtedly played some role in his interest in education. He is somewhat cantankerous, and quick to laugh or make a joke. He has taught for 25 years at the same institution, but, even now when approaching retirement, he has never lost his own interest in learning. Indeed, after having completed the Master of Arts in Linguistics that initially qualified him for the teaching position, he continued to take courses and earned a Master of Science degree in Finance 12 years after his first masters. His initial interest in language and culture was further enhanced by traveling, most notably to Japan where he spent 7 years involved in teaching English. While Dean remains an active professional, serving on committees and attending conferences, he has claimed that his own development as a teacher came $9 9 \%$ from experience and only $1 \%$ from education and professional development.

Unlike Dean, Laurel has found conferences to be an invaluable source for her own development. Laurel was born in New York State and, like many young people, couldn’t quite find her niche when she first started college. Utilizing her travel experiences, however, she came to realize her true calling and has never turned back. She has remained active not only in her teaching and service to her students and the school, but also has been active as a teacher educator. Throughout her 23 years at the same institution, she has mentored future ESL teachers from the university, and been invited to train teachers in locales as far away and diverse as Mexico and Kazakhstan. Actively participating in professional organizations, she often presents her work at conferences, edits a professional newsletter, and has co-authored three books about teaching ESL. She never loses her temper—in or out of class—and always seems to maintain control, taking things in her stride. With eternally smiling eyes, she laughed out loud when I called the cluttered desk in her office a perfect example of “organized chaos.” I could never find so much as a pencil on it, but she always knew exactly where everything was.

Kevin was also born in New York. An interesting character, he is as reserved outside the classroom as he is active inside the classroom. His experience teaching ESL/EFL spans 27 years in locations such as Africa (where he served in the Peace Corps) and the Middle East. He has given workshops and made numerous presentations, continuing to be nearly as active in the professional side of the field as in the classroom itself. His teaching, however, has remained his primary focus; he can often be found teaching in the evenings as well as the daytime program at his institution and other special projects, and usually takes the summers to—you guessed it—teach. His dedication to his students is well recognized; he consistently receives the highest student ratings out of all his colleagues who, by the way, all receive above average evaluations. The atmosphere of his classes can best be described as vibrant with students actively engaged in learning.

Csilla (pronounced “chill-ah”) had been at the school for the least amount of time of all the teachers—9 years. The youngest of the four, she was also the only one to have received a PhD, which she earned studying contrastive linguistics in her native Hungary. Along with her colleagues, Csilla shares an interest in lifelong learning, having continued to take courses at the university in areas as different from linguistics as astronomy and biology. In addition to teaching ESL in the United States, she tutored and taught English at a medical school in Hungary, she taught aerobics, and she worked in a law office. These several eclectic experiences have, in her own estimation, benefited her immensely in being able to relate to students’ diverse interests and needs. Her willingness to explore has not, in any way, hindered her professional development in the field of ESL, though. She has been actively involved in making presentations and attending professional conferences—another avenue, she has remarked, that has contributed to her own learning.

As you read through the book, I have integrated the words of the four teachers along with short scenarios intended to give you a sense of what it is like to participate in their classes. I hope you will take note of their experience to help you understand the various skills and gifts they bring to the classroom context—the collage of personality and professionalism that you, too, will learn to integrate into your own effective language instruction.

# MEET THE AUTHOR

Having long possessed an interest in learning about diverse languages and cultures, I commenced my own journey into studying them at a very early age. I would buy translation dictionaries and other language texts and tapes, trying to learn as much as I could. I would seek out classmates who were different than I was and try to find out as much about them as possible. It wasn’t until many years later while living and working in Washington, D.C. that I began to educate myself in linguistic theory. There was a technical bookstore near my apartment, so one day I walked in and asked the clerk if there was a section on languages. I can still recall the first book that I picked up; it was published in a place that sounded rather exotic to me at the time—Tucson, Arizona—having been born and raised entirely on the East Coast. Little did I know then that I would end up completing my doctorate work, as well as the principal data collection for this text, there at the University of Arizona.

After picking up my first linguistics book and reading it cover to cover, I was hooked. I started collecting more until I finally decided that my education could probably benefit from some structure; it was at that juncture that I began graduate work at Georgetown University where I received an excellent start. Though I didn’t finish my degree there (the expense of a university degree isn’t always within one’s means), I received an excellent theoretical and sociolinguistic base that has served me over the years. I spent the next couple of years looking for a direction until I started volunteer teaching in an ESL program in Atlanta—something I never thought I wanted to do. This experience led me to finding a job at a community college in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and, ultimately, back to graduate school at West Virginia University to complete my masters, followed by the decision to pursue a doctorate at the University of Arizona. Once I began teaching ESL, I made a conscious choice never to take a job doing anything else but teaching. My classroom experiences have since covered working with individuals from the world over in a variety of different contexts and programs.

More than anything else in my life, teaching has given me a challenge. I no longer feel that I have all the answers as I did at jobs I worked earlier in my life; I continue to learn and grow every day and rely on my teachers, colleagues, and students—sometimes having all three sources embodied in the same people—to keep me on track and give me the desire to continue. My greatest hope is that I can touch their lives, share some experiences, and remain worthy of their trust to provide a supportive environment where they can learn and grow.

# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

As I complete this manuscript, I want to acknowledge the immense debt of gratitude that I owe to Teresa McCarty for her encouragement; she is truly a mentor in every sense of the word. Without her, I might have never had the courage to undertake this project. I am also deeply grateful to Sonia Nieto and Naomi Silverman for their continued support throughout this endeavor. Sonia’s insightful feedback along with Naomi’s advice and input have smoothed over the many rough edges and given me a renewed feeling of confidence. In addition, I wish to extend thanks to Lorrie Stoops Verplaetse of Southern Connecticut State University and Mary E. Wildner-Bassett of the University of Arizona who provided helpful suggestions for improving the text. As with all academic undertakings, though, there will undoubtedly be a certain number of mistakes—I take full responsibility for these.

I further want to recognize the contributions of many individuals, especially Csilla Balogh, Dean Jensen, Kevin Keating, Laurel Pollard, and the nearly 100 English language learners who shared their voices to make this book possible. Wherever they all are now, this book is dedicated to them. Together with my current students, they continue to be my teachers as much as the other teachers and professors I have had in my life—both in and out of school.

# What Is the Nature of Process Over Product?

# Pre-Reading Questions

In a small group, discuss how you would define the following concepts:

 Truth  Knowledge  Education

As you write a definition for these concepts with your partner(s), consider how you might conceive of each of these in terms of a process and/or a product. Do any of your definitions lend themselves more toward one or the other? As you read the first chapter, think about why that might be so.

Tstand everything the first time it is presented, or do you sometimes needto ask questions or have concepts explained in a different way? Arethere times when the day, the weather, your mood, or other people in classmates? Do you expect that everyone in your class understands things equally well and at the same time as you, or do you think that some people grasp certain ideas faster and others more slowly?

While the answers to these questions may seem somewhat obvious to you, they underlie the nature of learning as a process. Though there is and has always been a focus on measurable outcomes in education (i.e., products), the day-to-day business of learning is all about process. Part of this process resides within the students and their willingness to engage in learning, but the other part resides in you. Together with all your educational background and the developing understanding of the differences that result from students’ learning styles, learning strategies, and varying interests, talents, and skills, it is necessary that you recognize the diversity inherent in the multicultural ESL classroom on a more intuitive level. Students from different backgrounds with different experiences and a variety of languages, ethnicities, and cultures come together to form a context that is not merely dynamic, but also diverse. Understanding and expecting that learning within this context is dynamic, your teaching needs to be equally dynamic and adaptable to be truly effective.

In this book, I present a multicultural ESL classroom as the context, or classroom environment, and advocate a participatory approach—an approach based on critical pedagogy. Yet the task of distinguishing between multiculturalism, multicultural education, and critical pedagogy remains to be tackled, for while there are similarities, differences do exist. In this chapter, I attempt to differentiate the various strands and demonstrate how they complement one another. You will read about the naturalistic paradigm, a theoretical framework for looking at and understanding the dynamic nature of the ESL classroom. You will also explore the various meanings of multicultural, a concept—though often overused and misunderstood—that further contributes to the vitality experienced in the U.S. context of an education for democracy.

# EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRACY

Since the beginnings of democracy, there have always been concerns that educational systems should exist that respond to its needs. These concerns have sometimes surfaced very visibly in the work of particular individuals. In this book, I forward the perspectives of two pioneer educators, John Dewey and Paulo Freire (especially the latter), as being particularly relevant in addressing the learning needs of ESL students. Dewey’s focus on the importance of recognizing and incorporating student experience in the classroom and Freire’s critical pedagogy unite in their process orientation and provide a backdrop for the contemporary approach to language teaching, the Communicative Approach. Each of the concepts—the naturalistic paradigm, the multicultural classroom, Dewey’s education and experience and Freire’s critical pedagogy, and the Communicative Approach to Language Teaching—is defined and discussed briefly.

# THE NATURALISTIC PARADIGM

# Synchronic Versus Diachronic

Teaching, as a process, is modified and adapted to the changing situations within the classroom that occur on a daily basis, as well as the changes in the makeup of students in the classroom from one semester to the next. These two types of fluctuation, synchronic and diachronic, respectively relate to the contextual influences that make the classroom so dynamic. Synchronic fluctuation refers to the changes brought about by everyone’s daily lives and their influences on learning; this can include everything from a sunny day to a car accident someone has before class to a feeling of fatigue from not having enough sleep the night before. This type of fluctuation is so dynamic that it can change from minute to minute and from person to person, and an effective teacher needs to be ready to deal with them. Similarly, occurrences within the classroom—sometimes brought about by the teacher—can also contribute to synchronic fluctuation. These can include students’ reactions to a particular activity, presentation style, or comment from a classmate or the teacher. Diachronic fluctuation refers to the history that you and students bring to the classroom context; this can include past school experiences and cultural attitudes about education, for example. Within the classroom, all of these environmental factors can affect the learning process.

In their book, Naturalistic Inquiry, Lincoln and Guba (1985) outlined a framework for examining human environments, such as classrooms. In a naturalistic paradigm, it is accepted that “all entities are in a state of mutual simultaneous shaping so that it is impossible to distinguish causes from effects” (p. 38). This statement highlights a very important point in teaching: No direct causal effect can be assumed between teaching and learning. In other words, just because something is being taught, you cannot predict that it is being learned—or even understood on a superficial level. Similarly (and relative to the unique differences of individual students), it would be foolhardy for you to assume that all students are in the same place in terms of learning or learn at the same pace. Making these assumptions reduces classroom instruction to a one-size-fits-all model, an approach that overlooks the diversity among individuals and offers an image of teaching as automatic. A common mistake many young teachers make is to assume that if they simply follow the book and its directions in order, learning will happen. But as you may have already experienced for yourself, that’s not what happens. Thus, acceptance of a naturalistic paradigm means recognizing the dynamic nature of human interaction in synchronic and diachronic fluctuation, affecting and being affected by the immediate environment. In other words, one of the fundamental contentions of this book is that any attempt on your part to understand human behavior and thereby employ effective instruction cannot occur devoid of the context in which the phenomena occur; that is, the multicultural ESL classroom.

# Truth

Another fundamental assumption of the naturalistic paradigm is that truth is something derived through the interaction of humans with each other and their environment. Within the naturalistic paradigm, truth is seen as positional, relational, and derived within a context, recognizing the validity of multiple realities and, hence, multiple truths. In other words, you cannot assume that everyone is looking at the world from the same perspective as you, even in terms of language learning. Freire (1970) defined a subject as one who knows and acts in the world and cautions that you should be a responsible subject. The danger in embracing truth as absolute is the same as acting from a single subject position—it objectifies others and negates their unique perspectives. Everyone has a different subject position, or way of looking at the world and his or her place in it (cf. hooks, 1994).

The role of the progressive educator, which neither can nor ought to be omitted, in offering her or his “reading of the world,” is to bring out the fact that there are other “readings of the world,” different from the one being offered as the educator’s own, and at times antagonistic to it. (Freire, 1994, p. 112)

Often students’ subject positions and attitudes about language and language learning are very different from yours. Not to acknowledge or attend to these other realities maintains a power and status differential and perpetuates a one-sided, imposed control over what constitutes “acceptable” knowledge in the classroom. This, in turn, can alienate your students and stand in the way of their learning. By imposing your beliefs without reflection, you run the risk of not understanding your students and not being truly able to meet their needs. “Students have important messages for teachers about what works and what doesn’t” (Nieto, 2002, p. 138). Thus, effective ESL instruction subsumes a process approach where truth itself is not static, but dynamic and co-constructed by the participants—teacher and students—in the classroom environment. It also accepts that there is not just one subject position, but that each individual with her or his own experience brings a unique perspective to that environment (cf. Nieto, 2000).

# Scenario

Laurel and her class are having a group discussion. Some of the more outspoken students have been complaining about the amount of homework they have to do; they feel it prohibits their ability to interact with the English language in other ways. They say that they spend an inordinate amount of time completing assignments and studying for tests. They feel that this inhibits their ability to take advantage of the fact that they are learning English in a second language context—the United States; having more free time would enable them to actually go out into the community and interact in meaningful ways with the language and its speakers.

One of the students chimes in, “This is not a democracy.” Laurel responds to this by saying, “No, but it is a negotiacracy.” She states that not all good ideas come from teachers and asks them what they would rather do to engage their learning. Someone suggests that they have their weekends free from homework to which several others add good and reasonable possibilities for practicing English, such as taking time to learn about the city, going to movies, and reading for pleasure. Acknowledging their suggestions and reflecting on her desire to foster leisure reading among the students, Laurel agrees that she will not give any more homework over weekends.

In the foregoing scenario, Laurel allowed herself to become aware of the synchronic fluctuation in her own classroom. She recognized discontent among her students and engaged them in an honest discussion in order to name the problem. If Laurel had chosen to recognize only her own subject position—that of “teacher knows best what students need”—she would have missed an opportunity to understand her students and respond to a real need that they had: to take advantage of multiple opportunities beyond the classroom and bookwork for engaging in authentic and meaningful use of English. By reflecting on their different subject po sitions and asking for their input, she was able to meet a real need and create a partnership with her students. This is the essence of problem-posing.

# THE MULTICULTURAL CLASSROOM

Almost all contemporary nations are multicultural; that is, they contain two or more social groups which can be distinguished to varying degrees in terms of culture. (Liebkind, 1999, p. 143)

While this characterization presents a rather clear definition of the term multicultural as applied to the outward appearance of the classroom, especially when we are referring to a second language classroom in the United States, it is simultaneously insufficient. The multinational nature of a multicultural classroom has come to represent more than merely the physical reality of its demographic makeup. By recognizing the diversity replete in the contemporary ESL classroom, we, as teachers and participants in the educational process, must look for ways to address the needs of all our students. In so doing, “often, professors and students have to learn to accept different ways of knowing, new epistemologies, in the multicultural setting” (hooks, 1994, p. 41).

Even more than in a typical multicultural classroom of the United States, a multicultural ESL classroom provides a milieu where “students do not share the same ethnic, social, racial, and linguistic backgrounds as their teachers, [that] may lead to cultural incongruencies in the classroom which can mediate against educational effectiveness” (Gay, 1995, p. 159). It is not only representative of an obvious mixture of students from different races, countries, ethnicities, and political orientations, but it is also steeped in the ideology of multiculturalism coupled with the practice of multicultural education. hooks (1994) refers to bringing the ideology into the classroom as a challenge for you and your students.

Multiculturalism compels educators to recognize the narrow boundaries that have shaped the way knowledge is shared in the classroom. It forces us all to recognize our complicity in accepting and perpetuating biases of any kind. Students are eager to break through barriers to knowing. They are willing to surrender to the wonder of re-learning and learning ways of knowing that go against the grain. When we, as educators, allow our pedagogy to be radically changed by our recognition of a multicultural world, we can give students the education they desire and deserve. (p. 44)

Consequently, you must be acutely aware of the differences between your students, and between your students and you, in order to function effectively and orchestrate a supportive atmosphere where you and your students need to understand and accept each other’s differences in order to let learning happen. Developing your awareness will be the first step in meeting the first of two premises necessary for “any worthwhile educational philosophy” according to Nieto (2002): “To provide an equitable and high-quality education for all students” (p. 186).

Multiculturalism, as an ideology, secures its framework within the struggle for democracy and social justice. As an advocate for your students, you must understand that teaching is a political act in every aspect, from the point where you begin to reflect on the assumptions and attitudes that you carry with you into the classroom to the point where you need to argue for your students with other teachers across the curriculum who may be unaware of the needs of English language learners and view them from a “deficit” perspective. To that end, rather than starting from a standpoint where it is assumed that all people are equal, multiculturalism recognizes that social equity is not a reality, but a goal. Multicultural education, as the practical counterpart of multiculturalism, is a process of educational reform which attempts to achieve the social justice which is part and parcel of the ideology. The classroom, then, becomes the forum where inequity can be explored and understood in a critical analysis of present-day society. Within your analysis, the system of education itself cannot remain unexamined and unaddressed as you recognize the classroom is a microcosm of the larger society, and thereby a means of preparing students to enter the outside world (Shor, 1987a, 1992). Thus, a participatory approach to ESL must also serve to meet the second premise necessary for a worthwhile educational philosophy: “To provide an apprenticeship for active participation in democracy to prepare students for their roles as active and critical citizens” (Nieto, 2002, p. 186).

# Pedagogies of Possibility

Gay (1995) presented an argument in which she identifies many parallels between multicultural education and critical pedagogy, suggesting that the differences are more of degree than of kind. She defines both as “pedagogies of possibility,” or ways of teaching that empower students in their individual struggles to achieve equality and become full participants in a democratic system. She refers to critical pedagogues more as generalists; that is, seeking to reform education in general or on a more theoretical and philosophical level. Multiculturalists, on the other hand, are presented as specifists, reforming education at the level of curriculum and classroom—the practitioners. For our purposes, we are much more interested in praxis, or the place where theory and practice come together. Thus, while we can debate where the differences lay, our ultimate aim in the process of becoming more effective ESL teachers is to understand how these definitions work together.

We can begin this process by positioning today’s praxis within a brief historical (diachronic) perspective.

# EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, AND A CRITICAL PEDAGOGY

# Dewey

In the early part of the 20th century, John Dewey (1916/1944, 1938/1973) introduced the idea of progressive education. Among the most revolutionary of his ideas was the notion of valuing student experience. Dewey felt that if educators could begin with what students already knew, learning would be grounded in more tangible rather than abstract, theoretical concepts. This, in turn, would make the learning experience more meaningful for students. Prior to this time, public education had been geared toward preparing the general citizenry for entering the workforce, often into menial, labor-intensive jobs to serve the growing industry of the nation. Dewey essentially reconceived of the purpose of public education to that of preparing all citizens for participation in a democracy, thus empowering individuals to understand that they had choices. Though Dewey’s theories were intended for general education in a time when the demographic makeup of the student population was quite different from today, his ideas resonate even more now when we recognize the great disparities that exist in our society, especially with regard to a differential treatment of language minority students who, by the nature of being nonnative speakers of English, are often perceived in terms of deficiencies (e.g., “at risk,” “Limited English Proficient [LEP]”) (Nieto, 2000, 2002; Spener, 1988). Dewey’s fundamental notions about a more democratic educational system have been echoed in the work of many educators, including Paulo Freire. In fact, several similarities exist between Dewey and Freire, not least of which are their philosophical and political positions, as well as a fundamental notion that education should be transformative (Aronowitz, 1993).

# Freire

Freire began his work teaching literacy to workers in Brazil, his homeland. His (1970) approach to education, later named critical pedagogy, also proceeded from a fundamental perspective that learners don’t enter into learning situations with empty heads waiting to be filled, but start from a place of knowing based on their personal experiences. He referred to this traditional model of teaching as the “banking model” where teachers make deposits of knowledge into the minds of students. Believing the banking model to be fundamentally alienating—another reason why many learners shied away from formal education, he observed that learning can be more readily engaged by drawing on learners’ own experiences to make otherwise complicated ideas meaningful.

Simply stated, critical pedagogy is a movement in education toward education for social justice. At the micro, or classroom, level, we can refer to this generally as multicultural education or, more specifically, as a participatory approach in the multicultural ESL classroom. Our ultimate goal, then, is to engage students in a truly democratic process—a practice ground or “apprenticeship” for full participation in American society. This means creating a safe space where all opinions are welcome, all voices are heard, differences are respected, and ideas are generated; in other words, a place where learning can begin (cf. Kutz & Roskelly, 1991). These students in the process of becoming begin with a personal transformation—realizing that their voices are powerful.

[T]he point of departure must always be with men and women in the “here and now,” which constitutes the situation within which they are submerged, from which they emerge, and in which they intervene. Only by starting from this situation—which determines their perception of it—can they begin to move. (Freire, 1970, p. 66)

Nieto (personal communication, May 7, 2004) notes, however, that Freire’s vision was not that students should merely undergo a personal change, but a political change as well.

Self transformation cannot occur without social or structural transformation and . the latter cannot occur unless individuals are able to both understand and work against their personal implication in the process of social repression. (McLaren & Silva, 1993, p. 56)

Consequently, given the opportunity to develop in the supportive environment of effective language instruction, students’ self-transformation can then be applied to political change toward democratization and social justice in the world outside the classroom.

# Problem-Posing

“But,” you ask, “how do we convert all this philosophy into reality? How do we carry out the practice in the classroom?” Those are questions that this book attempts to help you answer. In a participatory approach, you start by integrating students’ lives and experiences at every level of the curriculum (cf. Auerbach, 1996). The first step is to engage in the core process of critical pedagogy: problem-posing. Problem-posing consists of three phases: naming, reflection, and action (Wink, 1997). Naming emerges through observation and recognition of a problem through discussions with students, thus identifying what needs to be addressed. Reflection requires the situating of the problem in space and time and in relation to the individual and the larger society. This will help you to understand your students and yourself better, as well as helping to devise the best strategies to engage learning. Action provides a means of redressing the problem. In theory and practice, the action element attempts to work for a transformation toward democracy, both in the classroom and the larger society. Make your students partners in the learning process, not merely recipients. Discuss your approaches with them; explain why you think certain techniques will help them and how different activities support one another.

In the scenario presented earlier, Laurel asks her students to name what the problem is: too much homework. As a result, the group works together to reflect and come up with an alternative plan that doesn’t undermine their learning process, but may actually enhance it. Laurel, despite her position of authority, also reflects on what students are saying. She responds by taking the immediate action of suspending weekend homework. In this way, she shows her students that their contributions are welcomed, important, and respected. Though this simplistic representation does not embody the fuller realization of transformation toward social justice in the external, it is an early step in engaging students in the process.

To recap, we can conceive of a participatory approach as the manifestation of multicultural education for the second language classroom; it is founded on the principles of critical pedagogy and, as a way to teach English language learners, fits well within the scope of a communicative approach to language teaching.

# THE COMMUNICATIVE APPROACH TO LANGUAGETEACHING

The communicative approach is an umbrella term and can take on a variety of forms (i.e., communicative approaches; see chapter 2 for more explanation). By definition, all the forms of the communicative approach possess common elements. These elements are (a) the goal of developing a communicative competence in students; (b) the practice of making language learned through instruction meaningful and useful by examining students’ language orientations; and (c) a focus on fostering a student-centered classroom. A participatory approach easily fits within the framework of a communicative approach by incorporating each of these elements. What makes a participatory approach unique, however, is the way in which it fulfills them. Through problem-posing, negotiated interaction in the development of a communicative competence goes beyond a mere give and take in basic communication, drawing upon students’ experience and voices to fulfill the meaningful and useful requirement of the second element (cf. Rivers, 1983). Negotiation also involves listening to students and working together with them to understand what they want to learn, where they are in their process, and how the syllabus must be changed to meet these needs. Furthermore, the student-centered focus explored through problem-posing requires teachers to identify the language orientations of the students. In this and the ensuing chapters, we begin by exploring the primary concepts, then adding on the layers that more precisely define a participatory approach.

# Communicative Competence

The first of these elements is the ultimate goal in the language classroom of helping students to develop a communicative competence. Dell Hymes (1971, 1972) originally coined this term to refer to the notion that native speakers of a language not only have an underlying knowledge of their language system, but they also have an understanding of how to use it in a variety of situations. As language teaching became more focused on ways to understand how theory could improve practice, the idea of a communicative competence was reconceived of as a goal for second language learners. In other words, knowing the rules of language (grammatical competence) was no longer sufficient. In order to engage in real communication, learners would also need to know about how the second language is used in appropriate contexts (sociocultural competence), what expectations native speakers possess with regard to different interactional situations and rhetorical patterns (discourse competence), and what to do in the event that communication breaks down (strategic competence).

To restate then, there are four competencies originally outlined by Canale and Swain (1980, 1988) that constitute a communicative competence in a second language learning setting. They relate to knowing a language in its various forms (the various linguistic levels, such as the sound system, grammatical rules, etc.), knowing how to use the language (relative to the person or persons being spoken to, and notions of politeness and appropriateness), knowing how to structure language into larger units of communication beyond a sentence (e.g., conversations, conversation types, and rhetorical patterns), and knowing how to compensate for communication breakdowns (e.g., asking for repetition or clarification, paraphrasing). Subsequently, a communicative competence goes beyond what one can merely understand to what one can do with a language in real communication.

# Language Orientations

The second element inherent in a communicative approach is the notion that students’ attitudes, or orientations, toward the language are more utilitarian than the average language teacher would like to believe. In other words, students are not necessarily interested in learning the language for its own sake, but rather in learning the language as a means to an end, for the alternate goals it can help them to achieve. This brings us back to the earlier example of Laurel’s class. The language being taught in the classroom and the assignments related to its learning should not merely reflect pedagogical aims, but should be meaningful and mirror authentic, “real-world” discourse, relative to students’ needs and ultimate goals. By problem-posing and essentially making the students partners in the classroom, Laurel was able to recognize that students were not unhappy about having to learn English, but were actually looking for meaningful opportunities to use it.

# A Student-Centered Classroom

Finally, a student-centered classroom is the primary focus in the realization of a communicative approach. In this manner, ESL praxis in general has traditionally implied all of the terms discussed in this chapter: a naturalistic paradigm, the multicultural classroom, education and experience, and a critical pedagogy philosophy. Essentially, adoption of a communicative approach and all that it entails has transformed the language classroom into a student-centered environment where acquisition occurs through negotiated interaction between teachers and students. Rather than an approach where the teacher defines what truth is in the form of rules or “acceptable” knowledge, students’ experience is valued and the learning process is seen as dynamic and creative. Consequently, learning goes from whole to part (Freeman & Freeman, 1998) where students’ real communicative needs are met by first presenting larger issues that emerge from selected themes, classroom discussion, and immediate problems that arise. These issues are then broken down and analyzed in partnership with students.

It is important to note that some students may possess a particular attitude toward the learning situation which translates to their preference for a more teacherdirected approach (Nieto, personal communication, May 7, 2004). Students’ preference for the “teacher-as-authority-figure” relates directly to the internalized expectations that years of traditional pedagogy have succeeded in achieving, making students find comfort in a model they are familiar with—passivity. “In traditional classrooms, students develop authority-dependence; they rehearse their future as citizens and workers by learning that education means listening to teachers tell them what to do and what things mean” (Shor, 1993, p. 29). It is your job to help them become partners in the classroom. You should not scold students for their apparent inability to engage a participatory approach immediately, then; remember that they are only responding to years of exposure to a particular way of doing things. If you are to foster an educational process that truly leads to the eventual transformation of society toward social justice for all, you must begin in the classroom by raising students’ awareness, initiating their move away from merely receiving education to actually engaging in the process.

# PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER

You should, by now, be able to identify some general parallels between a communicative approach to language teaching and a participatory approach. Likewise, other beliefs in contemporary second language pedagogy are easily positioned within the problem-posing framework. For instance, there has been a general advocacy for language instruction that focuses on content rather than forms or skills. Identifying issues of particular concern to students (i.e., a form of naming) helps to identify students’ needs and engage the process of learning. It also positions language to be learned within a meaningful context, thereby contextualizing instruction and enabling learning to go from whole to part (Freeman & Freeman, 1998). In other words, language is taught implicitly with a general focus on content; the explicit instruction of language forms occurs only if and when necessary. As a result, a focus on form (cf. Doughty & Williams, 1998) emerges out of the need to overcome an obstacle to learning, such as an inability to perceive the appropriate forms used in a given context.

The concepts of naming and reflection occur through negotiated interaction between instructors and students. Within the classroom, they can take on the form of negotiating the syllabus, identifying topics to be covered, and engaging in discussion. They also combine to bring greater understanding among students of diverse backgrounds within the multicultural classroom and add to the ultimate acceptance of differences and co-construction of knowledge. Ultimately, these early forms of co-construction will serve as practice for initiating change outside the classroom through participation in negotiation. These practices are advocated in the writings of practitioners and theoreticians alike (cf. Kumaravadivelu, 2003; Nieto, 2002; Richards & Lockhart, 1994; Richards & Nunan, 1990) and merge in a participatory approach by incorporating student experience. You, as the classroom teacher, will need to recognize that in the multicultural context, learners with different ways of knowing will have different ways of re-presenting comprehension. Moreover, you will need to respect these differences and learn how to acknowledge the contributions they make to the benefit of the class.

Within the immediate classroom environment, the action component can be realized initially in the selection of topics by students, the negotiation of the syllabus as an outcome of student needs and desires, and the altering of teaching practices to reflect student learning styles, ways of knowing, and experience. Moreover, the communicative competence fostered in the ESL classroom also establishes a matrix for lifelong learning that functions as a transformative action element. In this way, learners will continue to actively engage in the analysis of language forms and use in order to engage in more effective communication. Furthermore, in a supportive environment where effective communication and negotiation can be developed and practiced, the engagement of problem-posing using a participatory approach enables students to extend the democratic process beyond the microcontext of the classroom into the macrocontext of the external world, working toward social jus tice for themselves and others by utilizing those communication and negotiation skills. In the following chapters, you will learn about a participatory approach, its practices and procedures, and its applicability to your classroom.

# Post-Reading Questions

Think about how truth, knowledge, and education are defined in this chapter. Refer to your definitions from the beginning of the chapter. Does the perspective presented here agree with yours? Why or why not?

Define the following, based on your understanding of the chapter:

 Naturalistic Paradigm   
 Multicultural Classroom   
 Critical Pedagogy   
 Communicative Approach to Language Teaching

How is each of these a process? Again for each, what, if anything, might be considered a product?

# Reflective Journal

Reflect on your own learning experiences, in and out of school. Try to think of any teachers you have had that you felt were particularly effective? What made them so?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Brainstorm a list of qualities, behaviors, etc., that you consider to be necessary for an effective teacher. Next, brainstorm a list of methods, tasks, activities, etc., that you consider necessary for effective instruction. Compare and discuss your lists with those of other classmates; try to identify what your opinions are based on. On poster paper, compile two large lists from the ideas suggested. As you continue to read through the book, have the posters visible or available, depending on the classroom setup. Decide whether there are any changes that you, as a group, need to make. Also consider what the relationship is between effective teachers and effective instruction.

# 2

# Is a New Definition of Effective Instruction Necessary?

# Pre-Reading Questions

Write a general definition for (the act of ) teaching. Compare this definition with at least two other classmates. To what extent do your definitions agree? To what extent do they differ? How would you characterize your definitions (i.e., do they relate more to specific behaviors, qualities, roles, or something else)?

Next, write definitions for approach and method. Do you conceive of these two terms differently? Where do you see the differences between these two terms? Compare these definitions with your partners and discuss them.

Would you say that learning a language is roughly equivalent to learning anything else? Why or why not? Then, would you say that teaching a language should be conducted in the same way as teaching anything else?

Eto classify effectiveness in teaching have taken various directions fromdefining it as a role or roles that teachers need to fulfill, to identifying ef-fectiveness in terms of specific teacher behaviors. In a participatory aphow you might make this concept more concrete and less elusive. The first of these points is that roles are not invariable; they are determined interrelationally between you as a teacher and your students. Bearing in mind that learning (and teaching, for that matter) is a process and that the classroom context is dynamic also denotes that your roles are not static, but will change as the situation, activity, or needs of your students warrant. Your own familiarity with classrooms has no doubt already informed you that teachers are not always lecturers or facilitators or counselors or disciplinarians; they assume all of these roles and more as determined by the fluctuations that occur within the class.

The second major point is that teaching and its concurrent effectiveness must be situated within and reviewed according to a compatible theoretical paradigm. An activity may seem good in and of itself, but can quickly deteriorate when viewed by students as disjointed or disconnected from the rest of the work they do in class. While variety is an essential quality in effective language teaching, unbridled eclecticism will not ultimately serve you or your students in the path toward achieving your goals (Freeman & Freeman, 2001). Consequently, a teacher using a participatory approach (or any approach to language teaching that is to be regarded as effective) must minimally have a theory of what language is, a theory of how it is learned, and an understanding of which activities, tasks, and corresponding teaching best support its learning (cf. Larsen-Freeman, 2000; Richards & Rodgers, 1986, 2001). Additionally, the philosophical underpinnings about what constitute truth, knowledge, and education must be compatible. In your aspirations to become an effective teacher, you should not only be able to understand all of these things, but also be able to explain them to your students so that they can become full partners in their learning process.

The third and final consideration or point in overcoming this notion of effectiveness as elusive is the recognition that you as a teacher will exhibit observable behaviors that affect and are affected by the classroom context, including your students. There is virtually nothing you can do in the classroom that your students do not scrutinize; indeed, there may be days when your students will be better able to describe your actions than the lesson being taught. Their unique perceptions also go beyond your mere physical actions. For example, Freire (1970, 1998) discussed the need of teachers to be students, to allow themselves to be open to what their students can teach them rather than acting as “bureaucrats of the mind” (i.e., the sole proprietors of knowledge). Students can perceive teachers’ inability to engage in genuine discovery with them. In effect, then, this idea relates back to the recognition that individuals possess unique and varied experiences that they carry with them into the learning context (part of the diachronic fluctuation discussed in chapter 1), and students will use those earlier experiences to interpret and form opinions about what they are currently experiencing in your classroom.

# EXAMINING MODELS FOR LANGUAGE TEACHING

# Problematizing Approach and Method

I have often been asked by my students to explain the difference between approach and method. I typically begin by deferring to previous definitions. The distinction is hierarchical, starting with the approach, which encompasses the broader perspective or theoretical perspective; the method forms the plan of teaching and entails specific techniques that are employed in the classroom (Anthony, 1963). While accepting the hierarchical structure, Richards and Rodgers (1986, 2001) focus on method, designating the division of approach, design, and procedure (i.e., techniques) as a helpful way to examine methods for completeness. They define approach as the theory of language and the theory of learning that underpin a method. The design, then, consists of structural elements, such as the type of syllabus and the roles assumed by the teacher and students. Finally, procedures are the specific actions carried out in the context of the classroom; these translate into the observable behaviors that are examined to determine effectiveness. To simplify further, you might think of the differences as being embodied in the questions what, how, and why. Procedures or techniques are what we do, design is how we structure it, and approach is why—that is, the set of beliefs we have about language and learning that inform everything else.

A helpful way to conceptualize the development of approaches and methods over the last century can be found in Freeman and Freeman (1998). They present five different orientations toward language teaching.1 The first was a grammarbased orientation which focused on the study of language as “a good mental discipline” (p. 7), not intended for communication, but to expand the mind. Having long been “the” way to look at language teaching (Kelly, 1969), it was challenged in the early part of the 20th century as ideas about language learning and the purpose of language (i.e., language orientations) began to have an impact on the language classroom. Consequently, the next wave was the communicative orientation; not to be confused with the communicative approach to language teaching, this orientation presented a major shift in thought where the purpose of learning a language was to be able to communicate. Exclusive target language use was considered essential in the classroom and oral language was considered primary.

The next orientation was the empiricist orientation (Freeman & Freeman, 1998). Maintaining a similar view of the purpose of language learning, it emerged during and after World War II as a more scientific approach was sought to guarantee success in language learning. This orientation embodied theoretical foundations of behaviorist psychology and structural linguistics, providing the first truly “complete” method of language teaching, Audiolingualism, in the sense that it was constructed on a theory of language and a theory of learning (language). Unfortunately, despite its auspicious beginnings, it proved generally unsuccessful as many learners could not move beyond memorized drills and dialogues into true communication. It was also brought into question with the suggestion that language acquisition was a more creative process, not merely a replication of learned behavior (Chomsky, 1957, 1959).

With a new way of looking at language acquisition coming from theoretical linguistics, a new orientation about language teaching emerged. The rationalist orientation (Freeman & Freeman, 1998) embraced Chomsky’s ideas that languages were rule-governed with those rules having a psychological reality in the mind of the learner. Furthermore, it was generally accepted that human language learning was innate, suggesting that if the right methods were employed, language learning would ensue. In an attempt to find a method to replace the Audiolingual Method, the 1960s and 1970s saw a time of great innovation. While some were more or less complete (cf. Richards & Rodgers, 1986, 2001)—and indeed some are still being used today—a more interdisciplinary way of looking at language teaching was forthcoming.

The final orientation presented by Freeman and Freeman (1998) was called the psychosociolinguistic orientation. This label reflected a general attempt to pull together the most complete understanding of theories underlying language and learning that could be honed from different disciplines. The assumptions about teaching and learning focused on student-centered classrooms, social interaction, meaning and purpose in the lessons being taught, and the integration of all language skills.

Table 2.1 provides an overview of the language teaching orientations along with their associated approaches (cf. Celce-Murcia, 2001) and methods (cf. Larsen-Freeman, 2000; Richards & Rodgers, 1986, 2001). It is worth noting here that Freeman and Freeman (1998) include “Problem Posing” as a “method” under this orientation, following the work of Wallerstein (1987). Elsewhere, LarsenFreeman (2000) describes a “participatory approach,” again following the work of Freire and culminating in the work of Auerbach (1992) as related to the learning of literacy. I find neither of these references (i.e., Freeman & Freeman, 1998; Larsen-Freeman, 2000) to be antithetical to the approach being presented here; however, they are rather brief and incomplete in their scope.

It is also worth noting that the “timeline” given here is not intended to suggest that the various orientations, approaches, and methods which dates have passed have been completely abandoned. Indeed, the Direct Method, the Audiolingual Method, and others are still practiced today in different contexts. As an advocate of finding out what works best for students, I can certainly understand why, for example, a student who is interested in language translation may find the Grammar-Translation Method appropriate for his or her needs. However, as an adherent of the psychosociolinguistic orientation by and large, I find that there are a variety of tasks, activities, and techniques that can be utilized from any number of methods, so long as they adhere to the ultimate aims of what your students hope to gain by learning the language. This is also a point of separation between a participatory approach and others, for while other approaches may absolutely insist upon or refuse to include certain practices, a participatory approach will keep its focus on how individual learner differences (see chapter 3 for more information) can best be met, identifying and examining a variety of past learning experiences that worked for students and finding ways to integrate or restructure those into what will best meet the aims of students in their language learning process. In a participatory approach, we look at praxis—the nexus, or juncture, of theory and practice—as the determiner of effectiveness and recognize that the what, how, and why inform each other.

I do not go into any more detail regarding various approaches and methods; indeed, that is done very well elsewhere in the texts already cited in this chapter and not the purpose of this book. Moreover, another perspective has arisen in recent years that brings into question the efficacy of the notion of “method.”

# Post-Method2

In a critique of the language teaching profession, Prabhu (1990) called for a “sense of plausibility,” explaining that it was insufficient to employ methods un questioningly without attempting to connect a notion of what constituted effective language teaching to successful language learning. Widdowson (1990), too, explained that a “principled pragmatism” was necessary where “the relationship between theory and practice, idea, and actualization, can only be realized within the domain of application, that is, through the immediate activity of teaching” (p. 30). These appeals for principled language teaching stood in contrast to the evident eclecticism that emerged from the multiple approaches and methods that were often interpreted and implemented in different ways by different instructors (Kumaravadivelu, 2003). Other criticisms that encompassed the arguments against methods (and approaches, to a certain extent) were that they tended to be too prescriptive (i.e., top-down); devoid of a consideration of the learning context; generally disconnected with other issues of curriculum (e.g., program planning); dated or poorly informed with regard to contemporary second language acquisition research; and suspiciously similar in actual classroom implementation (Richards & Rodgers, 2001).

In response to the dissatisfaction with method, Kumaravadivelu (1994) first outlined and later detailed (2001, 2003) what he refers to as a “postmethod pedagogy.” In his conceptualization with this form of pedagogy, he cites the need for teachers to reflect on “a wide range of historical, political, and sociocultural experiences that directly or indirectly influence L2 education” (2001, p. 538), what I refer to as the diachronic and synchronic fluctuation (see chapter 1). He then elaborated on what this pedagogy would look like in terms of practicality, possibility, and particularity. A pedagogy of practicality aims at informed praxis, bringing theory and practice together in a manner where they inform each other and are tested in the classroom context. A pedagogy of possibility is also embodied in a participatory approach, emerging out of the work of Freire where there is a “need to develop theories, forms of knowledge, and social practices that work with the experiences that people bring to the pedagogical setting” (Giroux, 1988, p. 134). A pedagogy of particularity is what I see as a basic premise underlying effectiveness where instruction is contextualized to the specifics of the local situation, moving away from the imposition of ethnocentric ideas about language teaching that may meet Western expectations, but be totally inappropriate for other contexts. As Kumaravadivelu (2001) stated, “to ignore local exigencies is to ignore lived experiences” (p. 539). In other words, to impose a method without considering the local context reifies the very hegemonic subject position that a participatory approach is working against. Elsewhere in this book, I present what I feel speak to these components; I refer to them respectively as the pedagogical, environmental, and societal functions, and they are examined separately in chapters 6, 7, and 8.3

# Problematizing Effectiveness

Although there have been many previous attempts to classify effectiveness in teaching, these earlier classifications of traditional pedagogy have not succeeded in addressing the uniqueness of different contexts and the individual differences of students. To avoid replicating what these earlier classifications have done, it is necessary to examine what makes them problematic within a participatory approach. To begin with, teachers have too often been presented as being twodimensional, functioning in one role in relation to administrators and one role in relation to students. While innovatively approaching the study of the role of the teacher as being interrelational (i.e., relative to the participants involved in an interaction), the impression has been given that these roles are static between participants over time (cf. Gage, 1972; Guba & Bidwell, 1957; Medley, 1977). Your roles as an effective language teacher, however, must be multiple and dynamic and responsive to the synchronic and diachronic fluctuation of individual students and classrooms.

# Csilla

I remember times when I set up a plan and it just did not work the way I thought it would work. And then I tried to think on my feet and come up with alternatives. This is one of the things I try to urge interns to practice. If you realize it’s a bad plan, or it’s a good plan, but for some unforeseen reasons it’s just not working with this group of students, then think on your feet. Think about the routines that you know work and see if you can change it right then. Let’s say that you planned an activity and it flops. I would probably cut the activity short and use one of these routines and say, “Okay, let’s do it this way.” One of the signs that it’s not working is confusion. You know, the students seemed to be confused and they are not doing the activity the way you wanted them to. You will need to change it and clarify instructions. Another thing is when they are not involved; they seem bored or they are just not doing it—I’m not just talking about one student or two, but the majority of the class seems bored or not doing it or slow at getting into it. That would be another sign. In a group work situation, if I see one student dominating the group or one student getting out of hand and the rest are sitting there, that would be another sign to modify something or change it.

Another problem with traditional pedagogy is that teaching has been forwarded as no more than a set of behaviors. This notion is troublesome on several levels. First, it presumes a theoretical stance contrary to the presentation in the last chapter of the naturalistic paradigm. It infers a reductionist stance; that is, a belief that human behavior (or behaviors) can be separated from belief systems and previous experience, quantified and thereby measured. By reducing effectiveness to a set of observable behaviors, it is assumed that with the correct combination and amount of behaviors, good teaching can be replicated. Although it is not the intention of this book to make effectiveness even more elusive by appearing to mystify it—indeed, a fixed set of behaviors would simplify the matter—neither can it suggest that ticking off items on a checklist is equivalent to good teaching. Even imagining that teaching could be reduced to a set of replicable behaviors, your own recognition that there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all method for teaching should, by now, make you concede that all effective teachers will have to possess a repertoire of skills available, but that true effectiveness lies in the ability to customize your pedagogy to the needs of your students.

Throughout chapter 1, I assert that teaching is a process, modified and adapted to the changing situations within the classroom that occur through synchronic and diachronic fluctuation. Keeping this in mind, it seems unthinkable that strict adherence to a skills-based approach would be used in teacher preparatory programs or professional development workshops. Yet Gebhard (1990) stated that “teacher educators have taken research findings on effective teaching and directly translated them into skills to be mastered by student teachers in their teacher education programs” (p. 119). In a participatory approach, however, you are encouraged to identify and develop your own strengths while simultaneously coming to know and understand different techniques, their underlying theories of language and learning, and the variation with which they can be applied to facilitate student learning. If you were merely intended to replicate prescribed behavior rather than customize it, innovation would never be possible.

Freire (1998) claimed that the profession of teaching must reject scientific reductionism. Thus, rather than molding practice out of theory, theory should emerge “soaked in well-carried-out practice” (p. 21). Again, this is not to say that practice cannot or should not be informed by theory, merely that theory should not be created in a vacuum, devoid of the environmental and contextual influences that inform it. Praxis, the nexus of theory and practice, works from a standpoint where each element informs the other. “Many educational plans have failed because their authors designed them according to their own personal views of reality, never once taking into account the men-in-a-situation to whom their program was ostensibly directed” (Freire, 1970, p. 75). Thus, if teaching is to be deemed effective, praxis must be recognized as a living and changing entity in accord with its human environment. Consequently, theory and practice cannot simply inform, but must also transform one another.

Also relevant to the current discussion of reductionism is an examination of the other side of the issue: the students. Acceptance of a reductionist model of education would further imply an ideal learner, a philosophical stance which conceives of truth and knowledge as static, rejecting individual learner differences and multiple intelligences. Educational researchers and practitioners alike, however, acknowledge that different students not only possess different affective, cognitive, and psychological capacities, but exhibit different preferences toward learning situations, strategies for learning, and orientations toward what is being learned. Thus, accepting that students have individual learner differences means there is no such thing as an ideal learner and that teachers need to be flexible and vary their instruction to accommodate any number of different learning styles and contextual influences that fluctuate organically in the social interaction between humans and their environment.

Finally, former classifications suggest that learning is purely behavioristic, a response to effective teaching that can be defined in a cause–effect relationship. As an approach to second language teaching, this theoretical concept failed on several counts. First and foremost, it was founded on the belief that second or subsequent languages are learned in the same way that first languages are learned. Even if this were the case (and there are still those researchers who believe that all language learning is equivalent), research in child language has proved that children do not merely repeat language that they hear; if that were true, they would never be able to create unique utterances. Second, language teaching methodology based on a notion of programmed response provides only marginal success— some students may excel while others will not. In fact, as was determined to be the case with audiolingualism, many of the language students who performed quite well in the classroom were unable to communicate effectively. Years later, although they may have been able to remember dialogues memorized in the course of their language learning, they were unable to carry on a spontaneous conversation with a native speaker. Again, making generalizations about isomorphic (i.e., one-to-one) relationships between teaching and learning entails many drawbacks in the emergence of an effective teacher. In a perfect world, we would like to assume that what is taught is what is learned, but clearly that is not the case. On developmental grounds alone, however, some students will be ready to integrate new lessons into their learning process while others will not. Some will need you to alter your approach in terms of modality (e.g., visual, auditory) or format (e.g., whole group, dyads) to make lessons more comprehensible, whereas others will simply require more time to process the new information and fit it into their developing language.

# A NEW DIRECTION

Building on the gaps of earlier, more limited models, Banks (1994) addressed the characteristics of effective teachers in a multicultural context. He lists knowledge and skills as primary requirements, along with cultural awareness and tolerance to address the multicultural nature of society and the classroom. Respectively, these latter two characteristics relate to the understanding of one’s own culture and to the understanding and/or tolerance of others’ cultures. In our process of defining a participatory approach, we can relate these multiple levels of understanding to the diversity discussed in chapter 1; that is, there is more than one subject position in any given classroom and the teacher’s is not the only one that counts. Still, while this multicultural awareness positions Banks’ model within the purview of our emerging model, it does not go far enough in addressing the many facets of diversity replete in a multicultural ESL classroom. In addition, the nature of language as being closely associated with culture, and of language learning as being a subject with its own unique requirements, needs to be attended to in any search for a definition of effective instruction.

Therefore, in answer to the question about whether a new definition of effective instruction is necessary, I submit three more fundamental issues which question the efficacy of classifications developed for traditional pedagogy. These are that effective language teaching is not equivalent with effective teaching in a general sense; effective language teaching should not be presented to student teachers prescriptively; and models for effective language teaching should be consonant with contemporary praxis.

# Effective Language Teaching Is Unique

Yoshi, 27, Japan: Unlike other subjects, such as history, science, and literature, English is the way to communicate with others. It is more practical than others. I think the “effective” mean to learn more practical use of language.

Saif, 19, United Arab Emirates: In other classes, some students need the teacher just to speak and give the information. That’s all; they can’t speak with the teacher like in the language class here. We must practice with the teacher; we must do something. That’s what is the difference between them.

Walid, 23, Saudi Arabia: To learn language is not like other subjects; when I study math, I can read, “one plus one equals two.” This language I think is different than other classes. Maybe somebody will teach language methods for this language different than other classes.

Although many attempts have been made to previous models for effective pedagogy to the specifics of the modern language classroom, most models are still little changed from those established for general education. As suggested earlier, neither effective language learning nor instruction exists in an isomorphic relationship with effective learning or instruction in general education. Nor does effective language instruction exist in a subset relationship to effective instruction in general; that is, just because one is able to teach math or social studies effectively, it does not entail that he or she will be able to teach language effectively. Although this may be argued about any subject—clearly, there are some teaching behaviors that can be found in common among all effective teachers whereas each subject has some special features—language stands out as unique from all the others. Why does this seem to be the case? From a theoretical perspective, current views about second language acquisition indicate that language is learned through a combination of implicit and explicit means, requiring—among other things— input, interaction, and feedback. Thus, to foster the fullest development of a communicative competence, the focus in the language classroom needs to be on meaning and use in context, as well as the forms of the language. On a more visceral level, there is something else about language that makes it unique. Most people accept that not everyone is good at chemistry or has a talent for art, but every human has the potential to communicate through language. It is inextricably linked to issues of culture and identity. In a classroom setting, language is both the means with which to communicate information about content and the content itself.

# Variation Exists in Effective Language Use and Effective Language Instruction

Rie, 19, Japan: The teacher uses slang, not just the textbook. We want to talk about other things and we want to add something.

Cailian, 23, Taiwan: The teacher gave us a paper and it is very interesting. We can talk about the article and this could happen in our daily life, so I think it’s more interesting than just using the book.

Jamal, 18, United Arab Emirates: When we speak, it is not only the formal language. When anybody speaks in the supermarket, we can’t understand what he says because we learn only formal English. Like in my country, nobody uses formal for everything.

These student comments highlight a very important “dual” aspect of effectiveness in language instruction. Pick up any introductory text on language and linguistics and skim the contents. Without question, you will see chapters that relate to the manifold and constantly changing nature of language. Sociolinguistics texts, in particular, pay special attention to variation resultant from contact, mobility, and time. In addition to the awareness that this variation exists in language—that a language does not have just one form—you must be prepared to vary activities, techniques, and methods of presentation in your instruction, making the language you teach as dynamic as your teaching itself. When I started teaching ESL years ago in Atlanta, I can recall being told to teach “y’all” rather than “you” for the plural form of the person pronoun; after all, we were teaching survival English and that’s the way people spoke. Yet despite the recognition of diversity in the world, its people and languages, most training and development programs often present models for effective instruction via prescription rather than description, inferring that there is only one “correct” language and only one “correct” way to teach it (Gebhard, Gaitan, & Oprandy, 1990). From the perception of a novice teacher, this practice disseminates the notion that effective instruction results from attempts to emulate others’ behaviors rather than being defined organically in the classroom through interaction and in relation to students. “Idiosyncratic aspects of [. . .] teaching are stymied as the relationship becomes a matter of the student teacher replicating the educator’s views and practices in the classroom” (Freeman, 1990, p. 107). Through such a top-down approach, you are not encouraged to be innovative and, most likely, are not being prepared to deal with the diversity replete in the organic, constantly changing environment inherent in the context of the classroom. Thus, upon entering your own classroom, you will be left to fend for yourself, ill-prepared to make adjustments in your praxis when you encounter synchronic and diachronic fluctuation (Kumaravadivelu, 2001; Zeichner, 1996). Inadvertently, “prescription keeps the responsibility for decision making with the teacher educator, thus lessening the likelihood that student teachers are being prepared to assume the responsibilities for what goes on in their classrooms” (Freeman, 1990, p. 16). Through top-down prescription, a checklist of “desirable” behaviors is imposed which is intended to apply in any given language teaching situation. This approach is fundamentally antithetical to praxis that focuses on students’ needs and expectations. Moreover, turning back now to our discussion of the duality in this aspect of effectiveness, the teacher who is ill-prepared to meet students’ language needs will do a disservice to his or her students and most likely teach one form of the language—the one in the book. Always remember that the book is a tool for you to make use of in your teaching; it is not what you are teaching. And as Jamal says, “Nobody uses formal for everything.”

# Contemporary Praxis Deserves a Contemporary Model

Lucia, 25, Mexico: First of all, the teacher has to learn about the different customs of the people in the world.

Rie, 19, Japan: Here, speaking is important. It is important to talk because we use new words so we can remember them and how to use them.

Hiro, 22, Japan: In class, the teacher gives us many activities, so we have to speak;   
we enter into speaking in class.

Osamu, 32, United Arab Emirates: This is the first time I saw a teacher do this way because in our country usually we just sit down and the teacher talks all the time. We do nothing. But here, the teacher wants us to share in the class, to speak together, discuss together, read together, sometimes to find the main idea together, so all the time we share with her the class. This is good.

Finally, previous models, while having some application to a broad, generic definition of teaching, must be refined as they are out of sync with contemporary educational philosophy and, more specifically for our purposes, current approaches to language teaching. They may represent a view of teacher effectiveness that embraces a positivist paradigm (i.e., a view that reduces human experience to numeric values that can be measured and calculated). A reductionist way of looking at theories of learning and language—not to mention human behavior and social interaction—fails to recognize the innumerable variables interacting in a variety of ways which underlie any investigation of the human social context in the language classroom.

# Post-Reading Questions

Go back to the responses you gave to the Pre-Reading Questions at the beginning of this chapter. Do you agree with the assessment that language learning and teaching is different from learning and teaching in other disciplines? Why or why not? If your opinion has changed, what, specifically, was it in the chapter that you learned that you didn’t know before?

# Reflective Journal

Take the definitions you wrote at the end of chapter 1 for effective teaching and effective instruction, and the definition you wrote at the beginning of this chapter on the act of teaching. Go back over the section on “Building on Previous Work” and ask yourself whether your definitions seem to be limited in any respects. How would you modify them so that they would be more compatible within a participatory approach?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Consider the three arguments advanced in this chapter:

 Effective language teaching is not equivalent with effective teaching in a general sense (i.e., language teaching and learning are unique);

 Effective language teaching should be presented to student teachers and, in turn, students descriptively, not prescriptively (i.e., variation exists in both effective language use and effective language instruction);  Models for effective language teaching should be consonant with contemporary praxis (i.e., contemporary praxis deserves a contemporary model).

To what extent do you agree or disagree with these premises? What additional information can you provide to support or refute these ideas?

Read a current article (within the last 5 years) on a language teaching approach or method. Does the information provided in the article support or refute the arguments for a new definition for effective language instruction? Is it compatible with a participatory approach?

# What Are the Factors That Can Affect Second Language Acquisition?

# Pre-Reading Questions

Researchers and practitioners alike have suggested numerous factors that affect second language acquisition. With your classmates, brainstorm a list of those you are already familiar with or that seem intuitive to you.

When your class feels confident that it has produced a relatively comprehensive list, work individually to rank those that you believe are most relevant to those that you believe are the least relevant. Then, compare your ranking with a couple of classmates sitting around you.

In small groups of three to four people, group and label the various factors into categories by shared traits. Share these categories with the other groups.

Texpect to have any apprehensions? Imagine that you don’t speak thelanguage of the teacher. Suppose you realize that your level of profi-ciency will prohibit your comprehension for the rest of the period and, might this affect you? What will you do if you can’t understand a single word the teacher is saying? How long can you tolerate not knowing what’s going on around you without having it affect your motivation, interest, and ability to stay focused?

This particular trait, tolerance of ambiguity, is just one of many affective factors that can help or hinder language learning. From a teacher’s perspective, this is just one of many factors you will need to contend with from among the many that can influence second language acquisition. It is also worth noting at this juncture that a difference has been made in the work of Krashen and Terrell (1983) between acquisition and learning. Although there may be some basis for preserving the distinction and you will most likely read more about this on your own (see also the suggested readings at the end of this chapter), the inability to test and verify the two as separate processes causes me to use the terms interchangeably in this chapter and throughout the book. In furthering my own argument, I would say that learning, or acquisition, is not a process limited to the clinical environment of the classroom or the natural environment of the external world.

The factors involved in second language acquisition can roughly be divided into five subcategories. These are affective, cognitive, developmental, environmental, and psychosocial.1 You will no doubt learn about these through the course of your study to become an effective ESL instructor, but I will herein give a brief summary of some of the various factors that you will need to be aware of to better understand and meet the needs of your students. With each of the factors described, there is an inherent understanding that they do not exist in isolation, but interact with each other and create a unique composite within each individual language learner that determines how successful he or she2 may be in ultimately developing a communicative competence in the second language.

# Affective Factors

Affective factors are those related to the internal world of the student and his reaction to those intangible elements outside of himself and over which he independently has very little control. These include anxiety, attitude, motivation, and tolerance of ambiguity.

Anxiety, as it relates to second language acquisition is not just one thing, but an overarching term that encompasses a series of emotional responses. The primary division that should be considered is that of “good” and “bad.” The good kind, or facilitating anxiety, is a type of response that enables the student to perform at his peak. By utilizing his nervous energy, the student is able to heighten his alertness and awareness in response to a stressful situation, such as a timed test. On the other hand, debilitating anxiety can undermine a student’s underlying competence and inhibit his performance by virtually immobilizing him in a stressful situation. It should also be noted here that anxiety in either form can pertain to various levels. These are global, or the student’s overall sense of self; state, or the student’s opinion toward his own possession of a talent or skill in a particular endeavor, such as language learning; or trait (also called situational), or the student’s opin ion toward his ability to perform certain types of tasks, such as reading aloud or answering multiple choice questions.

Attitude, as I’m using it here, refers specifically to the feelings the learner has toward language and culture—both his own and the target. To digress momentarily and for the sake of clarification, this is not the same as the notion of social distance forwarded by John Schumann (which I discuss in some more detail under Psychosocial Factors); instead, I’m speaking about those internalized feelings that may or may not be resultant from a societal and oftentimes ideological framework that exists toward a perceived hierarchy in multilingual societies. In essence then, attitude may be divided into positive or negative, and can subsist in any combination with respect to the target language and culture and the first language and culture. A possible negative example of the former would be when a student is forced by his parents or a program of study to enroll in a language course that he is not interested in, such as a business student in Colombia being made to study English as a requirement; a possible negative example of the latter would be when a student finds his own language archaic and useless in light of the perceived advantages of a language of wider communication, such as a Quechua student studying Spanish. While these examples need not be the case—the same student in either situation might evaluate the target and/or first language positively—it is the viewpoint the individual holds (i.e., his attitude) that we are concerned with here and that could be beneficial or detrimental in the acquisition process (cf. Gardner & Lambert, 1972).

Motivation has been discussed in many forms in the literature, the principal types being integrative and instrumental, intrinsic and extrinsic. For our purposes, all of these can be placed under the rubric of affective factors as they all feature prominently in the internal world of the student. The first two relate to the underlying reason for the student to engage in the study of a language. Integrative motivation belies an affinity the student feels with the target group and a deep-seated desire to assimilate their language and culture. Instrumental motivation suggests that the student identifies some ultimate benefit for himself by undertaking the study of the language. Both of these forms of motivation can be strong proponents in ultimate achievement. The latter, however, seems more intrinsically related to the second set of terms which, in a somewhat different take on the same factor, focus on the ultimate rewards the student imagines will obtain from successful acquisition. In some ways, this latter distinction may be more instructive for our purposes as it represents a dynamic portrait rather than a static one. Indeed, the initial impetus for starting a course of study is less likely to change the notion of what one wants to achieve and the perception of how well or fast one is progressing toward that end. Whether the motivator is intrinsic (e.g., feeling a sense of self-satisfaction) or extrinsic (e.g., getting an “A”), a student’s perception that things are going well or they are taking too long can affect performance and, in turn, acquisition.

Tolerance of ambiguity is the ability the student has to function within a reasonable degree of confusion. A student with a high tolerance, someone who may have studied other languages previously and does not have a high expectation or need to understand everything at the beginning, should be able to proceed despite a lack of proficiency in the language or clarity of instruction. On the other hand, a student with a low tolerance of ambiguity will require clarity on one or more levels. Thus, if he is incapable of understanding any of the target language, he will absolutely need clear instructions or, at the very least, a presentational style that addresses his learning style preferences. His frustration and ability to grasp anything in your class, in whole or in part, immediately or over time, will progress in direct proportion to his perceived needs. As stated earlier, the student will most likely not be able to overcome these factors independently. It is, therefore, part of your job as an effective instructor to help him to identify and overcome anything that could prove detrimental to the process of acquisition.

# Cognitive Factors

Cognitive factors are those related to the mind and abilities of the student. Though many of these abilities veer more toward “preferences” and are therefore not necessarily absolute, their degree of “fixity” appears strong enough to require lengthy training (or, in some cases, “untraining” preceding training) before any changes could ensue. For this reason, I shall present the following discussion more in terms of “among students” than within a single student. Again, through diagnostics, you will be able to help the student recognize her preferences and address your instruction in order to facilitate her acquisition. Cognitive factors include aptitude, field dependence/independence, learning styles, and multiple intelligences.

Aptitude has been a highly controversial construct with regard to second lan guage acquisition and teaching over the past 50 years. Seeming to provide great promise in terms of predictability where language learning is concerned, aptitude has been defined in terms of language subskills which can be delineated and measured. The Modern Languages Aptitude Test (MLAT) (Carroll & Sapon, 1959), the best known of the aptitude tests, measures phonemic coding ability (i.e., sound–symbol correspondence), inductive language learning ability (i.e., recognition of patterning), grammatical sensitivity, and rote learning (i.e., memorization). These subskills have since been redefined by Skehan (1998) into factors with concomitant processing stages, namely phonemic coding ability at the input stage, language analytic ability at the central processing stage, and memory at the output stage. Though seemingly beneficial in determining achievement for students who succeed with methods that focus on forms (Cook, 2001; Dörnyei & Skehan, 2003), much research still needs to be done. For instance, it is as yet unclear how the notion of language aptitude will fit into a more student-centered, individualistic approach to language teaching. There is unfortunately still the potential to idealize language learning into a one-size-fits-all model. Nevertheless, the discussion of aptitude holds potential for a better understanding of second language acquisition with quantitative studies indicating relatively high correlations between learners’ performance on the MLAT or other aptitude tests and their success in language learning.

Field dependence and field independence have been researched at length in connection with their ability to promote or detract from second language acquisition. Ultimately, findings from multiple studies (albeit often incomparable in terms of design) demonstrated that an inclination toward either could still result in acquisition, rendering the pursuit of one definitive trait leading to “better” acquisition unproductive. In terms of language learning, a field dependent learner will make use of contextual cues to understand while her field independent counterpart is able to analyze constituent parts of language and its systems independently of one another (i.e., without recourse to contextual cues). For our purposes—and since neither should be deemed preferential to the other—a more useful understanding may be found in the distinction between global and analytical in the discussion of learning styles below.3

Learning styles can be defined as the preferences learners possess for processing information. Thus, to elaborate on the distinction we began to make a moment ago, a global learning style would be embodied in an individual who prefers to receive information in a holistic manner so that she can, in turn, intuitively derive how all the components work together as a system. Conversely, an analytic learner prefers examining and understanding the individual constituents separately, increasingly enabling her to build a whole system from the ground up. While some researcher-practitioners stress one direction over the other (Freeman & Freeman [1998] claim that learning should go from whole to part), to be the most effective teacher, you will need to consider the individual needs of each of your students. Moreover, a particular style employed by a student may be relative to a specific type of task she is being asked to perform; therefore, considerations of learning styles should always be embedded in an understanding of practices rather than simply generalizing one easily identifiable learning style summarily to the student or, worse still, to her cultural group (Gutiérrez & Rogoff, 2003).

In addition to the distinction mentioned above, Oxford (2001) further divides learning styles into personality types and sensory preferences. Just as it is important not to essentialize an individual learner based on the observation of one approach to one task, Oxford also notes that learner differences “are not dichotomous (black or white, present or absent) but generally operate on a continuum or on multiple, intersecting continua” (p. 360). For example, “personality type”— based on the work of the psychologist Carl Jung—is never presented as a single style, but rather as a composite of four components defined by opposing ends of a continuum. The first of these is extroverted versus introverted. This component, according to Oxford’s description, appears to relate primarily in the language classroom to grouping patterns with extroverts preferring to work in groups and introverts preferring more individual or perhaps pair work. Although these individual preferences may interact favorably with certain individual affective factors, such as anxiety, mixing student groupings adds to the overall variety in the classroom and can prove ultimately beneficial by exposing the student to multiple contexts for interaction. The next personality type relates to the exchange of information; intuitive/random versus sensory/sequential ranges between a preference for a faster, random presentation of information, avoiding a more routine-oriented approach, and a preference for a slower, step-by-step, more organized presentation. Another example of this type of learning style—and perhaps the best example of why individual learning differences must be conceived of as on a continuum—is thinking versus feeling. It is improbable to imagine that an individual would only possess one of these two dimensions, but a student may exhibit more of a tendency toward being perceived as competent versus caring in the learning environment. The final personality type relates to a student’s orientation toward closure. While one student may prefer some lessons to have clear organization and a defined endpoint before proceeding to the next lesson, another may appear to thrive in a more freeform environment where lessons take on a life of their own. The closed versus open distinction also suggests a preference for a deductive versus inductive approach to learning. In the case of learning language structure, for example, a deductive approach begins with the introduction of patterns and rules which are then applied to novel situations; an inductive approach, on the other hand, begins with authentic data from which patterns and rules can be discerned and internalized. In all of these dichotomies, however, you should remember to interpret them as continua rather than polar opposites. In other words, students may exhibit greater or lesser degrees rather than an absolute propensity for one or the other.

There are also learning styles originating from a preference for one of the sensory modalities. Included in these are visual; auditory; kinesthetic; and tactile learning styles. Respectively, the student with each of these learning styles may process information through reading, listening to lectures, taking part in roleplays, or working with manipulatives. Again, these preferences may be task dependent; for instance, the same student who demonstrates a visual preference during a lecture, requiring you to add visual aids to your presentation, will demonstrate a kinesthetic style in small group work, calling for less adherence to a strict procedure for this type of interaction. Ideally, though, you will need to help your students to develop a flexible learning style, or the ability to process information through a variety of means in a variety of contexts.

Related to the above learning styles, H. Gardner (1983), another psychologist, advanced seven intelligences that relate to the way learners can respond to the mode of instruction. These are body/kinesthetic; interpersonal; intrapersonal; logical/mathematical; musical/rhythmic; verbal/linguistic; and visual/spatial. Although there seems to be some obvious overlap between these intelligences and the learning styles above, the difference in definition relates to the preference for engaging the process of learning (learning styles) versus the preference for instructional mode, or manner of communicating information by the instructor. You, as an effective teacher, will need to be aware of how these preferences can combine and interact, and find ways to convey information through multiple modalities in order to accommodate the greatest number of learning styles and intelligences represented in your classroom. For instance, when giving instructions, you might consider not just speaking aloud, but accompanying your talk with a written form and possibly modeling (or having students model) what it is you intend them to do. You will also want to vary whether students work independently or in some grouping, occasionally letting them choose for themselves.

# Developmental Factors

Developmental factors, whether fixed or variable, share one important feature: They are all progressive when compared over time. These include age, bilingualism, first language proficiency, and interlanguage.

Age has been an oft-researched factor in second language acquisition. Beginning with an understanding of how maturation affects first language acquisition, the notion of a Critical Period Hypothesis (CPH) was established (Lenneberg, 1967). In essence, the CPH suggests that language acquisition can be associated with milestones in human development and consequently the nativelike acquisition of various subsystems of language (e.g., phonology with lateralization of the brain, syntax with the onset of puberty) is inhibited if not virtually impossible after the stages of human development have been attained. When these notions seemed to be borne out in studies of feral children (i.e., those who were severely deprived of linguistic input), other studies were conducted to determine whether the CPH applies to second language learning. In essence, while there seems to be some basis for a weaker version, or sensitive period (Long, 1990; Oyama, 1976, 1978), there are still many learners who are able to become highly proficient in a second language at almost any age. Alternative hypotheses may also prove fruitful. For example, it may be possible that all learning is identical (i.e., that language learning is no different from other learning), that Universal Grammar—the inherent human ability to learn language—is available in varying forms and degrees after the initial language acquisition period (i.e., completely, through the first language, or derivatively), and that general processing skills—the cognitive skills that function in “other” learning—take over, help, or hinder language acquisition after the initial language acquisition period. To what extent any of these hypotheses are true, independently or in some combination, has yet to be proved, however. Still, there seems to be some evidence from various studies that indicates the important role of age in second language acquisition. Whether the CPH or its weaker version is ultimately proved, younger children tend to be better second language learners on the whole than adults in terms of more closely approximating native speaker norms, but adolescents progress faster than younger children in foreign language learning (Genesee, 1987; Marinova-Todd, Marshall, & Snow, 2000; cf. Hyltenstam & Abrahamsson, 2003, for a thorough review).

It is at this juncture that I would add a qualification with regard to age and second language acquisition, specifically that “second” or “subsequent” language acquisition must be defined separately from first or initial language acquisition (cf. Block, 2003). Despite the claims that very young children are still the best and most complete in their acquisition of a second language, I would argue that prior to the age of five or six children may not be learning a “second language,” but rather a “second first language.” In sum, these children are becoming bilinguals in the sense of possessing two first languages or, at the very least, balanced bilinguals where one language does not seem to be preferred over the other. Indeed, antiquated ideas that exposing children to more than one language will merely confuse them (Jespersen, 1922), research in cognitive science has indicated that, during this period of initial language, children are primed to acquire language as there appear to be few other cognitive skills in competition for their attention. Thus, very young children are easily capable of acquiring more than one language at a time and fully integrating them into their developing communicative systems (Genesee, 2001). On the other hand, over time, many individuals claim to have lost a language they knew as children due to lack of use resulting from any number of causes (e.g., negative attitudes toward bilinguals). If both languages are not supported at home or in school, there is a very good chance that one may be lost, typically the one that does not possess a level of prestige (Freeman & Freeman, 1998). Some aspects of language acquisition continue over the course of a person’s life (i.e., complete acquisition does not end when a child reaches 5 or 6) and must therefore be cultivated if both languages are to be maintained.

To continue in this vein, the next developmental factor to be addressed is first language academic proficiency and concomitant skills competence. Studies have shown that incomplete acquisition of the first language in early childhood may have a negative effect on the learner’s ability to acquire a second language (Collier, 1987; Skutnabb-Kangas & Toukomaa, 1976). For example, a learner who has learned to read well in her first language will be able to transfer the associated skills, but a learner with poor reading ability in her first language may experience difficulty learning to read in her second language, especially when attempting to acquire those and other academic competence skills later in life (Cummins, 1979; Saville-Troike, 1991). Nevertheless, it is important not to confuse the issue of transferring language proficiency from a first language to subsequent languages with differential language proficiencies in bilinguals. Shin (2003) stated that the misdiagnosis of semilingual, or a child not fully possessing any language (MartinJones & Romaine, 1986), often proceeds from the lack of recognition that bilinguals typically use their two languages for different purposes with different people. Therefore, in attempting to ascertain the origins of a student’s problems, it will be helpful to distinguish a true second language learner and then to diagnose her first language proficiency.

The final developmental factor to address was first identified by Selinker (1972). A learner’s interlanguage is that stage of development where she is at any given moment in her path from her first language to her attainment of the target language. Though early studies conducted in the acquisition of morphemes tried to identify language-specific patterns that were equivalent or similar to those obtained by native speakers acquiring their first language, closer scrutiny of those early findings indicated that the order of acquisition could not be attributed to either the first language of the learners or to the typical acquisition patterns of the target language, but instead was much more individualistic. Rather than diminishing Selinker’s concept of the interlanguage, however, the emergence of this reinterpretation suggested that the interlanguage is more in line with the factors affecting the individual than the language itself. Relevant terms to this discussion and that of the first language include transfer, interference, and overgeneralization. Transfer, which often serves as a superordinate term, can be narrowly conceived of as the features that positively match between the first and target languages and can facilitate the acquisition process (e.g., cognates, similar word order). Interference is generally thought of as negative transfer, or the mismatches that can hinder acquisition of the target language (e.g., “false friends”—words that sound like something in the target, but don’t have the same meaning). Overgeneralization relates to the application and misapplication of rules into the target language. In other words, while there may be some overlapping of rules between the first language and the target language, it does not exist in a completely balanced relationship, so learners may tend to use the form in circumstances where it is inappropriate or incorrect (e.g., L1 Spanish speakers who drop personal pronouns in English). While all of these terms are presented in terms of first language to target language, they can also operate from the interlanguage to the target language. This is best explained with regard to interference and overgeneralization in that there may be features that emerge at some stage in a learner’s developing interlanguage which do not exist in her first language or in the target language. In her process of acquisition, these features may appear for a time in her attempts to employ the target language (i.e., in her interlanguage) (cf. Tarone, 1988).

One final area of discussion that should be addressed is the notion of fossiliza tion. In brief, fossilization has been conceived of as an arrest in development. It has been suggested that individual learners have experienced fossilization because they were somehow incapable of progressing any further, or they simply learned a sufficient amount of the target language to meet their needs. More recent research in cognitive models of acquisition suggests that a paucity of input may be the cause of apparent fossilization (Wolfe Quintero, 1998). In fact, the issue of “halted acquisition” may be more a matter of insufficiency than inability. That is to say, it may be possible that the synapses of the brain must be reactivated a sufficient number of times (i.e., the brain requires some information to be repeated) before acquisition can actually take place. Though more research will need to be conducted before this hypothesis is proved, it provides one plausible alternative to the question about why some learners seem to experience fossilization while others do not. Regardless of what is ultimately determined to be the root of this problem, effective language instruction will require that you are diligent in your ability to intervene to promote students’ progress, whenever and wherever possible.

# Environmental Factors

There is a certain degree of what R. Gardner (1990) labels “pedagogical variables” which evolve from the nature of the classroom environment where teacher and students interact as individuals. Although I believe these can also influence acquisition to the extent that they interact with affective and cognitive factors, I refrain from addressing them until chapter 5 where we explore the factors that students identify for themselves as relevant to the classroom context regarding the human element: teachers and their expertise in providing effective language instruction. Instead, the environmental factors referred to here include those which vary in terms of the channel, or pathway, of acquisition. Within the channel, learners receive input, or messages about the language itself, which they may or may not attend to, depending on a variety of reasons. With regard to this input, acquisition may occur to a greater or lesser degree depending on whether a sufficient amount of information is being provided, the input is suitably clear, and/or the forms of communicating information are varied enough to accommodate students’ learning styles and preferences. For our purposes, then, the discussion of environmental factors will focus on degree of input, saliency of input, and instructional mode.

If we consider the total number of hours learners are exposed to a target language during class in light of a hypothesis about the degree of input (i.e., more is better), we begin to understand why learners in second language environments seem to surpass learners in foreign language environments, and learners who make more opportunities for themselves to interact with the language and native speakers seem to surpass learners who don’t. Though these musings are purely anecdotal, time on task is essential to learner development. In a foreign language class that may only meet four times a week for an hour each time and have a large number of students, each student’s chances to use the language and interact in meaningful ways are greatly inhibited. Conversely, in a second language environment, students have the possibility of interacting with the language beyond the classroom (provided they take advantage of it), regardless of whether they are enrolled in an intensive program that requires 16 to 20 hours of study per week. Laurel’s students from the scenario in chapter 1 clearly recognized this and negotiated a reduction in homework to make optimal use of the English-speaking environment.

Another factor relevant to the language classroom environment is the saliency, or clarity, of input. A language-rich environment alone is insufficient to guarantee the conversion of input to intake (i.e., the information incorporated in the developing interlanguage of the learner). Consequently, to be truly effective you will need to consider quality (saliency of input) in addition to quantity (degree of input) (Gass, 1997). The role of teacher as facilitator is especially crucial here where a mere bombardment of information may lead to more confusion than intake. Using your developing teacher awareness to recognize when students are confused and engaging in problem-posing to draw out specific areas where help is needed will assist you in understanding how to clarify the direction future instruction will take. Within this discussion, the matter of timing also becomes germane, for the issue of when to introduce (or reintroduce) information to students is directly related to where they are in their interlanguage development. Earlier work on consciousness raising (Rutherford & Sharwood Smith, 1988) and Focus on Form (Doughty & Williams, 1998) indicates that you can take the lead and make certain features of language salient for your students without necessarily waiting for them to indicate to you that they need assistance; to that end, the engagement of problem-posing could prove beneficial on two grounds. First, it provides a forum for the raising of consciousness and the attention given to explicit information that students are not otherwise incorporating. Second, it serves as a means for making your own “input” salient; that is, what you may believe students to be lacking may, in fact, be a fallacy and problem-posing will enhance your awareness of the direction instruction needs to take (cf. Van Patten & Cadierno, 1993).

The final factor in this section is instructional mode. While this notion may seem best aligned with the vast amount of work that has been done on “method” in second language teaching situating instructional mode more squarely within pedagogical factors, what I refer to here is the classroom context and the way it varies depending on the makeup of the teacher and students and the degree to which language itself becomes the focus of learning (Snow, 1991). Thus, assuming a continuum between attention to teaching language (explicit) and attention to teaching content through language (implicit), we can perceive a negative correlation between the two extremes where the increase on attention paid to one implies the decrease of attention paid to the other (see Fig. 3.1). Beginning with foreign language teaching which traditionally focused on the teaching of language exclusively—evidenced by the Grammar-Translation Method and still obvious in some contemporary structure-driven syllabi—we trace the gradual decrease of the focus on language itself as the focus on content4 (and the presumed concomitant incidental acquisition of language) increases.

![](img/67b07fe0fb13f5d3f2bb4bf444dbed7eba846b17166bfd83d7c49a2c2368f227.jpg)  
FIG. 3.1. Instructional modes of language teaching.

From this positioning of traditional foreign language instruction, we advance to a form of content-based instruction (CBI) known as theme-based. In this instructional mode, language instruction and the integration of skills are arranged around a series of themes, such as holidays or domesticated animals. While themes can incorporate a good deal of content, the focus in this form of CBI remains on the language with the themes acting incidentally to promote that learning. Another form of CBI is the adjunct model (sometimes called the linked model). In this form, an ESL class taught by an ESL teacher is linked to a content area class taught by the content area teacher. While the ultimate aim would be full integration of the material in the two classes, it is typically the ESL teacher who must accommodate more to the subject area by modifying the class to support the language needs of the ESL students and clarify the material being presented in the content class. This lopsided accommodation is even more pronounced when the content area class contains both native English speakers and second language learners. The next form of CBI consists of a content area class that contains only second language learners. In this sheltered model, the teacher is usually certified in both the content area and ESL so that he can both teach the subject matter and provide any language assistance necessary.

Beyond these forms of CBI are immersion and bilingual instruction (Genesee, 1987; Swain, 1987; Swain & Johnson, 1997). In both these modes of instruction, the focus is entirely on the subject matter. The differences from CBI, then, exist in the makeup of the class (i.e., both native English speakers and second language learners) and the focus on the content. The distinction between the two rests in the use of one language (the target language in immersion) versus two languages. In the case of the former, the “sink or swim” ideology that has typified many mainstream classes in the United States has been referred to as submersion where no modifications are made in terms of task or activity types to accommodate students’ language needs. If they succeed in learning English and the subject matter, it is often at the detriment of their first language, resulting in subtractive bilingualism (Lambert, 1975). On the other hand, if students do not succeed in learning English and/or the subject matter, the stigmatization may lead to a situation where they have no complete language, not having acquired English to any appreciable extent and having internalized negative attitudes toward their mother tongue potentially resulting in some degree of loss. In the case of bilingual instruction, there are any number of models with the ideal being dual-language instruction (Lessow-Hurley, 1996) where students emerge from a program speaking two languages (additive bilingualism) and the least preferential being where the teacher alone speaks two languages in order to communicate content to the students who speak two different languages within the same class.

# Psychosocial Factors

As intimated in the earlier section on instructional modes, environmental factors can greatly affect the extent to which students learn, based on the psychological and social effects that result. The discussion of psychosocial factors finds its culmination in the theories of Schumann (1976, 1978). Although much broader a discussion than shall be dealt with here, the core issue is that of distance, presuming that the greater the distance, the less acquisition will take place. Psychosocial factors include language dominance/subordination, gender role relations, learning strate gies (including grouping preferences), and perceived proximity between languages.

Language dominance and subordination exist in direct opposition, relating to the feelings the speaker has about her language and the target language relative to the language-learning environment. Referring to the perceived status of the target language, language dominance occurs when the target language (and by association its speakers) enjoy relatively high status compared with the learner’s first language. In such cases, although learning the second language (i.e., the target language) would be deemed preferable by the wider society, the feelings of the learner toward the target language would affect her ability to acquire it. Desire to assimilate would enhance acquisition while strong feelings of denigration could inhibit the process. Subordination, on the other hand, occurs when the learner views her language as superior to the language of wider communication. Under these circumstances, the degree to which the learner actually acquires the language may vary depending on the size of a cohesive group of speakers of her first language. Where a large number of speakers who share her first language exist, the degree of acquisition could be greatly hindered. Conversely, if she finds herself relatively isolated, she may be able to overcome her distancing of the target language group out of sheer necessity, although an apparent level of fossilization may be indicated when her immediate psychological and social needs are met. Both situations seem to tend toward a negative prognosis while nondominance in either direction would be deemed preferable (Schumann, 1978).

Gender role relations emerge in the degree to which the second language learning is engaged matches the learner’s expectations about how males and females interact, relative to her first language and culture. Studies carried out with young learners of Maori and Hawaiian5 (Stiles, 1997) showed that interactive play among boys and girls in language learning situations resulted in effective acquisition as it emulated the way children are reared in the respective societies. When replicated on the Navajo reservation, however, further investigation revealed that this approach to learning was less effective as Navajo children are not enculturated to engage in mixed playgroups (Jordan, 1995). With adult learners, students who come from societies where men and women are generally separated from each other in various domains of society, such as education, could potentially suffer from forced mixed interactions, at least initially. Indeed, even in the United States, studies have been forwarded that suggest men and women approach the task of learning in different ways and could experience differential learning based on their preferences for a more collaborative rather than competitive environment (Maher & Thompson Tetreault, 1994; Sadker & Sadker, 1995). In the case of the multicultural ESL classroom where students come from different countries, it is especially important to be aware that differential learning patterns may originate from sociopolitical contexts as well as socialization and you need to be sensitive to these (Nieto, personal communication).

Learning strategies refer to the way different learners approach the task of learning. Discussed earlier as one part of a communicative competence (i.e., strategic competence), learning strategies can include any number of techniques students employ to learn. While these in and of themselves do not necessarily pose a problem and can be addressed and expanded in the course of the class, initial resistance can occur, especially when students with different strategies are asked to work together as often happens in the context of the ESL class. At the outset, you may try to group students with similar strategies and ease them into different combinations as they are introduced to alternative strategies—this is assuming, of course, that you have conducted some form of analysis at the beginning of the term. Otherwise, you will need to conduct problem-posing around this issue and engage in some explanation on your own to enable students to see each other as potential resources for one another. To that end, grouping preferences themselves are an important item to address as a student resists the notion that she can learn from her classmates, especially when she believes that other individuals at “the same” level of development cannot possibly enhance her acquisitional process. It is here that you must intercede to help her recognize that it is the differences among students that make them all resources for one another. Indeed, while the relative level may be deemed as “the same”— at least in terms of placement within institutions—it is our acceptance of the naturalistic paradigm that helps us to understand that each individual has something to contribute to the whole that will benefit the class, whether that emerges from her past language learning experience, her learning strategies, or whatever it may be.

The final area to be discussed in this section is the perceived proximity be tween languages. This notion, clearly residing within Schumann’s theory of dis tance, gained popularity from the Foreign Service Institute’s ideas about the prescribed length of study time required for speakers of English to learn a second language. Thus, after World War II, government and military employees were assigned varying lengths of time to study a language based on whether it shared the same orthography, grammatical structure, and other features with English. Following this line of thought, English speakers studying Spanish required considerably less time than those studying Mandarin Chinese. While this practice still exists today in the language training of foreign service officers for the United States and seems, at least on the surface, to have some degree of reasonability, its reality may, once again, be more of a quantitative issue than a qualitative one. In other words, depending on the individual learner’s purpose and intent in learning the second language, the reality of a distance may be vastly exaggerated. If a student is solely interested in learning to speak a language, there need not necessarily be more time required to learn Russian than French. However, if the same student is attempting to learn how to read and write the language, the different orthography would most likely add more time to the overall acquisition of the target; however, there are no verified studies that have proved this and individual learner differences must always be considered.

# Post-Reading Questions

Try to define yourself as a language learner using the factors listed in this chapter. Compare your profile with that of at least two other students in your class. Where are the similarities? Where are the differences? Assuming you were all in the same language class, how might instruction be altered or enhanced to accommodate your differences?

# Reflective Journal

Review the categories and individual factors affecting second language acquisition. Based on your understanding of them, compare and contrast the processes of first and second (or “subsequent”) language acquisition. What do you think are the similarities? What do you think are the differences? Reflecting upon your final assessment (i.e., they are more similar or more dissimilar), what would you imagine the benefits or drawbacks are in teaching a second language based on a model for first language acquisition?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Make arrangements to observe an ESL class. Once in the class, choose one student to observe without letting him or her know. Try not to select the most outgoing student necessarily, but consider a student who may be more reserved. During the course of your observation, take notes on the student’s behavior. Does it change depending on the type of grouping pattern or activity being worked on? Does the student volunteer to answer or wait to be called on? Describe in as much detail as possible all the nonverbal behavior (e.g., facial expressions, body language) that accompanies the progress of the class.

Afterward, when you have returned home, type up your field notes and note how many of the factors named in the section on second language acquisition you can identify, whether seen first hand or derived from the witnessed behavior. Compare your experiences with a classmate. Together, prepare a report for your class listing which behaviors seem to be indicators of specific factors.

# Csilla

I’d say my best teacher had first-hand experience of what she was teaching us and that was just so much more interesting than anything the books could possibly offer. I would say she was a good teacher because she was real, what she knew was real, and it was interesting. To be a good teacher you really need to expand your horizons and for me taking general education courses is a wonderful way to do that. Last semester, I had a student who was a biology major and she wanted to write a paper about DNA. I was just so happy because I just finished a biology class and for the first time in my life I could relate to a topic in science.

And I think we really connected over that. I think she ended up thinking that I was a wonderful teacher because I was willing to let her do that and could understand what she was talking about and make suggestions. To be a really good ESL teacher, you need to know about other things. Then, you have all this interesting information to share or talk about with the different students that might be here to learn English, but there are so many other things in the world.

s an ESL teacher, where do your beliefs about effective instruction A come from? Do you attempt to model yourself after those individuals from your own experience whom you considered to be your “best” teachers? Do you simply try to follow the methods you learned as part of a teacher preparation program? Or is there some element of all of these combined with the day-to-day dynamics of the classroom context?

In the opening example, Csilla identifies how first-hand knowledge became important to her, first by recognizing it in her own English language teacher and then by fostering it in herself to broaden what she knows and can bring to the classroom experience.

In this chapter, you will begin to explore some of the various influences that shape teachers’ belief systems and subsequent praxis. While the list of influences discussed here is not intended to be exhaustive, it is sufficiently broad enough to allow every individual to fill in his or her own unique experience in the named area. The only caveat I ask you to consider is that, should your own beliefs agree with those presented here, please don’t allow them to limit your potential for growth; keep in mind that different ways of knowing, different subject positions, and different realities in the local culture of power can inform and ultimately en hance your ability to meet the needs of your students in your journey toward becoming more effective.

From the teachers who were interviewed for this book, several influences, or areas, that emerged revealed a great deal about how these individuals approach the task of teaching ESL in a multicultural classroom environment. That approach, as well as the themes that emerged from this study, reveals information about the teachers as people, situated synchronically and diachronically in their praxis. This information was further supported by classroom observations. The areas of belief presented contribute to a definition of effective language instruction from the teacher perspective and are presented in the following order:

1. Beliefs about Language Learning;   
2. Beliefs about Language Teaching;   
3. Beliefs about the Instructional Program and Its Curriculum;   
4. Beliefs about Language Teaching as a Profession;   
5. Teachers’ Personal Background & Self-Assessment;   
6. Teachers’ Self-Reflection on their own Learning Experiences;   
7. Teachers’ Notions about the Student–Teacher Relationship; and   
8. Teachers’ Definitions of Effective Language Teaching.

# BELIEFS ABOUT LANGUAGE LEARNING

Richards and Lockhart (1994) asserted that language teachers’ beliefs about learning often stem from their own life experience and teaching preparation, as well as their own personal experience as language learners. Evidence in support of this statement appears directly in the comments from the teacher interviews. Combining all three of these sources of experience—personal life, teacher preparation program, and language learning—Laurel reflected on her own somewhat restrictive “upbringing” to offer the following remarks:

# Laurel

You know I don’t often think about how my early life affects me as a teacher. I tend to think more about how much I’ve learned from workshops and from other teachers and from books and from people where I’m teaching and from conferences. There is a strong strand in my thinking about every class I teach that the students are in charge of their own learning—and it’s quite possibly a reaction to my upbringing. I had never been allowed to make decisions for myself in high school. It makes sense, doesn’t it? That what I impose on them will not be as useful to them as what they choose to do. So student choice I think is one of the absolute most important variables in any teaching/learning situation. And at the bottom, the basis for that is my belief that the desire to learn is just an unstoppable human propensity. People love to learn. Learning is fun. And if you give people choices, they will come and unerringly choose the one that’s best for them. They will not make the lazy choice because it’s a lot more fun to be in the challenge zone. So if you give students enough choices, they’ll choose the right challenge and they’ll learn faster.

Complementary to the reflection about where teachers’ beliefs about learning originate, there exists a certain expectation which those beliefs inform. In his discussion about how his own learning experiences influenced him, Dean states that “being easy on a student is just counterproductive; you have to expect a lot. It probably falls into line with that not much was expected of me, so I try to expect more of my students.” This idea is echoed by Laurel who explains that, “if you believe the best of people, they rise to it again and again.”

Yet alongside the high expectations that these teachers have, it is necessary to be aware that students, too, have expectations. Occasionally, this awareness may arise from an understanding that students often have different orientations toward language learning than ESL teachers do (cf. Kono, 2000; Ruiz, 1984).

# Csilla

For them, English is not a goal; it’s a tool. For me, it was a goal. In a way, it was a tool because I use English to teach, but being perfect in English was part of being an English teacher.

It is always important to recognize that your students’ underlying beliefs about language learning may be profoundly different from yours. Csilla’s comment gets to the heart of Ruiz’ (1984) language orientations presented in chapter 1, demonstrating that different people have different perspectives about what language is and engage in the study of languages for different reasons. Remember, you will make your teaching more effective by maintaining a student focus, engaging students in open discussions and making them participants in their own learning process. Thus, you as a language teacher also need to acknowledge “the importance of clarifying to learners the assumptions underlying teachers’ classroom practices, or accommodating classroom practices to match them more closely to students’ expectations” (Richards & Lockhart, 1994, p. 35, italics added for emphasis; see also Kumaravadivelu, 1994).

# Dean

We language teachers are interested in words—many of us—words for words’ sake.   
We like dictionaries and we like foreign languages and we think words are just fun.   
See our students are just not that way. They’re trying to get their engineering degree.   
They want to memorize and use the language to get through school. I tend to guard against thinking my students have the same interests as I do.

Dean’s comments highlight how an important element in becoming a more effective language instructor requires focusing on meeting students’ expectations. By understanding that meeting expectations is a multidirectional function (i.e., teachers must meet students’ expectations as well as the inverse), effective instruction in a participatory approach necessitates an ongoing renegotiation of the processes involved in teaching and learning.

# BELIEFS ABOUT LANGUAGE TEACHING

Research in language classrooms also supports the notion that there can be a mismatch in meeting expectations between teachers and students. In a study looking at teacher and student beliefs about language instruction, Schulz (1996) surveyed 92 second/foreign language teachers and more than 800 students. Her analysis revealed that a gap existed between what each thought was necessary to facilitate and enhance language learning. Whereas students generally felt that they needed more explicit error correction and grammar teaching, the majority of teachers embraced a communicative approach as the best way to teach language.

This gap underscores what I believe to be a major problem contributing to ineffectiveness in language teaching: There is often very little meaningful dialogue between the teachers and the students about what is happening in the classroom. As Freire suggests, the failure of many educational curricula is due to the teachers’ lack of consideration for the desires of those involved: the students. On the other hand, teachers who are considered effective by students tend to share their students’ beliefs; accommodate their beliefs to those of the students when feasible and practical; and/or do their best to articulate why they follow a particular approach. This inclusiveness, making students partners in the classroom, underlies the very essence of a participatory approach. Opening a dialogue aids teachers’ awareness of students’ expectations. In effect, teachers maintain an ongoing student focus and provide variety in the classroom to address as many different needs and desires as possible. Although it is also necessary to have a plan prepared, effective teachers remain aware and versatile enough to make changes to their plan at a moment’s notice, even if it is already in progress.

# Laurel

In teaching and learning, there is a mutual process of discovery between me and the student as to what needs to be learned here and what’s the best way to learn it. The best I can expect to do is understanding what the student wants or needs to learn.

Dean also maintains this student focus as he asks himself, “What kind of things do they need?” He explains that “There’s a mixture of nurture and nature,” which Laurel refers to as “caring intensely and letting it show.” In a communicative approach to language teaching, teachers often identify the balance between nurture and nature. This balance ultimately refers to a teacher’s understanding of each student’s individual process of language learning and an awareness about when some type of intervention or explicit teaching is required (nurture) and when students need to be left on their own to discover (nature).

Scarcella and Oxford (1992), in detailing their own formula for a communicative approach to language teaching, the “Tapestry Approach,” find these characteristics “essential because they foster caring, growth-inducing relationships that enhance the quality of lives” (p. 4). Thus, effective language teaching combines the professional development from pre-service education, in-service development, and experience, with the human soul of someone who genuinely cares about the students he or she teaches.

As stated earlier, planning and preparation also play an important role in engaging effective language instruction. However, despite the need for advanced planning, flexibility is vitally important. Kevin, a veteran teacher of 25 years, describes what he refers to as “teacher senses” which manifest themselves in the classroom by “keeping your ears open for interaction and seeing whether the students seem to be involved with each other or not.” Maintaining these teacher senses, or awareness, is also multidirectional. First, it relates to the realization that either instructions are unclear, the activity or lesson is unproductive, or the overall plan is ineffectual. Contrastively, even if the planning is sound, “for some unforeseen reason it’s just not working with this group of students” (Csilla). In those moments, Kevin plainly asserts, “If something doesn’t work, usually I’ll terminate it. If it’s ‘bombing,’ change it.”

One way to develop an effective plan is to find a balance. Variety seems to be the key component in addressing students’ differences in cognitive learning styles, multiple intelligences, and personality and affective factors, all of which create a dynamic situation where each student must be seen individually. Laurel reasserts the relevance of variety not only for different students, but for the same ones by stating “I believe in variety in a classroom to keep people awake and alive. Don’t always do it the same way.”

Variety can refer to many things, such as the way you present new material, the way the students engage in the process of learning, the types of grouping that you organize in any given class period, and the types of media you integrate to be used for and by student. But this is not to suggest that the process of teaching should proceed from the position of uninformed eclecticism; that is, a random selection of techniques and activities uninformed by theory and with no relationship to one another (Freeman & Freeman, 2001). As an effective teacher, you will need to make choices based on your understanding of your students’ needs and a continuous awareness of how those choices are working, both of which are informed by a solid foundation in language pedagogy: both its theory and practice. Nor should every moment of your class be a surprise to your students. Students not only want, but may also need a certain degree of repetition to make connections either to their own experience or to material from previous classes, facilitating relationships and enhancing learning. “It’s not that I believe in unbridled variety. That’s why I like routine. Classroom routine gives students an anchor” (Laurel). To emphasize this point further, my own observations of Kevin’s classroom teaching come to mind.

# Scenario

Everyday, the series of activities seemed virtually the same. Class would always begin with a few questions on the board. Students would stand and arrange themselves in a circle. Throughout this activity, students would engage in a question and answer session, using the questions as they were written on the board and exchanging answers. After running through the first series of questions and answers, students would switch partners and run through the string of questions again with someone new. Afterward, the students would return their seats, take out their books, and usually take turns reading aloud. At the end of each paragraph, students would offer any vocabulary words they didn’t know. After Kevin felt that they had sufficiently comprehended the meaning of the new words, the students would turn and work with a partner seated next to them to review the meaning of the paragraph by paraphrasing it. This sequence would ensue until the entire passage had been read. Finally, students would work together to respond to some comprehension exercises about the passage. There was little variation in this class from one day to the next, yet students never appeared to be frustrated or bored. Indeed, they continually rated Kevin as one of the most effective teachers they had ever had. Perhaps by freeing them from having to learn and try out novel tasks and activities on a daily basis, they were freed to use the language they were acquiring in meaningful ways, from the social to the academic.

# BELIEFS ABOUT THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM AND ITS CURRICULUM

Language teaching programs, on some level, may be considered a sum of their parts (Richards & Lockhart, 1994). In any program, the philosophy, mission, policies and practices, are reflective of the “collective decisions and beliefs of individual teachers” (p. 38). Among the many issues that may be explicitly represented as part of the curriculum or only implied in praxis are a focus on needs analysis, student centrality, the use of authentic materials, and multiculturalism.

In reflecting on his own experience, Dean refers to school as a refuge. In his recollection of his impressions of school as a child, he describes his feelings about school as “a friendly, warm place,” and makes a connection to the warmth and security of the building where he teaches how. He sees it as a safe haven for the international students entering this strange “new world.”

# Dean

They don’t have to provide their own activities, which is especially difficult in a foreign country for a lot of people. There is the prospect of future success and wealth. In a word, it’s a hope. That’s a pretty hard driving force and most of our students are hard driving. For ESL students, a new world is opening I’m sure. As it did for me, there’s a new world out there with new people and they’re looking at themselves, their own culture, you know, within a different light. It’s a secure place where they’re learning to think.

In a sense, Dean, Kevin, and Laurel, all “grew up” in the programs where they teach, each having been employed there in excess of 20 years. Additionally, they all refer to the ease with which they seemed to obtain a teaching position, despite the strong competition for ESL teaching positions. Csilla’s experience also reflects the apparent ease with which she became a faculty member.

# Csilla

I called the Director. He gave me an interview. I told him I wanted to observe classes. He let me observe and then I went back and I said, “Would it possible for me to teach here?” And I was very lucky because that was one of the good years, I think. You know, enrollment was sky high and he offered to let me teach the TOEFL class first.

Although the process was clearly more involved than this excerpt implies, these teachers’ own experience and qualifications made them shine above other potential candidates.

If there is a universal complaint teachers seem to have about a program, it is usually curricular and relates to the materials available. Both Dean and Laurel refer to the paucity of good material to address the diverse student needs and interests. Even with a wealth of current journals in the field, teacher reference books, and textbooks for the teaching of a wide variety of skills, levels, and purposes, very little material is available to help teachers cope with individual student difference; in this area, they must often rely on their own skills and gifts.

# BELIEFS ABOUT LANGUAGE TEACHING AS A PROFESSION

Language teaching as a profession still does not share equal status with many other professions, including teaching in other disciplines. The reason for this may also be connected with the way language is viewed as a subject and part of the reason why language teachers seek innovative approaches to foster second language acquisition. Since a first language is something that everyone acquires naturally, without explicit instruction, the attitudes about the best way to learn a language abound. However, second language researchers have shown that learning a second language is not parallel to learning a first language and can benefit from direct instruction (Bley-Vroman, 1989; Doughty, 1991, 2003; Doughty & Williams, 1998; Long, 1983). For a long time, though, many linguists and educators alike considered it problematic to introduce a second language to younger children as it might be ultimately confusing and inhibit other cognitive development (Jespersen, 1922). In some cases, such as in the United States, for example, many people could not even understand the utility of learning a second language and, thus, language education became relegated to second-class status. Subsequent studies, starting with Peal and Lambert (1962), suggested that, contrary to earlier notions, there may be advantages to knowing more than one language (cf. Collier, 1995; Romaine, 1995; Wei, 2000), but these findings are relevant to early bilinguals rather than second or subsequent language learners (see also Bialystock, 2001; Grosjean, 1982, for a review of the relevant literature). Despite a person’s perspective on the benefits of early or late introduction of language learning, different language orientations (Ruiz, 1984) can similarly influence opinions about the benefit of language teaching and teachers by association.

# Kevin

I think I had some idealism about teaching a language that could bring people together, you know, and help communicate. I think I still have that—getting people to be able to talk to each other.

The teachers interviewed for this book also acknowledge their own initial attitudes toward becoming English teachers. For all of them, teaching ESL seems to have happened “by default” rather than through careful choices in career planning.

# Csilla

I had a really good English teacher in high school. My mom wanted me to be a scientist or a doctor and I knew I definitely didn’t want that. And, I fell in love with the English language and the literature that she was teaching me. So then, the logical step, when I was 18, I wanted to go to college. So what am I going to major in? I’m going to major in English. And at that point I did not know about teaching or I didn’t have a clue that I was going to be a teacher or wanted to be a teacher.

While this excerpt may sound like the start of a career in English teaching, Csilla later clarified that it was rather fortuitous that she met her English teacher in the first place.

# Csilla

You go 8 years to grade school. And then I had to choose a secondary school to go to. And I was terrified by having to do that. I grew up in this little village and the secondary school was in Budapest. And the only thing I knew is that I didn’t want to be the only one in that class and not know anybody. So I had this good friend, and she decided to go to this certain high school to study English.

Other teachers interviewed about their initial impulses (or lack thereof) to become an ESL teacher were even more explicit.

# Dean

The thought of being an English teacher never crossed my mind. I was traveling around Japan and I was hitchhiking and was running out of cash and there was a tremendous demand for English. And I was getting along so well in it and I thought, you know, doing a good job. So that’s when I thought I would do it for a while. But I still thought it was just a temporary thing.

Often, a lack of direction led to a situation where the teacher simply “fell into” language teaching without considerable forethought.

# Laurel

It all started with a kiss in Egypt. I was 19 years old. After one year of college, I was booted out of the University of Nevada and they said, “Do not come back.” So there I was traveling, feeling sort of lost in the world and very much enjoying being in Egypt, but feeling like a total failure academically when I walked past an open doorway. People were studying to get the masters in ESL at the American University in Cairo and they were practicing for a midterm exam. I heard one of them say, “Okay, what’s an implosive bilabial click?” I was just walking past the door and I knew the answer, so I walked back and I called out, “Yo.” All these older academic people looked up at me and I showed them an implosive bilabial click; I blew a kiss and walked away. It was a moment of epiphany.

Regardless of their beginnings, once they acknowledged their “calling,” these effective teachers all went on to complete a degree in ESL education. Furthermore, to keep up with their own professional development, they have attended numerous conferences and workshops, presented their own research, and attempted in a variety of ways to stay current in their praxis. Their attitudes have changed toward the profession and their professionalism is reflected in the way they approach teaching and interact with their students.

# Laurel

I’ve got the world’s best job for me. I love it. I absolutely adore it. The same reasons I got into it turned out to be true. I’m my own boss. I can be creative. The world comes to me. It’s never boring. There’s always a challenge.

# TEACHERS’ PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND SELF-ASSESSMENT

Though the previous sections reveal a great deal about teachers’ belief systems, there are other necessary considerations in understanding a composite picture of effectiveness that is informed diachronically as well as synchronically. The statement, “We teach who we are” (Palmer, 1998), effectively expresses this idea in the examination of teachers’ subject positions. This is not to suggest that those subject positions are static, but informed by an ever-present dynamic that is reflective (able to look into its own origins) and fluid (able to adjust in relation to external influences circumstances, such as other subject positions).

Dean clarifies this dynamic by discussing his own background, revealing that “in rural Montana, there were no different cultures, no foreign languages, no foreign influence at all. My initial interest came from reading I guess.” His impressions about school as a “refuge,” references to his family’s “elevated English” despite their humble existence, and focus on reading as an initial way to experience other cultures merged to interest him in travel as both experiential and educational. Much like the other teachers, he opines the formative and transformative nature of travel. “Travel not only brings people together, but it broadens—the way they look at the world. It caused me to look at the world and see it in a different light.”

Among the dynamic nature of the subject position revealed in Dean’s comments, reading and travel play prominent roles in other effective teachers’ backgrounds. Kevin, for instance, explains his original choice of a college major, English literature, based solely on the fact that he liked to read. Subsequently, his interest in traveling combined with his degree to give him the opportunity to teach English in the Peace Corps. From that experience and his many years of teaching, he has framed this fundamental viewpoint. “I like working with foreign students, foreign people. I like the exposure to different languages and different cultures and different viewpoints. It helps me from becoming too narrow-minded and ethnocentric.”

There are also certain traits that surface from the teachers’ personal backgrounds that translate into praxis. Some of these materialize from memories that they are trying to rectify with their own students, such as the lack of mentoring. As stated earlier, Laurel sets high expectations for her students. Perhaps this reflects her own upbringing where she states “An A– was not enough.” While she speaks openly about her own attempts at overcoming this perfectionist attitude, she simultaneously recognizes that a caring teacher needs to show an interest in her students’ success. “I was graduated with highest honors from high school, but nobody mentored me.” Dean, too, agrees that “being easy on a student is just counterproductive,” relating back to his own experience where “no one really made excellence important.”

Direct references to pushing or mentoring, however, are not merely intended to suggest a replication of the high standards these teachers were or were not expected to achieve in their youth, but a genuine interest in their students’ individual development. Laurel explains that her sense of perfectionism was imposed from outside by claiming that she recognized that early on she didn’t know how to make decisions for herself. Clearly, reflecting on her personal experience led her to avoid this form of imposition with her own students.

# Laurel

Students need to feel that they’re getting what they need. And if I don’t ask them, I don’t know what they need. The theme that emerged from all the things I wanted to do was, “you are in charge.” So the activities that I chose were ones that, by and large, emphasized the fact that they’re in charge of their own learning.

# TEACHERS’ SELF-REFLECTION ON THEIR OWN LEARNING EXPERIENCES

While their life experiences discussed in the previous section have been educational and have had consequences in their praxis, the teachers were also asked to talk about specific formal learning situations that came to mind. In addition to the concept that we teach who we are, there is also the generally held belief that teachers teach as they were taught (Hinkel, 1999). Still, a certain amount of teaching praxis appears to develop from teachers’ conscious choices based on reflections of what works and what doesn’t. These choices can result from (a) a consideration of what worked for them in their own learning process; (b) the recognition of how students respond to different practices; or (c) a comparison of different teaching approaches and/or styles.

In general, Dean had a very positive attitude about school:

# Dean

I hated to miss school and whenever I was absent, it was the worst thing in the world. I was behind everybody else and I’d miss something—not only the academic stuff, but the friendships and the games that were played—all that good stuff.

Despite his general love for school, though, he mentions a “mean” teacher from whom he learned a great deal: “I learned geometry. I was afraid not to.” In contrast, he refers to a very nice teacher who was “worthless.” In searching for these elements in his classroom conduct, neither characterization seems appropriate. Indeed, his own students find him caring, funny, and effective.

Csilla’s portrayal of her high school biology class lends a somewhat different experience to the analysis. “It was repulsive.” Juxtaposed with classes she has taken at the university where she teaches since she started working there, there is a marked difference.

# Csilla

I’ve been taking classes here for the past, I would say, 3 years. I’m having the time of my life! I think it’s easy, and it’s interesting. Even the bad teachers are superior compared to many of my former professors. Probably my attitude has changed a lot about learning.

Nevertheless, she questions what was at the heart of her feelings about the experience. “I’m not quite sure if the classes are really that different, or I changed a lot. Now, I see myself as being much more involved.”

Perhaps the notion that teachers teach as they were taught can be revised for our purposes. As it is clear that Dean and Csilla have experienced both effective and ineffective teachers, it might be more accurate to suggest that teachers’ praxis emerges out of positive experiences with their own teachers. To highlight this distinction, Laurel refers to herself as “a hands-on sort of learner.” This rings true in her own classroom as she involves her students in a good deal of hands-on learning as witnessed in the several observations I made. Kevin also emphasizes experience as an excellent teacher. He notes that a good deal of his learning about how to teach “just came from doing it.” He has reduced the distinction of what constitutes a good class to the common denominators of “it was interesting; it was fun; it was active. The students performed. The teacher didn’t stand up there and talk forever.”

“Mostly I learned from my students and I learned a lot teaching freshman comp from my students.” In this statement, it is evident how Laurel as an effective teacher is also a student (Freire, 1970). Part of this effectiveness comes from maintaining an awareness of the moment-by-moment atmosphere of the classroom. Thus, as stated earlier, the effective teacher continues to take the temperature of the room by listening and watching what happens, and altering the direction of the lesson if students appear confused, frustrated, or bored.

As suggested earlier, effectiveness may require reflection and analysis of both positive and negative learning experiences. In comparison to their own experiences with the educational system, the teachers interviewed here can distinguish between what didn’t work for them and what does work for their students, an awareness that you will need to foster in order to make your language instruction more effective.

# Csilla

Students are considered more as equals and not just objects sitting in the classroom to be lectured at. Communicative learning methods are kind of spreading throughout the field. Or that’s what I saw when I took these astronomy classes—that even the science teachers are putting you into groups and giving you questions to answer with your partners. I didn’t see any of that in college in Hungary. You sat down, you listened to your professor. You went home, you memorized what you were supposed to, as opposed to sitting with a bunch of people and figure out what the correct answer is. It’s just so much more enjoyable.

This excerpt points to many of the changes that are taking place in the American educational system related to multicultural ESL classroom and the impact of changing demographics on the educational system in general. This type of collaborative classroom appeals to different kinds of students with different ways of knowing and remains consonant with a communicative approach to language teaching. Indeed, finding new approaches to pedagogy can transform the subject matter into something accessible to the students. In one of Laurel’s reflections, she talks about a professor she had at the university. Even though she was already interested in the subject from the beginning, she muses, “I learned about grammar in a way that I hadn’t before.” In effect, the teacher, whom she had earlier referred to as “deadly” based on her participation in a previous seminar conducted by the same person, affected her greatly through his approach and changed her attitude about him as a professor. Although Laurel and others were able to overcome the otherwise negative learning experiences and identify positive outcomes, we as ESL teachers interested in meeting out students’ needs and fostering lifelong learning can’t afford to rely on the possibility that our students will engage in this same type reflection later in life; indeed, we can only guess at the number of students who may be turned off to learning early on because of a negative experience. Instead, we want to ensure that our students, as partners in the classroom, recognize their potential while engaging in the process of learning.

Laurel’s comments further emphasize the grossly overstated impression that teachers teach as they were taught, suggesting that a teacher’s ability to engage in effective praxis only emerges out of positive experiences with her or his own teachers. If this were true and teachers only conducted their classes like the classes they had been exposed to through their earlier educational experiences, innovation could never happen. Indeed, depending on their experiences, they might never have the capacity to become effective. Translation: There is hope. It therefore seems more likely that teachers’ teaching behavior, as suggested by these interviewees, joins what they consider effective language teaching practices, modulation to student response, and part of their own personalities to create a composite of effective language instruction from the teacher perspective.

# TEACHERS’ NOTIONS ABOUT THE STUDENT–TEACHER RELATIONSHIP

# Dean

There’s mutual respect in the classroom.

# Laurel

No adults like having their comprehension checked continually. It’s demeaning. It’s not a human–human interaction; it’s a teacher–student interaction. It’s a power differential interaction.

# Kevin

Try to listen to them carefully and to accept their ideas without being judgmental. Give them opportunities to express their opinions and not to be critical of their opinions, to treat them in a professional way.

These statements advance what seems to be one of, if not the most important features of the student–teacher relationship in effective language instruction: respect. In the classroom, you are almost certainly viewed as the central power figure. In a multicultural ESL classroom, it is the student focus that enables you to recognize that yours is not the only subject position; in effect, you recognize your place in the perceived culture of power and make a conscious choice not to be complicit in its replication; that is, you don’t seek to repeat bad practices, such as the “banking model,” but you attempt to engage in problem-posing to help your students take part in a democracy, both inside and outside of the classroom. These conditions provide for an atmosphere of mutual respect. Coupled with that respect, there must also be a willingness on the your part to assume the various roles that may be necessary during any given class period with any individual student to address needs, accommodate learning styles, or simply meet expectations—to be an “ally.”

# Laurel

An ally is someone who believes you can do anything that you set your mind to. An ally is someone who provides the resource you need when you need it—somebody you can count on in life.

Scarcella and Oxford (1992) provide detailed information on what they deem to be the several roles of the teacher. “Teachers are information-gatherers, decision-makers, motivators, facilitators, input providers, counselors, friends, providers of feedback, and promoters of multiculturalism—depending on the context in which they teach” (p. 4). With regard to the final tag, it is also necessary to realize that the students are the living element in the classroom; they provide for the constant dynamic which is the classroom context. Thus, you need to prepare to meet the expectations of that classroom through the recognition of the diversity that exists there on several levels, such as the multicultural makeup of any group of students and the individual student differences with regards to cognitive learning styles, personality and affective factors, etc.

# Laurel

Everybody’s different. The more I learn about my students, the better I can teach them. And that informs a lot of my practices as a teacher.

# Csilla

I said the class has to be interesting, so it starts with understanding your students— what they are interested in, who they are. One way of understanding them for me is to relate their life experiences or their attitude to something that I experienced, but it’s always kind of an individual connection.

# TEACHERS’ DEFINITIONS OF EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE TEACHING

Effective language teaching, with all that entails, is a challenge. Csilla provides a binary categorization for teaching that seems an appropriate consideration in the development of a working definition.

# Csilla

I begin to see teaching more and more as a bunch of skills that are learnable. You know, it’s also a gift, and many people are gifted. But there’s a huge part of it that is just learning skills—learning how to do it—and I’m always challenged by that. The area of gift includes things like sense of humor. Another gift is the ability to make personal connections, being a good storyteller. Making the big plan, being a director, making it fun, I think those are skills that you can learn.

In addition to these earlier mentioned ideas, the several teachers interviewed offer an array of qualities that range from a list of descriptions to actions. The former category, descriptions, is further subdivided into two areas: descriptions about the teacher as a person, and descriptions about the actual instruction that the teacher provides and/or the classroom atmosphere the teacher fosters. In the latter category, actions, the teachers offer suggestions from both their own teaching and learning experiences. Table 4.1 lists these various qualities.

TABLE 4.1 Teacher Qualities   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Descriptions</td><td rowspan="2">Actions</td></tr><tr><td>Teacher as a Person</td><td>Classroom Atmosphere</td></tr><tr><td>: available : cogent, logical, and clear; not confusing . hard, but fair : fluent : real : well-organized</td><td>: enjoyable : fun lively : nurturing : practical : useful : a class has to be interesting at whatever the cost, so</td><td>. keep it light; keep it humor- ous; keep them interested - setting goals--what is this class about : show an overall plan that goes beyond that particular class : he did the unexpected so it</td></tr></table></body></html>

Comparing the descriptions and actions named from the voices of the teachers with the students’ definitions of effective language teaching in the following chapter, common themes emerge. These themes move us closer toward the evolution of a working definition for effective language instruction.

# Post-Reading Questions

Now explore your own beliefs. Reread your definition for effective language instruction. Decide how complete you think it is and make any necessary changes. Are there any areas not mentioned in the chapter that you consider important in defining effectiveness? What are they? Be sure to include them in your revised definition.

Working with a group, try to co-construct a common definition from your various offerings. If someone followed your steps, would that be sufficient to make him or her an effective instructor? What other influences might affect a teacher’s ability to engage effective instruction?

# Reflective Journal

Reflect on your own belief. To what extent do you think your experiences have informed the way you think effective language instruction should be carried out? Choose one or two of the areas identified in the Pre-Reading Questions and write about how it has contributed to your way of thinking.

Did any of the comments your classmates made in group surprise you? Try to think of one example and write about why it surprised you. Consider the possible differences in experience between you and your classmate.

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Go back and reread Csilla’s discussion about “skills and gifts.” Then, look over the table of descriptions and actions. Make a chart or a Venn diagram placing the various labels given under skills or gifts. Add your own descriptions and actions to the chart or diagram. Bring your work to class to compare with your classmates. If possible, post the charts or diagrams around the room in order to incorporate student perspectives from the next chapter into your developing model.

# What Do Students Believe About Effective Language Instruction?

# Pre-Reading Questions

In a group of three to four classmates, generate a list of where you think students’ opinions of effective teaching originate. Consider your own experiences as a student in answering. Do you imagine these opinions are malleable (that is, to what extent would you imagine subsequent experiences with the same or other teachers alter these opinions)? Why or why not?

Now, go back to the Pre-Reading Questions in chapter 4. Reviewing the list of areas where teachers’ beliefs may originate, are there any modifications you would like to make to your group’s list regarding students’ beliefs?

Consider your own ability to effect change as a teacher. Where and how might you be able to initiate a positive change with students in your praxis? In the classroom? In their lives?

Hto prepare yourself for the class? What do you anticipate in the firstencounter with the teacher and your classmates? What expectationsdo you have of the teacher and the class? How would you cope if proach than you are comfortable or familiar with)?

Up to now, we have explored some issues related to philosophy of language and learning, theory behind language teaching, and factors affecting second language acquisition. But there is yet something else that remains to be integrated into your praxis—a perspectival factor that unfolds in the interaction between you and your students. You will need to discern what your students consider an effective teacher and effective instruction to be and, to some extent, respond to those expectations through direct dialogue and explanation of your praxis.

Responding to interviews and questionnaires, more than 100 English language learners were asked to define what “effective” means to them. These students were all taking classes at the Center during the time of the original study and, as a further caveat, were solicited from classes being taught by the teachers identified for the study (see Preface). The students represented a wide range of languages and cultures, but were predominantly international students, intent on entering university in the United States. They offered a variety of ideas that will be explored in this section. At times, the student responses were synonymous with those advanced by the teachers. At other times, the responses were suggestive of the definitions given by the teachers. In both of these cases, the teachers’ answers are duplicated below for the sake of comparison. On occasion, however, the students’ answers provided an insight not often explored by most teachers—the kind of information that problem-posing draws out and can make the difference between being a good teacher and a truly effective one.

# DESCRIPTIONS: TEACHER AS A PERSON

With regard to student comments that come closest to the teacher comments about the teacher as a person, students tended to focus more on behaviors than mere adjectives. Their words were consequently more suggestive; however, clear connections can be drawn between the qualities forwarded by teachers and the actions prized by students (see Table 5.1). From the perspective of the students, then, this link between “being” and “doing” seems to be indicative of one of the principal premises of a participatory approach: The two do not derive from separate positionalities. In other words, the teacher in the classroom and the person outside of the classroom are not two distinct individuals, but one and the same.

TABLE 5.1 Comparison of Teacher and Student Descriptions of “Teacher”   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Teacher Descriptions</td><td>Student Descriptions</td></tr><tr><td>Teacher as a Person</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>: available : cogent, logical, and clear; not confusing . hard, but fair</td><td>: Mahmoud, 28, Saudi Arabia: We often met him outside the class. : Mahmoud, 28, Saudi Arabia: Uses simple word to communicate with us. .

They start with review of what they were giving yesterday, then get you to the new lesson, moving between what we took and what we will take.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In those cases where the students did supply descriptive adjectives to describe teachers as effective, they tended to focus on the possession of an even-tempered nature. Though not stated overtly their responses to the request for a definition of effective, each of the teachers plainly said in their interviews that getting angry with students was something they all viewed as highly detrimental to the student–teacher relationship.

Walid, 23, Saudi Arabia: Patient. More patient. Because maybe you explain something it’s easy, but it’s difficult for a student.   
N.B. “Flexible” was an adjective mentioned by numerous students (e.g., Ana, Udom, Tomas, Dolores, Jamal, Maria, Mahmoud).   
Mahmoud, 28, Saudi Arabia: Flexible . . . cooperative.

# DESCRIPTIONS: CLASSROOM ATMOSPHERE

The area of the greatest convergence between student and teacher descriptions could be found in the description of the classroom environment. The focus on making the classroom fun and interesting while the language being learned is practical and useful resonated throughout many of the comments obtained from students and teachers (see Table 5.2). Reflecting on earlier chapters, we can see how students’ language orientations, and the difference between language learning and other learning are often shared by the participants in these classes. Thus, within a participatory approach, you will need to strive for a certain amount of agreement and understanding between you and your students to ensure the creation of a supportive environment where the learning process can be engaged. This also includes keeping the language relevant to students’ needs and level of proficiency, fulfilling the guidelines of a communicative approach to language teaching.

# ACTIONS

In several of the examples from both teachers and students, they reflected on a teacher they had had whom they particularly thought of as effective and proceeded to describe what that teacher did. Thus, although personality and the general character of the classroom environment are extremely relevant to defining what assists a teacher to provide effective language instruction, the most obvious manifestation of that effectiveness emerges from the actions. As can be seen in the comments in Table 5.3, being a demanding teacher does not necessarily entail seriousness, but a level of dedication and commitment to understanding that students’ view of language is often connected with their daily lives, personal interests and needs for achieving future success, and capacity to process new information.

As an addendum to this section on actions, it is also worth noting that students do not view their own role in the learning process as passive. Indeed, while they may have high expectations of you as a teacher, they do not have lower expectations of themselves. Several students took the defining of “effective” as a query about their personal involvement, as typified in the comments below.

Yousef, 18, United Arab Emirates: It means study very hard.

Maria, 34, Mexico: Practice more English after school.

Yuki, 20, Japan: That you need to feel that as much as you force yourself, you also improve yourself.

TABLE 5.3 Comparison of Teacher and Student Descriptions of “Teacher Actions”

The frustration from feeling incapable of comprehending or marking any visible signs of progress can be overwhelming and, at times, crippling. As a result, the incorporation of positive feedback and encouragement cannot be overvalued in effective language instruction.

As with the thematic analysis that was conducted with the teacher interviews, information provided by students in interviews and questionnaires was analyzed. The resulting themes give vital information about students’ perspectives on effective language instruction and aid in the development of a model. In the previous chapter, I referred to a publication by Schulz (1996). One of the major findings of her study is that teachers’ and students’ perceptions, especially in terms of what an approach to effective language instruction should entail, are frequently quite different. Within a participatory approach, however, you will have opportunities to exchange ideas with your students from the beginning rather than discovering misunderstandings through end-of-term evaluations. In fact, your explanation of the perceived efficacy of different tasks and techniques, where applicable, will let students know that you respect them enough to explain what you are doing and empower them as partners in the classroom and their own learning. The eight themes discussed in the subsequent sections are:

1. Language Skills   
2. Individual Differences   
3. Real-World Diversity   
4. Variety   
5. Love   
6. Humor   
7. Mutual Respect   
8. Praxis

# LANGUAGE SKILLS

As might be expected from any discourse in which students explain their concepts of language learning, they invariably refer to the language skills they consider to be most important to their development. Whether identifying receptive skills (i.e., listening and reading), productive skills (i.e., speaking and writing), or the components of lexis (vocabulary) and syntax (grammar) that enable interlanguage growth to proceed, students are most commonly verbalizing their knowledge of a more traditional understanding of language teaching—one which focuses on the development of a linguistic competence, just one part of a communicative competence.

Hyesun, 24, Korea: It’s to advance reading comprehension.

Eva, 23, Bulgaria: To learn correctly the language, like the meaning of words, grammar. And when you finish, to speak and write.

Ji-Yeol, 27, Korea: I can speak, listen, and write with English.

Pilar, 25, Colombia: For me there are many ways to learn a language, but the first way is speak with the people and understand the grammar. It’s very important to know vocabulary, a lot of vocabulary. Writing really is important for me. Grammar and reading; reading gives a lot of vocabulary for you.

Although this does not suggest that students are completely unfamiliar with other aspects of language in communication, they rely on your awareness as a teacher to diagnose and help them fulfill a more complete acquisition of the second language. For instance, elaborating on the differences between “formal” and “informal” learning, Fawad intimates a keen appreciation for the need to foster a sociocultural competence, as well as a sense of his own learning preferences.

Fawad, 27, Mauritania: I think they have a lot of ways, like the formal and the informal. And the formal is to go to school. And the informal is sometimes, you know, to talk to people in the cafeteria and restaurant. And for me the most important thing is to read a lot I think. One way to learn a language is to read.

The skill named most often, however, was speaking. Its importance cannot be stressed enough in the multicultural ESL class. Students in the second language environment are acutely aware of their accent and, despite research suggesting that pronunciation cannot be perfected after 5 or 6 years of age, you will need to attend to these concerns. Whether students are international students (i.e., in the country for the sole purpose of studying) or immigrants (i.e., living in the new country, whether by choice or not), the ability to communicate their innermost thoughts and be understood are important in the nurturing of the students’ identities expressed through language. Therefore, being in the target language environment, both inside and outside the classroom; having the teacher be a native or near-native speaker of the language; and speaking the language as much as possible are relevant to their ultimate achievement.

Yu Wen, 20, China: The best way to learn a language? I think speaking is a big problem. Just, for example, if I write an essay or write a composition, I think clearly because I can think carefully and the vocabulary and, you know, I can organize all the things carefully and clearly. But if I speak, it’s too hard for me. And I found out if you read a lot, then your speaking, writing, all the things will improve.

Hiro, 22, Japan: I think if I want to learn English, I will go to America or England. I think if I want to study some language, I should go to the country which the language is spoken.

Chul-Oh, 26, Korea: To be a good language teacher, first you must speak very good (Laughs).

Maria, 34, Mexico: I think it’s practice—speaking English with other people.

As stated in the previous section, students understandably associate effectiveness in language instruction with their own assessment of the degree of progress being made. As you might expect, the progress can manifest itself in several ways, most notably in terms of the time it takes to learn something, the ability to discern improvement—however incremental—and the products, or outcomes, of their efforts.

Jin Liang, 19, Taiwan: “Effective” means to have more vocabulary in the shorter time, realize what native people speak, read more articles and write better essays.

# Time and Competition

Just as students have individual learner differences, their distinctive personalities determine their own sense of timing and competition. The sense of competition with other students may be more or less depending on their respective cultures, but the degree of necessity increases significantly in the second language setting as compared with a foreign language setting. When students find themselves in the target language and culture, there is more of a burden on them to progress rapidly so that they can take part in whatever it is they want. Remember that international students and immigrants are most likely not studying the language for its own sake, but for access to something the language will afford, such as admission to a university program of study or more opportunities for employment. For this reason, they don’t want to spend what they consider an excessive amount of time studying language.

Delia, 22, Chile: Effective means learn fast and easy a language.

Rumi, 21, Japan: I think, “effective” means to me that I can fluently speak English more, and understand English more quickly.

Ji-Hyun, 27, Korea: Learning quickly.

Panos, 19, Cyprus: When you can learn it more easy and quickly and you can practice it. Effective means like useful.

The other side of this issue is, nevertheless, equally individual, entailing that some students will simply require more time than others. In those cases, it will be incumbent on you to help your students understand that second language acquisition cannot be rushed and that “fast” does not always equal “complete” when it comes to learning.

Ji-Yeol, 27, Korea: Learning language is very difficult and takes a long time. We need endurance to learn language.

Samir, 20, Kuwait: I think learning language is like drinking coffee. If you drink it fast, you’re going to burn your tongue, so you have to understand it well.

# Improvement and Outcomes

To assist your students when they may feel that acquisition is not happening fast enough, you should keep them abreast of their grades throughout the course of the class and show them the progress they are making. One way to do this is by incorporating some form of tracking method such as a portfolio. A portfolio is a collection of representative work accumulated over a given term (e.g., a semester). The choice of what to include can be predetermined or negotiated with the students; to demonstrate progress, however, you should have them include comparable assignments from the beginning and the end of the term, such as a writing assignment. In this way, students can see their own growth.

Tae-won, 22, Korea: Improve speaking and free communication.

Walid, 23, Saudi Arabia: I feel interest when I am studying the language. Also I feel that my language is improving.

Carlo, 18, Italy: Students improve skill in communication.

Consequent to the students’ comments above, there is a very important caveat to our interpretation of “improvement”; benchmarks and grades are not the only way to gauge improvement. They do not measure the worth of an individual. They are devises used to assign a value—a product—to student performance, relative to level and firmly grounded in a competitive model of education, and need to be explained to students as such. Although they are necessary (and expected by students) in most learning situations, you must also include an assessment of students relative to their personal goals and capabilities.

Hyesun, 24, Korea: It’s to get high score in the test.   
Alicia, 40, Mexico: Effective is to reach result.   
Bartolomeo, 26, Peru: That you achieve your goals or reach your objectives.   
Mauricio, 33, Mozambique: See the expected result.   
Myung-Ho, 30, Korea: Speak English fluently.

Thus, we can see that the student concept of learning skills, though typically expressed in terms of specific language skills, encompasses notions of what it means to know a language and how learning it should proceed. Though these notions are not always complete or entirely realistic, they exist as realities for these students until such time as they can develop a broader understanding of language and learning. Through the engagement of a participatory approach and the coconstruction of knowledge, you will be instrumental in this process.

# INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES

In chapter 3, we examined many of the factors that can combine and interact to affect second language acquisition. In this section, however, we limit the wider category of individual learner differences to those affective, cognitive, and developmental factors that students recognize in relation to language learning.

Students specifically addressed their motivation for studying the language, typically identifying it as instrumental or extrinsic in nature. In terms of their language orientation, we can see a good deal of similarity between teachers’ comments about why students study English as a second language—it is a necessary tool for achieving their personal goals. Moreover, students’ references to affect, as might be expected, suggested that environmental elements such as the interaction with teachers and other students could affect their performance.

Lucia, 25, Mexico: I need $1 0 0 \%$ English if I want to get a better job in my major.

Kwang-Ho, 25, Korea: Because if I knew different languages, I would have already got a good position of a job.

Dolores, 49, Mexico: It is important to me that you feel comfortable. When we see that some people are rude most of the people are afraid.

Majed, 27, Saudi Arabia: That’s when you see teachers laugh with you and make the “weather” inside the class good. Maybe this gives you the chance to open your brain to understand because in this time you’ll have less tendency to be scared.

In addition, students’ comments were suggestive of cognitive differences in both terms of actual ability and strategies. As a result, even students placing at the same level were ultimately aware that learning was achieved and addressed differently among peers.

Yu Wen, 20, China: I think the teacher spends much time and I know our levels are different.

Alberto, 18, Mexico: We have the same chance to participate in class, but not everybody has the same level in English. You must know how each student is because all the students cannot have the same intelligence; he has different tactics to learn English.

# REAL-WORLD DIVERSITY

Students who choose to study language in a classroom still maintain a level of expectation that the language they learn will enable them to communicate with native speakers. Thus, to make language learning practical and useful, you must keep in mind that your students see the sheltered environment of the classroom as a practice ground for the external world where they will use the language to communicate with others. Especially in the second language environment, they can also measure their outcomes against how well they perform in that external world, making them even more cognizant of whether the language being taught in the class has relevance to their needs beyond it.

Kuniyoshi, 35, Japan: Effective means whether or not it is helpful for me to communicate with English speakers.

Barbara, 22, Bulgaria: You can practice the language with other people who speak English. This is best way to examine my own English abilities.

Rodolfo, 18, Mexico: Learning too formal doesn’t help me to talk in the street.

Amir, 18, United Arab Emirates: I learn this language—Okay! Then when I go to the mall or some different places in the U.S. I have to speak with other people from the U.S. If I speak well, they will be kind or if I don’t, they will look at me like I’m stupid.

Students also affirm the need for effective language teachers to make connections between classroom content and the real world. Their comments reiterate the teachers’ discussion of the need for more authentic materials and real-world focus in the classroom environment. They underscore the need to develop a communicative competence by going beyond just the language and its pronunciation to actual situations and circumstances they will encounter.

Cailian, 23, Taiwan: This could happen in our daily life, so I think it’s interesting more than we just use the book.

Hiro, 22, Japan: You have to use the things which I want to use or have to use in our life.

Along with the desire to see language, use, and content that depict the real world, there also exists the common element of diversity. In addition to seeing English as a tool possessing the communicative value of language to connect them with the external world in which they are studying, working, and living, part of the benefit of the classroom in a participatory approach is that it links the multicultural composition of the ESL classroom with the multicultural composition and process of globalization in the modern world.

Fawad, 27, Mauritania: I see diversity, you know? Students come from different origins, different countries, different continents, and they don’t have the same ability or same idea; they are different.

Cailian, 23, Taiwan: Here, there are more people from different countries. They have a lot of different cultures and they have a lot of different experiences in life.

Recognizing the experiences of all students as valid and utilizing problemposing to explore real issues, the classroom becomes a resource for everyone and a catalyst for the transformation of society. Thus, it seems important that teachers in the language classroom, possibly more than any other type of educational situation, recognize the value of authenticity and place “classroom culture” in a procedural framework which can be openly discussed and negotiated with the students in a teacher–student partnership (Freire, 1970).

# VARIETY

Jin Liang, 19, Taiwan: Dean encourages us to use our own way of thinking. Once we guess the right meaning, it’s hard to forget. Moreover, we have different kinds of activities during the class. Thus, we can use our potential ability and make better progress.

As you begin to acknowledge the importance of understanding individual learner differences in students, so, too, must you accept that using one technique, one presentation format, one activity type, or one way of grouping students will not benefit all or even the greatest number of students (Oxford, 1993). For that reason, variety as a pedagogical device is necessary to meet the needs of the students; however, this variety should never entail unbridled eclecticism (Freeman & Freeman, 2001), but derive from a needs analysis of the students who make up each individual class. My first experience teaching ESL seemed to be a magical one; the students responded well to everything I tried and made incredible progress. The following semester, I taught the same course and was caught off guard when the same explanations I gave and activities I tried didn’t work as they had with the previous group of students. In some cases, I had to find a totally new way of explaining something or come up with a different activity altogether. In other cases, I simply had to be more explicit in my instructions or convince the students why I believed a particular task would help them. Part of the co-construction of knowledge, then, consists of your ability to speak with students about their learning styles and preferences, and to communicate what the purpose or motivation behind different activities is. It may also consist of your ability to reach outside the limits of your training and utilize a technique that may not be within the traditional confines of the communicative approach to language teaching when a student’s needs warrant. Thus, a participatory approach, while encompassing the basic precepts of a communicative approach may additionally, out of necessity, extend beyond the boundaries of a limited definition to respond to different needs that require different tactics.

Pilar, 25, Colombia: Effective is when you can get the better. The teacher so wants to help you learn more aspects and more vocabulary and pronunciation.

Kuniyoshi, 35, Japan: I think my teachers here are the best. Learning from them, I could really recognize that the study of language is not desk work.

Raul, 18, Mexico: I like Csilla best why because she tries to find ways so that we can learn better, like games, books, etc.

Miguel, 19, Mexico: We learn more English playing than studying and exams, etc. We learn more vocabulary playing with fun classes. With boring class we can’t learn. We have to do more activities.

Ji-Hyun, 27, Korea: In my country, they teach just grammar, and reading, with a little listening. That’s very boring.

# LOVE

It is doubtful that many teacher preparatory programs emphasize the importance of “love” in their curriculum, but Freire saw it as central to teachers’ praxis (Freire, 1970, 1994, 1997, 1998). Love implies many things in the classroom context, such as the commitment teachers have to their students and the students’ learning, as well as their dedication to the profession. In the student–teacher relationship, it can be manifested as quasi-parental love or friendship relative to the changing roles of the teachers’ fulfillment of the students’ needs. Students also recognize the importance of love, as indicated by their comments below. It can work in conjunction with humor to motivate students or, in some cases, they suggest that it may have a direct connection to learning although they are divided over whether this connection is specific to language learning or not.

Khaled, 18, United Arab Emirates: The first thing, in my opinion, to learn anything the teacher should make you love this class. If you hate it, you can’t study anything.

Suleyman, 20, Kuwait: Kevin is the best teacher here because he loves to teach and he wants to teach.

Osamu, 32, United Arab Emirates: I think it you have a tough teacher maybe you’ll hate his class. But if it’s funny, you will love the class. You will try to show the teacher and the rest of his class you are considerate of his class.

Suleyman, 20, Kuwait: I think not in the other subjects, but in language because the language is kind of new for us and we have to love this language. If I hate this language, I cannot learn.

# HUMOR

Carlos, 18, Mexico: My best language teacher was the assistant teacher of my last class yesterday. She was like so funny, but she explained everything good. You know, you learn more when something is funny.

In chapter 2, you considered the question of whether a new definition was necessary for effective language instruction. It was suggested that learning a language is somehow fundamentally different than learning other subjects. Though it is possible to make such an appeal on theoretical grounds, such as language as an innate quality is shared by all humans while the ability to comprehend calculus is not, the students view the distinction as more visceral.

Rie, 19, Japan: When we have fun in class, we enjoy the class. If you’re studying math class, math is not funny. It’s difficult.

Rosa, 47, Mexico: It’s something in the daily life. It’s good.

It is unclear what the exact relationship is between humor and language learn ing, however, but students suggest numerous possibilities for us to consider that situate humor within a developing framework for understanding and implementing effective language instruction. As with Rosa’s comment above, humor may be one element that helps to go beyond the experimental environment of the classroom, infusing a sense of the real and linking it to the external world.

Another possibility is that it functions as a device to maintain students’ interest, meeting students’ expectations about what makes instruction effective. Simultaneously, holding interest may translate into heightened intake on the part of the students as they are focused and don’t allow their attention to wane.

Khaled, 18, United Arab Emirates: Don’t make the students bored. You have some jokes—20 minutes, one joke—like salt in the food, something like that. The food without salt is not good, so to make good.

Walid, 23, Saudi Arabia: Grammar and reading I think is not serious, but the teachers should make the class fun. If they say, “Don’t have fun,” maybe we’ll sleep.

Daud, 19, Mauritania: Kid with me. I think that’s more important because if you are tired, that helps you.

Chul-Oh, 26 Korea: It also makes people more involved in the class.

Moreover, students’ natural ability to speak their native languages can lead to great frustration in the face of an inability to learn a second language quickly. To counter a feeling of language shock where students find themselves incapable of expressing what they believe to be their true identity through the new language, humor may be an essential element in the repertoire of an effective teacher.

Finally, humor may help to foster a more cooperative environment within the classroom. Thus, while a degree of competition may spur on some students’ learning, others may find that cooperative interaction alleviates pressure, thereby re ducing anxiety and enabling them to acquire more of the second language.

Barbara, 22, Bulgaria: Because I feel better when it’s funny, when there is no pressure between people in the class and it makes me feel more concentrated and do the best that I can.

Once again, though, students do not see the learning process as consisting of simply one thing. Like the teachers in the last chapter, they recognize that the engagement of their own learning calls for the variety that addresses individual learner differences. They also expect the teacher to approach the task of teaching with a certain degree of seriousness, just as they approach their task of learning.

Pilar, 25, Colombia: Probably if the teacher is funny sometimes, not all the time, but the class is more agile or more interesting and not monotonous.

Ali, 20, United Arab Emirates: But not always funny, all the time funny, you know.   
He has to do teaching.

Ahmed, 18, United Arab Emirates: If all the class is jokes, we will not learn because I think when all the classes are jokes, the students don’t care about them.

As we have seen with everything discussed to this point, effective language instruction should never be just one thing in isolation. Likewise, finding a balance in the classroom context between the amount of humor that facilitates language learning and that which becomes detrimental to it is a “gift” that you will want to cultivate. It offers rewards for both teachers and students since the ability to incorporate humor in the language classroom appears to have a beneficial effect on students’ learning.

# MUTUAL RESPECT

Daud, 19, Mauritania: She respects me and she is like my friend.

Osamu, 32, United Arab Emirates: If you feel this man respects you, you can have contact with him; you can share with him. I like that. But if you feel he does not respect you from inside, you will hate this man, so you cut all the connections that lie between you and him.

Dolores, 49, Mexico: In my opinion, if you respect people, they give you respect. My father always told me, “You respect the world, the world respect you.” And this is true.

The student–teacher relationship as outlined by the students does not differ from that of the teachers in the last chapter. It is a relationship of mutual respect where teachers’ engagement of professionalism and effective praxis does not exist in a vacuum. Rather, teachers take on the responsibility of changing roles in relation to the students’ changing needs. Within our matrix of a participatory approach, partaking in an open exchange of ideas through problem-posing brings about an awareness of which issues are of concern to students and which aspects need to be addressed in the students’ developing interlanguages.

Much as the teachers in the last chapter expressed the need for a reciprocal re spect between teachers and students, the students identify this additional aspect— combined with variety, love, and humor—as integral to their ability to take part in the business of learning language effectively.

Barbara, 22, Bulgaria: Everyone must be respected by the others and by the teacher and the teacher must be respected by the students, too. You feel better when someone tells you something good for you; you want to study more to show him that you won’t disappoint him and you improve your English.

Hiro, 22, Japan: She knows about each of us and I think she treats us properly.

Hamoud, 20, United Arab Emirates: You have to talk with the students to see what is the problem with student.

Saif, 19, United Arab Emirates: You must help the student and if the student has any problems or something like this, don’t make like war between the student and teacher. You must connect between the student and teacher and language.

Another characteristic of the respect that students expect from teachers has to do with teachers’ appreciation for the students’ diverse cultures.

Rie, 19, Japan: He understands Japanese culture, but he never talks Japanese. He also understands about Mexican culture and the Korean culture.

As was stated earlier, multiculturalism cannot be something that you, as an effective teacher, just teach or talk about, but it is something that you must live. In the numerous texts on critical pedagogy, it is abundantly clear that students’ keen awareness of a teacher’s sincerity resides in the correspondences between words and deeds; you have probably experienced what a mismatch feels like for yourself. Thus, embracing and living an ideology of multiculturalism while truly striving to make the classroom a more democratic environment goes a long way toward student participation and ultimate empowerment. This is not to suggest, however, that the classroom will deteriorate into utter anarchy, nor should you let it; students will look to you for guidance and expertise. It does mean that you respect students’ suggestions, choices, and efforts, allowing that they will not always succeed, nor will they always want to. Controlling every situation does not invoke respect nor ensure students’ participation in the process of learning language. A general rule of thumb, then, is that the less you do, the more students will.

Maria, 34, Mexico: If we have a teacher that doesn’t respect us, we can’t feel good in class and maybe we wouldn’t ask him or her for help.

Lucia, 25, Mexico: First of all, I think you have to learn about your different customs for people in the world, around the world. And second, it is very important that you have to understand that you are teaching to the class. They don’t want to know how much you know. “I’m a doctor; I have a masters.” We don’t care about it. We come here to learn. We don’t care if you know more than someone else.

Osamu, 32, United Arab Emirates: In our country, we usually just sit down and the teacher talks all the time. We do nothing. But Laurel wants us to share with her in the class, to speak together, discuss together, read together, sometimes find the main idea together. So all the time we share with her the class.

Transforming the classroom into a microcosm of a working democracy in the sense of critical pedagogy and a participatory approach, teachers are redefined from being storehouses of knowledge and authority figures to “teacher-learners” and participants in the learning process. As individuals who can also learn from their students as well as teach, they fulfill the many roles required to make them effective.

# PRAXIS

Earlier in the book, I defined praxis as the nexus of theory and practice. It has also been stated that the “ideal” for effective praxis exists when theory and practice inform and transform each other (Freire, 1970; Gore, 1993; Richards, 1990; Wright, 1990). From this standpoint, I would like to reaffirm that praxis is not a static entity, but as much a process as learning itself is—in fact, when we are engaging in truly effective and transformative praxis, we are learning. While employing different practices in the classrooms, you must maintain an active awareness of student reactions in order to determine what is working and what is not. Your awareness becomes a form of inquiry-based learning on your own part as you analyze and make adjustments to your praxis. Herein lies the essence of problem-posing; whether you are utilizing the process with your students or independently, you identify and name a problem, reflect on how it might be changed, and act to implement those changes. Acting upon the guidance of Freeman and Freeman (2001), you do not engage this inquiry in an eclectic manner, but make a conscious effort to improve your content and procedural knowledge to inform your practices. The four teachers in this book, for example, revealed their ongoing efforts to “update” and “renew” themselves through continued reading of current research, attending classes (content as well as teacher-related), and participating in developmental workshops and conferences. All these endeavors come together to inform and transform their praxis in an attempt to meet students’ needs.

In the comments assembled below, the students reveal the thoughts about teacher knowledge and technique they deem important. These indirect references to praxis mirror the teachers’ ideas about learning and teaching and focus on the pedagogical component, or “function,” of effective language instruction. For example, teachers are meeting expectations by being ready to approach the task of teaching language skills with content knowledge, suggesting that maintaining a focus on their students should also entail making use of their pre- and in-service development to address individual learner differences.

Yuliana, 17, Mexico: You have to be prepared and you have to know English very well.

Fawad, 27, Mauritania: Improving to your level or your method of teaching you have sometimes to listen to the students’ suggestions.

Another part of the students’ perceived notions about praxis has to do with making connections to the external world. To accomplish this task, you will need to link those language skills being learned to real communication, exposing students to the real-world language diversity they can expect in the larger second language community through guided practice. This brings us once again to the core of education for democracy and a participatory approach: Students’ voices are valuable and need to be part of the class.

Hiro, 22, Japan: In Japan, I hate learning English. Laurel teaches me what I don’t know about English, for instance how to use in my life.

Vivian, 20, Brazil: He helps you with what you have to do because when you come, you don’t know what’s better. He’s not tough in class, but he tells what you have to go through.

Yi Ling, 28, Taiwan: You can understand the situation because it’s two-way. You can fit the situation to the audience, so you can change your topic. I think you have to talk with your students and understand what they want to learn.

Ryuji, 30, Japan: These teachers teach how to express your mind or communicate with other people.

Jin Liang, 19, Taiwan: Dean encourages us to use our own way of thinking.

Ji-Yeol, 27, Korea: These teachers give students chances to speak their opinion.   
They always ask their students what they think.

As several of the foregoing comments suggest, bringing students from where they are to where they want to go is part of their learning process and life journey that you will have an opportunity to share in and influence. Regardless of students’ orientations toward the language itself, you can empower students to reach their individual language goals by fostering an environment that is supportive and conducive to learning. In this environment, you must also remember—and come to terms with the fact—that students have the unencumbered right to succeed or fail. Ultimately, then, one of your primary responsibilities is finding the balance that cultivates this type of classroom.

Hiro, 22, Japan: Laurel gives me place where we speak English. For example, in class she gives us many activities so we have to speak, but we can enter into speaking in class.

Saif, 19, United Arab Emirates: She’s fun sometimes. She’s not like a teacher, is not very serious. She’s like me sister, like mother.

Rumi, 21, Japan: She listens, whether we speak wrong English, but she listens.

Ali, 20, United Arab Emirates: They treat the students as friends which helps the students to open their hearts to the teachers.

Under praxis, we have briefly mentioned how language skills, individual differences, and real-world diversity begin to merge into an evolving model of effective language instruction. Within this last comment above, though, we start to see how students connect the remaining aspects that they identify in effective language instruction—variety, love, humor, and respect. It seems they perceive what might be referred to as “noncausal links” that lead to language learning. Consequently, students’ comments suggest that they believe humor in the language classroom helps to reduce negative affective factors that hinder second language acquisition, keeps them interested in the class, and makes them love the language. In turn, their love of the language and the respect that exists between them and the teacher translates into engagement in the class, as suggested in Fig. 5.1. Students will apply themselves more which facilitates, expedites, and enhances their learning of the language.

Ali, 20, United Arab Emirates: I saw a wonderful teacher, a funny teacher. You know, I love this subject.

Muhamad, 21, Qatar: To work hard, to study hard. If you like the English, you can learn with the English, but if you don’t like that language, you can’t do anything.

In the next three chapters, I present each of the “functions” of the emerging model for effective language instruction—pedagogical, environmental, and societal—in turn. At this point, however, I leave you with a statement that seems to sum up the answer to What Do Students Believe About Effective Language Instruction? while simultaneously differentiating between a “good” teacher and one who is truly effective:

![](img/7a775e51c2ab90b474b8e2ab2fea4dd21b511afed00db1f2890a7555f74ea557.jpg)  
FIG. 5.1. “Noncausal” links in effective language instruction.

Ji Won, 25, Korea: Every teacher here has good ability to teach but good teacher is rare because humanity is more difficult than teaching.

# Post-Reading Questions

Now that you have read this chapter, would you answer the following questions (from the Pre-Reading Questions) differently?

 Where and how might you be able to initiate a positive change with students in your praxis? In the classroom? In their lives?

List any modifications that you would make as a result of the reading.

Going back over the eight primary themes that emerged from the student interviews and questionnaires (i.e., Language Skills, Individual Differences, RealWorld Diversity, Variety, Love, Humor, Mutual Respect, and Praxis), are there any that surprised you? If so, which ones and why?

With the same group that you completed the Pre-Reading Questions, respond to the following issues and report your consensus back to the whole class:

 To what extent do you feel that the student themes match the teacher beliefs?   
 What seem to be the areas of the most agreement? Of the most disagreement?   
 To what extent do the themes forwarded by the students underscore the need for a new definition of effective language instruction from chapter 2?

# Reflective Journal

Considering the final comment by Ji Won, how do you think he would define “humanity”? Reflecting on your own learning experiences, in or out of school,

who would you consider to be your most “human” teacher? Is this person also the individual you named as your most effective teacher in your journal entry for chapter 1?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

With one partner, design a pictorial model (i.e., use geometric shapes or line drawings to represent abstract connections) for each of the following: (1) the eight areas of teachers’ beliefs (chapter 4) and (2) the eight student themes. Present your models to the class and discuss where and how the two models might inform one another.

# What Makes Pedagogy Effective? (The Pedagogical Function)

# Pre-Reading Questions

What things do you, as a teacher, need to know to be effective? Where does this knowledge come from?

To what extent do you need to bring yourself to the task of teaching, both in terms of commitment to teaching and as a human being?

How should you feel about teaching? About your students?

Refer back to the chart or Venn diagram you made at the end of chapter 4 of the skills and gifts associated with effective instruction. Are the items on your lists things that can be learned or acquired? Are they simply part of one’s nature? Is there anything one can do to achieve a good mix of skills and gifts in the quest of becoming more effective? With a partner, try to identify where these skills and gifts come from.

n this chapter, you will read about two teachers, Csilla and Laurel, whose effectiveness as language instructors was not only attested to by their students and teacher peers, but also recognizable in their interviews and obI servable in their classrooms. As you read through this chapter, focus on the pedagogical function—what teachers bring to bear as trained professionals who merge theory and practice in the constantly changing context that is the contemporary classroom. Also, consider how their approaches to ESL instruction do or do not embody a participatory approach where praxis is contextualized to meet the needs of students.

# “THE MOVIE DIRECTOR”

# Csilla

I think the word I would use to describe my relationship with my students would be facilitator—somebody who makes it relatively bearable for students to learn. Learning a language is hard and it involves a lot of things that are not especially pleasurable—memorizing words or practicing grammar, forcing oneself to do something that is embarrassing. So the goal of the relationship between me and my students is to make learning as pleasant and interesting to them as possible.

In the foregoing segment, Csilla’s sensitivity toward her students’ situations is evident. This sensitivity is clearly informed by her own experiences, first as a student majoring in English in her native Hungary, and later as an immigrant to the United States. Measuring at just over 5 feet tall, with shoulder-length blonde hair and glasses, Csilla’s petite stature is not imposing at all. At various points in my conversations with her, she described herself as a “facilitator,” a “party organizer,” and a “movie director.” It was clear throughout my observations of her teaching that Csilla had the flexibility to change her roles depending on the needs of the students and situations involved in the classroom.

From one of the first classes I observed during the fall of 1999, I noted that Csilla was adaptable and ready to change as the situation or climate of the class changed. At that time, she was teaching two classes. The first was called “Basic Skills.” This was a class for beginning level students and resembled a more typical ESL class in which all skills are integrated within a holistic educational experience where language is learned in context and somewhat incidentally. The second was called “Multiskills Workshop.” This class for low-intermediate students provided activities designed to expand vocabulary acquisition and enable students to connect the language they were learning across the curriculum to additional domains, both academic and nonacademic.

My initial impressions upon entering Csilla’s classes focused on the warm and comforting atmosphere. Both classes that she taught during the term I observed were for lower proficiency students. The supportive environment, therefore, seemed exactly what was called for, as it was highly likely that these students would experience a higher degree of anxiety based on their unfamiliarity with the language and relatively recent arrival to the United States. Her friendly attitude seemed to put the lower level students immediately at ease in order to overcome any anxiety they might have had based on their unfamiliarity with the language and culture. To me, this attempt to lower the students’ affective filter was not only part of Csilla’s modus operandi, but also went a long way toward empowering students to approach the task of learning English.

Csilla often reiterated the concept of advanced planning as central to her teaching. In her guise as “movie director,” she believed it absolutely essential to situate each lesson on both a micro level (i.e., what needed to be accomplished on a particular day) and a macro level (i.e., how any given lesson fit in terms of the broader curriculum). When asked what would constitute a bad class, Csilla re plied:

Something that is not interesting for the students, does not involve the students, and does not show an overall plan that goes beyond that particular class. I always think there should be a bigger picture. A class where the teacher is not in control—and when I say “control,” I don’t mean to be a control freak—I think the teacher is sort of like a director that plans everything out. The teacher plans and then lets the students do it. But if there isn’t a plan and the students don’t know what to do, there is confusion and everything is going out of hand. That would be a bad class.

As indicated by her own words, the concept of “control” does not imply absolute power for Csilla. Instead, she relates it to the amount of preparation required for an effective teacher to enter the classroom and meet the needs of the students. The best director needs to “step back” and let the actors’ talent and creativity take shape. Reflecting on her earlier ideas about teaching, Csilla said “I thought as long as I teach, I have all the control, but it’s such a much more creative process.”

Contrary to her early ideas about a transmission-oriented view of teaching, Csilla was able to identify that one of the most important things to be learned by engaging the teaching process is to step back and let the learning process happen. By releasing this presumed control, or power, students become empowered. They have their own reasons for studying the language and they need the freedom to explore those reasons in order to make the learning truly meaningful. An effective teacher’s task, then, is to prepare and implement a syllabus while recognizing that the job of learning lies with the motivation, talent, and goals of the students. In problem-posing fashion, Csilla identified what was ineffectual in her ideas about teaching. Aided by her own continued engagement of learning by continuing to take university classes, Csilla was able to reflect on the ineffectuality of this traditional approach. She then acted to change her own teaching praxis to make it more effective.

Her ability to utilize a participatory approach was also apparent in classroom observations. On several occasions, Csilla assigned roles to the students to review material. In dyads, one person would be delegated as “teacher,” the other as “student.” After a short period of time, she would ask the partners to switch roles, giving each student the opportunity to gain a different perspective on the learning process. In the manner of Bloomfield (1933), students were able to reinforce and demonstrate their knowledge by acting as a teacher to their peers. Likewise, in the Freirean manner, roles were redefined from the traditional position of teacher (in the traditional sense) as knower.

When necessary for clarity, Csilla modeled what the students needed to do. On those occasions, she would often share personal experiences. Throughout her shared stories, she would use lots of facial expression and give details. Often, she used pantomime to make her ideas clear. This type of modeling, then, served as an instructional device on several levels: The students learned content and vocabulary from Csilla’s stories and their comprehension of the directions was facilitated through a salient representation of what they were expected to do. Moreover, she brought the human side of herself to the classroom. The way the teacher approaches the classroom can make all the difference to the students in their learning process.

# “THE CHOREOGRAPHER”

# Laurel

My passion is dancing. Dancing is elemental. There’s a rhythm and a swoop and a creativity to it if the music is right. It’s freedom, power, creativity, grace, and joy, all at the same time. It’s timeless. When the dancing is at its best, the partner and me and the music all merge. There’s just a oneness. There’s an echo of that in the classroom, too. There’s definitely a dance of the classroom where activities and minds and moods ebb and flow and I get to play with that, balance it, tickle it.

Although the characterization “choreographer” was not the one that originated from Laurel herself, I felt justified in using it based on our discussion about passion. Even her appearance resembles that of someone from the world of dance. She could often be seen walking in a very determined manner down the hall with her head upright and her back straight, wearing a loose skirt and colored tights. Whereas “dancer” might immediately seem to be an obvious choice, I chose the related characterization for several reasons. When I directly asked Laurel about the relationship between dancing and teaching, she clearly noted that there were some differences for her as well. Indeed, she always explained what she wanted students to do, often modeling things for them to make directions and ideas clear. The activity and energy that embodied the classroom resulted from her arrangements of the students in all sorts of groupings for different activities. Variety and creativity were quintessential parts of every class. Thus, her outward appearance combined with my classroom observations led to my interpretation.

I first met Laurel in 1996 when I started teaching at the same institution. In one of the teachers’ offices, I occupied the cubicle adjacent to her. The first time I saw her desk, I recall referring to it as “organized chaos.” Though there appeared to be papers, books, and other implements associated with a teacher’s office all over the place, Laurel could easily identify which items were on the desk versus in the desk, and could readily locate any one of them upon request. My first exposure to her teaching some 3 years later gave me a similar impression. Many things were going on at the same time: there was a cacophony of voices coming from all directions, students were arranged in a variety of groupings, some were seated while others were moving about, and everything seemed to be in a state of chaos. Like Laurel’s desk, the organization was not immediately apparent, yet, upon closer inspection, it did exist. This time, however, I declined from my previous characterization and opted for the analogy of a “three-ringed circus.” The difference between her desk and the classroom was enjoyment. Students were smiling, some were laughing, and everyone was speaking English. The mood was joyful.

Herein it is possible to see the nature of the choreographer. Laurel was always creative, always willing to let students explore their talents. She provided them with the music, modeled the choreography, and let them dance. During and after class, she was supportive, encouraging, and ready to give well-deserved praise.

Another element I noticed about Laurel’s nature, at least as a teacher, was that she always remained in control. Again, like the earlier reference to control in conversations with Csilla, control wasn’t equivalent to dominating or overbearing. Instead, Laurel’s type of control was part of her awareness of both what students desired and what worked well for their learning process. Thus, rather than being imposing, she was constantly attentive, relative to the perceived and/or stated needs of the students. I recognized on numerous occasions how her teacher preparation informed her praxis. I often noted that she had very specific motivations for nearly everything she did. She was very methodical about how she organized the class and it rarely seemed that anything occurred that had not been accounted for or anticipated by her in at least some small way. Her preparation and planning calculated every possible move as if she were engaged in a large chess game.

To further emphasize Laurel’s control and awareness of the events in class, I had noticed throughout the course of my observations that there were occasions when she left the room for a few minutes while students were working on some group activity. With no apparent reason for her periodic departures—she never returned with additional materials or anything that would necessarily explain her move; I asked her about it one day. She confided that she purposely went out of the room. Feeling that students might be inhibited from talking when the teacher is in the room, she intentionally gave them the opportunity to talk more freely. This information added support to my earlier idea that she calculated every moment of the classroom experience.

Like Csilla, Laurel also shared her own personal experiences with students. During one class period, she started the class by telling a story about her own experience in Kazakhstan some years earlier. Through the narrative, she introduced and opened a discussion about the concept of culture shock. As both the teacher and advisor for the group she was teaching, she felt responsible for their adjustment to the new school and country, as well as the language and culture. By sharing her own story, she was able to get the students to open up and discuss some of their frustrations with the class, the school, and the city. Respectful of their differences and concerns about retribution, she found ways to enable all their voices to be heard. She asked the students to write something anonymously that they were angry about in that moment on a file card. This turned into an activity where students shared their complaints and frustrations with a partner. When the students finished the activity, having spoken with several different classmates, their tension had eased a great deal. During the activity, expressions of surprise and occasional laughter were observed. The recognition that others had experienced the same feelings and experiences diffused the anxiety.

# THE PEDAGOGICAL FUNCTION

The pedagogical function enables you, the language teacher, to meet your students’ expectations and to communicate what your own expectations of those students may be. Having a familiarity with different approaches to language instruction is essential, especially in cases where a student’s experience with prior language learning—positive or negative—may inform what that a student perceives to be the “right way” to teach. Herein, your familiarity with some of the students’ languages and cultures may be important; while it would be improbable for you, however, to become familiar with every possible language and culture in the contemporary multicultural ESL classroom, having had the experience of learning another language and culture by living in another country creates a sensitivity to the learning situation. Similarly, knowledge of how different cultures view teaching and learning can be relevant. Even when there may be a mismatch between your expectations and those of your students, it is essential that you explain how and why you believe a particular approach will work for students. Being proactive in this regard will help you to establish a partnership that a transmission-oriented approach—“do as I say because I’m the teacher”—will not.

Moreover, it is in and through the pedagogical function that theory and prac tice merge into praxis. As a well-prepared professional ESL instructor, you will be able to address students’ emotional (affective), cognitive, and psychosocial needs, as well as provide access to the skills necessary for their individual development. An understanding of the myriad individual differences and intelligences inherent in any given classroom enhances your developing and ongoing awareness and facilitates your ability to take the necessary steps to engage student learning.

It is, however, important to note that effectiveness does not solely derive from educational and clinical training. The human side of what you bring to the classroom is also relevant. Regardless of all the “book learning” you may have acquired, an inability to relate to students on their level can very well be your downfall. In other words, technical expertise is certainly valuable, but it cannot be equated with effectiveness when it comes to instruction. As one student put it:

Fawad, 27, Mauritania: I think in general a teacher needs to have the background— the knowledge to teach what he wants to teach. That’s the first thing. And the second thing is about psychology. His ability to talk to a student is important. The other thing is to listen to the student. He can’t just have background knowledge and say, “I’m better than the students. Do what I say.” I think for improving your level of teaching you sometimes have to listen to the students’ suggestions about what they need. You can make mistakes, but the most important thing is to look at your mistakes and to be responsible and, you know, next time, make some changes.

Students will recognize that you are the teacher and look to you for your expertise in helping them to achieve their goals. Keep in mind, however, the themes that students identified as necessary for effective language instruction in chapter 5: language skills, individual differences, real-world elements, variety, love, humor, mutual respect, and praxis. Separate from those that have been discussed here as parts of the pedagogical function, the others will be explored in more detail in chapters 7 and 8, respectively, as we define the environmental and societal functions in our emerging model.

How are the final comments made by the student, Fawad, supported or contradicted by the words of the teachers in this chapter? Do the teachers’ ideas seem to match Fawad’s ideas about what a teacher need to bring to the classroom? Why or why not?

How do you conceive of the relationship between teacher and students? Come up with your own analogy, such as those discussed in this chapter (i.e., movie director, choreographer, etc.).

Go back to the list of teacher roles identified at the end of chapter 4 by Scarcella and Oxford. Decide whether the multiple analogies given in this chapter fulfill some or all of these roles. How does your analogy measure up?

# Reflective Journal

Make a list of courses, experiences, etc. that you have had that detail what you, as a teacher, bring to the classroom as part of the pedagogical function; try to think

of the list in terms of skills and gifts. What are some areas that you could realistically develop to make your own teaching more effective?

How much of yourself do you put into the art of teaching? Do you see this as important? Why or why not?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Go back to your comparison of Scarcella and Oxford’s teacher roles and the multiple analogies given in this chapter. In a small group (4–5 people), discuss your responses. Share your own analogy with the group and together problematize the teacher–student relationship you forwarded. Are there any areas you can identify as a group that may be imbedded with preconceived notions that you were previously unaware of?

# How Do Teachers and Students Relate in the Classroom? (The Environmental Function)

# Pre-Reading Questions

In your experience as a student, how important is it to you that you like your teacher? How important is it that you like your fellow students? How do you choose whom you will sit beside or whom you will work on various projects with? Have you ever really given it much thought?

Find a partner in your class whom you don’t know well or at all, have never worked with before, or simply “seems” different from you. Get together with him or her and compare your answers to the set of questions above. Where are there commonalities and differences in your responses?

Define the following:

 Power   
 Order   
 Empowerment

Compare your responses with your partner. To what extent do they match? How would you distinguish the relationship between power and empowerment?

typical “ice-breaker” activity in an ESL class begins by providing   
A students with a handout that instructs them to look for someone who shares certain qualities with them. Thus, students get out of their seats and proceed around the room asking different people questions related to the items listed on the handout, for example, “Do you like to read?”,   
“Do you have a pet?” The aim of this activity is not just to get students to use the   
target language, but also to have them feel more comfortable in the class by get

ting to know one another and identifying classmates who share common interests. Ideally, this will lead to students working together with others who do not necessarily share the same first language and culture.

In the last chapter, you were asked to reflect on individual learner differences from a theoretical pedagogical perspective; that is, how can teaching be modified to enhance learning? In the current chapter, try to focus on how those individual differences could operate on the level of human interaction. In this chapter, you’ll be asked to focus primarily on what happens inside the classroom. Ultimately, in addition to the awareness you need to develop about the multiple factors affecting second language acquisition, the several needs and desires of your students, the array of different techniques that can be employed within a communicative approach, and the numerous external contextual elements that add to the dynamic nature of the classroom, it is in this environment where you most directly interact with learners. To that end, you will have the opportunity to get to know Kevin better. Again as you read, decide the extent to which you find Kevin’s praxis compatible with a participatory approach based on your understanding of it up to this point.

# “THE COACH”

# Kevin

With my students, we do dialogue journals through e-mail and I usually sign off as “Your teacher and friend.” And I think that about sums it up. I’m their teacher and I also consider them as friends of mine and treat them accordingly. My point is that instead of seeing these individuals in our classes as students and only students, I realize that’s just one component of their being and the time they spend here in this classroom is just maybe one or two hours out of their whole day. This is just a brief period of time in their whole life. They have a history and a background and they’re total individuals. That’s what needs to be respected. The fact that I’m a teacher doesn’t make me better than them or someone who can wield authority over them. You need to respect their life and their history. Try to listen to them carefully and accept their ideas without being judgmental. Give them opportunities to express their opinions and don’t be critical of their opinions.

One theme that is prevalent in Kevin’s teaching as well as his comments above is the recognition of students as individuals with lives that extend beyond the classroom. Thus, he couples his love of teaching with respect for his students and achieves the goal of the environmental function: finding a balance within the classroom. This commences by meeting students’ expectations with the incorporation of the pedagogical function in a unique way; he establishes a framework of classroom procedure where the sequencing of activities almost always follows the same patterning. Students quickly become familiar with the routines and don’t need to wait at the end of each activity to find out what happens next. Without prompting, the class appears to proceed seamlessly from one activity to the next.

In my early observations of Kevin’s classes, I was somewhat surprised at the rigid sequencing which, from a superficial perspective, is very repetitive. What I began to realize at length was that students both enjoyed and progressed within the recurring structures. Like the appellation given above, the good coach gives his team “plays” that they memorize and eventually know so well that they don’t need to think about them any longer. Instead, the team members are able to stay focused on the immediate action, work together, be creative, and perform at their peak without getting weighed down in lengthy and convoluted explanations. In any case, the setting up of activities within the classroom is not where learning happens; it is in the activities.

On those occasions when Kevin does need to set up a new activity and give some instruction, his explanations are clear and concise and accompanied with a model that usually enables students with different learning styles to comprehend readily what is expected. One way that he manages to reduce the time on giving directions is by situating new activities within the context of the other exercises that students have done or are about to do. Thus, by linking activities, exercises, tasks, etc., students are able to activate relevant schemata and predict how skills and content fit together.

One of the effects that emerges from the “rigid” structure is that there is seldom any noticeable lag between the various components of the class. Whereas many classes taught by good teachers can be observed to have clearly identifiable breaks between activities, Kevin’s class moves rapidly. It is a rarity to find a student not engaged in learning in some form or another. Even on those occasions when interaction seems to digress from the business at hand, it never gets far afield and usually manages to serve some other purpose in maintaining the balance of the environmental function. While it is always evident that Kevin has a well-defined and organized plan for each class, he acknowledges the necessity for having what he calls a “teacher’s awareness,” which allows for making instantaneous changes as warranted within his structured framework.

# Kevin

If something doesn’t work, usually I’ll terminate it or change it. I think I’m pretty aware of the energy in a classroom and whether students are running with it or not. And if they’re not, I’ll just tell them, “I don’t think this is happening, so let’s do something different,” and they’ll probably say “Good.” They usually know when something is not happening, too. Sometimes, noise level is a good indicator; if they’re supposed to be working together as a group or in partners and it’s really quiet. I think it’s maybe also a feel for energy and trying to be generally aware instead of going into a class and saying, “Okay, I’ve got to do this; this is my agenda and this is what we’re doing.” Instead of steamrolling through, you have to be open and aware.

When describing the environment, Kevin sums up several “common denominators” that find a balance within the classroom and enable students to flourish.

# Kevin

Teaching should be something that’s really practical for the students. These sound really basic, but classes shouldn’t be boring; they should be interesting. They should contain material and information that the students can use practically and they can take out of the classroom that day and use. And make it fun; make it enjoyable. Make it an experience where students can get to know each other and enjoy each other. When I would think about what was a good class and what was a bad class, what was successful and what was not, the common denominators were things like it was interesting; it was fun; it was active. The students performed. The teacher didn’t stand up there and talk forever. I guess any class where I felt that I had dominated the class would be a real bad class . . . a class where I had performed more than the students had or I had performed more than I felt I should . . . a class where I felt the students didn’t really learn anything that they could use.

The quintessential aspect in the description above is the realization of the student-centrality, a key component of a communicative approach, in Kevin’s classroom environment. It is not only evident in his discussion of effective praxis, but is also embodied in his classes through the use of students’ languages when possible, the recognition given to their languages and cultures when appropriate, the incorporation of their ideas into the class routines, and the acknowledgment of their contributions to the class. To sum up, Kevin’s teaching strikes a balance between many elements, at times seemingly contradictory. His classes can be described as both planned and free, successfully bringing together effective praxis with students’ creativity in a joyous atmosphere where mutual respect and appreciation exist.

# Kevin

I like working with foreign students. I like the exposure to different languages and different cultures and different viewpoints. It helps me from becoming too narrow minded and ethnocentric. Instead of seeing these people as students and only students, I realize that that’s just one component of their being and this is just a brief period of time in their whole life. They have a history and they have a background and they’re total individuals. That’s what needs to be respected.

# Laurel

I would describe my relationship to my students as an ally. I don’t think I would come up with a better word that describes how I feel about it. These are adults I’m dealing with. They have complete life histories coming into my classroom. They’ve got unique personalities and goals and hopes and blocks and the best I can hope to do is get to know them as well as I can in the short time we’ve got together in order to be an effective ally in their going where they want to go and learning what they want to learn. That’s my job.

# THE ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION

As with the pedagogical function and its enactment in effective language instruction, it is important for you to begin to appreciate that the various functions, though discussed independently of one another up to this point, do not work in isolation. Just as we defined praxis as the merging of theory and practice, and teaching in light of the multiple roles a teacher must fulfill, so, too, do the functions combine in the development of a model for effective language instruction. Within this section, I present some of the various components of the environmental function. In the ensuing discussion, try to imagine where and how the environmental function might intersect with the pedagogical function and the societal function dealt with in the next chapter.

It has been claimed that the multicultural ESL class is a microcosm of society, abounding with the diversity that exists in the world outside the classroom. The individual differences of the people interacting in this context—teacher and students alike—is representative of the external world and provides an excellent setting for practicing language that students will be expected to use outside the classroom environment. Multiculturalism, however, is not merely fostered solely through the interaction of teacher and students, but in the interaction of students with one another and in their appreciation of each other’s languages and cultures. This requires constant vigilance on your part as students often have a tendency to sit next to and engage in pair activities with others who speak the same language. While it is always preferable to have students choose their own partners for tasks and activities, there is nothing amiss with asking them to choose someone who speaks a different first language or with whom they have never worked before.

As you have probably surmised by now, the individual differences I am referring to here do not stop at the pedagogical view of how second language acquisition proceeds and the myriad factors that can foster or deter that acquisition; I am integrating a level of individual differences that addresses the human interaction alluded to in the discussion of Kevin’s and all the teachers’ relationships with their students, for beyond the familiarity you may have with various approaches and methods of language teaching and a series of techniques that can be employed, there is something about effectiveness that surpasses the merely procedural. Moreover in your integration of the theoretical in your praxis, you must learn to interpret any research you read as representative, but not comprehensive. That is, while quantitative studies are conducted to be generalized to entire populations, the reality of the human condition and the acceptance of a naturalistic paradigm requires that you appreciate the uniqueness of each individual; no two students are alike, even if they speak the same language, share the same culture and language, and come from the same country. If you grew up with siblings in the same household, raised by the same parents, you would still willingly accept that you are very different. So, too, must you recognize and accept this reality for your students.

Think back to the chapters on what teachers and students believe about effective language instruction. While no one questions that teachers need to have a background that prepares them with content knowledge and methodological approaches to teaching, to be truly effective requires more.

[T]he task of the teacher . . . is both joyful and rigorous. It demands seriousness and scientific, physical, emotional, and affective preparation. It is a task that requires that those who commit themselves to teaching develop a certain love not only of others but also of the very process implied in teaching. It is impossible to teach without the courage to love . . . (Freire, 1998, p. 3)

Beyond this love of the students they teach and the act of teaching itself, teachers and students agree that the student–teacher relationship must be one of mutual respect. Epitomized in Kevin’s words toward the beginning of this chapter, Freire’s critical pedagogy guides a participatory approach through the merging of the many strands introduced earlier, namely the recognition and appreciation of students’ lives and experiences prior to and outside of the class, the addressing of individual learner differences, the student-centered focus of a communicative approach to language teaching, and the recognition of multiple subject positions and ways of knowing in multicultural education. Ultimately, students’ voices are a key to effectiveness in a participatory approach, for, without them, instruction becomes little more than a “hit or miss” endeavor where the best laid plans may follow the syllabus or book, but do little to meet the needs of your students.

# A Note on Participation

In chapter 1, we saw an example of problem-posing when Laurel asked her students to identify some problems they were having with what they perceived to be too much homework. Through open discussion and a willingness on her part to give students a voice, a solution was obtained that all parties could agree upon. The value of including students in the decision-making process cannot be stressed enough. The very essence of problem-posing is engaging in a negotiation process where a shared outcome results. If you as a teacher decide that only your opinion counts and you will make all the final and important decisions, the whole nature of a participatory approach is undermined and students will get a lesson in democracy that you had not bargained for—one where their role is irrelevant and where only the powerful can make choices.

I have often heard teachers suggest that giving students input into the syllabus, grading, and classroom procedure undermines their role in the class and can lead to utter chaos. In my own experience, however, I have not found this to be the case and there is a vast difference between maintaining order and wielding power. Power, in reality, is not ordained, but granted by students who want to learn from you. It is their willingness to participate in the learning process that enables you to maintain order when things get too off task. Furthermore, as we have seen from the chapter on what students believe effective language instruction should include, they want and fully expect teachers to be in charge of the class, but this can never be at the expense of denigrating those same students who look to you for guidance. Thus, as Laurel engages problem-posing to learn about students’ views, as Kevin laughs at his students’ jokes, as Dean appreciates students’ pointing out his mistakes, and as Csilla asks students to take on the role of the teacher, the empowerment of students comes from the inclusion of their voices in the context of the classroom to demonstrate the respect teachers have for them (Shor, 1987b, 1996).

# Post-Reading Questions

Return to your definitions of power, order, and empowerment from the beginning of this chapter. How would you alter your definitions based on your understanding of this chapter and in an effort to achieve mutual respect within the environmental function?

In chapter 6, you were asked to come up with your own analogy for the relationship between teachers and students. Can you refine your analogy to include new information about the classroom environment from this chapter? What, if any, modifications need to be made?

# Reflective Journal

To what extent do you engage in multiculturalism in your school life? In your life outside of school?

How much of yourself do you reveal in your teaching? Do you see this as important? Why or why not?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

In a small group (4–5 people), make a list of tasks and activities that you could employ to foster interaction and mutual respect between students.

Brainstorm some typical issues for problem-posing that students might have (N.B. Try to include both general student issues and those specific to English language learners). To get you started, you may consider some issues of inequity from your own life, from your current class, or with another student. Present these to your teacher and class, and engage in problem-posing to come to a shared understanding and a mutually agreeable resolution. Afterward, reflect on the process and decide how it worked for you. Are there any elements that could have been changed to make the process more effective?

# What Does Instruction Mean for Students? (The Societal Function)

# Pre-Reading Questions

Many words in common usage have a more specific and limited use in academic and professional contexts. With that in mind, how would you imagine the following terms are intended for the ESL classroom?

 Authentic materials  Real communication  Simulated task

Do you consider a classroom a “natural” or “clinical” environment? Think about the purpose of language instruction as it is conceived through a communicative approach to language teaching and attempts to foster a communicative competence. Discuss your responses with the whole class and see if you can come to a consensus.

In groups of about four people, brainstorm some ideas for the following:

 What can you as a teacher do to make the microcosm of the classroom reflect the macrocosm of the external society?   
 How would your understanding of students’ language orientations enable you to make your ESL instruction more effective?

Tmost ignored components of effective praxis in the ESL classroom. It issimultaneously the key to meeting students’ needs and a fundamentalelement in a participatory approach. Through the societal function, the fulfill the stated goals of an approach, but to make connections between the microcosm of the classroom and the macrocosm of the external world. As part of a participatory approach, the classroom itself serves as a safe and supportive place where students can identify and reflect on their needs and problems in the external world in order to practice how to resolve them actively. This rehearsal can ultimately translate into the transformation of the external world toward a more democratic and socially just society. There is one caveat worth mentioning, however; you should never confuse the artificial environment of the classroom with the outside world. While the institution of “school” and all that it entails is intended as a means by which to prepare students for future life, school has a culture all its own with its own interactional patterns, discursive style, and power relations. Through a participatory approach, though, you can use this artificial space to achieve its intended purpose: as a practice ground where simulated tasks can facilitate future encounters with real events. In this chapter, you will meet the final teacher, Dean, more closely and hear about the several teachers’ recognition that their students language orientations are typically not identical to their own and what they do to adjust their instruction to their students.

# “THE MANAGER”

# Dean

I suppose I’d liken my relationship to my students as a manager to the work crew of a profit sharing plant. We’re both going to share in the good things that come from completing this task as completely as possible. I’m going to feel good because what they’re going to get is an ability to communicate in English and that’s their reward.

Always acutely aware of the potential for disparity between teachers’ and students’ goals, paths, and motivations, Dean continually strives to make his classes challenging and useful for his students. He accomplishes this feat by gearing his instruction toward students’ immediate and long-term plans and incorporating activities that will help students to achieve both.

# Scenario

In Dean’s advanced level business English class, the primary activity for today is the preparation for an interview. After having read an article about whether someone should be in business for himself or herself, students are to imagine themselves as reporters for a business publication interviewing someone on his or her suitability as an entrepreneur. Students will be required to find an American informant to respond to their questions; however, the purpose of this period is to prepare their questions and try them out on partners in class in a simulated interview. This activity takes a good portion of the class, but students are engaged, talking and laughing as they share information about their own lives and cultures. The use of English is consistent, but almost incidental as meaning is negotiated through the interactions and students stay focused on their intended goal of gathering information to make their reports.

One of the first things that can be readily noticed in Dean’s class is the repeated use of authentic materials. Within the context of ESL, “authentic materials” refer to those that are specifically created for native speakers of English rather than anything that may have been simplified or otherwise modified for educational purposes. Dean often begins classes with articles from local newspapers, thereby incorporating authentic materials of particular interest as an opportunity to engage in problem-posing. By understanding that most students’ language orientations are not equivalent with language teachers’ and linguists’, he keeps students’ attention on real issues so that they can acquire language incidentally. Language becomes the means of communication rather than the focus of study. It also functions as a way to negotiate culture as students learn about local and current events with relevance to their lives.

By reading authentic materials and problem-posing in the classroom, Dean’s students not only became aware of issues, but had the opportunity to discuss them openly and attempt to identify solutions to some of the challenges they might face outside the classroom. In one example, a conversation ensued about sexual harassment. Students’ interest in this issue led to the discussion of some of the stereotypes people have about gender roles. Students were able to explore American culture through direct examination and comparison to their own cultural beliefs and attitudes. Another cross-cultural dialogue enabled students to evaluate the nature of multiculturalism and discrimination. By bringing in their experiences from their own countries, multiple subject positions were presented, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of American culture through the comparison of different perspectives. Finally, one of the topics that peaked student interest was the availability of financial aid and tutoring on campus. As the majority of these international students had come to the intensive English program to prepare for their admission to the university, they were especially interested in learning about any assistance and services they might take advantage of upon admittance. In all of these cases mentioned, students engaged in meaningful communication about important issues that prepared them and connected them to their future needs outside the classroom. It is also important to mention that they were not overtly preoccupied with the learning of English in these discussions, but in co-constructing meaning and learning about the issues.

# Laurel

Anything that I’m interested in in my life and anything the students are interested in becomes grist for the mill. We’re not limited to a certain corpus of information or knowledge as one might seem to be or feel when one is teaching another subject.

We’re teaching language here. All sorts of things can happen in language including getting to know one another—a very necessary language goal. I’ve had students give speeches in class about the most phenomenal things that I wouldn’t have learned about otherwise, so the subject matter is life. And there’s no more interesting question in life than how and why people change.

Another effective feature of Dean’s instruction is the inclusion of meaningful simulated activities. Engaging students in various simulations, such as mock interviews, presentations, note-taking, and incorporating text into writing, link the microcosm of the classroom to the real world. Not only are these tasks outwardly useful for individuals who intend to major in business and eventually enter the business world, but also preparatory for the types of interactions these collegebound students will encounter in the university environment. The value of the simulations and the overall learning process is heightened by combining these activities with natural language, including everyday idioms, slang, and—in this case—business jargon. That is to say, the natural language utilized in effective language instruction must be specifically relevant to the students involved. Thus, students become familiar with real communication that they will be exposed to outside the ESL class and in their future lives when encountering native English speakers.

A final important note regards feedback. Because the classroom serves as a practice space for the type of performance students will ultimately engage in beyond the classroom, they need clear indication of how they are doing. Dean’s feedback to students is always instructive and facilitative. Rather than simply telling them what their mistakes are, he indicates where they should look in their work or leads them through a guided discussion. In this manner, students are able to find their own mistakes—a skill that will benefit them immeasurably in their future. To further build this capacity, he occasionally has students working with partners to find their mistakes, increasing their support of one another and decreasing their dependence on the teacher. These practices also fulfill the expectations of a participatory approach where students don’t only learn from the teacher, but from each other; similarly, students can function as teachers in the classroom to assist their classmates and further instill their own learning process.

# THE SOCIETAL FUNCTION

The final function in the emerging model for effective language instruction involves your ability to make connections between what occurs in the classroom context and how it will benefit students in their future lives. Although these connections may sometimes be obvious, such as future businesspeople becoming familiar with interviewing, others may be less obvious. Part of your job, then, is to mediate the pathways between the microcosm and the macrocosm for your students. This will require both a good deal of introspection and awareness—introspection in terms of your own teacher preparation and praxis and awareness of the moment-to-moment fluctuations within the classroom context. Herein, we can see the overlap of the societal function with both the pedagogical and environmental functions in effective language instruction.

Personal introspection (i.e., reflection) into your own pedagogy will keep your instruction fresh, innovative, meaningful, purposeful, and effective (Richards & Nunan, 1990). It also gives you the opportunity to practice what you teach: problem-posing. Thus, you engage in questioning the efficacy of your own praxis to ensure that students are receiving the kind of instruction that is necessary and appropriate to their needs. You are also able to distinguish between which activities are meeting purely pedagogical aims, which are preparing students for life outside the classroom, and which are accomplishing both. By pedagogical, I am referring to those activities which are self-serving to the learning process, to the clinical context of the classroom. While this definition does not need to be construed as negative—indeed, English language learners preparing to enter university will need to be familiar with academic expectations—you still need to be aware of this fact and explain it to your students. An example would be to preview a list of vocabulary words before reading. Although this is certainly helpful to many students in terms of activating background knowledge, it is a “student” task, not one you would encounter outside of a school environment. Think about the last time you heard about someone giving out a vocabulary list prior to reading a medical report, business prospectus, or supermarket circular.

Linking with the environmental function, the societal function requires that you maintain your awareness of the changes that occur within the classroom to address external needs. For instance, imagine that some recent event involving a particular ethnic, religious, or cultural group causes a change that results in negative attitudes of some type of social unrest outside the classroom. Because you and your students do not live within the confines of the class, it is possible (indeed probable) that emotions could run high within the classroom as well. By engaging in problem-posing, you can expose feelings that students may be suppressing and that could potentially stand in the way of their learning. It may be necessary for you and your students to undertake the process more than once and it may not bring about any resolution of the problem; however, by initiating a dialogue, students can begin to develop an “other awareness”—an awareness of the subject positions of classmates that can eventually lead to understanding.

An additional benefit of self-reflection through the societal function is that it will develop your general understanding of different language orientations. Recognition of different language orientations similarly feeds back into effective praxis by helping you to make informed decisions about pedagogical choices and the kinds of interactions you have with your students.

# A Note on Language Orientations

The discussion of language orientations emerges from the work of Ruiz (1984). Essentially, three orientations toward language have been forwarded. These are separately identified as language as the aim of study; language as the medium of communication; and language as the mediator of culture.

# Dean

We teachers are interested in words for words’ sake. Our students are just not that way. They’re trying to get their engineering degree and they don’t give a damn where the derivation of “pickle” comes from. They want to be able to pass the test and go home and get rich. So that’s another mistake that I think a lot of ESL teachers make; they think that the students are as interested in language as we are and, you know, for most of them it’s just not that interesting. They want to know how to survive in school. I tend to guard against thinking my students have the same interests as I do and I don’t want to spend too much class time on it because that kind of language and information is not going to help them get through school.

# Csilla

For most of the students, English is not a goal; it’s a tool. For me, it was a goal—I mean, in a way it was a tool because I use English to teach. But for me, being perfect in English was part of being an English teacher. If you are a dancer, you have to stand on your toe, but if you are an engineer and you want to learn about dancing, you don’t necessarily have to stand on your toe. I see the language as a tool for many of my students and they suffer from it. Sometimes they are mad and they say, “I need this English to be able to get into medical school or engineering school.” For them, it’s a hurdle they have to jump over, but not the goal itself.

The preceding comments indicate that effective language instructors are aware of the differences between language orientations, suggesting that the orientations that we as applied linguistics and language teachers possessed in order to pursue our ambitions may not be appropriate for the way we actually teach our students. Dean’s reference to an interest in words for words’ sake epitomizes the individual with a future in some aspect of linguistics. Such a person is interested in the study of language, often perceiving that as an end in itself. Herein, we can see that it is possible on one occasion to observe a great divergence between a participatory approach and a prototypically communicative approach. Though it is highly unlikely that you would ever encounter an entire class of students with a “language as the aim of study” orientation, it is worth noting that your insistence on fostering a communicative competence in your students would produce a mismatch that could ultimately hinder learning.

Fong, 18, Taiwan: If you become familiar with a new language, you get some helpful tools. I think it is best to read Kafka in German and to read Camus in French because only the native language of the author expresses his ideas accurately. I want to learn more languages to improve my understanding of literature.

In Fong’s case, language may serve as a “tool,” but she is clearly interested in the study of language for its aesthetic value (i.e., for its own sake). Undertaking a grammar–translation methodology would probably serve her better than pushing communicative aims. A participatory approach and the engagement of problemposing would enable you to detect this orientation early on so as to avoid teaching and learning goals at cross-purposes.

On the other hand, one reason that communicative approaches have been so successful in ESL classes in the United States is precisely because the majority of students who study the language do have the second orientation: language as the medium of communication.

Raul, 18, Mexico: They have to teach you the language in order to communicate.

Mai, 23, Taiwan: When I’m here in the United States, I have to use English to communicate with others.

Whether international students intent on commencing a program of academic study toward the completion of a degree or immigrant students trying to start a business, get a job, or go about their daily lives in a new culture, the preponderance of students in second language classrooms do not see the language as an end, but as a beginning, a catalyst for opening up a whole new world of possibilities to them. Thus, language study and the time it requires becomes more of a “necessary evil” and oftentimes an obstacle than a desired stage of personal growth. Treating this orientation with sensitivity, sharing love and humor and showing students the respect they deserve translates into a rewarding experience for all participants.

The final orientation is one in which language acts as the mediator of culture. Although it may be suggested that this is always true from a sociolinguistic perspective, we would be presuming too much upon our students to think that they proceed from this point of view. Instead, this language orientation refers specifically to those individuals who show an express interest in interacting with other cultures and using language as a bridge to develop a keener understanding of them, as in the following excerpts.

Hyejin, 28, Korea: If I didn’t understand the culture, I couldn’t completely and wholly learn the language which is used in the culture.

Kyung, 20, Korea: At first, language was made by people who also made culture. Most languages include their own culture, so, as language learners, we can learn culture.

As indicated in chapter 3, factors affecting second language acquisition and individual learner differences create situations where you, as an effective language instructor, will need to adapt your praxis to accommodate different students’ needs. Though language orientations have been alluded to in different parts of the book, the choice to present them here is based on the recognition that they present a factor that mediates not only the three functions of the emerging model of effective language instruction, but also, and more specifically, because they reconcile the practice space of the second language classroom, the purpose for study, and the nature of language to be used outside.

# Post-Reading Questions

In your own words, write out a brief explanation of the differences between an activity done for purely educational purposes (“school oriented”) and one done for external, real-world purposes (“real-world oriented”). What, if anything, would you expect to be the differences in terms of your directions and explanations to students, the concomitant student perceptions of the value of the activity, and the degree of engagement and motivation the students have to remain on task? How might you alter your manner of communicating about either to maintain a high level of student involvement?

Review the classification of factors affecting second language acquisition from chapter 3. Would you place the language orientations within this framework? If so, would you situate them under one of the subcategories previously given or create a new one? Elaborate your reasons.

# Reflective Journal

Complete the following statement:

I think learning language is like . .

What clues about your own language orientation are suggested by the way you completed the statement? What would you have said about your own language orientation if you had been asked that question first? To what extent do you think recognizing and understanding your own orientation will help you to become a more effective language instructor?

# Follow-Up Activities: “Exploring Your Beliefs”

Think about the last assignment you gave or were given. Was it more “school oriented” or “real-world oriented”? Why do you think so?

With a group of 2 to 3 classmates, return to the activities or tasks designed to foster interaction and mutual respect that you identified in the Follow-Up Activities from the last chapter. Work together to create a chart, diagram, or other pictorial representation to indicate how and where these activities would take place outside the classroom and in which contexts they might be appropriate. Which of the language orientations do they seem to be linked with?

# A Brief Review (The Effective Instruction Model)

# Pre-Reading Questions

How would you summarize each of the functions—pedagogical, environmental, and societal? Write a brief definition and compare it with another classmate. Together, make any alterations you deem necessary to develop a clearer, more complete definition. When you have finished, join another pair and repeat the same process.

In your group of four, discuss and decide where you would situate the several themes students identified as necessary for effective language instruction from chapter 5. Does the inclusion of this information within the framework of the functions help you to determine how and where the functions overlap? See if your group can design a schematic to illustrate the interaction of the various elements.

# THE PEDAGOGICAL FUNCTION

The pedagogical function serves to meet educational expectations. Students and teachers have beliefs about language and learning that do not always coincide. Students’ expectations result from their beliefs based on their previous learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom. Thus, prior good and bad learning experiences inform their opinions about their individual learning styles and the most effective approaches and methods to address those learning styles and to determine how language learning should proceed. They are further informed by notions about which language skills are necessary to achieve their goals and orientations toward the language (i.e., how learning the language will serve them).

Teachers’ expectations similarly emerge from their own experiences as learners. However, teachers additionally incorporate their multiple spheres of belief about language learning, language teaching, the instructional program, the profession, and the student–teacher relationship, all influencing their previous experiences. Furthermore, teachers incorporate relevant research and practice from their teacher education to develop effective praxis. Part of this knowledge includes understanding the integration of language skills in the learning process, the individual learner differences that can enhance or inhibit that process, and the importance of variety in instruction to address those differences.

Within a participatory approach, you will need to apply problem-posing to get at the underlying beliefs that both you and your students possess, reflecting on your praxis, giving clear explanations to students, and making modifications when and where they are warranted.

Batu, 21, Mongolia: The teacher that shows the best way to study and learn, gives activities, works for us, and teaches us what he knows, what is necessary for us to know and learn so we have a good English to work, study, live.

Pilar, 25, Colombia: She has many abilities, many things to teach English.

Daud, 19, Mauritania: She likes to help everybody and if I don’t know the answer to her question, she doesn’t tell me every answer. She lets me have time.

Yuki, 20, Japan: His teaching is clear. I studied the same subject before, but I couldn’t understand about that. But he teaches that again so I can understand.

Walid, 23, Saudi Arabia: When I answer something that may be wrong, he encourages me.

Alicia, 40, Mexico: The teacher should make the students feel self-esteem because when the people are learning in language they feel “as a baby” and with a sense of frustration.

Ahmed, 18, United Arab Emirates: To make the class more interesting and the students like the class. For example, I like her class more than all the classes because it is a class of many kinds of activity.

# THE ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION

Within the environmental function, the student–teacher relationship is most poignant. It is in this interaction zone that teachers’ theory and practice not only merge into praxis, but come into direct contact with the true test of instruction: to see if teaching can be translated into learning. Moreover, teachers’ and learners’ beliefs meet “face to face”; any disparities must be addressed and resolved if effective instruction is going to take place. Within a participatory approach, resolution can be achieved through problem-posing, but problem-posing cannot achieve its intended aims if it merely serves as a device for teachers to explain what they expect students to do. Truly critical teachers may enlist students to try something that is not necessarily in line with their system of belief about “traditional” learning, but must also be willing to be self-reflective, accept that their suggestions will not always work, and accept that students’ ideas are also worth trying. An open mind and the willingness not to insist upon being the only “correct” voice define the basis of mutual respect. Ultimately, then, the overarching theme of the environmental function is finding a balance within the classroom.

Within attempts to find a balance, effective tools are embodied in the pedagogical “skills” and human “gifts” that you, as an individual, bring to the classroom. Your skills include your familiarity with and ability to diagnose and respond to individual learner differences, as well as regard for the diversity inside your classroom and the exterior world that learners will be operating in with their new language.

Yi Ling, 28, Taiwan: I think, for a good language teacher, experience is very important. Many countries have many teaching styles. If you want to be a good teacher, you can go to many countries to know how they teach their students. Or learn something you can learn; don’t just stay in your country.

Being truly effective requires that you maintain a “meta-awareness” when engaging in your praxis. Although travel may not always be possible as Yi Ling suggests, there are many ways to inform yourself about other cultures. Thus, not only do you need to develop acumen in the learning process itself, but also in the multicultural factors that can moderate student response to that process (e.g., differences in culture, educational culture, and ways of knowing).

Another form of balance that you need to locate within yourself is that between teacher and person. Effective language teachers are not automatons that seem to disengage their individual humanness when they enter a teaching mode—such a shift away would inhibit their ability to remain in the moment and allow them to gauge how well activities are going and whether they need to be modified or simply dropped. Indeed, you want to ensure that you are being pedagogical without being pedantic. This can be achieved through your gifts. Although the gifts you bring to the classroom may vary to a certain extent from person to person, they refer to the more humanistic elements that are often overlooked, such as love and humor. In effect, the environmental function constantly presents a challenge in your efforts to find a balance within the dynamic context where praxis is carried out, where love of teaching can translate into love of learning, and where humor plays a crucial role in the language acquisition process.

Masahiro, 25, Japan: A language teacher, especially in speaking class, should be like an entertainer. I think learning language with laughing together is the best way to improve and he made a cozy atmosphere to talk with friends.

Fawad, 27, Mauritania: For me, I want teachers to listen to students, to pay attention to their needs and to do as much as he can improve their levels. Diversity is also good.

Jamal, 18, United Arab Emirates: Kevin has a good style in teaching, and he always has a smiley face. I like his activity and kindness. He always respects you, helps you as soon as he could and he deals good with us.

German, 24, Mexico: She gives you the opportunity to participate and pays a lot of attention. Also she is a respectful person so she lets you trust her speaking and asking in class.

Ryojiro, 19, Japan: She knew how to let the students like to learn other languages, knew how to teach them from the level they can start with, and spoke only English in the class.

# THE SOCIETAL FUNCTION

Kiyung, 23, Korea: I think we have learned useless English. For example, even though we have studied English for 6 years, we can hardly talk with native English speakers.

Yi Ling, 28, Taiwan: Effective means it’s useful in life, not just for test.

The student comments above depict the frustration they can feel when engaged in language instruction that neglects their personal goals and beliefs about effective instruction. The societal function further helps to define effective language instruction by making connections between the microcontext of the classroom and the macrocontext of the outside world. Though the classroom is a veritable practice space for learners’ language use in the real world, it is, in fact, a “clinical” environment where simulations of real language use approximate natural language environments. While this realization is not intended to undercut the benefit of many pedagogically motivated activities which serve to advance learner development and the acquisition process, it is intended to draw your attention to the need for variety with regard to the incorporation of activities that connect to students’ individual goals for undertaking language study in the first place.

You must find ways through problem-posing and other means to learn what students’ language orientations are, why they are studying the language, and what they think is important for language learning. Examples of other means can include handing out a questionnaire at the beginning of the course asking why students are taking the course and what their future scholastic and career goals are, and/or conducting a needs analysis to determine their strengths and weaknesses in the various language skills. Gathering this information can prepare you to understand where gaps may exist between you and your students, opening up the possibility to promote a common understanding, negotiate the syllabus, foster a learning partnership, and make the learning process more useful and meaningful. When learners feel that their needs are being met and their interests are being considered, they are more apt to engage in active learning and less likely to resist suggestions that can ultimately benefit them.

Masato, 24, Japan: It’s easy to memorize because I always said something useful.

Osamu, 32, United Arab Emirates: She can give us a common word that we can use daily in our life.

Hamoud, 20, United Arab Emirates: I think “effective” means when you learn something and you still know it all throughout your life.

Udo, 20, Germany: Effective means that you achieve your goals or reach your objectives.

Yi Ling, 28, Taiwan: I think you have to usually talk with your students and to understand what they want to learn. Yeah, what they want is very important.

# THE EFFECTIVE MODEL

The model for effective language instruction was derived through an approach to theory building known as Grounded Theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1998). In this approach, the information obtained through a series of interviews, observations, and surveys from multicultural, university-level ESL classrooms was compiled and analyzed. Throughout this text, I have endeavored to provide as much of that data as possible to assist you in understanding the process, the resulting themes, and the subsequent model. By asking you to become participants in this theory building process and engage in your own form of classroom problem-posing and self-reflection, I trust you have become better informed about how a participatory approach can be employed in learning.

The definitions given earlier for the pedagogical, environmental, and societal functions are not meant to be taken as the final interpretation and purpose of these distinctions. Instead, they can and should be integrated with your own to provide a forum for the co-construction of knowledge. Clearly there is a good deal of overlap in talking about any one particular function, but that is intended to show the fluidity and flexibility necessary in effective language instruction and to demonstrate the multidirectional nature of these abstract mental constructs.

To begin with a description, the two-way arrows in Fig. 9.1 symbolize the underlying philosophy of critical pedagogy which explains that effective language instruction is not an end in itself, but extends beyond the classroom into life (Freire, 1970, 1994; Wink, 1997). Thus, the teacher in the classroom is not separate from the individual whose humanity pervades his or her praxis. Furthermore, it also exemplifies how the classroom is a microcosm for the larger society. In this respect, teachers can foster a problem-posing approach which will empower students to think critically inside and outside the classroom in their attempts to transform society.

FIG. 9.1. Model for effective language instruction in a multicultural ESL classroom.

Working from the outer circles toward the core, the three functions have been identified as pedagogical, environmental, and societal, along with their underlying purposes, respectively to meet expectations, find a balance, and make connections. In this “active verb” form, the nature of the multidirectional process of language education within a participatory approach is realized. The pedagogical function enables the language teacher to meet student expectations and to communicate what their own expectations of those students may be. It merges theory with practice in preparing to address students’ emotional and psychological needs, and provide access to the skills necessary for their individual development. The environmental function moves toward finding a balance in the classroom to accommodate the needs of the students as individuals and as members of distinct and diverse cultures. The societal function connects the classroom and the real world, situating its microcontext in the larger context of life. It further conjoins the language orientations of the students to the curriculum and prepares them to meet the language requirements of whatever their future endeavors may be.

The convergence of all three spheres in the core is where effective language instruction, in a multicultural ESL context, is defined. The excerpts from the teachers and students resound with references to praxis as it merges variety, humor, and love in a relationship of mutual respect. Praxis brings all forces and functions to bear on an environment where teachers find a balance between theory and prac tice to meet students’ needs and interests for their futures in the external society.

This further requires making connections between the classroom and the real world, the content and its use.

# The Problem-Posing Framework

Putting all of the themes within a problem-posing framework, we can see the steps of naming, reflecting, and acting. Identifying, or naming, the themes individually, it can be determined that variety is a necessary element from all perspectives. Society is not one-dimensional, so neither can its classroom counterpart be. However, the balanced environment within the microcontext is not intended to promote an uncontrolled variety, but rather to attend to the diverse and changing needs of the students from both a pedagogical and human standpoint. Humor, to paraphrase one student, is the “salt” that flavors every aspect of language instruction considered “effective.” It simultaneously connects the language being learned to the real world, gives balance to the seriousness of study and makes it enjoyable, and allows teachers to be a little more human. Love, too, defined as teachers’ commitment and dedication to becoming better in their profession, and to their students’ achievement, features prominently in what students and teachers consider effective language instruction. When teachers truly love what they do and dedicate themselves to it, it becomes apparent to students through their interactions. The students appreciate and can reciprocate the love generated by the teachers by applying themselves to the task at hand: learning a language. To initiate these positive interactions, dialogue must commence. “Love is at the same time the foundation of dialogue and dialogue itself. . . . If I do not love the world—if I do not love life—if I do not love people—I cannot enter into dialogue” (Freire, 1970, pp. 70–71).

Reflecting on how these themes might contribute to effective praxis, the student–teacher relationship emerges as a context for their creation and fostering. In critical pedagogy, the democratic process a participatory approach is intended to be calls for the mutual respect of all individuals and their differences. As a result, a multicultural ESL classroom allows students to learn a new language in a challenging yet supportive environment where everyone has a subject position that is welcomed and redefined through the process of coming to know others’ subject positions. Knowledge is co-constructed, immersed in mutual respect, redefining education from a view of the teacher as the sole authority figure to a process whereby teachers also learn and students also teach.

Finally, the action element, essential to problem-posing, is realized in two ways. Effective teachers will adjust their praxis to accommodate the changing needs of students inside the classroom, and the societal function transports the educational, problem-posing process outside the classroom to support the transformation of society toward the ideals of democracy in a pluralistic, multicultural world.

# How Can Effective Praxis Be Adapted to Various Contexts? (The Application Model)

# Pre-Reading Questions

Starting from the Effective Model presented in the last chapter, how would you convert this culmination of naming and reflection into an action element? That is, considering all the teacher and student contributions provided in this text, how and where could you start to transform your own praxis? Work with your classmates and see if you can position your ideas within the model.

n the previous chapter, Grounded Theory was identified as the approach through which the various interviews, observations, and surveys were conducted, themes were derived, and the model emerged. While it is true that Grounded Theory, as with other forms of qualitative research, is intended to be context-specific, the development of themes and the subsequent model provide a level of abstraction that enable their transferability to other contexts. Thus, through description, interpretation, and verification, the findings have implications for a broader understanding of ESL teaching in multicultural contexts, and hence, for praxis in those contexts. Though the backgrounds, experiences, skills and gifts of Csilla, Dean, Kevin, and Laurel are somewhat different, the emphasis here is the specification of commonalities that contribute to their distinc tion as being considered effective language instructors. The transferability lies in the re-application of the themes as they stand to other contexts with specific re gard to the teacher, students, and school context in question.

# THE “FIT” OF CRITICAL PEDAGOGY

Just as “effective” must be defined within a context, that context is determined and delimited by those stakeholders who co-construct it. Accepting that it is only logical that the participants’ several voices are heard in the defining, earlier models for effective language instruction based on traditional pedagogy have failed contemporary praxis. As a teacher, it is easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking we know what is best for our students. It is this same process by which societies destabilize the true nature of democracy by creating a state of hegemony. Freire (1970) suggested that we are constantly engaged in the process of “becoming,” what he labeled conscientization. As we attempt to understand our profession and its applications, we must constantly reflect on the subject position that we espouse. No one can speak for the students, except the students. Any attempt to do so without invoking their voices and different positionalities runs the risk of being an imposition that does not speak for their true needs and interests. Our vocation as teachers, then, is not to know what the students need in some omnipotent sense, but to seek a better understanding of their experiences and needs, thereby helping them to achieve what they want.

Throughout this text, you have been asked to adopt a problem-posing approach to understanding what some teachers and students think effective language instruction is. If the process was successful for you and your classmates, the development of the Effective Model cannot be said to be a singular effort. The information presented through teacher and student transcripts and observation fieldnotes in the various classrooms and the models derived through their comparisons were co-constructed through the multiple efforts of all who participated in the process.

# APPLYING THE EFFECTIVE MODEL

The implications here suggest ongoing reflection and reexamination of everything related to second language instruction from language teacher education to program curriculum design. In order to frame this discussion, I return to the three functions—societal, environmental, and pedagogical—presented in the Effective Model. The ESL profession has already seen shifts from purely skills-based approaches to more theme-based or content-based approaches to integrated skills approaches. These shifts reflect attempts on the part of teachers and researchers to make connections on a societal level to both the way students perceive language and the way language is used in the world. Furthermore, as education itself is a process, teachers must also be prepared and flexible enough to find a balance within the constantly changing environment of the classroom. The realities of the macrocontext of the larger society and the trends in the microcontext of the classroom require teachers to attend to the pedagogical function as well in order to meet the constantly changing needs of their students. Current and future teachers will no doubt need to develop new approaches to examine the efficacy of future shifts. Consequently, a participatory approach provides a framework for continual renewal in both language teacher education programs and multicultural ESL classrooms.

All things considered, you and your students must acknowledge that while the classroom operates on some level as a microcosm for the larger society, it is still a classroom. Bringing elements from the outside world into the classroom context, however, must always be tempered with purpose. You will need to find a balance between what is educational and useful, with what your students need. As the approach presented in this book has suggested, the best way to obtain answers for what students think they need (and here I am including language teachers, current and future, in the act of becoming) is to ask them. It seems unthinkable that any attempt to define effectiveness in language instruction would emerge from a purely top-down process. Not only does this type of prescription run the risk of advancing the image of an idealized learner, completely ignoring the myriad differences inherent in the individual, but it also negates the environmental influences that change both diachronically and synchronically in any given classroom context. Therefore, a definition of effective language instruction must always include the voices of the students involved and recognize that each descriptive definition will have natural variation based on the changing needs and expectations of the students from one context to the next. An awareness for these changing needs and expectations, along with an appreciation and respect for the cultural diversity and individual learner differences inherent in any contemporary classroom, can and should be fostered in teacher preparation programs. Although there is no guarantee that all teachers will develop these qualities (and it is uncertain how the degree to which they do could be determined regardless), it cannot be assumed that they would simply “pick them up” on their own if not exposed to them during their preparatory language teacher education.

Both inside and outside the classroom, you will bring your pedagogy to bear on meeting the expectations of the natural fluctuation in life. Like their students, Csilla, Dean, Kevin, and Laurel share a love of learning. This can be seen in their ongoing participation in university courses and professional conferences, even their own reading of research about current trends in pedagogy and second language acquisition. They continually work toward self-improvement and renewal, both for their students and their own personal well-being. Indeed, if you want to foster lifelong learning in students, you must serve as a model for them. This, too, should be highlighted in teacher preparation to emphasize the nature of process in working toward more effective language instruction.

Preparation programs and in-service should also focus on variety in language teaching rather than simply adopting a “one-method-fits-all” approach. By not doing so, they do their students (i.e., future teachers), and their students’ students a great disservice. Focusing on one approach to language instruction assumes an ideal that this book, I hope, has gone a long way to argue against. A reductionist focus further misses the point of recognizing and appreciating the diversity inherent in a multicultural classroom by imposing a one-sided view on how learning should happen. Perhaps the greatest benefit of the Effective Model provided here will be its depiction of the interconnected relationships that you must define for yourself together with your students in an ongoing process in your classroom. Using the problem-posing model presented here as a guide, you can further apply yourself to the task of developing a way to examine, reexamine, and adjust your praxis.

# THE APPLICATION MODEL

Though the teachers presented in this text were diverse in many respects (i.e., there was no formulaic, one-size-fits-all behavioral pattern indicated), certain shared traits could be recognized in their praxis that enabled the Effective Model to emerge. From an examination of the model and a consideration for the transferability of its themes to other contexts, I suggest that the four teachers, Csilla, Dean, Kevin, and Laurel, drew on their theoretical and content knowledge—as well as their growing familiarity with their students—to identify the right mix of activities and techniques in any given context on any given day (see Fig. 10.1).

In attempting to provide more effective language instruction, the four teachers made connections beyond the classroom. They recognized that the students’ language orientations were different from their own—the students were not interested in learning language for its own sake, but for the access it would give them to the larger society in terms of admission to an American university and/or advancement in the workplace. They incorporated authentic language into the curriculum to provide the students with a sociocultural awareness of appropriate language use in the real world. Their teachers’ awareness kept them alert in the process so that they could alter the mix or modify their own roles within the environment as needed. Additionally, the materials they provided were not only educational, but also useful to the students’ own needs and goals. In their own individual ways, they found a balance that enabled students to engage in learning.

![](img/8d10cbbf0e515aeb5699c76f8335e9d94f05da9dd72615d47e4c9be7966f0629.jpg)  
FIG. 10.1. The application model.

These teachers not only attempted to foster lifelong learning in their students, but also exhibited their own interest in self-improvement and renewal. Thus, their personal engagement in lifelong learning demonstrated by enrolling in additional courses, reading research to stay current in the profession, and attending conferences enabled them to serve as role models. Finally, they used various means to approach the task of teaching. Their skills and gifts blended together in their praxis to address a wide array of individual differences and customize the variety of skills being learned to the changing needs and interests of their students.

The major part of applying the Application Model is the conducting of a contextual analysis. A contextual analysis must be part of any effort toward defining and becoming a more effective language instructor. Accepting a naturalistic paradigm determines that each multicultural classroom must be examined on a caseby-case basis through an exhaustive look at the immediate context. This can be accomplished by defining each of the various components of the Effective Model both for yourself and together with your students. This includes an ongoing awareness that goes beyond the locale to the changing diversity of your students from one class to the next, from one term to the next. Just as no two teachers are the same, no two students are either. It cannot be stressed enough that even the same student can approach different tasks in different ways. Indeed, the composition of individual differences present in the makeup of any one class cannot be predictive for a different class, with either the same or different students. Thus, praxis based principally on the nature of one class’ ethnicity, gender, or ethnicity and gender will never be sufficient. Students are no more predictable simply because they are male or female, Japanese or Arabic, rich or poor.

# CONCLUSION

Effective language instruction is not so much a matter of replicating behavior as it is a matter of customizing behavior. Although none of the teachers identified here specifically claimed to be engaging in a participatory approach of espousing a philosophy of critical pedagogy, the critical cycle—naming, reflecting, and acting—was evident in all of their classrooms to some degree. The teachers’ awareness and direct questioning of the students enabled each of these teachers to notice and identify needs or problems. Through reflection and problem-posing in a relationship of mutual respect with the students, plans were devised to respond to the needs and resolve any problems. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the plans were implemented. These teachers, in conjunction with their students, took action. Through pedagogy, they brought the external society into the classroom environment where, through love and laughter, language was learned.

It is here that I return to the discussion of critical pedagogy within a multicultural classroom environment where facilitating students’ development of a communicative competence is the goal. My insistence on its “fit” is simple. By engaging a critical classroom, diversity in the multicultural nature of the teachers and students in the class is recognized and embraced. All voices have the opportunity to express their subject positionalities and share in the co-construction of knowledge through the use of language. Communicative competence is achieved by expressing and coming to understand the various experiences of the involved individuals. Herein it becomes clear that multicultural education and a communicative approach to language teaching are not incompatible. The practice of critical pedagogy in a multicultural ESL classroom provides a framework wherein effective language instruction can be achieved. Consequently, teachers and students working together can critically examine and redefine praxis to make it more effective.

# PROBLEM-POSING: PUTTING PRAXIS INTO PRACTICE

Now that you have read the text and had the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of a participatory approach both individually and with peers, it’s time to apply that understanding. To begin, I present another scenario utilizing problem-posing for you to review; then, you will have some additional scenarios for you and your classmates to examine, discuss, and devise ways to introduce in a language class using a participatory approach. With all of these examples, in presenting the particular matter to your students, consider the language to be learned, the individual learner differences (including level of language proficiency), the most appropriate way to address the issue in the given context (e.g., considering students’ cultures and expectations), and the purpose of the “lesson” to the students’ needs in the real world. It is important to remember, however, that in a real classroom situation, it would most likely be your students who present the issues to be addressed, and you would need to customize the specifics to the individual learner differences of your students and the immediate context to engage truly effective ESL instruction.

# Example

When I was teaching a beginning level of ESL for immigrant students at a community college, one of my students came to ask me for help. She was an older student— about 60—who had come from Vietnam. She told me that she had just failed her driving test for the third time and felt that something was amiss. After bringing the matter before the class, she found a name for the problem: discrimination—this new vocabulary word was offered by the students, by the way. It seemed that while the state provided the written portion of the driving test in English and Spanish, it was not offered in Vietnamese. She explained why having a driver’s license was important to her; it not only provided her with a certain level of autonomy in being able to get around, but also made her feel more like an American since everyone else—at least in her immediate acquaintance and opinion—possessed one. After some reflection and discussion, it was decided that she should write a letter to the governor to ask to redress the inequity that existed. The letter was written, checked for errors, and mailed. A couple of weeks later, the student informed me that some men from the state had come to her house to visit her. She was issued a formal apology by the governor and was told that she could take the test in Vietnamese. Happily, she passed the driving test. As an addendum, I should add that state policy was actually changed; now, citizens may request to take their driving test in many languages other than English or Spanish.

Now, it’s your turn. Together with two or three partners, problematize the following scenarios using what you have learned.

# Scenario 1: When the Teacher is the Issue

A student came to see me in my office one day. He was an advanced level proficiency student from Saudi Arabia who was in the military, studying English in the United States with a group of his countrymen under a contract established between the two governments. He informed me that some of the students had been talking about one of the instructors. It seemed that a rumor had started that the teacher was gay and the students were trying to determine how this might affect them. Some had even suggested not taking classes with that teacher any longer because of his alleged sexual orientation. How would you broach this matter using problem-posing?

N.B. This situation can be looked at from any number of ways where there is some level of difference in cultures, lifestyles, etc. For example, I also had a Jewish colleague in the same institution who felt it would be detrimental to her effectiveness with her students to let them know about her heritage. I, on the other hand, see these and other situations where differences are present as an opportunity to explore greater understanding.

# Scenario 2: “Too” Friendly?

A young female teacher felt that the best way to interact with her low intermediate proficiency students was on a level of “friend” more than “teacher,” feeling the traditional status differential would deter student participation and interaction. During one semester, however, one of her male students from Mexico, who was also very close to her in age, apparently misunderstood her friendliness. He began to wait for her after class and call her at home in the evening. The attention made her feel increasingly uncomfortable—so much so that she began to avoid the student, leaving him confused. Was it a matter of cross-cultural misunderstanding (i.e., the culture of the classroom being different between the two countries), or was it simply inappropriate behavior resulting from “mixed messages”? How could she have dealt with this situation in the classroom in a participatory approach framework?

# Scenario 3: Racial Profiling

Post September 11, 2001, a Saudi student returning to the United States after a semester break was stopped at U.S. Immigrations at the airport and detained with no explanation. He was interrogated for several hours regarding his background, purpose for being in the country, intended length of stay, etc. In the end, he was held overnight in a jail cell before being released and allowed to continue on to his final destination. Needless to say, the incident left him traumatized, humiliated, and questioning whether he should continue his study in the United States. How might a discussion of this incident be raised in the classroom without causing further embarrassment to the student and what are the potential ways of addressing it, both in and out of the classroom?

N.B. A similar situation occurred when a low proficiency level female student recently immigrated from Cuba (of African origin) explained that she was feeling marginalized by both the Latino and African-American communities in the city; both groups appeared incapable of seeing beyond her differences which left her feeling alone and without a support system in her new country.
