This corpus-based study investigates the discursive presentations of the main social actors in the media coverage of the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement circa 2014. In particular, this work compares the strategies deployed by the South China Morning Post and China Daily in depicting the involvement of China, the Hong Kong government, the protesters and the students in the incident. The analysis of word co-occurrences revealed that the discursive portrayals of the social actors were very different in the South China Morning Post and China Daily, and a wide range of discursive strategies were used to construct the social actors, including predication, nomination and perspectivization.

# 1. Introduction

Since the return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong has faced multi-faceted political and social challenges, such as the weakened power of the Legislative Council (hereafter Legco) to amend legislation, the transformation of the political divide from ‘pro-Beijing versus pro-democracy’ to ‘pro-government versus anti-government’ (Ma, 2007, 126) as well as the increased pressure on and criticisms of the government (Ma, 2007). Among all the contentious issues, universal suffrage has been a concern in Hong Kong over the past twenty years (Scott, 2007). In June 2014, more than 800,000 people participated in an unofficial referendum vote organized by the pro-democracy movement ‘Occupy Central’ in the hopes of pressuring the Chinese government into allowing Hong Kong residents to choose their own Chief Executive by 2017 (Kaiman, 2014). The referendum was condemned by the Chinese government as illegal, and in August 2014, China’s parliament ruled out the open election in Hong Kong and tightened the rules on nominations of candidates in the 2017 Chief Executive Election (Martina and Pomfret, 2014). These actions angered a great many people in Hong Kong, and more than 50,000 students led by the activist groups ‘The Hong Kong Federation of Students’ and ‘Scholarism’ started a week of class boycotts on 26 September 2014 (Baldwin and Pomfret, 2014). The firing of tear gas by the riot police against the protesters on 28 September 2014 caused a public outcry and triggered tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents to encamp in three main districts of Hong Kong, thus starting a protest that was initiated by ‘Occupy Central’ (Lau et al., 2016). The movement was also later dubbed ‘The Umbrella Movement’ since the protesters used yellow umbrellas to defend themselves against the tear gas. The movement lasted approximately three months, during which Hong Kong’s central financial district was almost paralyzed due to the blockage of major roads and the encampment of protesters, and it also triggered rallies around the world, such as in London, Paris, New York, Washington and Montreal, advocating for democracy protests (Griffiths, 2014b).

The Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong has been widely investigated from different perspectives, namely, political (e.g., Wong and Chung, 2016), mental health (e.g., Lau et al., 2016; Ni et al., 2017), digital media (e.g., Jones and Li, 2016; Lee and Chan, 2016), and applied linguistics (e.g., Bhatia, 2015, 2016; Feng, 2017; Flowerdew, 2016). Jones and Li (2016) examined the incident of police officers attacking a handcuffed protester during the Umbrella Movement, and they collected different video versions of the incident, such as the related news reports; statements from various parties, including the police force, politicians and civic organizations; as well as discussion threads from popular Facebook groups advocating for either the protesters or the Hong Kong police. Those video versions showed various discursive practices, such as the removal of audio commentary, enhancement of images and combinations of video with other footage. Such practices revealed that various parties, such as journalists and ‘pro-occupy’ activists, expressed their particular opinion and constructed their identities in their own ways. Bhatia (2015) investigated how ideologies were constructed in the Umbrella Movement. Using the news coverage of the Hong Kong English newspaper South China Morning Post, she examined the ‘historicity’, ‘linguistic and semiotic action’ and ‘degree of social impact’ of the incident (Bhatia, 2015, 412). The analysis showed that the newspaper deployed various linguistic and rhetorical tools to transform the movement into a historic incident. For instance, the use of phrases such as ‘united around revulsion at the use of tear gas’ and ‘before the umbrellas and the pepper spray, before the pivotal tear gas movement’ portrayed the police’s ‘use of unwarranted force’ as ‘a landmark moment in the timeline of the movement’ (Bhatia, 2015, 421). In another paper, Bhatia (2016) also suggested that the media narrative has historicized the Umbrella Movement by constructing the key moment through the use of metaphors and personal stories and by exploring the stance and reactions of people to the incident through ‘use of temporary references to negotiate collective memory’ and ‘attribution of meaning to culturally significant objects’ (p. 563). To show the historicization of the Umbrella Movement, Flowerdew (2016) analyzed the interview between the movement organizer and the legislator on an English-language television programme in Hong Kong. His micro-analysis of the media discourse revealed the socio-political development and social tensions in Hong Kong. Feng (2017) examined the ideological dissonances involved in the Umbrella Movement from the major Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong and found that the polarized and divergent attitudes of newspapers about the political movement were consistent with the labelling of their political stance. He concluded that such strong bias in the Chinese news reports in Hong Kong was ‘unusual’ and that mainstream media should be ‘more neutral, impartial and objective to restore rationality, dialogue and harmony in Hong Kong politics and society’ (p. 564). The above studies have significantly shown how the Umbrella Movement was narrated in media discourses, but it appears that most studies have focused on Hong Kong newspapers, probably because Hong Kong is where the political movement occurred. While the Umbrella Movement was regarded as an act of civil disobedience by the ruling of the Chinese government and the movement was transformed by the local newspaper into a historic incident comparable to other major political incidents in China (Bhatia, 2015), and while the power difference and structural relationship between Hong Kong and China are widely known and transparent, it is worth questioning how such power dynamics are manifested in language and how language uncovers the opaque relationship of dominance, inequality, struggle and exploitation in the newspapers from both regions.

In this paper, the approaches of corpus linguistics and critical discourse analysis are combined to compare how the different social actors, including students, protesters, the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government, are discursively constructed in relation to the Umbrella Movement. In particular, this work proposes to answer the following research questions:

i How were the social actors linguistically described and constructed differently in the news discourse? ii To what extent did the discursive constructions of the social actors differ in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) and China Daily? iii What are the power dynamics involved in the processes of strategic identity construction in the two newspapers?

This paper begins with a discussion of a critical discourse analysis in the relevant discipline. The data collection and analytical procedures are then explained, followed by a discussion of present findings. The last section summarizes the research findings.

# 2. Literature review

Critical discourse analysis examines how linguistic choices play a role in the categorization of phenomena. The word ‘critical’ associates the causes and effects with our language use and social practice (Fairclough, 1995). The function of critical discourse analysis (hereafter CDA) is to ‘investigate critically social inequality, as it is expressed, signaled, constituted, legitimized and so on by language use’ (Wodak and Meyer, 2001, 2). In other words, CDAs examine the relations between linguistic choices and patterns as well as between the maintenance and negotiation of power relationships and ideologies. As indicated by van Dijk (2002), political discourse ‘can only be adequately described and explained when we spell out the sociocognitive interface that relates it to the socially shared political representations that control political actions, processes and systems’ (p. 234). Wodak (2001) suggested that there are many discursive strategies of the ‘positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation’ that we could examine in political discourse, including nomination, predication and perspectivation. Nomination refers to the ‘construction of in-groups and out-groups’ as exemplified by devices of membership categorization such as ‘the pitiful convoy’ and ‘an army of 110,000 Iraqi refugees’ (p. 282). Predication is the labelling of social actors in a more or less positive or negative way, which can be manifested by using evaluative attributions, as in ‘Calais is still crawling with asylum seekers’ (Wodak, 2001). Perspectivation is also called framing, which is related to the positioning of the viewpoints of speakers through devices including reporting, narration and quotation of events, as instantiated by ‘BRITAIN was warned last night it faces a massive benefits bill to pay for the looming influx of immigrants’ (Wodak, 2001). Over the past ten years, the interest in and application of CDA to investigate political discourse has increased (e.g., Baker et al., 2008; Cheng and Lam, 2013; Khosravinik, 2009; Proctor and Su, 2011). In their research on political discourse, Proctor and Su (2011) analyzed the use of personal pronouns in the 2008 vice-presidential debate in America as well as interviews with politicians, such as Palin, Obama and Clinton. Their results showed that Palin tended to use the personal pronoun we to present her nationalistic views in the 2008 presidential campaign, although she later changed tactics and identified herself more with John McCain in the vice-presidential debate. However, Clinton and Obama used the personal pronoun we to align themselves more with the US government to state their goals instead of stirring nationalistic views. Proctor and Su (2011) concluded that pronominal choice revealed the self-identification of politicians and the strength of relation between them and their parties. Khosravinik (2009) investigated the media representation of immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees during the Balkan conflict circa 1999 and the British general election circa 2005. The analysis revealed that British newspapers deployed various strategies to depict the social actors involved in the events. For example, in terms of topics and argumentation, the Daily Mail focused more on the side of refugees and portrayed them as ‘helpless, desperate, powerless and the victims of attack’ as exemplified by headlines such as ‘Flight from genocide’ and ‘Too late for these tragic victims’ (Khosravinik, 2009, 484). However, The Guardian used a more explicit and direct approach to describe the causes of the plight and contextualize the responsibility of the Serbian perpetrators causing the atrocity. As for micro-linguistic features, metaphors of water were widely used to describe the large quantities of refugees, as in ‘flooded by the rising tide of refugees’ and ‘the authorities and aid groups were unprepared for yesterday’s influx’ (Khosravinik, 2009, 486).

In fact, the significance of CDAs may even be enhanced by using corpus linguistic (CL) techniques. Baker et al. (2008) analyzed the British media discourse about asylum seekers, immigrants, migrants and refugees and suggested that the analysis of collocation and concordance and introduction of a qualitative CDA could ‘help triangulate the findings of the other’ (p. 295). As they explained,

CL can also examine frequencies, or, at least, provide strong indicators of the frequency, of specific phenomena recognized in CDA (e.g., topoi, topics, metaphors), by examining lexical patterns, and can add a quantitative dimension to CDA. The approximate quantification usually used in CDA studies can be made more specific through (relative) frequency counts and statistical measures. (2008, p. 296)

Cheng and Lam (2013) examined the change of Western views of Hong Kong over the ten years after its return of sovereignty to China in 1997 by comparing Western and Chinese news articles. These authors adopted CL techniques, including the analysis of collocation, semantic preference and semantic prosody in their discourse analysis. Their results showed that from 1996 to 1998, the Western views about the political situation of Hong Kong were unfavorable, whereas from 2006 to 2008, the Western media was more concerned about individual political views in Hong Kong. In Chinese media discourse, individuals’ negative perceptions or those of Hong Kong political parties towards the political state of Hong Kong were increasingly quoted. As Cheng and Lam (2013) noted, CL techniques ‘provide a window into the underlying ideological assumptions and values of the linguistic manifestation, and whether such assumptions and values of the linguistic manifestation have changed over time’ (p. 180). A corpus-based critical approach to the Umbrella Movement reflects how journalists portrayed the identities of major social actors in the incident and how such portrayals differ between the news reports in Hong Kong and China.

# 3. Data and methodology

Two English newspapers published in Hong Kong and China were chosen for the present study: the South China Morning Post (SCMP) and China Daily. The SCMP has a well-established history in Hong Kong, where it began as the South Qing Morning Post in 1903. The name was later changed to the South China Morning Post in 1913 and has remained in use since then. The average daily circulation of the SCMP reaches 100,000, and it was acquired by the Alibaba Group on 5 April 2016. As Alibaba founder Jack Ma explains, ‘with its access to Alibaba’s resources, data and all the relationships in our ecosystems, the Post can report on Asia and China more accurately compared with other media that have no such success’ (Chow, 2016). The target audience for the SCMP are ‘elite business readers in Hong Kong and the rest of Asia’. 1 The newspaper is generally known as being neutral towards the government, although its shareholder, the Kuok family, and the latest owner of the newspaper, Alibaba, are regarded as supporters of Beijing (Smith, 2006; Hines, 2016). There has been controversy over its editorial independence and self-censorship in recent years, including the coverage downplaying the death of the political dissident Li Wangyang, the forced dismissal of the staff that had criticized China’s government in the newspaper’s columns and editorials (The Standard, 2012) and the closure of their subsidiary publication, HK Magazine (Hines, 2016).

Founded in 1981, China Daily is the most widely circulated English newspaper in China. The daily circulation is 900,000 copies, with 600,000 distributed overseas (China Daily, 2017), whereas the web page views per day reach more than 52 million. The newspaper aims to present China and its news to readers from diverse fields, including ‘diplomats, representatives of international organizations and transnational corporations, international media reporters and editors, as well as foreign tourists’ (China Daily, 2017). China Daily also launched an African edition in 2012 because of the close partnership between China and the African continent. China Daily is regarded as a state-owned newspaper (BBC, 2012; Liu, 2010) because ‘its editorials represent the voice of the government’ and it has the names ‘Voice of China’ and ‘Window to China’ (Liu, 2010, 140). However, one should note that China Daily represents the voice of the Chinese officials or the Party, but not necessarily the views of the general public in mainland China.

The news data for this study were collected from the official websites of the SCMP and China Daily from September to December 2014, and these data capture the entire incident of the Umbrella Movement. The headlines of the news stories were read to ensure that the topic was relevant. Upon compilation of the corpora, the graphs and pictures were removed so that only the plain text was left. Two corpora were compiled, and they were respectively named the Corpus of the SCMP (CSCMP) and the Corpus of China Daily (CCD). The CSCMP consisted of 102 articles accounting for 115,153 words, and the CCD consisted of 75 articles with a total of 56,856 words. A combined approach of CL and CDA was used in the present study. Since this paper focused on the journalistic evaluations about different parties in the Umbrella Movement, the lexical items protesters, students, police, government and China were selected and the associated concordance lines were generated using WordSmith 6.0 (Scott, 2015). The concordance lines generated were analyzed, and the collocations and semantic prosodies of each socialactor term were identified. According to Sinclair (2004), collocations are word occurrences and semantic prosodies that refer to the pragmatic and evaluative meaning of a lexical item. The findings were then studied critically to identify the discursive strategies and motivations behind the linguistic patterns or usages discovered from the analysis of concordance lines, collocations and semantic prosodies.

# 4. Discussion of findings

Table 1 shows the frequency of occurrences of the lexical items protesters, students, police and government in the CSCMP and the CCD.

Table 1 Frequency of occurrence of the main social-actor terms in the CSCMP and the CCD.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>CSCMP</td><td>CCD</td></tr><tr><td>Word</td><td>Total frequency (percentage)</td><td>Total frequency (percentage)</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>131 (0.11%)</td><td>41 (0.072%)</td></tr><tr><td>Government</td><td>549 (0.48%)</td><td>364 (0.64%)</td></tr><tr><td>Police</td><td>1147 (0.99%)</td><td>159 (0.28%)</td></tr><tr><td>Protesters</td><td>853 (0.74%)</td><td>204 (0.36%)</td></tr><tr><td>Students</td><td>413 (0.36%)</td><td>97 (0.17%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

The findings revealed that the most frequently mentioned social actor in the CSCMP was police $( 0 . 9 9 \% )$ , followed by protesters $( 0 . 7 4 \% )$ and government $( 0 . 4 8 \% )$ . In the CCD, however, government $( 0 . 6 4 \% )$ was the most recurrent social actor, followed by protesters $( 0 . 3 6 \% )$ and police $( 0 . 2 8 \% )$ . Among the aforementioned five lexical items, students had the lowest frequency of occurrence in both corpora (CSCMP: $0 . 3 6 \%$ ; CCD: $0 . 1 7 \%$ ). The linguistic devices found in the corpora reflected the use of discursive strategies, namely, nomination, predication and perspectivation, to portray the social actors, as shown in Table 2 below.

Table 2 The discursive strategies and linguistic devices.   

<html><body><table><tr><td> Strategy</td><td>Device</td><td>Example</td></tr><tr><td>Nomination CCD: 5 (0.57%) CSCMP: 2 (0.06%)</td><td>Evaluative nouns</td><td>...accused the Hong Kong government of being &quot;the central government&#x27;s running dog&quot; ...

Table 2 revealed that predication was the most recurrent strategy found in both the CSCMP $( 1 . 8 1 \% )$ and the CCD $( 1 1 . 2 \% )$ to label social actors. This was manifested in a wide range of linguistic devices including metaphors, evaluative predicates, verbs and nouns, as in upset about this tail-wagging-the-dog turn of events and the police force have shown the greatest patience and endurance. The description and quotation of utterances in the corpora showed the use of perspectivation, as exemplified by expressions such as our defenceless students and the police would faithfully and truthfully enforce the law with patience. Nomination was relatively scarce in both corpora as in the central government’s running dog and young people have become the “cannon fodder”. The analysis showed that, as with the SCMP, China Daily deployed more strategies of nomination, predication and perspectivation to present the social actors in the Umbrella Movement. This seemed to suggest that China Daily may have a more positive or negative stance towards different social actors in the incident. The following sections further discuss the findings related to the use of all five lexical items, protesters, students, police, government and China in both corpora.

# 4.1. Protesters

In the CSCMP, the lexical item protesters frequently co-occurred with expressions of quantity $( 1 3 \% )$ , such as hundreds, scores, dozens, thousands and the vast numbers. Such expressions provided a general description of the scale of the protests during the Umbrella Movement, as in thousands of protesters marched west from Gloucester Road, many hundreds of protesters gathered outside the square and around 300 protesters engaged in a 5-hour-long stand-off with police. Other collocates of the lexical item protesters are exemplified in Fig. 1.

Twenty-three percent of the concordance lines associated with protesters frequently collocated with expressions describing actions and activities, including taken over, stand or move slowly through crowded shopping areas, promised to return, vowed to escalate their action and defied police warnings (see Fig. 1). All of these co-occurrences showed that the protesters deployed different strategies to occupy the main roads. For instance, ‘The “shopping” exercises have sprung up since the Mong Kok clearance and protesters stand or move slowly through crowded shopping areas’ (South China Morning Post [SCMP] 2014), and ‘On Friday, protesters defied police warnings as they sang carols dressed in choir garb while holding pro-democracy banners at Times Square in Causeway Bay’ (South China Morning Post, 2014). These actions taken by the protesters seemed to reveal their attempt to show that their demonstrations were peaceful. However, the protesters also seemed to be testing the patience of the Hong Kong Police. In addition, the word protesters was also often found in noun compounds $( 4 . 5 \% )$ as revealed in Fig. 2.

4 t, there was an overnight stand-off between protesters and police. It was estimated that ov   
5 e seen intermittent violent clashes between protesters and police, with the Occupy Central

Fig. 2 shows that clashes, stand-offs and violent confrontations occurred between the protesters and police as well as between the protesters and those opposing their action. These word co-occurrences expressed the tension between protesters and the other parties, namely, police and anti-protesters, indirectly showing the persistence of the protesters. In fact, a number of violent confrontations occurred between the protesters and people who opposed their actions during the movement. The anti-protesters attempted to destroy the protest sites by ‘attacking students, trashing student tents and hurling obscenities’ (Fitzpatrick, 2014). Local businesses and residents also complained about the sit-in. According to a local poll conducted in October 2014, $3 8 \%$ of the respondents supported the protesters while $3 6 \%$ of them opposed the protestors, showing the serious split in Hong Kong at that time (BBC, 2014). The above analysis showed that the collocates indicated the number of protesters, as well as their strategies and conflict with the police. The tone conveyed from the description of the protesters in the CSCMP was rather neutral.

As with the CSCMP, the concordance lines protesters found in the CCD did not have strong collocates. Still, from the word co-occurrences, we found the semantic prosody of ‘violence’ $( 5 8 . 5 \% )$ conveyed from protesters. Fig. 3 shows the sample concordance lines.

In Fig. 3, the social actor protesters is shown to be associated with expressions such as exercise violence, brought umbrellas with metal poles and barricades at an area. These phrases showed that protesters were portrayed by China Daily as violent people who posed a threat to the police and other Hong Kong citizens. Emotionally, the protesters could also ‘hurt the feelings’ of Hong Kong residents because of the disruption of residents’ lives (China Daily, 2014f). In addition to the emphasis on violence, China Daily also stressed that the Umbrella Movement was an illegal act exemplified by sentences found in the CCD, such as the protesters have actually violated the law (China Daily, 2014d), the protesters have upgraded their challenge to the rule of law (China Daily, 2014h) and the ‘Occupy Central’ protesters are apparently violating the law in Hong Kong (China Daily, 2014g). From lines 1 to 4 in Fig. 3 and the aforementioned linguistic examples, we see that the traits of the protesters described in the news tended to be deprecatory, and such traits were portrayed through the use of predication $( 1 3 . 8 \% )$ . This result is consistent with the view of Reisigl and Wodak (2001) that predication can label ‘social actors more or less positively or negatively’ (p. 94). The journalists of China Daily also used attributive adjectives to label the protesters, as in ‘sensible protesters began leaving the protests on Sunday and the re-opening of two affected schools on Monday’ (China Daily, 2014c) and ‘Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, cast doubt on the three activists’ influence on defiant protesters’ (China Daily, 2014i).

# 4.2. Students

Students played a crucial role in the Umbrella Movement: thousands of university students started the school boycotts on 22 September 2014, and thousands of secondary school students joined them on 26 September 2014 (The Economist, 2 October 2014). The students encamped in the main commercial districts of Hong Kong for more than two months and attended volunteer lectures and tutorials at night. As commented by Ortmann (2015), ‘finally, the driving force behind the Umbrella Movement has been the students, who were also the first group to mobilize for political change in the early 1970s’ (p. 34). Because of the road closures, many nursery, primary and secondary schools were forced to shut down from 29 September to 6 October. In the CSCMP, the word students $( 1 0 . 2 \% )$ often occurred with expressions about determination and uncontrollability. Fig. 4 is the concordance extract from the CSCMP.

As exemplified in Fig. 4, the word students was associated with certain predicates, such as vow to turn on, vow to fight on, riding on a wave of protest, stormed the building’s forecourt and blocked his [a policeman’s] path. These expressions depicted students as determined figures who resisted the interference of police and continued their sit-ins. This depiction coincided with the view of the sociologist and co-organizer of the Umbrella Movement Dr. Chan Kin-man, who ‘believes students will carry on the fight for democracy when Occupy is over’ (Cheung and Lam, 2014). The concordance lines also showed the use of metaphors, as instantiated by the use of the metaphors fight on and storm in lines 2 and 4, respectively, which conceptualized students as fighters in the Umbrella Movement. In line 3, the protest was conceptualized as a wave, thereby implicitly conveying the notion that the protest was widespread and influential. All of these metaphors reconceptualized the students as fighters, historicizing the entire political movement and transforming ‘a civil protest into a battle’ (Bhatia, 2016, 556). As explained by Bhatia, metaphor reconceptualizes and creates ‘new representations of reality and thus giving rise to various discursive illusions in the versions of reality put forward by different discourse clans’ (p. 557). In fact, after the school boycotts started on 22 September 2014, university students worldwide also showed their support for Hong Kong students. For instance, a student named Heather Pickerell from Harvard University launched a campaign with the participation of 29,000 students from more than 40 universities: ‘I started the campaign at Harvard because I thought that very few people at my university knew about the Hong Kong democracy debate and I wanted to raise awareness about it’ (Griffiths, 2014a).

Other concordance lines $( 1 1 . 4 \% )$ for students in the CSCMP revealed that students were innocent in the movement as shown in Fig. 5.

$5 \mathrm { ~ n ~ }$ . How could you do this to our defenceless students? Don't you have children of your own?

Fig. 5 shows that journalists of the SCMP used reported voices (line 3) and direct quotations (line 2, lines 4 to 5) to present the attitude of the general public toward students who staged sit-ins during the movement. Phrases associated with the word students included playing into the hands of the government, beat the students on the head again and again, young students should be forgiven, who had nothing to defend themselves and defenseless. All these linguistic choices depicted students as innocent, weak and vulnerable to the police through predication $( 6 . 2 9 \% )$ , reflecting the general public’s sympathetic attitude. The significant amount of indirect and direct speech on the part of the general public used in the news articles showed the use of perspectivation $( 3 . 1 5 \% )$ which position the journalists’ point of view. This supposition was supported by the view of Bhatia (2015) in her CDA studies: ‘criticism directed at the student protesters, often by anti-Occupy protesters, is played down by the newspaper, which chooses to focus mainly on their naivety rather than the illegal nature of the protest’ (p. 415).

China Daily took a slightly different stance toward the Umbrella Movement. Fig. 6 instantiates the concordance lines for students.

5 ion, even using the internet to openly incite students and citizens to assemble, the protest

Grammatically, the social actor ‘students’ often played the role of patients in the sentences (see Fig. 6), which was exemplified by expressions such as instigated students to attack the police, encouraging young students to participate, take advantage of students’ idealism and enthusiasm, hijacked the will of the students, and openly incite students and citizens to assemble. The above examples portrayed the students involved in the movement as ignorant subjects who were easily controlled and exploited by the Umbrella Movement organizers. China Daily also deployed direct quotations to report the attitude of various parties about the students in the Umbrella Movement, although the point of view expressed from those selected quotes collided with that from the SCMP. For example, one of the quotes was by a member of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, Rita Fan: ‘I cannot accept that young students are being used as a tool by the people behind them to tear apart Hong Kong society and thwart Hong Kong’s development’ (China Daily, 2014g). Another quote was from a Wen Wei Po critic: ‘The young people have become the “cannon fodder” for the schemers behind the scene’ (China Daily, 2014a). The words tools and cannon fodder used in these two quotations are examples of nomination $( 2 . 0 6 \% )$ , which further enhanced the discursive construction of ‘students’ in the newspaper. Reisigl and Wodak (2001) argued that the use of quotations to report or describe the utterances is useful for media framing or discourse representation. Quotation patterns ‘play an important role in implementing particular perspectives, and hence, ideologies’ (Baker et al., 2008). This concept is consistent with the above findings that the negative polarity of direct quotations used in the news articles also revealed the unfavorable view of China Daily towards the Umbrella Movement.

# 4.3. Police

Another crucial actor in the Umbrella Movement was the police. According to a Chinese university survey (Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2014) conducted in October 2014, nearly $5 4 \%$ of the respondents were angry and dissatisfied with the handling of the Occupy protests by the police. The corpus data revealed that the SCMP often reported police actions $( 6 4 . 8 \% )$ , which can be observed in the expressions Tensions boiled over as police bottlenecked protesters, police cut the power supply before they cleared the scene and riot police clashed with hundreds of protesters (CSCMP). This result is consistent with the findings of Bhatia (2015), who suggested that the Hong Kong police were portrayed as hard-handed in the SCMP. However, her argument about the villainization of police was not supported by the data from the CSCMP. Instead, indirect quotations in the CSCMP provided a neutral presentation of the opposing viewpoints on police actions as shown in Fig. 7.

Lines 1 to 4 show the indirect quotations of people who complained about police action, which are exemplified by expressions such as allegedly kicked and hit by, their alleged brutality, using grossly excessive force and used too much force. The police were described by the respondents as violent given their use of tear gas on ‘unarmed protesters’ (Chugani, 2014). In addition, TV footage showed seven policemen beating a Civic Party activist in a back alley (Bhatia, 2015). However, various parties, including the police superintendents, Democratic Party lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security Lai Tung-Kwok and the Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying, showed their support for the Hong Kong police as revealed in lines 5 to 8 (see Fig. 7). This fact was instantiated by expressions about lawfulness and decisiveness, such as suitable and necessary force, taking tougher action, take action decisively, and handle the situation in accordance with the law. All the examples in Fig. 7 reveal the deeply divided Hong Kong society at that time, and while the protesters and pro-protesters condemned the police action as violent and brutal, the Hong Kong police and government insisted that the police were lawabiding. The reporting of two opposing voices on the Hong Kong police shows that the SCMP adopted a neutral attitude toward the police and detached itself from the Umbrella Movement, which was inconsistent with the argument of Bhatia (2015) that the Hong Kong police was villainized.

Comparatively, the framing of police in China Daily was entirely different. Fig. 8 reveals the associated concordance lines.

As exemplified in Fig. 8, the police were portrayed by China Daily as the ‘victims’ in the movement because they were unable to perform their duties because of the barricades used by the protesters (line 2) and were attacked by the protesters using umbrellas as weapons (lines 3 to 4). The newspaper indicated that the Hong Kong police should be commended due to their ‘great patience and endurance’ (China Daily, 2014b). The direct quotations $( 2 2 . 3 \% )$ found in the CCD only showed the positive attitude towards the Hong Kong police: ‘It is the responsibility of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to protect their home and rule of law and support the police actions to maintain law and order’ (China Daily, 2014a). All of the above examples showed that China Daily used predication to label the social actors ‘protesters’ more negatively $( 1 3 . 8 \% )$ and ‘police’ $( 1 2 . 6 \% )$ more positively than did the SCMP. It, then, appears that China Daily had a relatively more positive and advocating attitude for the Hong Kong police, and its news articles depicting the victimization of the Hong Kong police further villainized the protesters in the Umbrella Movement, thus conveying the stance of newspaper against the Umbrella Movement.

# 4.4. Government

The Umbrella Movement involved a considerable amount of tension between the Hong Kong government and the protesters. The Hong Kong government was also said to receive pressure from the central government. As commented by Ortmann (2015), ‘during the Umbrella Movement, it became clear that the Hong Kong government was entirely dependent on central authorities for the way in which it dealt with the movement’ (p. 37). Fig. 9 presents a sample of the concordance of the lexical item government.

Fig. 9. Sample concordance of government from the CSCMP.

The word government was associated with certain expressions, such as lost the support of young people, would not heed the people’s call, unyielding, inaction and refuses to answer (see Fig. 9). These narrations were found in the quotations of respondents (e.g., lines 1, 2 and 5) and the critiques of the SCMP columnists (e.g., lines 3 to 4). The predicational devices $( 1 2 . 1 \% )$ such as the use of negative verbs and nouns, negative evaluative adjectives and negative syntactic constructions, as shown in Fig. 9, discursively constructed the image of the Hong Kong government as incapable of listening and unwilling to listen. This stance seems to further victimize the protesters and students who participated in the Umbrella Movement. During the Umbrella Movement, the Hong Kong police were criticized by the protesters and pro-protesters as being indifferent. For instance, the secretary general of the Federation of Students, Alex Chow Yong-kang, said ‘the government must not ignore the hunger strikers’ demand for dialogue’ (Ng et al., 2014), and a volunteer indicated that ‘there is no point in staying if the government is unmoved even by people going on a hunger strike’ (Ng et al., 2014). The SCMP columnist Frank Ching, who formerly worked with the New York Times for 10 years, also criticized the government for being unwilling to assume responsibility:

The government, it seems, has relinquished its role of governing and turned it over to the private sector, to the judiciary, to court bailiffs and to their police assistants. Nowhere is the government seen to be exercising leadership. It is not communicating with protesters. It is not mediating with the central government regarding the desires of Hong Kong people (Ching, 2014).

As for China Daily, the portrayal of Hong Kong government was much more positive as shown in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10 exemplifies the expressions associated with the word government, including will be seriously affected, affect the provision of services, made it very clear, fully respects the public’s right and declared illegal. These linguistic choices revealed that predicational strategies $( 1 0 . 7 \% )$ were employed by China Daily to depict the Hong Kong government as a ‘victim’, which the newspaper also did with the Hong Kong police in the incident. In addition, the Hong Kong government was positively portrayed as responsible. This depiction could be found in the quotations selected from the other newspaper critiques. The news article titled ‘A treacherous fault line’ (China Daily, 2014e), for example, included direct quotations from various newspaper critics. One quote was from People’s Daily, which is known as the state media (Huang, 2014): ‘By holding talks with ‘Occupy Central’ organizers, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has exhibited its goodwill’. All these intertextual elements indirectly reflected the support of China Daily for the Hong Kong government, which is in great contrast to the negative construal of the Hong Kong police found in the SCMP through the criticisms of their columnists.

# 4.5. China and the Central government

The findings showed that while the SCMP adopted the term ‘China’ in its new reports, China Daily used the term ‘the Central government’ most of the time. Considering that the conception of ‘China’ from the Hong Kong perspective is different from that of ‘the central government’ from the perspective of Chinese officials, this section was divided into 4.5.1 (‘China’) and 4.5.2 (‘the Central government’) for discussion.

# 4.5.1. China

In the CSCMP, the word China was mostly found in the quotations of protesters and various parties worldwide $( 3 1 . 9 \% )$ as well as in the opinions given by the SCMP columnists $( 3 6 . 7 \% )$ . The launch of the Umbrella Movement was caused by the anger and dissatisfaction of the protesters toward China on the issue of universal suffrage. Hence, the attitude of protesters towards China was assumed to be as negative as that towards the Hong Kong government; however, this was not the case (see Fig. 11).

![](img/9c2d0b4e50908304ed92316e2bc68fa2eb6ab6b5fa41dd692cee3573c6e3a958.jpg)

Interestingly, protesters were hopeful that China would listen to their views and change in the future, which was different from how they criticized the Hong Kong government as incapable and indifferent. Examples of the linguistic expressions associated with China included crucial determinant of national security, hopeful for [China’s] future, going to become democratic, eager to safeguard and will change, thus conveying a sense of hope towards China. The predicational strategies and quotations $( 9 . 9 2 \% )$ shown in Fig. 11 positioned the stance of protesters as optimistic that China would change because they believed that Hong Kong’s prosperity was important to China. As identified by the SCMP columnist Kelly Yang,

Our low tax rate, strong anti-corruption institution and clear legal system make doing business here easy. Our economy is our biggest asset, and the one thing China is eager to safeguard. It’s the only reason Beijing has to listen to what we want (Yang, 2014).

In fact, the 3-month sit-ins, the school boycotts and the hunger strikes during the Umbrella Movement enabled other countries to present their views. For instance, a US Congressional-Executive Commission on China indicated that the actions of Beijing to confine democracy ‘raise concerns about the future of the fragile freedoms and rule of law that distinguish Hong Kong from mainland China’ (Ng, 2014), and it urged ‘Hong Kong’s leadership to adopt an election process based on universal suffrage that provides a genuine choice of candidates’ (Shih, 2014). However, Charles Powell, who was the private secretary to late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and K. Shanmugam, who was the Singapore Foreign Minister at that time, believed that China would stay firm (Shih, 2014). The Umbrella Movement, undeniably, increased the tension between China and other countries. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei reminded foreign governments not to ‘intervene in Hong Kong affairs’ and criticized the view of the US commission as ‘distorting the facts’ and ‘making malicious attacks’ (Shih, 2014).

# 4.5.2. Central government

China Daily, however, focused more on the negative impacts caused by the Umbrella Movement in China. The newspaper preferred to address China as the central government $( 8 5 \% )$ , given the political regime of China and that China Daily is regarded as a state-owned newspaper published in the country. Fig. 12 shows the concordance of central government in the CCD.

![](img/75b9334de761dfaa450679b7d9acd3a72c32b514ad67162da99d371b7e4e3548.jpg)  
Fig. 12. Sample concordance of central government from the CCD.   
Fig. 13. Sample concordance of central government from the CCD.

China Daily tended to quote critiques from other newspapers (e.g., lines 1 to 4 in Fig. 12) as the strategy of perspectivation $( 4 . 6 7 \% )$ to express their stance for the central government. The central government was metaphorically being attacked by using a spear (line 1), being embarrassed (line 2), and being intimidated (line 3), and its constitutional rights were blatantly defied (line 5). These expressions depicted the central government as another victim along with the Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong government, and they indirectly villainized the protesters. The use of the third-party voice (quotation of the other newspaper critics) seemed to reflect that China Daily attempted to take an objective position, implying that they were not the only ones criticizing the protesters. The opinion of the columnists of other newspapers were also quoted in the CCD. For instance, in a news article titled Critics lash out at protestors for jeopardizing HK’s future, the commentary given by The Guardian columnist Martin Jacques was indirectly quoted as follows: ‘.it should be remembered that for 155 years until its handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong had been a British colony, forcibly taken from China at the end of the first Opium War’ and ‘democracy was actually introduced to Hong Kong by the Chinese government’ (China Daily, 2014b). The same news article also mentioned the view of Pierre Picard, an expert on China from the University of Paris VIII: ‘some Western countries used double standards on the Occupy Central movement and interfered in China’s internal affairs, which was “astonishing”’ (China Daily, 2014b). Other concordance lines $( 3 1 . 2 \% )$ depicted the firm stance of China (see Fig. 13).

5 cupy Central early on Sunday. The central government firmly opposes all illegal activities

China’s firm stance was directly expressed through the journalistic voice as supported by the predicates will not back down, undisputed guiding role, followed the rules to hear different voices, and firmly opposes all illegal activities. These expressions depicted China as a righteous and dutiful country that would never give in to protesters who ‘violated the law’ (China Daily, 2014d). Such a depiction also reflected the authoritative status of China Daily as a state-owned newspaper. As previously stated, the people who supported the movement were quoted in the news reports of the SCMP, and they indicated that because Hong Kong was vital to the economy of China, China would change. In contrast, China Daily indirectly quoted the view of a New York critic that Hong Kong also needed China:

Since Hong Kong’s return to China, the mainland and Hong Kong have been closely linked, sharing weal and woe. Hong Kong not only needs support and assistance from the central government, but cooperation with other provinces and municipalities in various areas (China Daily, 2014b).

The idiom ‘sharing weal and woe’ used in the quotation impartially portrayed the current relationship of Hong Kong and China. Although Hong Kong ‘depends heavily on food and water from the mainland, the rules always needed to pay close attention to the mainland even during colonial times’ (Ortmann, 2015, p. 34), the leadership of Hong Kong’s ‘world securities markets and securities/law enforcement ‘markets’ can help improve corporate governance on the mainland and increase valuations on the mainland while solidifying Hong Kong’s position as an international financial centre’ (Michael and Goo, 2016, p. 7). The justification of the power discrepancy between Hong Kong and China in China Daily has confirmed the point of Bhatia (2015) that ‘authority, power struggles, hegemony and subordination’ helped objectify ‘a particular representation of reality’ and the linguistic choice helped ‘achieve collective agreement’ (p. 409). As Baker et al. (2008) point out, ‘for CDA, language is not powerful on its own – it gains power by the use people make of it and by the people who have access to language means and public fora’ (p. 280). The strategic construction of identity by various social actors in the SCMP and China Daily not only highlighted the widening rift between people in Hong Kong and China as well as their structural and power relationship but also unveiled the opaque struggle and conflict between the two newspaper discourses in terms of inequalities, exploitations and distortions.

# 5. Conclusions

This study combined the CL and CDA techniques to analyse the media coverage of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong from September to December 2014 and compared the linguistic and discursive features associated with the different main social actors depicted in the SCMP and China Daily. In the SCMP, students were described as determined, innocent and uncontrollable, whereas in China Daily, they were depicted as ignorant and easily controlled. The image of protesters in the SCMP was said to be persistent, whereas their image in China Daily was as violent actors. In the SCMP, two conflicting views of the Hong Kong police were presented: on one hand, they were described as violent, whereas on the other hand, their actions were supported and depicted as efficient, showing the societal disparities in Hong Kong at that time. However, the Hong Kong police were commended by China Daily, in which they were described as dutiful and efficient. The opposing discursive constructions of the Hong Kong police in the SCMP showed the effectiveness of combining the CL and CDA techniques in examining identity constructions in media discourses and in reducing research bias. This further supports the view of Wodak (2001) that CL and CDA can be deployed to ‘analyse opaque as well as transparent structural relationships of dominance, discrimination, power and control as manifested in language’ (p. 2). The Hong Kong government was portrayed in the SCMP as incapable and unresponsive, whereas it was described in China Daily as patient and law-abiding. Finally, it is conventionally known that the Umbrella Movement was triggered by the negative attitudes towards China. However, the news reports of the SCMP showed the hopefulness of the protesters regarding the willingness of China to change in the future, which is often an often-neglected dimension. On the other hand, China Daily showed the central government’s firm stance. The present study also revealed that the protesters, the Hong Kong government and China were victimized in the news reports of China Daily.

The present study also demonstrated that the SCMP and China Daily used a diversity of discursive strategies to construct the main social actors in the Umbrella Movement. The SCMP deployed predication and perspectivation through a wide range of linguistic and textual devices, including metaphors, verbs and nouns, evaluative adjectives, syntactic constructions, direct and indirect quotations of the respondents, as well as critiques by the SCMP columnists. The opinion of the respondents and columnists not only expressed their own attitudes but also indirectly represented the SCMP’s attitude towards all of the social actors in the demonstration. The strategies of nomination, predication and perspectivation were deployed by China Daily through their use of evaluative adjectives, predicates and quotations in the news reports. The use of the other newspapers’ critiques in China Daily likely served as a strategy for the newspaper to show the ‘objectivity’ of their stance and their loyalty to the central government. Such nationalist optimism and patriotism were conveyed through all their evaluative and judgmental linguistic expressions. As Feng (2017) points out, ‘to varying degrees, the newspapers are not simply providing information, but are persuading readers to accept their biased version of reality through the strategic selection and design of attitudes’ (p. 564). By achieving its research aims, the present study not only provides insights into the inequalities, exploitations and distortions involved in the two conflicting newspaper discourses but also prepares the way for further studies into political movements in Hong Kong.

Further political studies could diachronically investigate the change in the journalistic stance towards the Hong Kong government, China and protesters or further explore the hopeful attitudes of the people of Hong Kong and mainlanders towards their country, which is a rather neglected dimension in current studies on political discourse. Political studies could also compare the discursive constructions of social actors in the Umbrella Movement and similar campaigns in other cities, or examine the conflicting views in a newspaper.
