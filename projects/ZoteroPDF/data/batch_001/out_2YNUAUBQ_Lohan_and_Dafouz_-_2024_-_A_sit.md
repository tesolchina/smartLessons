As English-medium education (EME) expands globally, this paper focuses on the need for a sit uated analysis of the contextual factors possibly influencing students’ English language devel opment at a private business university in Spain. Using the ROAD-MAPPING framework (Dafouz & Smit, 2016) as an analytical and theoretical model, the study highlights the sociolinguistic dynamics that can affect student English proficiency in such EME programmes. Focusing on two different cohorts (English-medium and Spanish-medium degree students), with varying levels of training in English for Academic Purposes (EAP), our analysis suggests that this private uni versity’s efforts to organise regular interdepartmental meetings between content lecturers and EAP professionals contributes to improvements in classroom practices and course syllabi relating to disciplinary language learning in English. Moreover, by viewing internationalisation as central to university life, and emphasising the importance of English to achieve it, the study shows how an international stance also shapes students’ disciplinary language development. The active promotion of EAP programmes for the whole student population, irrespective of the language of instruction, underscores their crucial role in this private business university. Finally, the paper closes with suggestions for further research in the form of emerging questions using the ROADMAPPING framework.

# 1. Introduction

In the past two decades, there has been substantial growth in the number of higher education programmes taught in English as a means of instruction (or $\mathrm { E M I } ^ { 1 } .$ ) and, concurrently, a wealth of research into what this growth may mean for those involved (e.g. Dafouz & Smit, 2020; Galloway & Rose, 2021; Macaro et al., 2018). However, a need has been identified for investigation into the impact of EMI programmes on students’ English language development (Kamas¸ak et al., 2021; Malmstrom ¨ & Pecorari, 2022). In a systematic review of 83 higher education institutions (see Macaro et al., 2018), only 7 studies examine the impact English-medium programmes actually have on learners’ English proficiency.

The general assumption behind EMI is that higher exposure to the target language will naturally improve students’ English pro ficiency (see Aizawa et al., 2020; Rose et al., 2020). Yet, a clear response to such an assumption is not always conclusive. For example, while substantial improvement in language skills was reported among EMI students in the United Arab Emirates and Turkey over a four-year period (see Rogier, 2012; Yuksel et al., 2023), such improvement was particularly noticeable in the Turkish programme which included a two-semester compulsory preparatory English course. In contrast, no significant gains were observed in a comparative study on Chinese students in English-medium courses compared to those in Chinese-medium courses with English elective modules after one year (Lei & Hu, 2014).

Differing findings also emerge when research focuses on particular skills, such as writing. In a Japanese study (Aizawa et al., 2020), students reported that writing was the least challenging of the academic skills. However, this may be due to the intensive pre-sessional course students undertook, i.e. an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) course in the first 18 months of their degree, before complete immersion in the English-medium programme took place. Conversely, research in China reported that the main preoccupation among students was the writing skill, when no previous preparation was offered (Zhou et al., 2022). This is further supported by research on students writing exam papers (Breeze & Dafouz, 2017) and on essay writing (Evans & Morrison, 2011), which found that academic writing was by far the most challenging skill. By and large, the lack of common research findings regarding students’ improvement (or not) in English proficiency in general or in particular academic skills could be connected to different research perspectives and the methods of analysis used when examining such proficiencies, as well as to the diversity of EMI contexts and factors that come into play (Fernandez ´ Costales & Lasagabaster Herrarte, 2024; Pun & Curle, 2021).

Against this backdrop, and without downplaying the importance of these studies, our paper argues for the need to go beyond English language exposure and investigate in detail which contextual factors may play a role in students’ language development in EMI. More specifically we2 aim to describe, analyse, and explain, the range of sociolinguistic issues that may impact students’ English proficiency in a private business university in Spain. To this end, we propose the use of the ROAD-MAPPING framework (RM, here after) a theoretical and analytical model which provides “a conceptual frame of reference at the metalevel” (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 60) and enables researchers to examine in a more holistic, dynamic, and comprehensive way the complex sociolinguistic reality of English-taught scenarios. With the help of its six dimensions (explained in the theoretical section), the RM framework examines the research in its specific context, exploring, for instance, learners’ self-perceptions of their language proficiency and their motivations for pursuing degrees in English, as well as lecturers’ beliefs of their teaching roles in these settings, the institutional language policies in place, the different teaching methodologies and language assessment criteria followed, or the international nature of the disciplines involved.

This paper not only examines English proficiency in a specific private business university setting but also provides concrete, sit uated examples of how RM can be used as an analytical model to identify factors that may go unnoticed. Furthermore, it offers insights into how English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programmes can play a key role in the development of students’ English proficiency in English-medium contexts and concludes with suggestions for future research in the form of emerging questions drawing on the RM framework.

# 2. Theoretical model: the ROAD-MAPPING framework

As mentioned above, the RM framework (Dafouz & Smit, 2016, 2020, 2023) offers a wide-ranging and holistic analysis of English-medium instruction settings. In this paper, we use an alternative label, EMEMUS, which stands for English-medium education in multilingual university settings. The use of this label is “semantically wider” than EMI (Dafouz & Smit, 2016, p. 399) and “is in clusive of diverse research agendas, pedagogical approaches and of different types of education, comprising, for instance, online programmes and teacher pedagogical development” (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 17). EMEMUS (or EME for short), moreover, embraces both teaching and learning in higher education settings and “explicitly describes the multilingual sociolinguistic setting that char acterises present-day societies and higher education institutes (HEIs) more specifically” (Dafouz, 2021, p. 18). In essence, EME offers a natural laboratory where researchers can explore the interplay between social factors, instructional practices, and students’ learning experiences, contributing to an understanding of the development and use of language skills in a multilingual university environment.

The framework identifies six relevant dimensions: Roles of English in relation to Other languages (RO), Academic disciplines (AD), language Management (M), Agents (A), Practices and Processes (PP), and Internationalisation and Glocalisation (ING). Finally, dis courses are seen as the “intersecting access point through which all six dimensions can be examined” (Dafouz & Smit, 2016, p. 403). An illustration of the framework is shown in Fig. 1.

The first dimension of the framework, Roles of English (in relation to Other languages) (RO), encapsulates the communicative functions of languages in EME universities, with English playing a prominent (and often contested) role in comparison to other languages (Dafouz & Gray, 2022). It also highlights the many functions that English can adopt in the educational setting, ranging from its use as a/the medium of education, to being the principal focus in an EAP course, or the only lingua franca (ELF) shared by students and/or staff with different first languages. Given this multifunctionality, it can be expected that English language practices will vary widely (PP) as will participant views (A) and institutional language policies (M).

Fig. 1. The RM Framework for EMEMUS (Dafouz & Smit, 2023, p. 4).

Dimension two, Academic Disciplines (AD) incorporates two related concepts: academic literacies (a wide range of academic outputs) and academic culture (the practices, norms, and values associated with a particular field of study) (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 82). AD highlights the discursive nature of disciplinary knowledge (Chang, 2023) and emphasises how a change in the medium of instruction in a degree programme can impact all other dimensions, from the stakeholders’ academic socialisation (A) to the curricular design (M) and the pedagogical practices used (PP).

The third dimension, (language) Management (M) refers to the language-related educational policies, documents, and statements “issued by social agents representing collectives at various socio-political and hierarchical levels” (Dafouz & Smit, 2016, p. 406) within HEIs. This dimension focuses on the policies and strategies which determine the language of programmes, covering how they shall be conducted or how such policies and strategies are promoted (Bradford, 2023).

Agents (A), the fourth dimension, comprises the many social actors in EME. Such stakeholders include a wide range of participants – students (both national and international) – the curriculum developers and lecturers of said programmes, those who conduct the administration tasks from admissions to graduation, and finally the recruiters, that is, those who encourage students to enrol on such courses.

Practices and Processes (PP), the fifth dimension, are “concerned with the administrative, research and educational activities that construct and are constructed by EMEMUS realities” (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 83). In other words, PP includes the diverse ways in which these programmes are taught and learned and, given the change in the language of instruction and the international stance largely adopted, this dimension also calls for a reflection upon lecturers’ pedagogical ideologies as well as their current methodologies (Shao & Carson, 2023).

The final dimension, Internationalisation and Glocalisation (ING) “refers to ‘the tensions but also the synergies’ (Scott, 2011, p. 61) that govern twenty-first-century HEIs, and portrays such organisations as transnational sites where stakeholders from different social settings, linguistic and cultural backgrounds and educational models are gaining presence” (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 83). Simply put, the interest lies in the interaction between the global and local worlds within the higher education institution (Graham et al., 2021).

Since its inception in 2014, the RM framework has been employed for different purposes and in diverse settings (see Dafouz & Smit, 2023, pp. 6–8). There are three recent studies worth highlighting for their relevance to this particular investigation. First, there is the application of RM as a research design model (Komori-Glatz, 2017, 2023). This study emphasises the innovation of the framework for its ability to acknowledge the relationship between the macro, meso, and micro levels across the dimensions while focusing on one specific dimension, namely, Practices and Processes (PP). Another study applied RM as a conceptual framework to design the research and organise the results of an investigation conducted across universities in Japan (Bradford, 2023). Lastly, the application of RM first as a descriptive tool to frame the research in its specific context, and secondly to narrow down the scope to two concrete dimensions (Agents, Practices and Processes) together with the construction of the research questions (Konttinen, 2023) has loosely inspired our work.

Having offered an overview of the RM framework, the next section will apply this model specifically to the current research setting.

# 3. A situated analysis of the business university context through ROAD-MAPPING

Our contextual analysis is conducted in a private business university where students choose to pursue their bachelor’s degree in business administration or marketing through either English (EME/L2) or Spanish (SM/L1). The methodology employed involved a comprehensive analysis of the private university. As previously noted, Author 1’s position as a lecturer in this private institution for 15 years facilitated an emic or insider view of the setting (Moriizumi, 2020). This entailed an examination of the university’s website, consultation of course syllabi, interviewing students and staff members as well as classroom observations and general on-site observations.

The undergraduate cohorts in this private university predominantly comprise individuals aged 17 to 23. A significant proportion of these students are of Spanish origin and, being within this age range, are financially reliant on their families. Many of these students have studied abroad or attended bilingual schools, thus their English proficiency is usually high. The university welcomes international students to the EME programmes and receives on average $^ { 2 0 0 + }$ incoming students annually. The students in the EME programmes receive one EAP course $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \tilde { 6 } 0 h }$ of class time) in their second academic year. Students in the Spanish-medium strand (SM) receive English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses in the first three terms as part of their supplementary degree/diploma programmes, with an additional EAP course in their 2nd-year bachelor programme $2 4 0 \mathrm { h }$ of class time). For clarity throughout the analysis, these student groups are referred to as the EME cohort/students and the SM cohort/students.

# 3.1. Roles of English (in relation to other languages)

There are several roles that English plays in this university setting. The EME cohort mainly acquires business vocabulary through content-based subjects, while the SM cohort receives explicit English language instruction through EAP courses. The EME students are often taught by international leading business professionals and specialists in their fields, who expose them to case studies and roleplaying activities that require students to write towards a specific audience (see Nathan, 2013). However, improvements in these EME students’ proficiency levels in English have been noted as a by-product of this exposure (see also Soruç et al., 2024) rather than as direct practice. Therefore, the role of English in this EME cohort is to function as the vehicle for content learning with little or no pedagogical adaptation and without overt attention to language issues. In other words, this would be a “prototypical” English-medium education role, which is fairly extended across universities (Molino et al., 2022).

Concerning the EAP role, while both cohorts undergo a single EAP course during the second academic year, where their academic language skills are honed, students enrolled in the Spanish degree also receive extra EAP training, comprising $^ { 4 \mathrm { h } }$ of classes per week spread over three semesters ( $^ \mathrm { 1 8 0 \ h }$ in total). Within these extra EAP courses, students collaborate in groups, working on mini-thesis projects throughout the term. At the end of each term, they present their projects to the class, receiving feedback from both their peers and EAP lecturers. In the SM setting, the role of English is clearly an EAP one, where attention is specifically given to the study skills and the specific disciplinary literacies needed to learn the subject matter.

Regarding the possible role of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), the high number of international students (often with limited proficiency in Spanish) who are part of the EME groups, usually prevents content lecturers from using Spanish within the classroom. Therefore, translanguaging practices are not common as they are deemed exclusionary (see Kuteeva et al., 2020). However, outside the EME classroom, whether in corridors or offices, Spanish is frequently employed between the L1 Spanish students and L1 lecturers to clarify individual queries. Another practice identified in the EME classroom is that Spanish-speaking students tend to form monolingual subgroups where Spanish is the shared language of communication for group work brainstorming or discussion but revert to English when presenting their work to the whole classroom. This underscores the coexistence of diverse bilingual and translingual practices that deserve further research.

# 3.2. Academic Disciplines

While the business university in this current study offers various business degrees, our focus, as previously mentioned, centres on the two options available in both English and Spanish: Business Administration and Marketing. Within these degrees, students are presented with diverse academic genres. Within the EME cohort, the Business Management students cover subjects based on eco nomics, finance, corporations and business law in the first two years. In contrast, the Marketing students focus on marketing, com mercial, psychology and civil law. This suggests a potential variation in disciplinary language exposure, a topic that falls outside the scope of this paper but could be explored in future research on disciplinary language variation (see e.g. Chang, 2023; Dafouz et al., forthcoming).

Regarding written assignments, Harrington and Roche (2014) identified academic writing as a reliable measure for indicating a student’s success rate in EME courses as well as at-risk students on said courses. In this regard, the EME students undertake an aca demic English writing course, (see Practices and Processes below for expansion), as they are expected to write essays in several content subjects within their first two years of study and complete a thesis project in their final/4th academic year. The bachelor thesis research project consists of a 10,000-word dissertation and a 20-min oral presentation.

The curriculum in these EAP courses expands students’ writing repertoire by introducing them to genre-specific tasks in alignment with those classified by Gardner and Nesi (2013) and Gardner et al. (2019). This includes writing documents such as financial reports and analytical essays, ensuring they can adapt their style to suit the different communication goals typical of first- and second-year level university students in Social Science degrees (ibid, 2013). Furthermore, EAP lecturers also train students on how to strategi cally approach content-subject exams by learning how to tailor their writing style to effectively answer various question formats.

# 3.3. (Language) Management

Language policies in this business university are largely created top-down. The rectorate board, the central governing body of the university, formulates all academic regulations which are then disseminated to the lower levels including departments, faculties, and other university units. Even though the managing language of the university is Spanish, many internal written communications are bilingual (Spanish/English). For instance, public announcements on the campus platform, such as upcoming events at the university, changes in exam dates and updates on-campus facilities, are presented in both languages to ensure all students receive the information.

The university guidelines specify that English is the language of instruction for the EME programmes. Regarding language profi ciency, EME lecturers must achieve an official C1 level certificate (Common European Framework of Reference, CEFR) and are awarded a financial bonus for teaching their subject(s) through English. The minimum language requirement for students to gain entry to EME courses is an official B2 certificate (CEFR), with general or EAP certificates accepted, making certification mandatory. It has been identified that standardised test scores (e.g. TOEFL, IELTS, CAP, CPE) aid in the streamlining of students to meet English language proficiency and ensure equality among students in language-related issues, according to a study on language proficiency requirements for EME programmes (Dimova, 2020). In the case of students in the Spanish programmes, no English language certificate is required yet Spanish students typically reach university with a B2 level as English is compulsory from primary until the end of upper secondary education.

Unlike other EME settings, English as a core subject is a key feature across all bachelor’s degree programmes at this private business university, constituting 6 ECTS credits. This demonstrates the institution’s commitment to ensuring that all students achieve a high standard of English proficiency during their studies. Upon enrolment in the EAP courses, all students in both cohorts (EME/SM) undertake an internal placement test. This test serves to determine their English proficiency level and guides the composition of the learning groups of similar proficiency levels to foster a supportive learning environment. The implementation of this policy entails significant costs for the university, as it involves opening additional classes and hiring more EAP lecturers. Concurrently, this serves as a distinguishing factor for the language department as it is the only department in the university authorised to offer and develop smaller class sizes. This further highlights the university’s commitment to enhancing English proficiency for all students and aligns with research that shows that the most successful EME students are those mastering academic English skills (see Aizawa et al., 2020), as well as programmes integrating EME and EAP courses (e.g, Costa & Mastellotto, 2022; Dafouz, 2021).

Another policy set up by this private university, and less developed in public universities, is the obligatory interdepartmental meetings for all lecturers. This provides an opportunity for EME/SM content and EAP lecturers to discuss the structure and conventions of academic writing genres relevant to the course, such as financial reports, case studies or academic essays, and to consider specific vocabulary areas which should be addressed. Furthermore, in these meetings lecturers present their subjects, emphasising the specific skills they need to cover. As a result, interdisciplinary collaborations arise including the design of mandatory assignments. The implementation of this policy is discussed further in the Practices and Processes dimension below.

In addition, the university is systematic in the design and follow-up of course syllabi (or Guia Docentes in Spanish). The course syllabi outline the general aims, learning outcomes, competencies, evaluation process, assessment criteria and course content. At the beginning of each course, these syllabi must be uploaded to the Learning Management System and presented to the students on the first day. Throughout the courses, students frequently consult the syllabi, paying particular attention to the assessment criteria. When comparing the EME and the SM syllabi, it was noticed that differences emerged regarding how language issues (i.e. spelling errors) were to be assessed in both contexts (a difference which is further discussed in the Practices and Processes dimension below).

# 3.4. Agents

Agents play a pivotal role in examining the way EME programmes are implemented, and language issues are dealt with. In this analysis, we begin with the meso-level agent, the university, and continue with other micro-level agents, namely the students, their parents and alumni, who appear to be instrumental in facilitating student enrolment in this private university.

If we consider the higher education institution as one of the key Agents responsible, the private status of this business university results in high tuition fees and few scholarships. In contrast, public universities in Spain are largely funded by the government and have much lower fees (Hern´andez Armenteros et al., 2023). As mentioned previously in the language Management dimension, the university has demonstrated its commitment to enhancing English proficiency levels for all students by opening a sufficient number of groups to cater for their EAP needs.

As already anticipated in section 3, students enrolled in this private institution have often studied abroad for at least one year in an English-speaking environment before reaching university and/or attended (private) English-speaking schools in Spain to enhance their proficiency. An understanding of students’ motivation to enrol on these EME/SM courses requires considering various factors (Dornyei, ¨ 2019; Dornyei ¨ et al., 2014; Ushioda, 2011). There are two types of agents, parents and alumni, who to our knowledge have not been examined in-depth in the EME literature and yet seem to play an important role in private institutions. In this setting, parents intervene in the decision-making process of enrolment by providing the financial support students need. As noted in the general introduction of section 3, these students are economically parent-dependent. It is important to note that private universities in Spain rely on student tuition, which is significantly higher compared to state-run universities. Also, parents often act as advocates for studying in English, since they see the added value of English in an increasingly globalised world, where proficiency in additional languages is an asset in international companies and demanded by prospective employers (Komori-Glatz & Schmidt-Unterberger, 2018).

Additionally, recruiters, who are generally recent graduates or alumni from the university working in the admissions department, are involved in the enrolment process of this private university and participate in national events like AULA (an annual trade fair where universities present their prospective courses to students). These alumni play a crucial role in shaping students’ decisions when enrolling in degree programmes. Their proximity in terms of age creates relatability and fosters credibility in the eyes of the students. Alumni, furthermore, address concerns related to language medium, cultural adaptation, and academic challenges, providing valuable guidance, acting as influential connectors, and bridging the gap between prospective students and the university experience.

As for content lecturers, they tend not to consider that their role within the EME classroom is to deal with language issues since they feel this would take from the content element (see Airey, 2012; TAEC EMI Handbook, 2019). Students, however, tend to believe that if they enrol in EME programmes their proficiency level of English will improve (Macaro & Akıncıoglu, ˘ 2018). Thus, the conflict of interests at play between the role of the content lecturers and student beliefs in the maintenance or enhancement of English-language proficiency demonstrates the importance of further investigating in this area, as is done in the understanding of the Practices and Processes dimension.

Lastly, the EAP lecturers teaching in both these EME and SM strands provide deep insights into the English language proficiency of students and tailor their classes around their specific needs. As a result, such EAP lecturers are consistently praised for the practical approach of their courses in the annual student surveys of the university – a positive view also reported in the studies of Arno-Maci ´ \`a et al. (2020). Moreover, their EAP training, primarily focused on language education and teaching strategies, positions these agents in a privileged place to provide professional development courses and enhance the student-centred ethos of the university. Consequently, incorporating their expertise in the successful delivery of EME courses is necessary if we want these programmes to reach their full potential in terms of English proficiency and disciplinary learning.

# 3.5. Practices and Processes

This private business university largely models its practices on developing a student-centred learning environment and on tailoring the subjects to the professional needs of the students. Pedagogical practices are said to be intrinsically linked with the beliefs and ideologies of teachers (Buehl & Beck, 2014). A recent study conducted by Curry and P´erez-Paredes (2021) focusing on the beliefs of Spanish lecturers in EME found that $9 5 \%$ of lecturers claim to encourage student participation, while $7 5 \%$ actively engaged in groupwork activities. In this university setting, group work is actively encouraged in all courses, comprising a minimum of $3 0 \%$ of the overall grade in the syllabus. Group work is viewed as a way to build communities, which is key in the EME classroom, as it fosters more language involvement from inhibited students (Smit, 2013).

Both EAP and content lecturers actively contribute to a hands-on learning environment by integrating market-relevant content and developing case studies or mandatory assignments with an entrepreneurial focus. Rivero and Ubierna (2021) surveyed 971 undergraduate students and discovered that when lecturers set clear expectations for their students, especially in entrepreneurship, it positively impacted their entrepreneurial intentions.

Regarding the aforementioned interdepartmental review meetings, (see language Management dimensions above), where EAP and content lecturers share and discuss course content and the literacy practices needed in their respective subjects, it was noticed that specific content is introduced into the language courses. For instance, SM students studying marketing concepts like ‘Customer Insights’ had these concepts incorporated into the mandatory assignment of the EAP course for that term. This allowed students from the SM cohort, to practice newly developed skills and transfer them into English. For example, the mandatory assignment for the EAP course was the creation of a Public Awareness campaign. To understand the target audience for the campaign, the students conducted a data analysis focusing on behaviours, needs and preferences, using techniques acquired in their marketing coursework. During class presentations, peer observation allowed students to correct each other not only on language but also on concepts. Overall, this collaborative approach was deemed beneficial for both students and lecturers. However, in the EME case, the differing perspectives among EME lecturers on their language-related responsibilities may hinder their effectiveness. In sum, EAP lecturers are instrumental in guiding these meetings towards productive outcomes and mitigating potential conflicts of interest.

When it comes to the academic writing course, mentioned in Academic Disciplines, this university setting offers a comprehensive learning experience. Students gain practical experience through a central component: a 2000-word mini-thesis on a business or marketing project. This allows them to not only apply theoretical knowledge but also refine their academic writing skills. In addition, a strong emphasis is placed on referencing and citation techniques, along with the proper use of paraphrasing to ethically integrate external sources. Furthermore, students need to present the principal ideas of the written project in groups, strengthening their oral presentation skills.

Assessment criteria included in the course syllabi, as mentioned in the language Management dimension, must be provided to all students in this business university. A common practice among content lecturers in the Spanish-medium programmes involves including an orthographical component, which stipulates that students who make spelling mistakes in Spanish receive lower grades. Interestingly, this assessment component is often missing from the course syllabi in the EME programmes, even though frequently the same lecturer teaches the EME and SM cohorts. This difference in assessment may reflect some lecturers’ conviction that in EME the language component is beyond their responsibilities (Lasagabaster, 2022; Mancho-Bar´es & Aguilar-P´erez, 2020; Melchor & Walsh, 2022). Concurrently, it implies that the EME students may not be actively supported in their writing skills, unlike the SM students who receive regular corrective feedback from their EAP lecturers for four semesters.

# 3.6. Internationalisation and Glocalisation

From the university’s perspective, and like most universities across the globe, internationalisation has become a general means to improve rankings (Bowles & Murphy, 2020; Buckner, 2022). In the 2024 edition of the Ranking CYD, an online survey of Spanish universities, this university secured the 5th position for International Mobility for both students and professors (Ranking CYD, 2024). Notably, this distinction was attained within two years of establishing its ERASMUS $^ +$ Charter, highlighting the university’s rapid ascent in the international sphere.

Glocalisation, on the other hand, is seen as a way for a university to present itself as a global institution whilst maintaining its local identity (Dafouz & Smit, 2020; P´erez-Paredes & Curry, 2023). From a local and institutional perspective, offering EME degrees attracts international lecturers which, in turn, improves university rankings, increases prestige and leads to the enrolment of more students. Furthermore, providing students with extended Internship placements in companies and encouraging business practitioners to deliver talks and courses strengthens the relationship between the business university and the local market.

From the students’ (and also their parents’) perspective, internationalisation is regularly cited as a reason to do their degree in English. English-taught programmes are seen as an opportunity to enhance student CVs on a global scale, enhance their career prospects and develop a more international mindset (Dafouz & Smit, 2022; Rose et al., 2020).

Finally, lecturers are provided with opportunities to engage in exchange teaching programmes abroad, attend international conferences, and complete the Higher Education Academy (HEA) fellowship programme (i.e. international recognition of teaching and learning in Higher Education aligned with the UK Professional Standards Framework and with whom the university holds an agreement). This shapes an international ethos which embraces an international perspective by holding international business and marketing conferences. Simultaneously, the university maintains a local national presence by connecting with national and local businesses and marketing companies.

After examining the higher education institution from the RM perspective, the next step is to discuss the comprehensive view obtained from such analysis, the interconnectedness of the dimensions and their explanatory power and conclude by putting forward some emerging research questions that stem from this analysis.

# 4. Discussing the comprehensive view and interrelatedness of the ROAD-MAPPING dimensions

Building upon the situational analysis, which highlighted the contrasting background of EME and SM students with English classes in a specific business university setting, this section discusses the interrelations between dimensions.

Table 1 provides a summary of the principal descriptive factors associated with each RM dimension in the context of this specific business university setting.

# 4.1. The interrelation of the dimensions

To begin with, it is important to remember that the dimensions should not be considered in isolation and that changes in one dimension may have an effect on other dimensions (Dafouz & Smit, 2020). These dimensions interact dynamically, reflecting the non-linear nature of RM. The framework enables users to zoom in and out of the different dimensions and through their interrela tionship, uncover the intricate connections between them.

Against this complex EME background that RM enabled us to describe, the overall aim of this analysis was to examine which contextual factors may contribute to students’ development of English proficiency. The dimension Roles of English (in relation to Other languages) was at the heart of the investigation but, as was shown, the context could not have been fully explored without recognising all the other dimensions.

In this respect, RM allowed us to explore the university itself as a key Agent (A) responsible for centralising the language Man agement (M) policies and implementing them from a top-down perspective. This revealed a coordinated effort to organise interdepartmental meetings between content lecturers and EAP professionals which contributed significantly to the design of languageoriented course syllabi. In turn, this interdisciplinary design of course syllabi resulted in including concrete disciplinary business practices (AD) which impacted the types of activities and methodologies (PP) that content lecturers, EAP professionals and students engaged in. The framework also revealed differences in the assessment practices (PP) depending on the language of instruction used, whether English or Spanish. The course syllabi (M), mentioned in section 3.5, highlighted that orthographical evaluation standards differed between the Spanish and English strands. Thus, while spelling mistakes were penalised in the Spanish strand, they were disregarded in the English one.

By highlighting the interrelationship between dimensions, we can identify the different perceived roles that content lecturers and the EAP professionals (A) fulfil in developing students’ English proficiency. In other words, while content lecturers may implicitly teach vocabulary within their subject course (RO, PP), EAP professionals provide focused language instruction (PP). We can also see how the roles of English (RO) is largely understood as a medium of instruction and as a lingua franca in the EME context, with little or no pedagogical focus, while in the SM setting English is viewed largely as an academic foreign language that students need to practice explicitly to progress in their studies. From the point of view of Internationalisation and Glocalisation (ING), placing this dimension as a core aspect of university life results in emphasising the importance of English for all students (not just EME) and the promotion and development of EAP programmes within this institution. Luckily, this strategy navigates in the opposite direction of what is seen in other university institutions, at least in the Spanish context, where many EAP programmes have been recently discontinued (see Arno-Maci ´ \`a & Aguilar-P´erez, 2018; Dafouz et al., 2023). Along with this internationalisation strategy, strong links are built with local communities by connecting with national and local businesses and marketing companies, in an effort to be active glocally, that is, at the global and the local level. This glocal view has implications for students’ development of bi/multilingual repertoires (RO) to work

at home and abroad.

Before concluding, our RM analysis also unveiled other types of Agents (A), parents and alumni, not examined in previous studies, but who seem to play an important role in influencing students’ decisions to enrol in an EME programme, particularly at this private business university. Further research into private universities could investigate these Agents further.

All in all, the use of the RM framework revealed a holistic and complex picture of EME – one where different areas usually examined in a fragmented way are now viewed in a multidimensional fashion.

# 4.2. Further research questions stemming from the RM analysis

The interrelationships identified above warrant further investigation and create opportunities for future research. For the sake of clarity, Fig. 2 displays some of the questions stemming from our RM analysis and points to different ways in which EME programmes can be further examined by researchers and practitioners working in similar educational contexts.

# 5. Conclusions and implications for EAP programmes

This study set out to show how RM is a useful conceptual and analytical framework for examining comprehensively EME pro grammes. As described throughout this paper, the application of RM to a private business university unravelled a complex social picture, somewhat different to public universities (at least in the Spanish setting) and allowed us to explore interesting and sometimes overlooked connections between dimensions that may seem to be, in principle, unrelated.

In brief, our study showed the interrelations between university involvement in organising regular interdepartmental meetings between two sets of Agents, content lecturers and EAP professionals, and their impact on course syllabi and classroom practices, particularly in explicitly and systematically addressing language-related issues. Additionally, integrating Internationalisation and Glocalisation as a fundamental aspect of university life and highlighting the importance of English for all students, beyond EME settings, also highlighted the active promotion and development of EAP programmes and methodologies within the institution.

Regarding implications for EAP, our situated analysis advocates the systematic collaboration between EAP specialists and content lecturers in EME settings. In line with previous research (e.g. Arno-Maci ´ a \` & Aguilar-P´erez, 2018; Dafouz & Gray, 2022; Lasagabaster, 2018; bib_rmfg_2022Ruiz Madrid & Fortanet Gomez, ´ 2022; Wingate, 2022; Yuan, 2021), we believe that “far from being redundant, EAP courses in EME should be envisaged as an opportunity to seriously rethink teaching and learning and introduce innovation” (Dafouz & Smit, 2020, p. 10). In this respect, the use of the RM framework is deemed useful as it offers, on the one hand, content lecturers the chance to view more distinctly the linguistic implications of EME, often perceived as unimportant and, on the other, enables EAP specialists to widen the lens and address the sociolinguistic aspects which usually go beyond their professional expertise. Finally, the RM framework is not without its challenges. Dafouz and Smit (2016, 2020, 2023) have discussed the complex nature of the dimensions as well as some potential overlaps (see Komori-Glatz, 2023; Shao & Carson, 2023). Yet, it is precisely the interrelatedness of the dimensions that, as we argued hereby, can provide a more holistic, comprehensive and unexpected picture of the EME scenario in focus, allowing researchers to look beyond the obvious.
