# INTRODUCTION

Collocations have been of considerable interest to applied linguistics and SLA researchers, due to their pervasiveness in language. In corpus research, collocations are broadly defined as pairs of content words like nouns and adjectives that appear more frequently in language than the occurrence frequency of the individual words would predict (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, and Finegan 1999). Typical examples in English are heavy rain and strong wind. As conventional forms of expression, collocations may be used to express concepts in an efficient manner, or serve as phrasal terminology in technical, scientific, or academic discourse (e.g., Schmitt and Carter 2004).

Research has shown that L2 learners tend to produce many collocations that are deviant or non-nativelike (e.g., \*make a photo) in their speech (Nekrasova 2009) and writing (e.g., Durrant and Schmitt 2009; Laufer and Waldman 2010). Although the evidence is far from conclusive, it is generally thought that L2 collocation knowledge develops slowly, and therefore does not always show up at the level of productive use (e.g., Durrant and Schmitt 2010). A better understanding of why this might be the case requires a closer look at the variables that may affect the learnability of collocations.

# LEARNING COLLOCATIONS FROM MEANING-FOCUSED INPUT

Input frequency is thought to play an important role in L2 collocation learning (e.g., Durrant and Schmitt 2010). Recent studies have demonstrated that the occurrence frequency of word sequences in L2 input predicts how fast learners process those word sequences (e.g., Northbrook, Allen, and Conklin 2021; Sonbul et al. 2022). There is also increasing evidence that advanced L2 learners are sensitive to the distributional properties of L2 collocations in measures of receptive knowledge and processing (e.g., Ellis et al. 2008; Öksüz et al. 2020). However, learning materials used in classroombased contexts do not always provide a faithful reflection of the collocation patterns that are conventional or common to native speakers (Northbrook et al. 2021). Further, learners tend to have less L2 exposure than native speakers. Compared to words, individual collocations and other formulaic expressions also have low occurrence frequency in naturalistic language input (e.g., Cobb 2019). For learners who have little contact with the L2, the memory trace left by an encounter with a collocation may fade before the next encounter, which might hinder the implicit pairing of words that results in collocation knowledge (Durrant and Schmitt 2010). Implicit collocation learning is therefore likely to be a slow process that requires a substantial amount of linguistic evidence (Ellis et al. 2008).

One way of supporting the uptake of collocations from authentic L2 input is through meaningfocused activities, such as reading, reading-while-listening, and viewing audiovisual input. Several studies have shown that learners can pick up collocation knowledge from these activities (e.g., Pellicer-Sánchez 2017; Puimège and Peters 2020; Webb et al. 2013), although purely incidental exposure does not always result in durable gains (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016). One explanation for this might be the low salience of collocations in L2 input. Several theories of SLA hold that inputbased L2 learning relies not just on exposure frequency, but also on learners’ degree of attention to L2 form (e.g., Laufer and Hulstijn 2001; Schmidt 2001). Features of the L2 input which attract learners’ attention are more likely to be retained in memory, as for instance evidenced in eye-tracking studies (e.g., Godfroid et al. 2013).

It is widely assumed that the salience of L2 features can be related to physical characteristics (e.g., spacing, prosody) as well as contextual, functional, and semantic properties, such as degree of predictability and processing difficulty (e.g., Ellis 2018). For instance, unpredictable words, or words that cause comprehension difficulties (e.g., due to novelty or contextual incongruity) are more likely to induce noticing than contextually redundant or highly predictable words (VanPatten 1996). Formulaic expressions that are strongly associated with communicative meaning, such as speech formulae, or whose form-meaning association does not match learners’ expectations, such as figurative idioms, may induce increased processing efforts, for example because of a garden-path effect or surprisal (e.g., Ellis, 2018). On the other hand, word combinations that are highly predictable, for example semantically transparent collocations (e.g., strong tea), do not necessarily induce increased processing effort. When encountered in context, they may not be perceived as functional or meaningful (Boers et al. 2014). Due to their low salience, L2 knowledge of transparent collocations may take longer to develop compared to more idiomatic or less transparent formulaic expressions. Several authors have therefore proposed that L2 learners need to be made aware of the collocational restrictions of words, in particular when collocations are highly transparent and do not have a literal or word-for-word L1 equivalent (Boers & Lindstromberg 2009).

# PROMOTING L2 COLLOCATION LEARNING: INPUT ENHANCEMENT

Recent studies have explored the use of typographic enhancement (TE) to increase learners’ noticing and uptake of L2 collocations in meaning-focused activities (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016; Puimège et al. 2021; Vu and Peters 2020; 2022). Typographic enhancement involves the use of typographic techniques such as bolding, underlining, or coloring, to make elements of a written text more visually salient. This may cause learners to shift their attention between meaning comprehension and focus on form (Pellicer-Sánchez & Boers 2019).

There is some evidence to suggest that TE may stimulate learners’ attention to, and learning of collocations encountered during reading. Peters (2012) examined the effect of TE on learners’ uptake of German formulaic phrases during reading. Participants read a German text containing enhanced (bold $^ +$ underlined) and unenhanced words and phrases, and were encouraged to write down any unfamiliar German vocabulary appearing in the reading material. Learning was measured using a preand posttest of form recall, in which participants had to translate German words and phrases from the text. The results showed that phrases that were enhanced in the input were written down more often and recalled better immediately after reading, which suggests that TE guided learners’ attention to the formulaic phrases, and promoted learning of those phrases. Choi (2017) used eye-tracking and offline tests to examine the effects of TE on learners’ attention to, and learning of collocations from reading. Participants read a short passage containing enhanced (bold) and unenhanced collocations while their eye movements were recorded. Their knowledge of the collocations was tested before and after the treatment in a form recall test (L1-L2 translation). Choi found that visual enhancement led to longer reading times for novel collocations, and that TE was associated with higher performance in the immediate posttest.

Whereas Peters (2012) and Choi (2017) only reported positive effects of TE on immediate recall of collocations, a few studies have found that TE may also promote long-term retention of L2 collocation knowledge. In a study by Szudarski and Carter (2016), combining TE with repetition in reading texts had a positive effect on recall and recognition after a two-week delay. Crucially, repeated exposure by itself did not result in durable collocation knowledge. This finding suggests that TE may promote the development of collocation knowledge at the level of form recall when repeated exposure by itself does not have a durable effect on learning. Szudarski and Carter (2016) interpret this finding in relation to the Involvement Load Hypothesis (Laufer and Hulstijn 2001), which predicts that the effectiveness of a vocabulary learning activity relies heavily on the “cognitive elaboration” that occurs during learning (Szudarski and Carter 2016: 260). Szudarski and Carter (2016) argued that TE may promote attention to the form and meaning of new phrases when there is no communicative need to pay special attention to the lexical composition of those phrases. This increased attention may benefit retention of the form of the collocation, and potentially also its associated meaning. However, as Szudarski and Carter point out, there is no guarantee that TE will induce attention to all features of the highlighted form, and what exactly learners attend to when they encounter enhanced collocations remains unclear. Nevertheless, the effect of TE in combination with repetition seems to promote collocation learning. In two more recent longitudinal studies, Vu and Peters (2020, 2022) investigated the effects of different input modes (reading-only, reading with TE, reading-while-listening, readingwhile-listening with TE) on L2 collocation learning over a nine-week period. Participants read graded readers containing new collocations, and knowledge of the collocations was measured in delayed tests of form recall. In both studies, the enhanced condition led to the highest gains.

The studies discussed above all focused on collocation learning at the level of form recall. This aspect of knowledge is commonly measured because many collocations are semantically transparent and can easily be understood in context (e.g., Peters 2012). Only a few previous studies have investigated the effects of enhancement for other knowledge aspects. For example, Sonbul and Schmitt (2013) examined the effect of TE on L1 and L2 speakers’ implicit and explicit knowledge of medical collocations (e.g., cloud baby) with highly specialized meanings. Implicit collocation knowledge was measured in a primed lexical decision task comparing response times for words primed by their collocate (e.g., cloud  baby), compared to a non-associated prime (e.g., steam  baby). Although TE promoted recall and recognition of collocations, the study found no evidence of collocation priming.

In a partial replication of Sonbul and Schmitt (2013), Toomer and Elgort (2019) increased the amount of input and the duration of the experiment to optimize conditions for implicit collocation learning. Collocations were encountered nine times either in enhanced (bold) or unenhanced form. Evidence of collocation priming was only found in the unenhanced condition. The authors suggested that the repeated use of TE may have obstructed the creation of an ‘accurate mental model’ of the contexts in which the collocations appeared, thereby preventing the expansion of lexical and semantic representations of words (Toomer and Elgort 2019: 426).

In a recent study, Northbrook, Allen and Conklin (2021) examined the effects of repetition and TE (underlining) on learners’ response times to lexical bundles (e.g., set off home, tired and hungry) in a phrase acceptability judgement task. Participants read stories interspersed with iterations of the phrasal judgement task, so that response times could be measured after each exposure. The results showed that repetition had a significant effect on response times after only a few exposures, in contrast to the findings of Toomer and Elgort (2019). Although TE initially promoted faster response times, its effect was quickly overridden by the effect of repetition, suggesting that learners’ visual recognition of word sequences may speed up as a result of repeated exposure regardless of the degree conscious attention.

Most previous studies examining the effects of TE and exposure frequency have combined the two variables in a single experiment (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016; Toomer and Elgort 2019). In these studies, exposure frequency was controlled by increasing the number of occurrences of target collocations in the input, i.e., through input flooding. Although this can be an efficient method of controlling the input frequency of collocations, input flooding may serve as an attention-drawing method in its own right. Consequently, when the same collocation is repeated and at the same time visually enhanced in a single text, the observed effect of TE can be expected to be much stronger compared to that of a single enhanced exposure.

From a pedagogical point of view, textually enhancing several exposures to collocations may not always be feasible for L2 teachers. Further, as Toomer and Elgort (2019) pointed out, authentic L2 texts such as university textbooks and graded readers rarely make use of repeated TE. Specialized terms and phrases are typically only highlighted in the first exposure, when the term or phrase is introduced. The question of whether beneficial effects of TE persist when only the first exposure is enhanced, remains open for investigation.

The present study examines the effects of TE on L2 collocation processing during reading, as well as the effects of repeated exposure and TE on L2 collocation knowledge. Unlike most previous studies combining TE and repetition, our study examines to what extent TE affects processing in the first

enhanced exposure, and in later, unenhanced exposures. The study addresses the following research questions:

1. What is the effect of TE on online processing of new collocations during reading? 2. Does TE affect learners’ knowledge of new collocations after repeated exposure during reading?

# METHODOLOGY

# Participants

Sixty-one Dutch-speaking students from various study programs at Flemish universities took part in the experiment. Students participated for course credit or a monetary compensation. Their prior vocabulary knowledge was estimated using the Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT; Schmitt, Schmitt, and Clapham 2001). Participant-related information is summarized in Table 1. Data from four participants were excluded due to absence in one of the experimental sessions, or track loss in the eye movement data.

# [TABLE 1 NEAR HERE]

# Reading materials and collocations

Participants read 10 English texts containing eight occurrences of 24 collocations in total. The first text (approx. 2,000 words) consisted of edited passages of a popular science book (Godfrey-Smith 2016). The remaining nine texts (each approx. 400 words) contained edited passages of TED-ed scripts similar in topic and lexical profile to the first reading text. The materials were selected in order to find a large number of items that each occurred repeatedly in texts of manageable length and difficulty. Although the longer text used in Session 1 and the shorter texts of Session 2 were of different genres, they were very similar in terms of style (“popular science”) and difficulty. All experimental texts were edited so that (a) at least $9 5 \%$ of the word tokens (including the target collocations) belonged to the 3,000 most frequent word families in English, and (b) each of the target items appeared exactly eight times in total: twice in Session 1 (text 1), and six times in Session 2 (texts 2-10). The edited texts were checked for naturalness and grammatical correctness by three native speakers of English.

We selected 24 transparent modifier-noun collocations with technical or context-specific meanings that appeared in the original texts. A few of these (e.g., sensitive cells, reflecting skin) were adapted from their original form (e.g., light-detecting cells, reflecting cells), so that the same single word component did not appear in more than one target item. Most target collocations consisted of words with high occurrence frequency in the COCA $M = 9 2$ per million, $S D = 7 7$ ). Three lowerfrequency words were either cognates (reflex) or transparent compounds (workspace, pinhole). By selecting low-frequency and technical or context-specific collocations, we could assume that most items would be entirely novel to the participants. Prior knowledge of the target collocations was

checked in post-experiment interviews. One target item (action potential) was excluded, because nine participants reported having prior knowledge of this collocation. The reading materials and target collocations can be found at https://osf.io/3ancg/?view_only=c0f90dc441be484896550f05bc86e475.

# Treatment conditions

The study adopted a mixed design combining between-participants and within-participants comparisons (see Table 2). Participants were assigned to one of the conditions according to their order of participation (participant 1 was assigned to condition 1, participant 2 to condition 2, etc.). In order to examine the effect of the treatment on collocation knowledge, exposure to the target collocations was a between-participants variable. Participants in the experimental group $( n = 4 1$ ) read English texts containing the target collocations, while participants in the comparison group $( n = 1 6$ ) read a version of the same texts not containing target collocations. In this version, we deleted the modifiers of the collocations (e.g., ‘reflecting skin’ ‘skin’), or through paraphrasing where needed (e.g., ‘sensitive cells’  ‘cells that capture light’).

Textual enhancement was a counterbalanced within-participants variable. Participants in the experimental group were assigned to one of two versions of the first of ten texts, each containing 12 enhanced and 12 unenhanced collocations. Enhancement was operationalized through bold font in order to facilitate the comparison with previous studies examining the effect of TE on collocation learning (e.g., Choi 2017; Toomer and Elgort 2019). Collocations that were enhanced in Version 1, were unenhanced in Version 2, and vice versa, so that all 24 target items appeared in both conditions in the full data set. Enhanced and unenhanced items were alternated in the texts. Note that in the enhanced condition, collocations only appeared in bold in their first occurrence in the reading texts. The remaining 7 occurrences were unenhanced for all items. This allowed us to investigate the effect of TE on online processing in later, unenhanced exposures.

# Instruments

The data collection instruments consisted of a form recall test, a form recognition test, and a sentencereading task. The three posttests can be found at   
https://osf.io/3ancg/?view_only=c0f90dc441be484896550f05bc86e475.   
The form recall test had a sentence cloze format. Target collocations appeared in informative sentences describing their meaning, and participants were instructed to provide the correct modifier (e.g., dead) based on the associated noun (e.g., zone) and the sentence context. The test contained all target collocations, and all distractors from the sentence-reading posttest. The distractors were included in order to control for learning from the sentence-reading posttest (see below). Some were taken from Sonbul and Schmitt’s (2013) list of medical collocations (e.g., cloud baby, split hand),

while others were found in TED-ed videos and other texts about scientific topics (e.g., marine snow, dry bite). Two example items from the form recall test are presented in Table 3.

# [TABLE 3 NEAR HERE]

The form recognition test contained the same sentences as the form recall test, but participants had to select the correct modifier from four options. Participants were allowed to guess or select an option randomly when they did not know the correct response. We coded different response types after the data collection, based on participants’ responses in a retrospective interview (see Interviews). Two examples are presented in Table 4.

# [TABLE 4 NEAR HERE]

Finally, to establish whether repeated exposure to the target collocations had an effect on reading times, participants also completed a sentence-reading task immediately after the experimental treatment. The task contained three types of target item: (1) target collocations from the reading texts, (2) matched control items, and (3) distractor items (see Table 3). The 24 target collocations from the reading texts were included in the posttest, in order to determine how participants processed these collocations after multiple exposures during reading. In addition, the test contained 24 matched control collocations, each containing the same modifier as their matched target item (e.g., human) but a different noun (e.g., weight). The control items were included in order to find out whether participants developed a sensitivity to the collocational restrictions of the target items by reading them repeatedly in the texts.

Although the nouns of the target-control pairs were matched for number of characters and occurrence frequency in the COCA, we did not control the input frequency of the single word components. The nouns of target collocations appeared in the input with considerably higher frequency $( M = ~ 1 7 . 3 3 , S D$ $= 1 4 . 2 5 )$ ) than the nouns of control collocations $M = 2 . 6 7$ , $S D = 3 . 5 5$ ), and some nouns in control items did not appear in the reading texts at all. Because effects of word frequency on reading times might complicate the comparison of the experimental conditions, we do not report the results of the sentence-reading posttest in the present paper. However, the test stimuli can be found here: https://osf.io/3ancg/?view_only=c0f90dc441be484896550f05bc86e475.

After completing the posttests, participants were interviewed about their responses in the form recognition test, and about their perception of the experimental treatment. First, they were asked to explain their motivation for each response in the form recognition posttest. The interviewer (the first author) asked the following questions:

1. Which response did you select?   
2. Why did you select this response?   
3. How certain are you that this response is correct (expressed in a percentage)?   
4. Had you already learned this collocation elsewhere before you read the texts?

This series of questions helped us determine to what extent responses in the form recognition test truly reflected collocational knowledge remembered from the reading texts, and not, for example, guessing based on semantic knowledge of the single word components or prior knowledge.

Participants were also interviewed about their perception of the experimental treatment. They were asked the following questions:

1. Do you remember encountering enhanced collocations in the first text in Session 1?   
2. Did you try to memorize any collocations during reading in Sessions 1 and 2?   
3. Did you notice that some collocations occurred several times in the reading texts?

Participants could elaborate on their responses if they wanted to. The results of the interview were not analyzed quantitatively, but will be discussed in relation to the interpretation of the eye-tracking data and posttest scores.

# Procedure

Data were collected individually in three sessions, over a period of three weeks. In Session 1, participants read the first of ten experimental texts while their eye movements were recorded with the Eyelink Portable Duo of SR Research. Participants were seated in front of a $1 , 2 8 0 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 1 , 0 2 4$ resolution monitor, their head resting on a table-mounted chin rest. The text was presented in Courier, 16-pt font, at a viewing distance of $7 3 \mathrm { c m }$ , so that each character corresponded to . $. 3 ^ { \circ }$ of visual angle. Eye movement data were recorded for the dominant eye only, at a sampling rate of ${ 2 , 0 0 0 } \mathrm { H z }$ . The text was presented across 25 screens, each followed by a drift check, to allow for recalibration of the eyetracker when necessary. A short break and recalibration were inserted after 12 screens. The 24 target collocations appeared twice in the first reading text. None of the target collocations immediately preceded or followed a line break or punctuation. Participants were instructed to read the text attentively. They were also informed that they would complete questions about the content afterwards. After reading the text, they completed three open-ended comprehension questions, followed by the 2K, 3K, 5K and 10K levels of the VLT.

Session 2 occurred after a one-week interval. In this session, participants read the remaining nine texts containing six unenhanced occurrences of each target collocation, in random order. Each text was presented across five screens, followed by a true-or-false comprehension question. Two short breaks were inserted after the third and sixth text. Afterwards, participants completed the sentencereading posttest, in which they read 60 sentences, one by one. Following previous studies (e.g., Carrol and Conklin 2019), one-third of the sentences were followed by a true-or-false question (at random intervals) to encourage attentive reading. Sentences were presented in random order, each on a separate screen, followed by a drift check. After 30 sentences, participants received a short break, and the eye-tracker was recalibrated.

In Session 3, one week later, participants completed the form recall and form recognition tests. They were also interviewed about their responses in the form recognition posttest, and about their perception of the experimental treatment. Finally, participants were debriefed about the aims of the experiment.

# Data cleaning and scoring

Binary scoring was applied to responses in the posttests. Based on the interview responses, the results for one target item (action potential) and two distractor items (mass number, shell shock) were excluded from analysis. At least $1 5 \%$ of participants reported having prior knowledge of these collocations or their Dutch equivalent (“massagetal” is the literal Dutch translation of mass number). In the form recall test, we applied a strict and lenient scoring. In the lenient scoring, misspelled or approximate responses were coded as correct. In the strict scoring, misspelled or approximate responses (e.g., ‘reflective’ instead of ‘reflecting’) were coded as incorrect (0). Because most collocations consisted of highly frequent single word constituents, the number of misspelled items was very low (23 items in total, or less than $1 \%$ of responses). Results of both scoring systems are reported and discussed below.

Eye-tracking data were visually inspected in the Eyelink Data Viewer. Vertical drift was corrected manually, and lines of text or trials where considerable drift occurred were deleted. Additionally, data from two participants were discarded due to track loss. This resulted in the removal of $6 \%$ of interest areas. Next, the default four-step cleaning procedure of Data Viewer was used to merge or remove overly short or long fixations. In total, 41.080 fixations were deleted, and 1.859 fixations were merged, leaving 558.547 fixations for analysis. The final data set only included eyetracking data for the target collocations and component words.

# Analysis

All data were analyzed in mixed effects models, using the lmer and glmer functions of the lme4 package in R (version 1.1-21, Bates et al. 2015). Each model included random intercepts for target items and participants, but no random slopes (adding random slopes for Item condition/TE caused convergence errors in lme4). Model assumptions (linearity, homogeneity of variance, normal distribution of residuals) were checked, and outliers were identified based on the studentized residuals of the mixed models. Residuals with a value above 2.5 were removed (Godfroid 2020).

We first analyzed the effect of TE on visual processing of target collocations during reading. We focused on four outcome variables: log-transformed total reading time $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ continuous variable, sum of all fixations on the interest area for the entire collocation, including rereading times) for the collocation and for both component words, and final-word skipping $^ { \prime } =$ binary variable, skipped or not skipped). All models included fixed effects for TE (enhanced, unenhanced), Exposure count (eightlevel factor), and their interaction. Grand-mean centered log-transformed item frequency, as well as

item length were included as covariates. To interpret the interaction between TE and Exposure count, Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons were conducted using the emmeans function in the emmeans package (version 1.4, Lenth 2018). We focused on the comparison of the enhanced and unenhanced conditions for each of the eight exposures.

Next, we analyzed the effect of the treatment on item-level binary scores (“correct” or “incorrect”) in the form recognition posttest, using the glmer function. The analysis was conducted in two steps. First, a model was run to determine the learning effect from the treatment. The model contained fixed effects for Group (experimental group, comparison group), Item condition (target item, distractor item), and their interaction, and total VLT score as covariate. Pairwise comparisons were conducted to break down the interaction between Group and Item condition. The second model analyzed the effect of TE. This model was run on the results of the experimental group, and only contained fixed effects for TE (enhanced, unenhanced) and total VLT score. We only report descriptive results for the form recall test, because only a small proportion of responses in this test were coded as correct (7.7 percent with strict scoring, 9 percent with lenient scoring).

# Research question 1

Figures 1-4 present the results of the mixed models with four dependent variables: log-transformed total reading times on the full collocation, for word 1 (modifier), and for word 2 (noun), and finalword skipping. The full output of the models can be found in the supporting materials: https://osf.io/3ancg/?view_only=c0f90dc441be484896550f05bc86e475. With Exposure 1 as the reference category of Exposure count, there were significant main effects of Exposure count and TE on Total Reading Time for collocations and component words, as well as a significant interaction between these variables. For final-word skipping, the main effect of TE, and the interaction between TE and Exposure Count were non-significant.

Pairwise comparisons for reading times on the collocation indicate that TE significantly predicted reading times in the first and fourth exposures. In the first exposure of Session 1, reading times were significantly longer in the enhanced condition $( B = 0 . 2 2 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ . In Session 2, reading times were shorter for enhanced collocations in Exposure 4 $( B = - 0 . 0 7 , p = . 0 2 7 )$ . Pairwise comparisons for reading times on the modifier show a similar trend. For the first word TE also significantly predicted reading times in the first and fourth exposures, with significantly longer reading times were in the enhanced condition in Exposure 1 $( B = 0 . 2 0 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and significantly shorter reading times for enhanced collocations in Exposure 4 $( B = - 0 . 0 7 , p = . 0 4 9 )$ . For reading times on the noun, TE only significantly predicted reading times in the first exposure, with significantly longer reading times in the enhanced condition $( B = 0 . 1 6 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ . Finally, the pairwise comparison for final-word skipping showed that the effect of TE was non-significant in all exposures.

# Research question 2

The output of the mixed models for scores on the form recognition test can be found in the OSF: https://osf.io/3ancg/?view_only=c0f90dc441be484896550f05bc86e475. The main effect of Item condition, and the interaction between Item condition and Group were significant. Pairwise comparisons showed that the estimated odds of a correct response in the form recognition posttest were significantly higher for target items than for distractors in the comparison group $( B = - 0 . 7 8 , p =$ .027), and in the experimental group $( B = - 1 . 7 2 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ . The $B$ estimates show that the effect was much larger in the experimental group, hence the significant interaction between Group and Item condition. The pairwise comparisons also reveal that odds of a correct response were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the comparison group for target items $( B = - 0 . 7 2 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , but not for distractors $( B = 0 . 2 3 , p = 0 . 2 0 )$ . In a separate model focusing on the results of the experimental group, the effect of TE yielded a small, significant difference between enhanced and unenhanced items $( B = - 0 . 3 4 p = . 0 3 7 )$ . Total VLT score was also a significant predictor of posttest scores in both models.

# DISCUSSION

The first aim of the study was to examine how TE (bolding) affects collocation processing during reading, both in a first, enhanced exposure, and in later, unenhanced exposures. Learners’ reading times were measured for 12 enhanced and 12 unenhanced collocations, each of which occurred 8 times in the reading materials, across two reading sessions: they were encountered twice in Session 1, and another six times in Session 2. Unlike the repeated use of TE in previous studies (e.g., Sonbul and Schmitt 2013; Szudarski and Carter 2017), only the first occurrence of each target collocation in Session 1 was enhanced through bolding.

The results show that, in the first exposure, TE led to significantly longer total reading times on target collocations. This supports previous findings that TE promotes overt visual attention to collocations during reading (e.g., Choi 2017). However, in the second exposure within the same reading text, there were no clear differences in reading times between the enhanced and unenhanced conditions, which suggests that the effect of TE on visual processing was local and short-lived. In other words, learners did not show any difference in reading times during the second exposure as a result of having seen the collocations enhanced in a previous exposure.

In Session 2 (Exposures 3-8), no clear differences in reading times or final-word skip rates emerged between previously enhanced and unenhanced collocations or their single word components. It thus seems that TE temporarily affected learners’ attention for target collocations (see also Choi 2017), but did not have a strong delayed effect on processing times in later contexts. It is possible that TE only had an effect on reading times due to the increased visual salience of the target items, without necessarily inducing noticing of the enhanced collocations as items for learning. Participants’ responses in the retrospective interviews indeed suggest that TE only had a superficial attentionraising effect. Most participants remembered encountering enhanced collocations in the text, but made no attempts to memorize the word pairs. The interview results also indicate that bolded collocations were generally interpreted as key words meant to draw attention to relevant concepts in the text, similar to how enhancement has been used in university textbooks (e.g., Toomer and Elgort 2019). We can therefore assume that, even though TE had an initial effect on learners’ perceptual processing of the target collocations, it probably did not induce greater attention to form or any explicit effort to memorize the target collocations. In line with previous studies finding that TE, by itself, does not guarantee increased noticing of a linguistic structure (e.g., Winke 2013), the eye-tracking data indicate that enhancement does not necessarily draw learners’ explicit attention to collocational patterns.

Another aim was to find out whether repeated exposure and TE affected learners’ recognition and recall of target collocations. The posttest results showed that participants were unable to recall most of the target collocations after a one-week delay, although they could recognize the correct modifier of more than half of the collocations. Results of the retrospective interviews suggest that many responses in the form recognition test were guesses, which would mean that the scores do not solely reflect explicit memory of target collocations. However, the mixed effects analysis showed that item scores in the form recognition test, in particular for target items, were significantly higher in the experimental group, indicating that these learners recognized target collocations from encountering them in the reading texts. In line with previous findings (e.g., Pellicer-Sánchez 2017), the results of the recognition test show that learners can retain memory of the collocations they encounter repeatedly during reading, even if they make no deliberate attempts to memorize these collocations. On the other hand, the negligible gains found at the level of form recall, which is more challenging that form recognition, suggest that learners could not produce the correct collocation after several contextualized exposures. This finding is in line with previous studies finding small or non-significant effects of reading on form recall of new collocations (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016).

Importantly, TE did not have a strong effect on form recognition scores. The small effect of TE and the minimal learning gains overall suggest that TE did not affect learning in the way it did in previous studies that enhanced target collocations repeatedly throughout texts (Szudarski and Carter 2016; Toomer and Elgort 2017). It is widely acknowledged that a minimal degree of processing effort may be necessary for incidental vocabulary learning to take place; that is, “only seldom will a single exposure lead to a sufficiently deep imprint in memory such that […] the word remains available for retrieval in the long term” (Hulstijn and Laufer 2001: 553). Learning from a single contextual encounter relies strongly on the quality or depth of processing involved (e.g., Laufer and Hulstijn 2001), and this may vary considerably depending on learners’ goals and processing strategies (e.g., Fraser 1999). In the present study, the imprints left by the first two exposures in Session 1 may have had minimal effects on learners’ memory of the target collocations. In addition, our interview data suggest that TE did not induce the kind or degree of attention to enhanced collocations that might result in a durable memory trace. Because the remaining exposures took place after a one-week delay, it seems likely that learners did not have a strong recollection of encountering the enhanced collocations in the previous texts. The forgetting curve, a power function that relates probability of recall to recency of learning, predicts that most forgetting occurs at initial stages of learning (e.g. Baddeley 1997). Therefore, it is possible that the one-week delay between the first two sessions mitigated a long-term effect of TE on learners’ collocation knowledge.

Even though we found little evidence of explicit collocation knowledge, repeated exposure may have led to implicit collocation priming across the eight contextual exposures. When it comes to learning syntactic associations between words, some researchers have claimed that a low degree of awareness may be sufficient, and that collocation learning is a primarily implicit affair driven by frequency of exposure (e.g., Durrant and Schmitt 2010). Even a single exposure may leave a memory trace that primes the activation of a collocation in later contexts (Ellis 2005).However, this hypothesis was not borne out by the online measures we used to track learners’ processing fluency of the collocations, as they were not powerful enough to observe an effect of repeated exposure on implicit collocation knowledge. In both conditions, reading times decreased from the first until the fifth exposure. This is in line with previous findings that repetition can have a facilitative effect on online processing of words and phrases (e.g., Pellicer-Sánchez 2016; Sonbul et al. 2022). Decreases in reading times have been explained in relation to theories of automatic processing or skill acquisition, which assume that processing speeds up due to storage of exemplars or instances in memory (e.g., Logan 1988). In L2 collocation learning, every new encoding of a word pair may have an effect on its representation in memory, and on its subsequent retrieval (Hoey 2005). Previous studies have demonstrated that such an effect may arise instantaneously when L2 learners encounter new formulaic expressions during reading (Northbrook et al. 2021; Sonbul et al. 2022). However, the current experiment did not compare target collocations to matched controls during the reading task (unlike Sonbul et al. 2022). Because changes in reading times and skip rates over time may reflect word-level repetition priming effect of the constituent words (e.g., Ledoux et al. 2006), they cannot confidently be interpreted as evidence of implicit pairing of the collocations.

Taken together, the results indicate that visually enhancing a single occurrence of a new collocation can induce noticing of the target form, which is in line with previous findings (Choi, 2017; Peters, 2012). In the current study, this was evidenced by longer fixation times for enhanced items, and by learners’ explicit memory of the enhanced condition in the retrospective interview. However, the results also suggest that the attention induced by TE was only superficial, and did not leave a durable memory trace. Although previous studies have found strong effects of a single enhancement on learners’ collocation knowledge (Choi 2017; Peters 2012), our results indicate that these effects may be very short-lived if knowledge of the collocations is not tested immediately after reading. These findings have important implications for incidental learning of collocations, because exposures to new collocations tend to be widely spaced in naturalistic L2 input (e.g., Durrant and Schmitt 2010). If the initial attention-raising effect of TE does not carry over to new exposures in later contexts, then this implies that this form of enhancement may not have a strong effect on learning when used with naturalistic reading materials.

Our results are in stark contrast with the findings of studies that combined TE with input flooding (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016; Toomer and Elgort 2019). It seems that enhancing various instances of L2 collocations in a single learning activity may more effectively promote noticing of collocations as recurring or important word sequences than a single enhanced exposure. However, as Szudarski and Carter (2016) noted, even repeated enhancement does not guarantee attention to all formal and semantic aspects of enhanced collocations. Without a deliberate focus on form, for example induced by pre-learning or awareness-raising activities, learners may not always interpret the enhanced information in the way intended by the teacher or researcher, let alone promote learning of the enhanced structure. Further, as Toomer and Elgort (2019) pointed out, the combination of TE and input flooding might in some contexts even hinder the development of implicit collocation knowledge (see also Conklin 2020).

Finally, it seems that the learning conditions in the current experiment, particularly in Session 2, were purely incidental, and learners did not appear to shift between focus on form and focus on meaning. In line with previous findings (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016), our results suggest that a much greater amount of L2 input may be necessary to find durable effects on collocation knowledge and processing in purely incidental conditions. Further, as has been found in L2 grammar acquisition (e.g., Cintrón-Valentín et al. 2019), our findings also suggest that TE by itself does not guarantee attention to low-salience linguistic features. The interview data suggest that the target collocations

were of low perceptual salience, as learners reported not paying particular attention to their form. However, more research is needed to examine how the degree of salience of new collocations affects incidental learning, especially in relation to variables such as congruency and semantic transparency.

# Limitations and suggestions for future research

The current study examined the use of TE in an arguably more realistic context than that applied in previous studies. However, we did not directly compare the effects of TE in this and previously investigated contexts. Firstly, by including a third experimental condition in which collocations were repeatedly enhanced (e.g. Northbrook et al. 2021) we could have directly investigated whether learners’ top-down processing strategies were influenced by the combination of repetition and enhancement as operationalized in our study. Furthermore, an immediate posttest of collocation knowledge, such as that used by Choi (2017), might have lent support to our conclusion that TE did not affect learners’ memory of target collocations due to how learners perceived the enhanced items. Because we only used delayed posttests to measure explicit recall and recognition of collocations, any conclusions on immediate effects is restricted to what could be derived from participants’ eye movement data and the retrospective interviews. Due to these limitations, the interpretation of our results remains tentative, and future studies will need to include a wider range of measures and experimental conditions to provide a more comprehensive picture of the benefits and limitations of TE in combination with repeated exposure in authentic texts. Nevertheless, the negligible effects of TE on reading times and learning strongly suggest that the conditions in which TE was presented, i.e., as a single enhanced exposure combined with (spaced) unenhanced repetition, do not foster collocation learning at the form recall level, unlike the flooded enhanced conditions employed in previous research (e.g., Szudarski and Carter 2016).

We should also point out a few important limitations related to the eye-tracking component of our study design. Firstly, we did not report the results of an immediate sentence-reading task that aimed to measure the effect of repeated exposure on learners’ collocation processing fluency. Because this test did not control for differences in component word frequency for target-control pairs, the results would have been difficult to interpret in relation to collocation knowledge. Further, because the primary aim of the study was to measure collocation processing and learning in naturalistic texts, we did not control for a number of variables that might have affected learners’ fixation times during reading. For example, we did not include control collocations in the reading passages of the experimental treatment. Decreases in reading times within Session 2 may have been caused by repetition priming of the single word components, or increasing topic familiarity. Therefore, we could not determine if, or at what rate, frequency of the target collocations affected reading times in the experimental texts. This issue may be addressed by controlling for lexical and contextual factors, as was done in a few recent studies (Conklin and Carrol 2020; Pellicer-Sánchez, Siyanova-Chanturia and Parente 2022; Sonbul et al. 2022). The current study included collocations that referred to real

scientific concepts, and which therefore had some pedagogical relevance for the participants. However, a more controlled method might have been more informative in terms of finding evidence of (implicit) collocation knowledge.

# CONCLUSION

This study examined the effects of TE on online processing of collocations during reading, and on L2 collocation knowledge. The eye-tracking results indicate that the initial attention-enhancing effect of TE did not carry over to later, unenhanced exposures. Results of post-experiment interviews suggested that learners’ primary focus was on meaning comprehension, and that TE did not induce conscious attention to the form of the target collocations. One week after the treatment, participants could recognize the correct form of target collocations, but they could not productively recall most of them. We conclude that a single enhanced exposure does not necessarily affect learners’ memory of collocations, or their processing of those collocations in later exposures. The development of L2 collocation knowledge may require a large amount of exposure in purely incidental contexts.
