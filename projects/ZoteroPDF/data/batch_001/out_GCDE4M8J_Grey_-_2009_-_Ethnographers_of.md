# Abstract

An engagement with difference has significant implications for the teaching and research of English for Academic Purposes where traditional focus has been on the preparation of students for university content courses, with an emphasis on skills development. What has largely been missing from this debate is a problematizing of the practices of a community of difference. This research draws on an ethnographic study of an EAP classroom in which I was both the teacher and the researcher. The international students become ethnographers of the diversity of the university community using alternative semiotic practices to carry out their research rather than a traditional reliance on reading and writing. I use examples of critical moments to show the ways in which difference is re-shaped when the students’ hybrid knowledges are made central. Critical EAP practice becomes one of creating difference, thus disrupting established norms of power/knowledge and raising the possibility for further questioning and change.

# 1. Nomadic trajectories

They left home together.

The international students were going out into the community to seek the resources they needed for their diversity research project. My aim was for them to photograph their understandings of diversity in different communities where they would encounter uncertainty and contradiction. In order to do this, I asked them to take their digital cameras and mobile phones as well as pens and paper on which they had already noted some questions. They were nomadic ethnographers, armed with creative tools for which a new use would be invented. The new inventions were their visual images which were used as political probes of difference. As the ethnographers moved away from the classroom they were laughing and their eyes were flashing with excitement as they discussed their plans. I heard different languages being spoken and I was struck by the level of noise, the hum, the excitement, the companionship and connection of a developing community of difference. There was a flurry of excitement as they went to experiment in spaces of difference which promised new ideas and possibilities. All of us were filled with desire, a ‘‘joy,’’ at the prospect of encounters not yet known or made (Deleuze & Parnet, 2002, p. 100). For the students, it was a rare moment in their university studies to be able to take control of their learning in such a novel and open-ended way. In doing so, they ‘‘seiz[ed] the tools to mark the world that marked them as other’’ (Haraway, 1991, p. 175). We had different questions in our respective research projects as I was the teacher/researcher and they were student ethnographers.

Later, the nomadic ethnographers returned, laden with their resources of difference. The student, Carlson, who was videoing the class interaction for my research, located himself in front of the windows on one side of the room in order to have a clear view of everyone. He turned the video on.

Most students formed a cluster in the middle of the room. Others sat together on tables or leaned against a table or a wall. I stood outside the central group of students. ‘‘Since each of us was several, there was already quite a crowd’’ (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 3).

Melanie introduces her group’s Race and Diversity project by showing the class a morphed image of a head and asked them if they recognized the different components. Melanie points toward the morphed image and directs her question to the class.

Can you say like.whose mouth it is.whose eyes it is.whose hair.?

I muse:

The hybrid image appeared to me like a ‘woman’. I found it confronting as ‘she’ looked as if she had a black eye (Fig. 1 - A New Start: hybrid image).

The title of their poster is Race and Diversity which is printed in large white letters against a black background with black and white photos of individuals of different races, ages, genders, religions and ethnicities placed in each corner. By contrast, the hybrid image, which is in color, is placed in the centre of the poster. The image provocatively highlights a range of physical characteristics of the group, such as skin color and texture and facial hair. One of the eyes is deeply circled with a blue-black smudge, and the hair, which appears to be from different heads, suggests different colors, textures and lengths.

The project group is positioned in front of their poster and the class is waiting expectantly for what is to follow.

# 2. A critical moment of difference

The video cameraman zooms in for a close up shot. On our right Grace smiles, extends her right hand towards the image and then places it on the face.

Fig. 1. A New Start: hybrid image.

Their diversity, Melanie prompts.

I muse:

I am intrigued by this. In identifying the hybrid image as having multiple identities Melanie, Grace, Harry and Joseph have created something different. In fact, later in his journal, Harry described the merging of their identities as ‘‘A New Start’’. What effects will this image have on the audience?

Melanie looks inquiringly at us.

Can you guess? Yeah.

A flat ironic voice breaks in from somewhere in the audience. I recognize that it is Addul speaking.

Yeah. Joseph’s beard.

Some class members spontaneously break into loud laughter. The reaction of the students to Addul’s comment about the beard is ambiguous. I wonder if the students feel uncomfortable about the implication of a female having a beard, particularly if they thought it was either Grace or Melanie, who are standing directly in front of them. It seems as if Addul’s comment has been generally received in the spirit of ‘‘commonsense notions of masculinity and femininity’’ which are based on gender stereotypes (Schmenk, 2004, p. 515). Discursive formations either permit or disallow what is possible to think, act or speak in different contexts, therefore making it very difficult for other students to speak against Addul’s claim.

Addul’s own reception of the Race and Diversity image suggests that in order to define his own identity he is maintaining an oppressive male/female binary. He indicates that to be recognized differently is threatening to him and he appears to prefer taking up a traditional position. If this is so, his position overlooks the complex nature of gender which can interact with other forms of difference such as race, religion, age, ethnicity, culture, sexuality and so on. These forms are historically and culturally located and produced in social and power relations. As a result, Addul’s understandings of other students’ notions of difference could be limited. On the other hand, the use of new technologies has offered all of them alternative ways of presenting their diversity. Through the hybrid image, the project group has subverted hegemonic understandings of race and gender and produced nonsense, not common sense, thus disrupting our thinking about gender, race and diversity. In using their hybrid knowledges they have opened up different trajectories for thinking about difference thus ‘‘displacing the sedentary and unified’’ (St. Pierre, 1997a, p. 5).

Addul is encouraged by their laughter and continues:

Her hair.

I muse:

Perhaps it is Melanie’s hair, then again it could belong to Grace.

Then I realize, like the face, the hair is also a hybrid.

There is more laughter from group members.

Melanie moves in front of the poster to take control of the situation. Seemingly unruffled by Addul’s responses and the class laughter, she turns to Joseph and says:

So, I’ll let Joseph speaks about the findings.

When the hybrid image was revealed and Melanie asked us to guess who it was, we were surprised. In the context of an academic poster presentation, this was an unexpected incident which highlights an important political shift in the students’ realities of difference. Normative views of gender, race and subjectivity have been challenged, thus opening up opportunities for change. In my research, I will refer to this instance of possible change as a critical moment, which Pennycook (2004) describes as ‘‘a point of significance, an instant when things change.where someone gets it.where someone throws out a comment that shifts the discourse’’ (p. 330). He urges teachers to take up these unexpected opportunities and act upon them and ‘‘turn them into critical moments in both senses.’’(p. 330).

A significant difficulty for the teacher, Pennycook suggests, is not only identifying and managing critical moments, but making them ‘‘critical in that moment’’ (p.342). An important aspect of critical moments, Pennycook argues, is that critical educators need to, on a moment-by-moment basis, be ‘‘slowly prodding for possibilities’’, to be on the alert for seemingly unimportant moments that can pave the way for developing a critical perspective (p.341).

In this critical moment, the Race and Diversity group has cast off unwanted identity labelings by collectively transforming themselves. In doing so, they have created a space of possibility where all students can explore alternative realities. Through social interaction, meaning is pushed to the limit as the audience collectively engage in the struggle to think differently about difference. Teacher interventions can be pivotal in critical moments as they offer possibilities for shifting the direction of the discourse in literacy experiences. However, if interventions are always initiated by the teacher there is a danger that it is her interests which always precipitate the moment rather than those of the students. I could have moved to shut down Addul’s facetious response but this would have undermined his values and beliefs thus restricting opportunities for change.

Critical moments do not have to have to be instantly acted upon by the teacher as this could reinforce the students’ dependence on her. Furthermore, one of my pedagogical objectives was to work towards developing the students’ own judgment of the power relations in interactions in order that they might contest their own or others’ positioning. So I waited patiently, and my opportunity to expand their gender realities came later when Denny commented again about the image. I also took this matter up in the journals in order to tease out further possibilities around gender and race stereotyping.

As critical moments are unpredictable it is impossible to say when they will occur and what form they might take. Critical moments are always interconnected with past events. In their enactment, the emphasis is on the connections made by the students through their own and others’ ‘‘dangerous memories’’ (Luke, 1996, p.315). These memories can lead to disruptive, embodied activity,which can form a basis for negotiating new perspectives as well as possibilities for creating difference.

In carrying out a mini-ethnography of diversity in the university community the international students engaged with their understandings of diversity. They moved in different time and space, constantly experimenting with their visual resources and thus creating surprising linkages. In his discussion of discourse acquisition, Price (1999) argues that connection takes place when there is ‘‘the contingent convergence of many elements at a unique moment in time and space in which meaning is enacted’’ (p.589). At that moment, unintentional and unexpected connections occur within and across subjects through an affective force which interpellates students into hybrid cultural practices.

The transformative potential of the critical moments lies in the collective reception made of them by the students in different social contexts. I argue that underpinning the student interactions is the Deleuzian notion of desire (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). It is a force that can disrupt as well as create relations between people and their contexts as well as creating different meanings and discourses. The notion of desire is another way to account for the leakage that occurs in student interactions as they struggle with multiple discourses of difference around gender, sexuality, race, religion and so on. In EAP, the discursive practices of disciplines do not account for this overflow of bodies interacting, thus excluding bodily meaning e making which can be joyful, sorrowful, conflictual or insightful. According to AlbrechtCrane and Slack (2003), ‘‘Desire is always present in classrooms and it works in unexpected ways: both productive and destructive’’ (pp. 210e211). It is the operation of Deleuzian desire at a micro-level which impacts on the different kinds of ‘becoming’ that is, the ways difference is continually re-shaped by and through a complex, ongoing process of desiring bodies relating to one another.

The critical moment which arose with the Race and Diversity group has turned the tables on the students and shaken their beliefs by posing the question as to whether they recognize them in a colored hybrid image that they have produced. At that particular moment, they have confounded the class with a question that defies them to reveal the ‘truth’ of the hybrid image, a figure of uncertain gender and race. There is a risk in thinking that there is a truth in the hybrid image as this would make it ‘‘a dogmatic image’’ which reveals nothing about the conditions that give rise to thought (Patton, 2000, p.20). The hybrid image gives the impression that the sequential merging of different physical features of the members of the project group has been a fluid, seamless transformation. Such thinking overlooks the unpredictability involved in the production of identities that become someone different each time there is an encounter with other bodies.

I question if the laughter from the audience is indicative of diverse knowledges which are being produced in the classroom. In this context at this moment, it is important to understand the different discourses that emerge from the students’ collective struggle with the image. Foucault (1980) has stated that as a social group there would be ‘‘the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements.’’ (p. 131). Foucault refers to a ‘‘regime of truth’’ where ‘‘truth is linked in a circular relation with systems of power which produce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extend it’’ (p. 133). Thus, the power relations of the students’ encounter with the hybrid image cannot be considered separately from the social and desire relations which Patton (2000) refers to as ‘‘a complex circuit of desire’’ (p. 69).

# 3. The research territories

I draw on research which was carried out with two classes of international students from an Australian university who were enrolled in an elective in the Business degree of which I was the teacher/researcher.

There were forty six full fee-paying students, four international exchange students as well as three permanent residents of Australia who had originally been international students. As an elective, the project-based subject, Business Communication, was available to all students in the faculty of Business as well as students from other faculties who wished to take a Business subject. The faculty stressed its suitability for international students. The subject was conducted for three hours a week in both first and second semesters.

For my research, I asked the students’ permission to use their visual images such as drawings, photographs and academic posters as well as their journals which they produced throughout the semester. A further request I made was that I would like to occasionally bring a video camera to class to film some of the class interactions. I explained that through my ethnographic research I hoped to gain some understandings of their literacy practices.

# 4. The student diversity project

One of the university’s strategic goals is to produce students who are entrepreneurial in both outlook and practice. In order to make that connection, I gave the classes examples of Australian businesses and corporations such as banks and mining companies which have implemented innovative and transformative diversity policies and practices in their workplace. It was recognized by them that diversity is an underutilized resource in business (Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 2000). These businesses regarded these innovations as their social responsibility to their employees as well as the wider community. I suggested to the students that this kind of thinking in our university community was also our concern and that the proposed diversity project with its vision of change was a form of social entrepreneurialism. I considered that my pedagogical response would not only meet the university’s goal but was also an important strategy for equipping students to face the cultural complexities of a globalized world (Kumaravadivelu, 2006).

In choosing a diversity project, I considered that the students could capitalize on their diverse resources and act as change catalysts. Rather than working from a pre-determined curriculum, where the ‘rules’ are usually determined by the lecturer, I asked the students to find out what their peers thought in order to question their own and others’ understandings of diversity, in particular, the stereotyping of students on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, religion, age, language, disability and so on. Thus, the development of a Business proposal in the form of an ‘academic ‘ poster of their design, would be a hybrid blend. Their challenge was to convince their audience of the potential of their proposal to bring about change in the university community.

As the student project was one of critical inquiry, the students collectively posed their own problems around diversity rather than working with a pre-determined curriculum and readings which had been set by me. In a postmethod pedagogy, Kumaravadivelu (2003) suggests that learners can assume mini-ethnographic roles by investigating the structure of issues identified by them as well as the interests that underpin them. In doing so, students’ realities are recognized and used in their learning rather than taking those from a discourse community that are already in place. I understood, though, that in departing from the ‘certainty’ of a set curriculum, it was an unknown process in their academic learning and therefore unsettling. Even though I considered risk to be an important part of bringing about potential change, they might not.

# 5. English for Academic Purposes

The EAP students, in this research, are actively involved in exploring the power relations of their university degree experience. Rather than a sole preoccupation with the pragmatic function of EAP, where normative views of difference are perpetuated and power relations are not accounted for, my students are also engaged in a political EAP where difference forms the basis of the curriculum. Whereas my critical practice is located in the Business degree program, Benesch (2001)

places hers in linked academic courses where opportunities are created for students to challenge power relations that affect them, thus disrupting the status quo. Benesch argues that affording these opportunities in conjunction with the requirements of the content courses achieves a balance between the students’ needs and their rights.

The specific focus in EAP of the cognitive effects of literacy overlooks the embodied performance of difference in the political and ideological contexts in which it is carried out. In this case, literacy is understood as knowledge that is reproduced by students rather than as knowledge that is performed by them. Scholars such as Benesch (2001) and Pennycook (2001) have vigorously questioned the power relations of a pedagogical emphasis on knowledge reproduction with its denial of difference.

There are often assumptions held that students are rational, knowing subjects who are required to have mastery over a commonsense learning process which is expressed mainly through textual means. If the focus remains on the teaching of established knowledge through conventional ways, the valuable resource of the students’ own knowledge production is often overlooked as well as the use of alternative semiotic practices to engage with it. I argue, when students are given the opportunity to collectively research their own communities in creative and self-reflexive ways, difference is re-shaped as they are encouraged to question diverse, local forms of knowledge. Instead of adopting a liberal approach to diversity with its goal of tolerance, the students explore how they themselves are positioned as well as the ways they position others in their learning in terms of race, gender, sexuality, religion and so on.

The recognition of an alternative critical EAP practice raises questions as to how this can be carried out. I propose the taking up of a practice of uncommon sense in the teaching of critical EAP. By this, I mean a political ‘game’ which involves playful, collective encounters with visual images. Such a practice offers disruption and thinking of difference differently.

# 6. Poststructuralism

A consideration of difference presents the politics of EAP and language learning with a ‘‘new set of problems’’ which impact on subject formation (Rose, 1999, p. 179). The subject of poststructuralism is constituted in discourse, which for Foucault (1980), is an interplay of knowledges and practices which are embedded in social life and this is where the subject’s reality is produced. By contrast, a modernist, humanistic perspective would assume that the students in this research would be autonomous and able to freely choose those aspects of difference that they thought would suit their purposes. Poststructuralism rejects this notion as it overlooks the subject whose ‘‘rational consciousness is decentred and subjected to the effects of unconscious wishes, desires and processes’’ which are the result of discursive constructions (Weedon, 1987, p. 88). Thus, new practices and different realities come into play, but not without struggle.

In EAP, if students are labeled according to their gender, race, culture, sexuality, nationality, culture, language, religion and so on, there is an assumption of overarching sameness within each category rather than that of difference. In the Deleuzian model of difference and repetition, according to Colebrook (2002), ‘‘a repeated word may look the same, but it is not sameness that produces repetition but difference. Each repetition is different so the repetition is not a copy but a transformation’’ (p. 67). Along with this understanding, I am also using Judith Butler’s (1990) notion of performativity as an important way of questioning pre-given notions of gender and sexuality. Butler claims that language is a ‘‘doing’’, not a ‘‘doing’’ by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed but the repeated stylization of the body, a set of repeated acts within a highly regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of a substance, of a natural sort of being’’ (Butler, 1990, p. 25). With the repetition of identity as always being a transformation, I argue that difference is performed in the ‘doing’. In my research the performance of difference as enacted through the students’ bodies is an ongoing series of social and cultural performances which are part of broader social relations and involve questions of ‘‘power, inequality and racism’’ (Pennycook, 2001, p. 65).

# 7. Nomadic practice and critical EAP

In establishing a project where the international students are nomadic ethnographers of their community, I question what nomads do, and investigate the practices that define those subjects as a community. My interest is also in the value that is placed on these practices by the community members.

With the advent of globalization, international students are part of the dynamic flows of practices and cultural products which have opened up many possibilities for the exchange of ideas and imagining new ways of thinking, acting and speaking. Nomads, according to Bogue (2004), are ‘‘peripatetic, set adrift’’ and seemingly ‘‘in a relatively constant state of movement’’ as they ‘‘ roam state societies and escape regulation’’ (p. 169). The nomadic ethnographers in my study engage in a practice of ‘‘bodily doings and sayings’’ of difference which involve more than words (Schatzki, 1996, p. 47). They move in unbounded ‘‘smooth nomad space’’ around the university community with their political probes of difference, thus deterritorialising from striated space, that is the defined territory of the lecture/ tutorial which is conducted in the lecture theatre or classroom (St. Pierre, 1997b, p. 369).

The nomadic ethnographers, like other environmental and social entrepreneurs, are ‘‘innovative, resourceful, practical, and opportunistic’’ (Elkington & Hartigan, 2008, p. 3). At the same time they are ‘‘unreasonable’’ as they break the rules as they go in search of ideas and pose problems of difference in unlikely places (p. 6). The nomadic ethnographers take huge risks as they move to destinations of their choosing, carrying out challenging tasks such as interacting with ‘local’ students as well as posing questions of cultural practices regarding, gender, sexuality, race, religion and other social formations. Collectively, they turn these challenges into opportunities as I encourage them to be bold in their creation of political territories of EAP.

There are many opportunities for the students to engage with uncertainty in this type of learning and they might experience shock, disappointment as well as success. Whereas rejection or even ridicule is possible when asking perceived sensitive or political questions, they might be admired for their experimental visual questionnaires or be complimented on the importance of the strategy that they are proposing. For undergraduate Business students, the questionnaire as a research tool is mainly textual. When eliciting responses from other students, the nomadic ethnographers refashion this tool by using a range of visual images. They incorporate photographs from their photoshoot, images from databases as well as using other students’ perceptions about diversity that are captured live on their mobile phones. This is nomadic EAP style. With its active political engagement with difference as well as rapidly changing technologies, it is fundamental for any further change to come about in the practices of literacy teaching and research in critical EAP.

Difference is something that ‘‘emerges from practice, from what people do rather than what they intrinsically are’’ (Cameron, 2005, pp.488e489). She suggests that the language people use will relate to the variety of things they are doing. I had this in mind when I wanted to establish a nomadic EAP practice which created difference and that meant encouraging students to question fixed categories of cultural difference. Rather than beginning the project by giving a lecture on culture and identity based on a reading selected by me, I disrupted the status quo and surprised the students by taking the very risky step of asking them to sketch what was significant in the sense of their own identities. I indicated that it was important for them to examine how their identities are shaped by their histories, cultures, families, education, religions, genders and political views. Some students complained that they couldn’t draw and others questioned the connection of this activity to Business. Yet, in a globalized marketplace their understandings of diversity matter. With the emphasis on Western knowledge and values as being the norm along with the use of English, there is a risk of homogeneity which excludes diverse cultural practices and identities (Morgan & Ramanathan, 2005).

My aim was to establish an ambience of trust, co-operation, risk-taking and the formation of new and different alliances (Simon, 1992). As the students worked in their ‘‘side-by-side ways’’ on the sketches, their own discourses and cultural practices became the focus of their collective attention (Van Lier, 2002, p. 147). I was curious to see what kinds of cultural capital (Bourdieu, 1991) might emerge through this informal social practice which could then be used as resources in their research project. I wanted the students to actively engage with those issues that they identified as being important rather than being presented with material which created a dichotomous position between their own cultural practices and those of the curriculum.

The co-operative production of the visual images can create a community which fosters student activism (Benesch, 2001). Rather than using traditional textual means, what I had in mind was ‘drawing back’ as a form of visual activism where the students used their images as a strategy for achieving their own purposes rather than those imposed by the institution. The problem though, I understood, was that the act of drawing in a university setting could be seen as nonsensical, as the students were not engaged with ‘serious’ forms of textual activity such as writing, nor legitimate ‘academic’ content knowledge.

# 8. Multiliteracies and nomadic practice

The development of digital technologies has opened up vast possibilities for showcasing diverse knowledges. The term multiliteracies was originally taken up to refer to the place of multiple modes that are used in new meaning-making which involves changing technologies, the impact of media as well as popular culture (Archer, 2006; Cope & Kalantzis, 2000; Kress, 2003). Whilst these scholars argue that students in times of change must have access to modes other than writing, issues of power and difference in different contexts as well as what and whose knowledges are powerful, remain largely unaccounted for.

Literacy is ideological and it poses an ongoing dilemma for both teachers and researchers (Luke, 2004; Pennycook, 2001). In universities, there are institutionally accepted literacy practices which the students rarely have the opportunity to question, let alone negotiate. For example, in the teaching of powerful genres where there is a focus on access, questions of politics and issues of power arise as students’ own knowledges are overlooked in favor of equality and the acquisition of technical skills (Luke, 1996).

Nomadic practice demands more political understandings of multiliteracies. Cope and Kalantzis (2000) ask the question, ‘‘What’s the Game’’? (p. 24) and their response is that an aspect of the literacy ‘game’ is access to a metalanguage which is sometimes directed toward ‘‘a clearly defined and socially labeled genre’’ (p. 24). As Wallace (2001) queries, it is not clear what that metalanguage might be, nor how it might bring about a critical engagement with genre. The nomadic ethnographers are involved in an alternative ‘game’ where there is ‘‘a remarkably diverse range of human goings on’’ (Schatzki, 1996, p. 95), as well as non-human, and it is in these contexts that their own subversive metalanguage can be used.

The creation of the playful morphed image demonstrates the desire of its needy creators to re-shape their difference in ways that could not have been initially predicted. The hybrid image of the cyborg invented by Haraway (1991) emerged through the development of new technologies. The cyborg was an illegitimate coupling that moved between the natural and unnatural worlds in a ‘border war’ between organism and machine. With the merging of identities in the student morphed image ‘‘ A New Start’’, the individual subject is no longer evident thus opening up possibilities for different connections to be made. In a swirl of competing discourses of social inequality, the nomadic ethnographers imaginatively use technologies along with their difference as resources in their academic work. They enter into new relationships with one another, with me as the teacher/researcher as well as the wider community which includes the global (Egan-Robertson & Bloome, 1998). In the wider community, the students source blogs, music clips and additional images for their project from various locations in cyberspace. Haraway suggests that this shift to the possibility of multiple new forms ‘‘from all work to all play, [is] a deadly game’’ (p. 161). It has the capacity to unsettle EAP practice.

# 9. Ethnography and nomadic practice

The global production of flows of knowledges, as well as different social relations and practices pose challenges for ethnographic analysis of literacy practices (Luke, 2004). Rather than maintaining a traditional approach to ethnography where subjects are under the ethnographic gaze, I established a poststructuralist discursive framework where the students lived experiences are made central and they can speak for themselves.

The presentation of the critical moments that occur through the student interactions allows me to give a more selfreflexive account of the students’ realities of difference.

It is their ideas, questions, and political connections they make with difference that become the curriculum, but it is the forms of difference they choose that drive my ethnographic research.

# 10. Disruptive becomings

The following exchanges between the students and me are spin-offs from the critical moment presented earlier when Addul made the ambiguous comment about Joseph’s beard. Their responses are a mix of molar and molecular lines which apply to political bodies (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). In the student interactions there are normative discourses of gender and race that are performed through molar lines, but at the same time there are the affective, molecular lines. Molecular lines are often barely perceptible but with ‘‘the swirl and toss’’ of their co-presence with molar lines it means that mastery of particular discourses is not possible nor are responses to them predictable (Conley, 2005, p. 172).

Melanie is seemingly unruffled by Addul’s comment about the hybrid image having a beard, especially as she is possibly part of it.

[S]he has no mastery over the situation, no effective control over which ideas the spectators verbalize or over how or if they subsequently connect. And (s)he seems unbothered by that fact, even pleased at the range and unpredictability of the responses (Massumi, 2005, p. 167).

It’s a monster, Denny claims.

I muse:

This is an image that shocks Denny. She appears to have reached the limit of her tolerance of diversity. Throughout the project she has encountered ambiguous claims about gender and sexuality from photos taken by the class. To be confronted with this freakish image which has clearly been constructed by a computer, is too much for her and she dismisses it as illegitimate.

It’s funny, Sven suggests.

This is a contrasting response to the image as some students lean forward scrutinizing it searching for anything about it that might be amusing.

It’s half woman, half man, Nancy claims.

Her claim would appear to be related to a discussion that took place earlier following the photoshoot. Christina had shown us an image of Harisu , the Korean transsexual activist, who she claimed was seen by Koreans ‘‘as an evil of God’’. Addul’s group had taken a photo of Ganesh, who the group said was the Hindu deity of wisdom and prosperity. Ganesh was considered by one student, Apple, as a ‘‘mixed-up-sex’’. Not all societies are limited by a binary view of gender like Western societies.

Apple places her hand on the image and strokes it to feel its texture. In touching the ‘stubble’ on the face perhaps she expects to feel gender difference. Then she changes her mind.

No, it’s in quarters.

There is more laughter from the audience as they contemplate this. Kei suggests:

I think the left side is female because it’s softer

.and the right, male.

There has been considerable discussion amongst the students about Japanese cultural practices in relation to gendered bodies and appearance. Kei told us that both men and women use products for skin care and make up so I wonder what cultural norms of femininity and masculinity she is drawing upon in order to make some form of recognition.

Novi interrupts, I think both are men

Her response shows the struggle that is going on for the class as they engage with different discourses of gender difference. I doubt if they expected this rupture during an academic seminar presentation.

It’s a transsexual thing, Benjamin calls out.

When Benjamin claims that the image is a transsexual, I feel physically stung by his strong emphasis on the descriptor ‘thing’. I recoil when he suggests this and wonder how the students’ startled bodies will cope. This is a molar line of sexuality and gender, a destructive line where a person with a sexuality other than that immediately recognizable is addressed in derogatory terms. Perhaps Benjamin is afraid of declaring his position about people who might not be heterosexual. The students listen intently and seem not to know what to do or how to react to this unexpected piece of information. They appear to be gazing into the distance as if trying to imagine how a person described as such, might look.

The left eye is Asian and the right one is Indian. Tuan indicates by pointing at the image.

The hybrid image poses a dilemma for not only Tuan but also for the rest of us. Even though the image is evidently morphed, Tuan attempts to recognize individual components. Melanie and the project group have ‘tricked’ him into essentializing aspects of its identity. I note that Gift looks quizzically at Tuan and follows the direction of his pointing. Given that there are two others in this project group, one of whom says he is of mixed race, Tuan’s claim opens up further possible questions.

I intervene by taking up Addul’s earlier comment about the beard:

What about the beard? Have you ever seen a woman with a beard?

In taking up Addul’s earlier expressed doubt about gender and beards, I make a mischievous intervention by interpellating the students into discourses of truth around gender, body hair and cultural practices in different contexts.. It is potentially challenging for the students as I have introduced further doubt and uncertainty into the discussion. Rather than preventing exploration of Addul’s remark , I have taken a risk and moved into the unknown thus creating additional opportunities for students to openly explore the politics of one another’s realities. At this moment, we are constituting and reconstituting one another through our engagement with the hybrid image.

Edmund offered:

I saw a woman on a train in Hong Kong and she had something, it was like a beard.

Was it like Vic’s? I pressed. (He has fine hair above his top lip).

No, just in bits, Edmund replied.

Monika breaks in,

In Norway we don’t have hair because we’re Western.

In making this surprising contribution, Monika is presenting a norm of cultural identity to which she ascribes. I wonder if her claim has been influenced by images she has encountered in popular culture whereby Western women often wax and/or shave their body hair for the sake of personal appearance and sensuality. I also question if she includes men, as Edmund claims in Australia, body hair is a sign of masculinity whereas in Chinese culture it is often considered by young guys as being foreign or primitive. Monica’s statement is an example of information that is globally distributed and taken up locally, and in Monika’s case, possibly by students that travel.

Monika continues:

Yes, but it’s different in Europe. Some women in Greece, Spain and Russia have hair on their faces and some here.

Monika points to the part of her face near her ears.

The students presenting the Race and Diversity poster have unsettled academic practices by performing their difference ‘live’ in an interaction with the hybrid image ‘‘in a kind of spontaneous Deleuzian combustion’’ (Massumi, 1996, p. 231). There is confusion and uncertainty revealed in some of the student responses to gender which is considered in relation to race, culture and sexuality. The forms of difference that have been taken up are, according to Norton (2000),‘‘not experienced as a series of discrete background variables, but are all, in complex and interconnected ways, implicated in the construction of identity and the possibilities of speech’’ (p. 13).

It became clear in this intercultural setting that the students made multiple meanings of the hybrid image. The reactions of the students varied as some students doubled up with laughter at the notion of gender confusion, while others were more cautious in their assessment and some remained silent. In Denny and Benjamin’s case, they showed anxiety or even fear. As Simon (1992) claims, fear may indicate ‘‘ that a particularly significant moment of learning may be at hand, in which old investments are about to be questioned, modified, or possibly displaced ’’(p. 81). The Race and Diversity group has addressed the students in a dramatic way in order to appeal to their passions and shock them into engaging with their educational strategy with its vision of change. Their inventiveness with technology is a demonstration of social and political power in a nomadic world.

My intervention is an important aspect of critical literacies as it can affect the ways students accept or reject circulating discourses. I aimed to challenge the students’ possible biases around gender, especially as Addul, Denny and Benjamin presented hegemonic notions of masculinity and femininity. I wanted the students to consider that ‘‘sexual identities are open to interpretation, and therefore, misinterpretation, and how their meanings are not selfevident but must be learned’’ (Nelson, 2004, p. 25). The hybrid image has facilitated the creation of both an individual and group identity. As Kramsch and von Hoene (2001) argue, ‘‘ when students encounter difference, i.e. that which they perceive as foreign, they have the opportunity to call into question and revise themselves as subjects’’ (p. 284). The affective interactions between the students indicate a tentative openness to different possibilities. Although the students cannot consciously choose the forms of difference they wish to engage with, in the process of learning about them through the production and reception of their visual images, they can remain open to different connections as there is always an overflow which cannot be pre-determined. Thus, the directions in which they travel cannot be known or controlled.

Through the subversive use of visual images in an academic presentation, the students parody academic discourses. The poster is not simply an attractive artistic piece nor is it merely a presentation of survey results as objective knowledge. It is above all, an encounter of joy that draws the students into a community of feeling, as an EAP community-becoming. The encounters with the hybrid image is where the students struggle with different text forms, where there are exchanges of different codes, the molar institutional code of the seminar presentation and the molecular, ludic nature of the posters as art. There is a blurring of codes as the students collectively appropriate the genre of the poster and imagine something different.

What distinguishes the student poster as presented in this research is that it is not reducible to a recognisable genre but is made up ‘‘of dimensions, or rather directions in motion’’ which undergo change in disruptive ways (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 21). As the audience, we are affectively captured by the morphed image which acts as a propellant for movement of non-subjectification and possible re-shapings of difference. Thus, literacy can be understood in a performative sense, because it is what the poster and images do, what they make us do through our affective connections, as well as their knowledge producing capacities which occur ‘‘whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight’’ (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 9).

The presentation of the poster can be considered as a performance but not in a fixed sense, as through the humorous interaction with the hybrid image, meaning is constantly on the move. The performance of difference as enacted through the academic poster ‘‘escapes the molar forces that produces the mechanical, dull, uninspired, depersonalized prose that characterizes a molar response to school’’ (Albrecht-Crane & Slack, 2003, p. 208). By locating the poster in the students’ diversity, they are performing ‘‘knowledges foreign to us’’ thus creating opportunities to resist other forms of knowledge in order to create hybrid forms of their own (Ellsworth, 1997, p. 195). At the same time, even though there is a break with the past, they have retained certain features of the genre. In the presentation of the poster, for example, they have maintained certain textual features of the Business proposal but have invented alternative ways with dramatic effects, thus creating an agentive space for themselves and their audience.

# 11. A manifesto of difference

This research best serves its purpose as a manifesto for a turn of nomadic uncommon sense in critical EAP where difference is performed through the students’ cultural practices. Developments in technology have created possibilities for the emergence of different kinds of political actors in the open territories of this community. Hybrid connections of ‘explosion’, ‘excess’ and ‘desire’ in the critical moments produce different realities and possibilities, thus disrupting normative literacy practices of academic texts and genres.

Even though my research is an example of innovative, hybrid EAP practice it is not always accepted by institutions and curriculum developers. I do not claim that a semester of student engagement with a pedagogy of uncommon sense will result in a well planned academic essay or a polished Business report. Nevertheless, as I have shown, in challenging hegemony and fixity, the students make different connections. Therefore, it is a productive practice and I urge EAP teacher/researchers to embrace it. Take a risk, lose ‘control’ of the curriculum, the worst that can happen to you and your students is that you will encounter something unexpected and soar on a line of flight into something new, that is, difference.

My pedagogical and research response to Business EAP in changing globalized circumstances is an ethical one. My concern is that the class consists mainly of international students, which could reinforce their perceived isolation from ‘local’ students. At the same time, such a separation is also a lost opportunity for ‘local’ students to go out together into the university community and experience the highs and lows of engaging with the politics of difference. As Yosuke writes in his final journal entry, ‘‘The experience I have obtained is so precious. I have learned so many diversity and am surprised. More surprisingly, I have found more diversity between my group.’’ Through their nomadic practice, that is the ‘doing’ of difference, Yosuke and the other students have found alternative ways of describing both themselves and others.

In an EAP community of difference, like Melanie, I ‘‘would rather be a cyborg than a goddess’’ (Haraway, 1991, p. 181). ‘‘The cyborg is a polychromatic girl.the cyborg is a bad girl.a shape-changer, whose dislocations are never free’’ (Penley, Ross & Haraway, 1990, pp. 22e23).

This is my nomadic practice.
