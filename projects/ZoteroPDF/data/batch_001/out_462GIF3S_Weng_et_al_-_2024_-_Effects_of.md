Despite the increasing scholarly attention towards students' writing feedback literacy in recent years, empirical explorations of effective approaches to enhancing this capacity remain scarce. While peer feedback often plays an important role in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing development, few studies seem to have addressed the potential impacts of peer feedback activities on students' overall writing feedback literacy. To fill this gap, a mixed-methods study was designed to investigate the effect of peer feedback activities on students' writing feedback literacy development across such dimensions as appreciating feedback, making judgements, acknowledging different sources of feedback, managing affect, and taking actions with feedback. Two intact classes, one as the experimental group and the other control group, participated in the study. The experimental group engaged in peer feedback activities during the semester (12 weeks), whereas the control group received conventional teacher feedback only. The pre- and post-intervention results based on a writing feedback literacy scale were compared between the two groups, in addition to the analysis of interviews with the teacher and focal students from the experimental group, as well as students' written assignments and revisions after receiving peer feedback. Results showed that peer feedback activities could significantly improve students' appreciation of feedback and their ability to make judgements. Nevertheless, no significant changes in other dimensions were identified. These findings extend the current understanding of EFL students' writing feedback literacy and hold valuable pedagogical implications.

# 1. Introduction

Researchers have long recognised feedback as an essential component in enhancing students learning (Hattie & Timperley, 2007) In the field of education, researchers have widely acknowledged feedback as a crucial element for fostering and strengthening leaning processes. Its importance is also acknowledged in the field of EFL writing (Hyland, 2016). In process-based writing classrooms, feedback can considerably enhance students writing abilities. Genre-oriented instruction with scaffolded learning techniques also recognises the significant role of feedback in writing classrooms (Hyland & Hyland, 2019).

The effectiveness of feedback, however, largely depends on students' understanding of the feedback and their willingness and ability to take appropriate actions in response to such feedback (Price et al., 2010). This understanding, along with the capacities and dispositions required to omprhd d utilise th fedack, has eeferre tostdent fedack litrcy (Carss  Boud, 2018) Learners who are feedack literate will recognise the significance of feedback, proactiely seek external asesments, and apply constructive feedback to enhance their future performance. Furthermore, they are more likely to adopt positive attitudes and be. haviours toward laning (Crles & Boud, 2018; Han & Xu, 2020; Molloy et a., 2020. Conversely, a lack of feedback literacy hinders not only the effectiveness of the feedback proces (Carless & Boud, 2018) but also the outcome of such feedback proceses (Molloy et al., 2020).

Due to the importance placed on feedback literacy, in the field of EFL writing instruction, there has been a growing scholarl focus on the writing feedback literacy of EFL students. Researchers have attempted to conceptualis students writing feedack literacy and develop instrments that measure it (Dong et a., 2023; Yu et al., 2022). More recently, reearchers have also begun to explore effective approaches to enhancing students writing feedback literacy through Al-based applications and online writing asssments (Ma et al. 2021; Rad et al., 2023; Zhang-Wu, 2023).

Peer feedback, as an important pedagogical tool for writing instruction, invites students' feedback on each other's work, and has been investigated mainly for is mpact on partcular dimensions of writig feedback literacy, including, for example, students ability to evaluate fdack quality and their aility to incororate fedback into ther revision and writing proces ., Gao et al., 2019 i & Herbert, 2023; Man et al., 2022; Nicol, 2010; Schunn & Wu, 2019). In this strand of research, only a handful of studies have explored the influence of pr feedack on the development of students overall writing feedback literacy (Han & Xu, 2020; Man et al., 2022; Zhang & Mao, 2023; Zhang-Wu, 2023), with Man et al. (2022) focusing on pr feedback training, while the rest examining the role of teacher feedback concurrently. However, few studies that primaril focused on examining the direct impact of peer fedback activities on students writing feedback literacy development. Finll, existing studies have predominantly employed the case study approach to investigating how pee fedack shape stdents writing feedback litracy. While casestudies provide rich data and in-depth anlysis, they often involve small sample sizes and potential researcher bias (Paltridge & Phakiti, 2015).

Therefore, to address these research gaps and examine how peer feedback activities impact students' overall writing feedack literacy development, the present study utlised a mixed-methods design to investigate the changes in students' writing feedback literacy through peer feedback activitie over one semester. This study aims to contribute to our understanding of student feedback literacy in EFL writing education. Additionall, it seks to offer insights into pedagogy and establish a foundation for future feedack literacy education.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Student feedback literacy in EFL writing

Due to its significance, educational researchers have made extensive efforts to conceptualise fdback literacy. Sutton (2012) first characterise feedback literacy as the capability to read, interpre, and effecively utilise written feedback" (p. 31). According to Sutton, feedback literacy entails not only teachable abilities to provide and use feedback but also students' perspectives about thir roles in the fedack process Expanding on Sutton (2012), Crles and Boud (2018) synthesised earier reearch to further develop the conceptualization within the social constructivist paradigm, proposing that feedback is constructed through dialogues, sensemaking, and collaborative efforts among participants. They introduced a proces-oriented conceptualisation of feedback, including four components: (1) appreciating feedback, which demands that students recognise the positive impact of feedback on learning and actively engage in the feedback process (2) making judgements, which requires rfined skill in assessing the appropriateness of feedback and choosing the suitable level of external support; (3) managing affect, which refers to students' abilit to handle their motions and practices especially when facd with critical feedback; and (4) taking action, where students employ feedackto inform their studies and improve performance in similar tasks in the future.

While Carlessand Boud (2018) confirmed the multidimensional and incremental nature of feedback iteracy, Molloy et al. (2020) extended their work to have focused on students perspectives and further proposed a student feedback litracy framework consisting of seven criteria, including dedicating oneself to using feedack for enhancement, appreciating fedback as a dynamic process and seeking information to enhance learning, among others. Each dimension highlights specific dispositions, beliefs, and behaviour characteristics of fdack-literat students. In sum, the aovementioned models collctively provide a solid basis for future feedack literacy conceptualisation, instrument development, and empirical studies.

Due to the varied characteristics of feedack iteracy in different contexts, i is crucial to examine fedack literacy within specific stakeholder groups and discilines. In the F writing contex, students ability to effctively utilis feedack to improve their writing, known as students' writing feedback literacy, holds substantial importance. There has recently been a surge in scholarly attention towards student fedack iteracy in the context of EFL writing. Building on Carles and Boud's (2018) framework, Zhou et al. (2024) further conceptualised student writing feedback iteracy as the cognitive, affective, and behavioural preparedness of students in handing feedback. Cogntive preparednes correspond to apreciating feedback and judging feedback quality; affective preparedness is comparable with managing affect; behavioural prepareness mirrors taking action. Additionall, some reearchrs are that Carless and Bouds framework nees to e furthr pified in different feedack contexts, and thus, propose different models. For examle, u and Liu's (2021) conception of student academic writing feedback literacy recognises the proactive involvement of student writers in cultivating their feedack literacy. It emphasises the mutual interplay inherent in the writing process and delineates a range of knowledge domains such as inguistic and genre knowledge) and skils (such as initiative and intropection) esential for sucessful student feedback. Considering the cognitie and social-affctive requirement for participatig in peerfedack activitie, Han and u (2020) conceptualised student feedback literacy as cognitive readiness and socio-affctive readiness within the context of second language (L2) writing. Furthermore, Yu et al. (2022) and Dong e al. (2023) have developed and validated instruments to evaluate EFL students' writing feedback literacy levels. Examining the responses from over 2000 Chinese university students, Yu et al. (2022) developed and validated an L2 student writing fedback literacy scale comprising 29 items with five dimensions and representing a refined version of Carless and Boud's (2018) four-dimensional model. Aditionally, Dong et al. (2023) focused on writing feedack literacy specific to peer feedback activities, developing and validating a scale utilising responses from over 400 Chinese university students. This scale encompasses four dimensions: proficiency in fedback-related knowledge and skills collaborative learning aptitude, recognition of peer feedback, and eagerness to engage in feedback processes.

In addition to the conceptualisations of writing feedback literacy and the instruments, prior studies have highlighted the importance of student writing feedback literacy. Adequate writing feedback literacy enables students to beter comprehend and apply feedback from diverse source to their written work (Yu et a., 2022), to manage their emotions and approach critical feedback with objectivity (Rad & Alipour, 2024), and to proactively seek external evaluations, such as pr feedback, for incorporation into their work (Yu & Liu, 2021). Therefore, writing feedback literacy contributes to the continuous learning and development of students writing skills (Yu & Liu, 2021).

Due to the significance of students' writing feedback literacy, researchers have advocated its proper development in EFL courses (Malecka et al., 2022; Yu & Liu, 2021) and examined the efectivenes of dfferent instructional approaches aimed at improving writing feedback literacy (Ma et al., 2021; Rad et al., 2023; Schillings et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2023; Zhang-Wu, 2023). Technological approaches, such as Al-driven applications and online writing courses/asessments, have been explored for their impact on the devel. opment of students' writing fedback literacy (Ma et al., 2021; Rad et al., 2023; Zhang-Wu, 2023). Moreover, translingual practices have been found toenance students awarnes, critical judgment, ositive identities, and motivation to act upon reived feedack (Sun et al., 2023). Additionall, reearchers have examined theffect of students pr-to-peer dialogues about their teacers written feedback. The findings indicated that such dialogues could improve students' comprehension of feedback and asessment critria (Schillings et al., 2020). Though various approaches to enhancing student writin fdack literacy have be investigated, few studies have examined the influence of peer feedback, despite its recognition as crucial pedagogical activity in writig classooms in reent years (e.g., Dong et al., 2023; Lee, 2017).

# 2.2. Peer feedback and EFL student writing feedback literacy

Peer feedback in EFL writing clases offers students the opportunity to engage in the practice of giving feedback to their peers on their writing, as well as receiving, interpreting, and incorporating feedback from peers. This process is cognitively challenging, requiring students to go beyond language knowledge recollection to engage in advanced cognitive processes such as explaining, justifying, comparing, and problem-solving. It also involves such metacognitive processes as evaluation, monitoring, and reflection (Evans, 2015; Nicol, 2010; Nicol e al., 2014), which, in turn, may improve students' proficiency in giving and interpreting fdback on written assignments (Han & Xu, 2020).

So far, numerous studies have shed light on how peer feedback improves students' writing proficiency, motivation, selfefficacy, autonomy, and use of diverse writing strategies (e.g., Berggren, 2014; Cui et al., 2021; Rosalia, 2010; Sun & Wang, 2022; Weng et l., 2023; u et al., 2022). Hower, cos prst rardng whhr  stdnts efftivly utilis the eeits of r feedback for developing their writing feedback iteracy. In response to this concern, some researchers have empirically explored students development of feedback literacy through per feedback practices, concentrating on specific aspects of writing feedback literacy, employing quasi-experimental designs, as well as qualitative designs. These aspects include recognising the value f fedback e.g, u & Carless, 2017; Yang et al., 2006; Yu, 2023, managing socio-affective relations (eg., Xu & Carles, 2017), reflecting on and judging feedback (e.g, Nicol, 2010), and incorporating fedback into the proces of revising and writing (e.g., Gao et al., 2019; Li & Herbert, 2023; Man et al., 2022; Schunn & Wu, 2019).

Though the dimensions of feedback literacy are interrelated in nature (Carless & Boud, 2018),current peer feedback studies primarily focus on specific dimensions in isolation. Only a limited number of studies have examined peer feedback's influence on overall student writing fdback literacy development. For example, Han and Xu (2020) focused on thre postgraduate students and examined how the teacher's comments on peer feedback influenced these students' writing feedback literacy, discovering that tu. dents' writing feedback literacy improved at different rates and degrees, with observed individual variations. Man et al. (2022) examined four non-English major students from China, revealing that three peer feedback training sessons positively impacted stu. dents feedback literacy across five dimensions, including recognising the importance of peer fedback, gaining knowledge about peer feedback, actively participating in the feedback process learning from giving fedback, and managing the emotions associated with receiving feedack In addition, in an 2 writing coure that incorporated peer feedback sessions, Zhang and Mao (2023) revealed that students maintained areflective stance towards their writing, while Zhang et al.'s (2023) longitudinal study involving three freshman university students indicated a positive trend in students' cognitive, behavioural, and emotional reactions towards per fedback. along with a better mastery of assessment criteria.

The above review of literature, however, reveals three gaps in the current scholarship. First, most of the existing studies focuse on how peer feedback impacts a particular dimension of students' writing feedback literacy. Second, the existing studies primarily examine the impact of a supporting component in the per feedback practice, such as teacher comments on peers feedback and peer feedback training sesions. Few studies have focused on the impact of peer feedback activitie on students writing feedback literacy development acros al the dimensions. Third, existing studies mainly employed a case study approach to investiating the growth of writing feedback literacy among several students. While case sudis ffer detailed analyses of literacy development and changes, they are limited by their focus on a small number of participants and may inroduce researcher subjectvity, potentially leading to biased findings (Paltridge & Phakiti, 2015).

To close these research gaps, the present study investigated the potential impact of per feedback activities on the overall writing feedback literacy of Chinese EFL students. Employing a quasi-experimental study design, involving an experimental group and a control group for comparison, this study aimed to assess how per feedback activities influence students' writing feedack literacy development. In addition, to provide a comprehensive analysis qualitative data, including semi-structured interviews and students writing drafts with comments and revisions, were collected to provide additional insights. Two research questions were examined in this study:

Research Question 1. : Do one-semester peer feedback activities significantly enhance students' writing feedback literacy?

Research Question2. : What asects f any, of students writing fdback literay could be inificantly influenced by peer feedac activities?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Design of the study

The current research utilised an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, combining a quasi-experiment with an interview session and the collection of students writing assignments. Two groups of students underwent a one-semester intervention and completed four writing tasks. The experimental group engaged in peer fedback sessions, whereas the control group received conventional teacher feedback only. The researchers administered pre- and post-intervention writing feedack literacy scales to both groups for a measure of their writing feedack literacy levels. Afer the intervention, individual interviews were conducted with the teacher and four students from the experimental group. These students written assgnments with per comments and revisions were also collected for examination. Fig. 1 illustrates the entire research design procedure.

# 3.2. Research context

The research was conducted in an intermediate-level writing course at a local college located in southeastern China. The primary goal of this course was to enhance the writing abilities of second-year English majors, with a particular focus on improving their argumentative essay writing skill. The course lasted 12 weeks, with each week consisting of a 90-minute class. Over the entire se. mester, students were required to complete four writing assgnments on the following four topics of \*teaching to the test," \*passions and dreams, "doctor-patient relationship," and "environmental protection."

The study took place in two clases taught by the same teacher, who holds a PhD degree in English Education. With over seven years of teaching experince in English writing, she was well-vered in EFL university students' unique writing traits and familiar withthe process of formative assessment in writing classes.

Fig. 1. The design of the study.

# 3.3. Participants

The participants comprised 59 second-year English majors from two clase, all aged between 19 and 21, and born and educated in mainland China. On average, they had been learning English for 9 to 12 years by the time of this study. Mandarin was th first language of these participants. According to the Common European Framework of References for Languages, their English proficiency levels were approximately at B2 (upper ntermediate) during our study. In the firs two years of universty, they were required to take courses aimed at ehancing their listening, reading, speaking, and writig skls, as wll as developing their knowledge of Westn culture and literature. During the Fall Semester of 2022, these English majors were enrolled in an intermediate writing course. Apart from the types of feedback they received, both classes received identical instruction and used the same textbooks.

# 4. The experiment

To examine whether pr feedack activities in EFL writing courses can influence students writing fedback literacy, one class was assigned as the control group $\left( \mathtt { n } = 2 5 \right)$ , and the other was assigned as the experimental group $( \mathtt { n } = 3 4 )$ . The incorporation of the control group aimed to capture changes in writing feedback literacy as aresult of the intervention, although the use of intact classes and conventional teacher feedback in the control clas, out of ethical considerations, certainly \*constitutes a limitation' similar to many such studies carried out in authentic educational settings (cf. Sheen, 2007, p.257).

The students from the experimental group were divided into teams, each consisting of three to four students. At the beginning of the semester, th tds reid tw sions of p feack rag Inth firt trnng sion, th tchr inocd thm to the objectives, proceses, and benefits of peer fdback. In addtion, th teacher familirised the students with the criteriafr ssesing argumentative essays (Yale Macmillan Center, n.d.) as outlied in the Appendix. According to the criteria, the argumentative essays would be asessed from four main aspects, including introduction and conclusion, main points, organisation, and mechanics. In the second training session, the teacher guided students through Min's (2005) procedures of providing per feedack: clarifying writers intentions, identifying problems, explaining the nature of problems, and making specific suggestions. The teacher ilustrated these steps with examples. Students were then required to practise offering comments on a sample essay, and the teacher provided her comments on selected students' peer feedback in class.

During the semester, four per feedback sessions were conducted in the experimental group in relation to students' four writing tasks. Before each peer feedack session, students were required to provide wrtten comments on their peers essays. After the peer feedack provision, students also need to carefully read the comments from their pers. During the subsequent in-class eer feedback sessions, students were required to print out their own writing and bring it to class, where they discussed and clarified the comments they had received and/or provided. f students were unclear about the stes involved in per feedback or how to implement these steps, they could occasionally sek assistance verall from their teacher. However, teachers would not directly give feedback or comments on the students' writing. After class students revised their initial drafts according to peers suggestions and their discussions. Fig. 2 below provides a visual presentation of the procedure of peer feedback implementation in the experimental group.

Fig. 2. Procedures involved in peer feedback sessions.

The control group students received the same writing instructionfrom the same teacher and were assigned the same writing tasks as those undertaken by the experimental group. Nonetheles, the control goup students rceived conventional writte feedack from the teacher on their four writing assgnments. In the teacher feedback sessions, the teacher summarised and explained the key issues identified in students' assignments and provided revision suggestions to the students.

It i noteworthy that as an ethical measure aimed at ensuring relatively equal accessto educational resources, teacher feedback on the assignments was provided to the experimental group students as well fter the intervention. In addition, the teacher would incorporate peer feedback training and practices into the control group classes in the subsequent semester.

# 5. Data collection and analysis

To examine the potential ffect f peer feedback n students writing fedack literacy level, both roups of students were required to complet pre- and post-intervention writing feedback litracy measures. The pre-intervention measure took placeat the beginning of the semester, during which allstudents in both groups respondd to the sale that evaluatd their writing fdack literacy levels. In the 12th week, the post-intervention measure was administered, and student from both groups were again required to complete the scale for an evaluation of their then-current writing feedback literacy level.

Additionally, the researchers conducted individual interviews at the end of the semester to gain further insights from the exper. imental group students and the teacher regarding the impact of peer feedback activities on writing feedback literacy development. Four students from the experimental group volunteered to share their perceptions of any changes in their writing feedback literacy following the peer fedback activities. Similarl, the teacher was also interviewed to share her perspective on the students writing feedback literacy development that likely resulted from the peer feedback intervention.

# 5.1. Quantitative phase of the study

# 5.1.1. The instrument

In this study, Yu et al.'s (2022) validated Student Writing Feedback Literacy Scale, a five-point Likert scale containing five dmensions with 28 items, was employed. The five dimensions included appreciating feedback, acknowledging different feedback sources, making judgements, managing affect, and taking action. Apreciating feedback refers to students' perceptions of the value of feedback. Acknowledging diffeent fdack source pertains to studnts attitdes towards various tyes of fedback.Making judgements denotes students' abilit to evaluate the quality of writing and feedback and select information to improve their writing quality. Managing affect involes student motional reilience n feedback sessons. Taking action refers to students' attempts to utilise the feedback information to improve their writing and to adjust thir learning objectives when necessary. Participants were required to self-report using a five-point Liker scal, ranging from1 (trongly disagree to 5 (strongly agee, to indicat their level f agrement or consistency with the provided statements. A higher score reflected a higher level of writing feedback literacy. The scores of ind. vidual items within each dimension were summed to determine the student's overall score in that dimension. The sum of scores from all items represented the overall score of the student writing feedback literacy.

The rationale behind selecting this scale stems from its original design for Chinese university students. Additionally, this scale measures students' writing fdback literacy levels, which is consistent with the focus of the current study. Furthermore, it has been validated, adding to its credibility and suitabilit for the research. The reliability of the scale in this study was also examined. The Cronbach's alpha values of the scale were 0.949 and 0.932 for the pre- and post-intervention measures, respectively.

# 5.1.2. Data analyses

In total, 118 survey responses were collected, comprising 59 pre-intervention responses and 59 post-intervention responses. SPSS 23.0 was employed to analyse the collected data. Descriptive statistics were used to determine if the pre-intervention and postintervention writing feedback literacy levels within each group were diffrent. If yes, the next step involved conducting the anal. ysis of covariance (ANcov) to determine if a inificant difference existed in the impact of the two feedback aproaches on students writing feedback literacy development. Before conducting the ANcovA analysis the pre-intervention scores between the two groups would be compared to check for significant differences. If there are no significant differences, the ANcoVA analysis would proced. In the AncovA analysis, the researchers compared the two groups' post-intervention scores, regarding their pre-intervention overall writing feedback literacy as a covariate. The independent variable in this analysis was the feedback intervention.

# 5.2.  Qualitative phase of the study

# 5.2.1. Data collection

The main goal of this phase was to explain the statistical results in the quantitative findings. To gain deeper insights into the potential effcts of peer feedack on students writing feedack iteracy, four students were invited to participate in the individual semi-structured interviews, with their consent. Their profiles are presented in Table 1. The interviews were conducted afer the intervention, centring on the following aspects (a) the students' experience with giving and reeiving feedback, (b) changes in their skills and attitudes toward giving and reeiving fedack bfore and after er feedback essions, and (c) ther viewoins on how peer feedback influenced their writing feedback literacy. Each interview was conducted in Mandarin and lasted between 60 to 80 mins. The four students' written assignments, with comments and revisions, were also collcted for analyses of identifiable changes in the students' writing feedback literacy during the feedback-giving, feedback-receiving, and feedback-utilising activities.

Additionally, the teacher was also interviewed for her perspective on the impact of peer feedback on students' writing feedback literacy development. This interview encompassed the following aspects: (a) any observed changes in students practices towards receiving and providing peer feedback, and (b) the influence of peer feedback on students' writing feedback literacy.

# 5.2.2. Data analyses

Two researchers in this study coded the interview data and students written assignments. The existing dimensions of writing feedback literacy were consulted: appreciating feedback, acknowledging different feedback sources, making judgements, managing affect and taking action (Yu et al., 2022). The rearchers paid attention to the contents releant to students witing fedack iteracy, remaining open to novel insights and observations that had not been proposed in the literature, if any. Independent coding from each researcher underwent acomparative analysis, and any coding discrepancies were deliberated upon until a consensus was achieved.

# 6. Results

# 6.1. Results of the quantitative phase

To address the firstresearch question, a series of quantative analyses were undertaken. Descriptive statistics in Table 2 showed that after one semester of intervention, the writing feedack literacy levels of participants in the experimental group demonstrated improvement. In contrast, the writing fedback literacy levels of the control group exhibited minimal change. The result of the independent sample t-test showed no significant difference between the two groups $( t = 1 . 4 2 5 , p = 0 . 1 5 2 )$ in the pre-intervention scores. One-way ANcoVA was then employed to investigate whether there were any significant differences between the experimental and control groups' changes in writing feedback literacy levels. Before conducting AncovA, preliminary analyses were carried out to ensure the dat lfilled the assuptions of Ac procedures, incuing the sknes and krtos ratios, eene's estrsults, and regression coefficients. The results confirmed that the data met the necessary ANcoVA assumptions.

The AncoVA analysis was then carried out to examine the two groups post-intervention writing fedback literacy levels. The preintervention scores of writing feedback litracy were controlled as a covariate, and the analysis result of post-intervention scores, presented in Table 3, showed that there was a significant difference in the two groups' performance $( F = 7 . 6 9 0$ $\begin{array} { r }  p = 0 . 0 1 \ \end{array}$ ). The eta squared value of 0.121 indicates a moderate effect size (Cohen, 1992). This finding demonstrates that students in the experimental group achieved significantly higher post-intervention scores of writing feedback litracy than students in the control group, indicating that peer feedback is effective in improving EFL students' writing feedback literacy levels.

To addresthe second research question and examine the potential effcts of per feedback on specific dimensions of students writing feedback literacy development, quantitative analyses were also conducted. Descriptive statistics were first computed to determine the mean scores of EFL students' writing fedback litracy across dimensions in both groups before and after the intervention. The esults in Table 4 show that most dimensions demonstrated changes between the means of each group's pre-intervention and post-intervention writing feedback literacy levels.

To examine f these differences were significant, the researchers conducted one-way AncovAs, with the pre-intervention scores of writing feedback literacy serving as a covariate. According to previous analyses no significant difference was found between the pre intervention overall writing fedback literacy levels of both groups. Subsequent ANcOVA analyses were carried out. The findings, as presented in Table 5, demonstrate  significant dfference in the levels of feedback appreciation between the two student groups. The $F \mathrm { . }$ statistic for this difference was 7.121 with $p = 0 . 0 1 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 1 3$ To be more specific, the experimental group exhibited a significantly higher level of their appreciation f feedback compared to the control group. These results suggest that the exposure to peer feedback experiences significantly enhances students' perceptions of the value of feedback.

Moreover, regarding students ability to recognise and acknowledge diffrent feedback sources, the statistical values showed an Fstatistic of 3.679, with a $p$ value of 0.06 and an effect size of 0.062, indicating no significant effect of peer feedback on how students acknowledged different feedback sources.

In addition, the cores on the students' abilit to make judgements were significantly higher in the pee feedback group than inthe conventional teacher feedback group $( F = 0 . 6 8 9$ A $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 3 5 \mathrm { ) } } \end{array}$ . This result suggests that peer feedback exerted a significantly beneficial influence on students' ability to analyse and choose information to improve their writing quality. According to Cohen's (1992) guidelines, the effect size $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 )$ suggests a moderate effect.

Regarding students emotional regulation in response to feedback, the AncovA results indicated no statistically significant dif. ference in the post-intervention scores between the two groups $( F = 0 . 8 5 5$ $\pmb { p = 0 . 3 5 9 }$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 1 5 )$ . This implies that the exposure to peer feedback did not have a significant impact on students' ability to regulate their emotional responses to feedback.

Similarly,concerning students feedback take-up actions, the AncoVA results demonstrated no statistically significant ifference in the post-intervention scores between the two groups $( F = 1 . 6 0 0$ $p = 0 . 2 1 1$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 2 8 )$ . This implies that peer feedback does not seem to influence how students utilise the feedback information to enhance their writing and adapt their learning objectives.

In brief, the statistical analyses demonstrated that the exposure to peer fedback activities had a significantly positive impact on students' overall writing fedack literacy development. To be more specific, students in the experimental group exhibite significantly improved skill in appreciating feedback and evaluating and selecting the information to improve their writing quality. Nevertheles the impact of per feedback was not significant in tems of how students rcognised and acknowledged various sources of feedback, their feedback take-up actions, and their emotional management.

# 6.2. Results of the qualitative phase

Four students (P1, P2, P3, and P4) from the peer feedback group were interviewed, and they were requested to provide their assignments after per feedback sessions. The results from the analyses of inerviews and students asignments largely aligned with quantitative findings, showing their changes in (1) recognising the value feedback and (2) making judgements. However, there was limited evidence of changes in (3) managing emotion, (4) utilising different sources f fedback, and (5) implementing actions based on feedback.

# 6.2.1. Recognising the value of feedback

First, students' feedback-exchanging practices enabled them to recognise the significance and benefits of feedback for enhancing their writig skils. They acknowledged that providing feedack could encourage them to repeatedly revist the linguistic and genre knowledge to ensure the feedback they provided was acurate, thereby fortifying their understanding of existing knowledge. For example, one student (P1) commented as follows:

If I rely only on what the teacher has taught in the writing class I wll forget the knowledge easily. However, if my peers bring my attention to the same ssues again in their feedback on my writing, it reinforces my knowledge. Also, while providing feedback on my peers' work, I often need to verify the correctness of my comments. This process also improved my understanding of writing. (Interview, P1)

Moreover, students believed that receiving per fedback improved their self-evaluation and reflective ailities. The feedback from peers allowed them to view their own writing from a different perspective, as shared by another student.

In terms of coherence, sometimes I personally feel that the relationship between the preceding and following sentence i clear. However, in the eyes of others, appropriate transitional words are required to make the connection explicit. It i very valuable to have another perspective to help me identify my writing issues. (Interview, P3)

# 6.2.2. Making judgements

As peer fedback progressed, students enhanced their aility to ealuate the qualit of written assignments. The teacher observed that throughout feedback exchange, students frequently consulted the writing assment criteria to ensure ther feedback relevance and accuracy. Such frequent consultation of assessment criteria certainly contributed to students internalization of the defining features of effctive argumentative writing, thus improving their ability to make judgements about the qualit of a text. For example, students (2, P3) reported their enhanced understanding of efective introduction and argument structure, as a result of such feedback practices:

When asessing the first paragraph, my initial focus i on whether the author clearly defines the problem and presents a thesis statement. It is an important foundation for an argumentative essay. (Interview, P2)

I would examine whether both supporting and opposing views were proposed with sufficient supporting evidence. If so, these elements could constitute a complete argumentative structure. (Interview, P1)

Analysis of students assignments and feedback also showed an increasingly broader coverage of key constructs intheir writing and feedback giving practices over time. In Task 1, for example, students predominantly focused their feedback on grammatical errors, followed by theargumentatie structure. However, in Task 3, they started to address ssues beyond these two aspects, covering gere format, wrig conventions, mechanics, as well as argumentation effectivenes. Some students even developed an understanding of cross-cultural communication and audience awareness. For example, when one of his peers quoted the government slogan, "Gren mountains and clear water equal mountains of gold and silver," to emphasise the importance of environmental protection, Student P3 commented criticlly that this expresion was a direct translation of ahinese sogan that is to parochial to be readly accessible and appealing to an international audience. He thus recommended that his per provide more background and contextualisation if h til would want to use this slogan.

In addition, the teacher also observed that students were able to recognise a broader range of issues in thir writing. As she shared

In the beginning, students mostly tackled minor issues, such as errors in words and phrases. But as time went on, they shifted to the macro level issues, paying attention to the alignment with prompts, message conveyance, and intercultural communication. Their fedback became more comprehensive, covering various aspects of writing. And you know what? Most of their suggestions on these aspects were accurate. (Interview, T)

Admittedly, some comments provided by students stil revealed occasional inaccuracies in their assessment of argumentation, leading to sometimes misguided suggestions. Nevertheless both teacher perceptions and student slf-rflections, as well as textual evidence, sm to show a cler development of knowledge about writing and skill in providing quality feedback over the course of one semester.

In terms f fack retion, studnts shifed from n \*cting all sugstios attitdeo more ritical ad sctive resonses to peer comments in their revisions. They made note (such as \*double-check") or marks (such as a question mark) beside comments they believed to be questionable. Both the students and the teacher highlighted this change during the interviews.

To be honest, I found many of my peers' sugestions were not appropriat. But Istil tag the \*awkward" ones and discuss them with my peers. I think it is an opportunity for us to figure things out together. (Interview, P4)

# 6.2.3. Managing emotion

Students exhibited various emotional responses towards feedback. Only one student (P2) expressed that she could maintain a positive attitude towards critical feedback. However, the majorit of other students tended to respond to critical feedack with a negative atitude. One student (P3) admitted that \*[he] find it challenging to accept negative comments, especiall from those less proficient in writing, [and that h]. thought it was a waste of time to lean from their feedback (Interview, P3). Another student (P1)

expressed embarrassment about errors in their writing, saying, Td rather have my teacher point out my mistakesthan receive feedback from my pers" (Interview, P1). One student conveyed that the abundance ofeedback ofte left him feeling overwhelmed, "not know[ing] where to begin... [and eventually] simply giv[ing] up correcting the mistakes" (Interview, P4).

# 6.2.4. Utilising different sources of feedback

The interview results indicated that three of the four students lacked awareness ofeedback originating from different sources e., peers, teachers, and Automated Writing Evaluation). They can hardly articulate the different scopes, as well as the strengths and weaknesses, of feedback from various sources, nor how to use them to improve their writig. Instead, they tend to favour feedback from \*the authority." For example, one student remarked, I don't care much about the sources of feedback provided. I think the feedback from the teachers and my peers with advanced writing skills are helpful for me' (Interview, P1).

Only one student (P2) seemed to have appreciated feedback from various sources and had a clear understanding of how different sources of feedback can be best combined and utilised. As she shared during the interview:

In my mind, the best way to check my writing is to check through Grammarly or Pigai to locate any language mistakes. Those tools give quick and accurate feedback. After that, Isubmit my revised work to either my peers or my teacher. They don't need to waste time on my grammar; they just need to give me their suggestions on the content of the article and other aspects. (Interview, P2)

# 6.2.5. Implementing actions based on feedback

An examination of students' revised texts showed that the majority of peer feedback was taken up by students in their revision. However, when asked whether they would be able to apply such per feedback for longer-term writing practices, most responded neatively. However, they did reflect on how to reine pr fedack activitie in the fuure. ome students, for instance, mphasised the importance of creating a comfortable feedback environment focusing on key aspects, and offering specific suggestions based on identified issues. One student (P2) explained, "Sometimes, I received criticism without detail, which can be confusing. If my peers were required to provide specific suggestions, it would be easer for me to make progress. Similarly, another student (P4) mentioned his preference for focused feedback over "comprehensive' feedback that can be too overwhelming to handle.

Furthermore, based on their peer feedback experience, students proposed suggestions for future per fedback activities. One student (P1) expressed the desire to form a peer feedback group with clssmates whose language sills complemented their own. Another student (P2) suggested random assignment of peer groups for the following reason.

I think that peers should be assigned randomly rather than ltting us pick our own peers. When we have the freedom to select our peers, we often tend to pick our close riends. However, this may result in friends avoiding giving honest feedback. Random assignment can address this problem. (Interview, P2)

# 7. Discussion

This study examined the impact of peer feedback activities on the development of EFL students' writing feedback literacy. The findings indicated that the experimental group, which had undergone pr feedback sessions for one semester, significantl improved on their overall writing fdack literacy. This reult generally supports the findings of previous works in this field (Han & Xu, 2020, Man et al., 2022; Zhang & Min, He et al., 2023; Zhang & Mao, 2023). Additionally, analysis of how peer fedback influenced the individual dimensions of writing feedack literacy revealed a significant improvement in students' appreciation of fedback and thir recognition of the value of fdback in advancing their writing skils. t is ikely that beause these students face similar writing tass and experienced similar challenges in their writing, they were able to empathise with one another's ifficultie. Consequently, they were in a better position to provide constructive feedback to each other and gain valuable insights from each other.

Furthermore, in per feedback sessions, students not only received writte feedback but also engaged in in-person conversations with peer, deliberating over the interpretation of the feedack. Therefor, students felt that the efectiveness f feedack was maximised. This finding is consistent with previous studies (Man et al., 202; Schilings e al., 2020; Zhang e al., 2023; Zhang & Mao, 2023, where researchers found that through peer feedback activitie, students realised the inherent learning potential of feedback. They also found opportunities to refect on their own writing and gain insights through the negotiation of meaning and the examination of others' writing samples.

Our findings also revealed significant improvements in students' ability to make judgements, i.e., to appraise and choose information to improve their writing quality. This finding isconsistent with the studies conducted by Han and Xu (2020) and Man et al. (2022), which indicatdthat while stdnts intill fad challenge in alatin feack quality, feback ractic facilitatethe development of their eedack iteracy and improved their ability to evaluate the feedback they received. In addition, peer feedback involved students both proiding feedack  ther per nd reeiving feedback from them.When fering feedback to er, students needed to analysevarious dimensions of writing and bore the responsibilit of reeatedly consulting the rubric t verify the accuracy of their remarks. This process encouraged them to think analyticall, compare different information sources, and further refine their judgement skills. Moreover, when receiving feedback, students likely had confronted contradictory feedback from peers. Conse. quently, they had tocitically evaluate the releance and usefulness of such fedack This proces empowered them to mak informed decisions regarding which feedback to incorporate into their revisions, thus claiming ownership of their own writing. This finding echoes those f Han and Xu (2020) and Zhao and Qi (2023), who found that after pr feedack activities students demonstrated an improved understanding of what comprised high-quality peer feedback, along with an enhanced abilit to evaluate the quality of peers' writing.

Using different source of feedback to guide students in their writing development is a crucial skill (Yu et al., 2022). However, the findings did not demonstrate that per feedback was effective in helping students improve their comprehension of these sources of feedback. This lack of effctivenes could be because the students from the experimental group only received fedback from peers and seldom had the chance to compare and contrast various sources f eedback, such as teacher feedack and online automated feedback. Furthermore, our findings did not reveal any significant impact of peer feedback on how students managed their affect towards feedback. One possible explanation could be that the limited number of per feedack sessions in this study (only four) did not lead to suficient critical feedback in the first place, thus faiing to create enough opportunitie for students to learn to handle emotional responses to critical feedback. Achieving significant hfts in this aspect may require prolonged and more consistent engagement and even explicit exernal intervention at the beginning stage. Regarding students' feedback take-up actions with feedback, quantitative findings did not indicat significant change following peer feedback. Nevertheless interviews with students from the pr fedback group showed that students developed an enhanced understanding of the effective approaches to providig and utilising feedback. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the relatively short duration was insufficient to support students in translating task-specific knowledge into general practices, as it demands increased cognitive effrt, heightened motivation, and learner agency.

# 8. Conclusion

The study investigated the impact of pee feedback activities on EFL students writing feedback literacy development in response to the observed lack f empirical research in this area. The findings revealed that students exposed to peer fedback actvities over the course of one meter signficantly eand thr vl witing feack itray, particulrl in their apprciation f fedack and their abilit to ass writing quality. The findings havexpanded our understanding of the theortical conceptions of student feedback literacy. Moreover, existing frameworks have primarily focused on either delineating the components of student feedback literacy (e. g., Carles & Boud, 2018; Han & Xu, 2020; Sutton, 2012) or elucidating its developmental processes (Yu & Liu, 2021). The current study sugests that student feedback literacy development entails both a componential and a developmental view. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding is needed, one that recognises the various impacts of peer feedack activities on diffrent feedback literacy dimensions, in order to inform future writing assessment practices.

Furthermore, the research offers some pedagogical implications. Whil peer feedback i effective it alone does not full optimise students' writing feedback literacy development. Future approaches should introduce other feedback types, such as teacher and machine-generated feedback, tailored to different stages of students' writing feedack literacy development in EFL writing courses.

Due to the various practical constraints, this study is not without limitations. For example, it only focused on the writing feedback literacy development of English major students from a college in southeastern China. Future research could involve students from diverse contexts to test the generalizability of the results reported in this paper. Moreover, the study examined the short-term impact of peer feedback activities on students' writing feedback literacy development during one semester using a pre- and post-intervention design. Future studies could incorporate a longer intervention and collect delayed post-intervention data to explore the lasting impact of peer fedback activities over time. Furthermore, the opinions of control group participants and the instructor's perspective on them were not sought during the interview. Including them in future reearch will provide valuable insights. Additionally, although this study examined various dimensions of writing feedback literacy, the potential interactions among such dimensions and with other variables remain unexplored, warranting further investigation. Finally, the study primarily relied on self-reported data, which may influence the objectivity of the findings. Future research may seek to incorporate objective data such as classrom observations and objective measures of students' writing feedback literacy so as to yield more robust results.
