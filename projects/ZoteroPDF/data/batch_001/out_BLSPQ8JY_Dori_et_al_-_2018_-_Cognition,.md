# Innovations in Science Education and Technology

Volume 24

Series editor Karen C. Cohen Weston, MA, USA

As technology rapidly matures and impacts on our ability to understand science as well as on the process of science education, this series focuses on in-depth treatment of topics related to our common goal: global improvement in science education. Each research-based book is written by and for researchers, faculty, teachers, students, and educational technologists. Diverse in content and scope, they refect the increasingly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches required to effect change and improvement in teaching, policy, and practice and provide an understanding of the use and role of the technologies in bringing beneft globally to all.

# Foreword

One of the most prevalent and dangerous misconceptions about education in the twenty-frst century is that because so much information is easily accessible “at the tip of our fngers,” knowledge construction should no longer be viewed as a major goal of schooling. Supporters of this view often maintain that current schools should focus on teaching generic skills rather than content-specifc knowledge. This book, edited by Dori, Mevarech, and Baker (2017), contributes to refuting this misconception. It is therefore highly signifcant that the three general, “big” constructs discussed throughout the book, namely, cognition, metacognition, and culture, are addressed in a variety of content-rich frameworks and across all four components of STEM education: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Although in other educational contexts technology and engineering education had sometimes been pushed aside in favor of science and mathematics education, in this book, technology and engineering education take center stage, as they should, in current STEM education.

More specifcally, there are debates in the literature about whether and to what extent cognitive and metacognitive skills are general, domain transcending, or context bound (e.g., Perkins and Salomon 1989; Veenman 2011). According to a recent review on metacognition in science education (Zohar and Barzilai 2013), the development of learners’ conceptual understanding has long been a central focus of science education research. However, previous reviews of metacognition in science education have claimed the role of metacognition in developing learners’ understanding of specifc science concepts has not been suffciently studied in such contexts. Therefore, the role of metacognition in developing conceptual understanding deserves increased attention from researchers and educators. In contrast, the data of the more recent 2013 review showed that, in recent years, the potential contribution of metacognition to the understanding of science content has become a central area of research. Many of the reviewed studies addressed metacognition in rich scientifc subject-specifc contexts. This trend frmly places metacognitive research in a central junction of science education interest, namely, advancing deep understanding of scientifc concepts and reasoning skills. This trend also opens the door for new research- and practice-oriented questions.

One such important question pertains to the generality versus content specifcity of metacognition in STEM education. When designing STEM curriculum in an integrated way, an issue that becomes central is determining the aspects of metacognition that can and should be taught in general, across all four components of STEM education, and the aspects that need to be tailored to each area separately. How can we best use metacognition to deepen the understanding of specifc concepts throughout the STEM curricula? Finally, how can we use evidence from previous research to support the adaptation to specifc content areas?

The frst step in answering these questions is to create an inventory of studies that examine metacognitive learning and instruction in all STEM areas. At a later stage, an analysis of many studies might form the foundation for devising integrated STEM evidence-based guidelines for how to best apply metacognition across and within areas of STEM education. While at this point there are many studies about metacognition in mathematics and science education, similar research in technology1 education and engineering education is less developed. Although there are an increasing number of studies about the application of metacognition in learning technologies (e.g., Azevedo and Aleven 2013), the area of metacognition in engineering education is in its infancy. The idea promoted in the book by Dori, Mevarech, and Baker (2017) proposes to look at all four STEM subjects together with respect to metacognition. The book begins to uncover the similarities among them in terms of metacognitive instruction and is therefore a step in the right direction. The addition of culture is also signifcant.

Finally, the review of studies of metacognition in science education (Zohar and Barzilai 2013) revealed that there are an insuffcient number of studies of teachers’ (both preservice and in-service) knowledge and professional development regarding metacognition. This research gap is a serious limitation in the ability to carry out large-scale implementation of metacognitive instruction in authentic classrooms. The book edited by Dori, Mevarech, and Baker attends to that research gap as seven of the chapters address teachers or instructors, thereby contributing to the literature in this important feld.

Overall, the book constitutes an important landmark in discussing cognition, metacognition, and culture in STEM education, adding signifcant value to the body of literature on these fundamental subjects.

# Preface

To my late parents, Moshe (Polack) and Risia (Dudman) Haisraeli, whose history and passion for education made me who I am.

Education is the pinnacle of civilization activities. It is not just how we accept values, knowledge, and insights about the world we live in; education is by far the most effective means to instill peace and harmony among people and peoples. Science satisfes humans’ insatiable curiosity and drive to know more and understand better, providing the underpinning for engineering and technology. If used correctly, following universal values of social justice and the right to pursue happiness for all, science and technology are the foundations for humans’ welfare, health, and wellbeing. Unfortunately, people have not always applied these values as torches of progress. Throughout history, and especially in the twentieth century, there were terrible deviations from using science and technology to beneft humans, leading to a murderous regime that killed millions of innocents in the name of some false racist theory. In the current century, religion often leads to similar arguments and outcomes, though not yet at the same scale.

Education is the only single means through which it is possible to eradicate these movements and encourage people and peoples to respect each other’s right to live their lives the way they wish, exercising their cultures, so long as it does not infringe on others’ lives. Moreover, only science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) can stop the deterioration of our planet’s environment while increasing the economic pie, so nobody has to fght over shrinking resources.

STEM education must evolve through research to gain better understanding of how our brains process and assimilate new information and turn it to knowledge and comprehension. Metacognition is a relatively new frontier in education in general and in STEM education in particular. This book attempts to fuse cognition, metacognition, and culture to enhance STEM education. As this book involves authors from diverse backgrounds, different countries and continents, representing a plethora of cultures and approaches, it is my sincere hope that the book will make its modest contribution to encourage dialogue among STEM educators and teachers.

I wish to thank my co-editors and the chapter authors for their contributions to this book and their ongoing involvement. Thanks to Rea Lavi, my PhD student, whose editorial help was indispensable. Last but not least, thanks to my dear family, and especially to my husband, Dov Dori, for being there for me.
