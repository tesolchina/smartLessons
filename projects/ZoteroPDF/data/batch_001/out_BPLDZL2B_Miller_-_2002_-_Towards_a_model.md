# Abstract

This paper presents a new model to account for lecturing in a second language. The lecturing in a second language (LSL) model is based on extensive ethnographic research conducted by myself and with colleagues over the past 10 years at a university in Hong Kong, and in particular of an ethnographic case study of engineering students [Miller, L. (2002). Academic lecturing and listening in a second language: an ethnographic case study. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong]. There are four main themes to the model: the multi-dimensional context of lecturers in a second language; lecturer intention and student interpretation; the negative cycle of expectation; and the establishment of communities of learners and practice. The paper ends with some implications generated from the LSL model for students, their lecturers and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teachers.

# 1. Introduction

Research into second language (L2) listening comprehension has had a slow start. It was not until the early 1970s that research into this area obtained its own agenda. Prior to this time, much effort had been expended on researching listening in the first language (L1) and reading in the L2, but not on listening in the L2. There was an assumption that listening in the L2 was the same as in the learner’s native language, and that reading and listening were so similar, both being receptive skills, that what was true for reading must also be true for listening. The research into L1 listening and L2 reading has been helpful in understanding some of the issues important to

L2 listening, but it has also highlighted the need for a research agenda that is specific to L2 listening (Faerch & Kasper, 1986).

Although the amount of research into general L2 listening is increasing, we cannot rely on this research for all our insights into academic listening. Lecturing is a wellestablished practice in the academic context and as it is something which occurs on a daily basis, it deserves its own research agenda. Academic discourse is different from other more general listening events. It differs in that there is a special disciplinary orientation, that it is delivered to an audience in particular ways, and that the underlying rhetorical structures are different from English used in a more familiar conversational context (MacDonald, Badger, & White, 2000).

In spite of its slow start to research into L2 academic listening, a research agenda has developed over time. This research can be divided according to the research orientation, namely (1) measurement, that is, psychometric studies measuring aspects of speech or listening (cf. Derwing, 1990; Jackson & Bilton, 1994); (2) analysis, discourse analyses of speech (cf. Flowerdew & Tauroza, 1995; Rost, 1994); (3) identification, the identification of strategies conducive to success in listening (cf. Vandergrift, 1997a, 1997b); and (4) perceptions, ethnographic investigations describing and analyzing perceptions of academic speech (cf. Benson, 1989). It is the fourth of these research orientations that is referred to in this paper as the basis for suggesting a model of academic listening.

Over the past 10 years a series of ethnographic studies has been conducted at a university in Hong Kong. These studies focus on how Chinese students cope with their lectures in English. The studies have three foci: students’ and lecturers’ perceptions, problems and strategies in second language lectures (Flowerdew & Miller, 1992, 1996a; Flowerdew, Miller, & Li 2000), special issues of the lecture event (Flowerdew & Miller, 1995, 1996b), and an ethnographic case study of one group of low-language proficiency students (Miller, 2002).

# 1.1. Perceptions, problems and strategies

In the first of a series of articles, Flowerdew and Miller (1992) report the results of the perceptions, problems and strategies of non-native students receiving lectures in English. In a second article, Flowerdew and Miller (1996a) focus on how native English-speaking lecturers deliver lectures in English to Cantonese-speaking students, and in a third article Flowerdew et al. (2000) look at the issue from the point of view of Chinese lecturers lecturing in English to Chinese students.

The main findings of the earlier studies are that students and lecturers do share some similar perceptions about lectures in a second language. For instance, lectures are considered important events in university education, and there are different purposes of lectures—sometimes to give facts, other times to offer opinions. The students and lecturers agreed that the main problem in students successfully understanding their lectures was their language proficiency. The main strategies students used to overcome their linguistic difficulties were reading outside of the lecture and peer help. Their lecturers’ main strategies to help students comprehend the lectures were to modify their language and use plenty of examples.

# 1.2. Special issues in lectures in a second language

The second group of articles by Flowerdew and Miller (1995, 1996b) deals with special issues which emerged from the grounded data of their ethnographic studies. For the success of second language lectures, lecturers need to be aware of cultural elements that may affect the students’ ability to understand the spoken text. Flowerdew and Miller (1995) identify four cultural dimensions:

Ethnic culture refers to the social-psychological features which may come into effect when a lecture from one cultural background is presented to students from a different cultural background.   
Local culture refers to aspects of the local setting with which the members of a particular society are familiar. The way in which local culture often manifests itself in lectures is by the use of examples.   
Academic culture refers to cultural practices peculiar to educational institutions and can be identified at a number of levels, namely within a group of countries (e.g. Western countries), within an individual country, within a group of institutions in a given country, and at the level of an individual institution.   
Disciplinary culture is realised by each discipline having a specialized vocabulary and specific ways of presenting information, something students need to be made aware of.

In addition to the cultural dimensions to lectures, lecturers and students need to be aware of the socio-cultural features of lectures. Flowerdew and Miller (1996b) identify six, namely (1) purpose of lectures, (2) roles of lectures, (3) styles of lecturing, (4) simplification, (5) listener behaviour, and (6) humour. They propose that these features be investigated further to see how much they affect lectures in a second language.

# 1.3. An ethnographic case study

In the ethnographic research cited earlier, the focus was on either English-language major students—a group which might be considered less representative of the general abilities of second language users attending lectures in English—or the general student population. While such studies generate base-line data, Miller (2002) tested the findings with a group of engineering students, a specific group of students who might conceivably have problems in comprehending lectures in a second language (Vinke & Jochems, 1993).

In Miller’s (2002) study an opportunistic group (Miles & Huberman, 1994) of seventeen engineering students took part in a 3-year ethnographic case study. These students had low or very-low English language proficiency, as indicated by their Hong Kong public examination scores, yet had to attend up to $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of engineering lectures delivered in English per week in their first year of study. The following research instruments were used to collect the data from the students and their lecturers:

focus groups;   
student and lecturer journals;   
questionnaires;   
life histories;   
participant observations;   
participants’ verifications; and in-depth, semi-structured interviews.

The main findings from Miller’s (2002) study support many of the features identified by the previous ethnographic research. In addition to this, Miller also found a number of other issues which were of concern to L2 engineering students in his study:

1. Comprehension was effected when lecturers did not use standard local accent and pronunciation.   
2. There was comprehension failure when scientific written text was delivered as spoken text.   
3. Students requested detailed handouts and that the lecturer follow the handout in the lecture.   
4. Any deviation from the lecture handout, for example, an aside, caused comprehension failure.   
5. Students’ appreciated the use of technology in lectures, for example, computer simulations, but found it difficult to follow the spoken text at the same time as attending to the visual artefact.   
6. The lecture theatre environment was very important in helping students maintain their concentration in the lecture, for instance, if the lights were dimmed concentration levels fell.

In addition to these points, Miller (2002) found that the students formed a very close community of learners (Rogoff, Matsusov, & White, 1996) in order to cope with their lectures, but did not see themselves as part of a community of engineering practice (Lave, 1993). Furthermore, it seems that both the engineering students and their lecturers had difficulty in identifying or constructing a specific engineering lecture genre in the students’ first year of study.

Based on the etic perspective from previous studies (i.e. the universal categories already uncovered) and the emic perspective from Miller’s ethnographic case study (i.e. the culturally specific categories of the particular group under investigation) (Pike, 1967), it is possible to develop a model to account for listening to lectures in a second language.

# 2. The LSL model

The lectures in a second language (LSL) model can be seen in Fig. 1. The LSL model is based around the concept of a crystallized prism. There are three dimensions at the base of the prism: the concept that lectures have a specific genre(s), that students belong to a community of learners, and that lecturers are attempting to initiate students into a community of practice in their lectures. Then, each point of the prism can be seen as a distinct feature of a lecture. For lectures in a second language to be comprehensible the type of language used must be accessible to the listeners, the pedagogy used by the lecturer needs to be clear, lecture artefacts, such as handouts, have to be incorporated into the lecture in a systematic way, and the behaviour of the lecturer needs to be interpreted and understood by the students, for example, lecture’s use of gestures.

Fig. 1. The LSL prism model.

In the LSL prism model, students and lecturers enter the lecture with certain shared previous learning and teaching experiences, and with certain expectations of what will occur in the lecture. Then, as a result of the interaction of features and dimensions present in the model, the students exit the lecture with certain different levels of comprehension about the lecture. The prism needs to be seen in a crystallized form as the features and dimensions are dynamic and can change from course to course, subject to subject, or even within the same lecture. This all depends on how skilfully the lecturer handles the presentation of the content taking account of the dimensions, and features, and the ways in which students react to the lecture.

In order to explain the LSL model we need to consider the general themes which arise from the literature into academic listening and, more recently, from Miller’s (2002) ethnographic case study. Four main themes are integrated into the LSL model, these themes relate to different aspects of the model:

Theme 1. The multi-dimensional context of lecturers in a second language. This deals with language, pedagogy, lecture artefact and lecturer and student behaviour.

Theme 2. Lecturer intention and student interpretation. Based on an understanding on how the features in Theme 1 are interpreted, lecturers and students are able to conceptualize the lecture event as having specific generic orientations. Theme 3. The negative cycle of expectation. Lecturers need to understand their students’ previous experiences and tailor their teaching to suit each group of learners.

Theme 4. The establishment of communities of learners and practice. Lecturers and their students have positions in two distinct communities in lectures, that of a community of learners, and of a community of professional practice.

# 2.1. Theme 1: the multi-dimensional context of lecturers in a second language

Any model of listening in a second language needs to have a multi-dimensional context to it. That is, we need to view the listening process from a number of angles and from different perspectives: of the students, lecturers, and researchers. This multi-dimensional perspective needs to take into account the previous work done into measurement, analysis, interpretation and perceptions.

It is no longer appropriate to state that all problems in L2 lectures can be attributed to the weak language skills of the students, and that the only answer to the problem is to help students improve their second language listening comprehension, a position that underpinned some of the earlier research into listening. In order to develop the LSL model for academic listening we need to examine language features, language and pedagogical interaction, and pedagogical features themselves. When all the previous investigations into academic listening is taken into consideration it is clear that language, pedagogy, lecture artefacts and participants’ behaviour in a lecture have a profound effect on the students’ ability to follow a lecture in English. Each of these dimensions can be studied on its own, but they all interact in the lecture event to make it a complex environment for second-language users to negotiate. Our better understanding of what the features of lectures are will help to advise students, lecturers, and English language tutors in meeting the challenges of lectures in a second language.

# 2.2. Theme 2: lecturer intention and student interpretation

If we are to improve the quality of listening comprehension in second language lectures we need to not only examine the features of lectures, as suggested in Theme 1, but also examine these features within the specific genres that constitute lectures. Genre is one of the base lines of the LSL model in Fig. 1. All lectures may be defined as having a specific spoken textual genre, the characteristics of which allow them to be identified as ‘academic lectures’. Specific genres can be seen as being realized through registers, and these registers are, in turn, realized through language (Martin, 1985). Previously, Levinson (1979, p. 368) identified lectures as a genre in which the activities are ‘‘constituted entirely by talk’’. However, genres are often contextualized in settings where more than just language is present (Gee, 1990). As Gee, Michaels, and O’Conner (1992, p. 233) state, ‘‘While linguists are primarily interested in language, they cannot safely ignore the rest of what is going on around language, and this other stuff—actions, objects in the environment, gestures, glances, attitudes, thoughts, values—can determine what a text means.’’ Therefore, the idea that a lecture can be identified within the specific genre simply by its linguistic features, is open to challenge.

As a way of investigating how effective lectures are in the L2 context, we need to look not only at linguistic features but also at the perceptions teachers and students have of their teaching/learning context (Prosser & Trigwell, 1997), as it is these perceptions which help the stakeholders identify and construct the genre of lectures. Research into language teaching has shown that there are considerable discrepancies of opinion between what teachers think students want, and what the students’ actually want to do in the classroom (Brindley, 1984; Nunan, 1988; Peacock, 1998). In addition to this research, there is a growing area of investigation into the perceptions lecturers have of their teaching, and their behaviour and strategies in the classroom (Trigwell & Prosser, 1996). By combining the ideas behind these areas of research the second theme of the LSL model emerges.

Very little research has been conducted into the effects of lecturer intention and behaviour (but see, Trigwell, Prosser, & Taylor, 1994) or into lecturer behaviour and students’ perceptions of that behaviour (see, Willcoxson, 1998), and, as far as I am aware, there has been no research into the mismatches of lecturer’s intentions, behaviours, and students’ interpretations of their lecturer’s behaviour in lectures given in a second language contexts.

The following are three examples from Miller (2002) which illustrate the type of mismatches that can occur between lecturers and students in a lecture:

Linguistic: Limited syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge of English cause problems for L2 language users in academic lectures, and these linguistic elements contribute to a lack of comprehension and misunderstanding. From Miller’s data it was found that the lecturers are highly sensitive to this issue and adopt a variety of linguistic strategies in order to cope with it. However, the lecturers also seemed to be unaware of the specific aspects of their use of English that enhance or hinder comprehension in the students, and hence allowed the students to follow the lecture within its specific genre. Students had little experience of attending lectures before joining their courses and their ‘language barriers’ prevented many of them from understanding the concepts or the ways in which they were presented.

Pedagogic: There are many instances in Miller’s data which illustrate a mismatch of pedagogical behaviour and student perceptions, the main one being the use of technology and the lecture environment. Although some lecturers planned their lecture presentations carefully, they seemed to be unable to change their teaching practice when something went wrong with their computer generated presentation. Students, on the other hand, became frustrated when their lecturers were unable to use the computer equipment well and often did not pay attention when the lecturer did eventually manage to get the computer to work.

Strategic: An important issue with L2 students attending lectures in English is the degree to which they are prepared for learning via lectures, and how effectively they can employ metacognitive, cognitive, and socio-effective learning strategies (Oxford, 1990). Although most lectures plan and make use of certain lecturing strategies they also need to be aware of the types of strategies students make use of most and (1) try to cater to their preferred ways of learning, and (2) attempt to explicitly introduce new listening strategies to the students in the lectures. Therefore, the way in which a lecture is presented and attended to has, to some extent, be negotiated between the lecturers and their students.

Linguistic, pedagogic, and strategic behaviours are only three examples of how a lecturer’s behaviour in a lecture can be misinterpreted by students attending the lecture. If students are unable to interpret the lecturer’s language and/or behaviour then they will not be able to situate their lecture within the specific genre that the lecturer is using. And, as can be seen in the LSL model, understanding the lecture genre is a foundation for comprehending the spoken text of any lecture.

# 2.3. Theme 3: the negative cycle of expectation

The concept that motivates the third theme is that in order to understand what is involved in lectures in a second language, lecturers and students need to be aware of the historical context of their teaching and learning. This is represented as the input dimension to the LSL model in Fig. 1. There are three aspects to this: language, content and lecturing styles. Any degree of ignorance in how students and/or lecturers perceive these areas of competence leads to what may be called the negative cycles of expectation (Willcoxson, 1998). There are many cycles of expectation in lectures depending on the amount of knowledge lecturers and students have of how lectures work and the achievements expected. At the level of language and content an example of a negative cycle works like this:

Lecturers know that the students have weak linguistic skills and knowledge bases Lecturers prepare detailed notes to assist students to follow their lectures Students have detailed notes so do not listen carefully to the lectures Students loose concentration easily in the lecture for a variety of reasons, (including having detailed handouts) and engage in non-lecture activities (tune out, do not ask questions when they do not understand, engage in other activities like chatting with friends) Lecturers perceive students non-lecture activities and loss of concentration as a result of their weak linguistic skills and knowledge bases Lecturers prepare more detailed notes for next lecture.

Many of the lecturers in Miller’s (2002) study had low opinions of the engineering students they were teaching. These opinions were formed on the basis that they were teaching students’ whose examination results from secondary school were not very good, and that the students’ behaviour in their lectures was below their expectations. However, the findings of how test scores relate to performance do not always correlate well. Vinte and Jochems (1993) found that it was age and motivation level that were better indicators of performance of their L2 learners rather than TOEFL scores. As most of the engineering students exposure to English was in their lectures each week, with the rest of their classes begin conducted in Cantonese or a mixture of Cantonese and English, it is little wonder that the students in Miller’s (2002) study had difficulty in following lengthy monologues in English. It appears that their lecturers were unable to fully appreciate the linguistic difficulties these students were faced with.

Given the struggles many L2 students undergo in order to gain a place in an English-medium university we have to bear in mind what more help they might need in order to benefit from their tertiary education. We can look to the literature for some advice here. Some researchers call for more preparation of second-language learners prior to attending university, others for training while at university. Chapman, Yuan, and Xu (1988), for instance, recommend that some preparation needs to be given to L2 learners prior to attending the university. Students need to be given as much information as possible about the course they will study and what they will be expected to do, in addition to which they need to be aware of what is involved in studying in a second language before enrolling on the course. Samuelowics (1987) calls for more preparation by means of pre-sessional courses offered by the universities before students undertake a course of study in English. This training would include not only language courses but also guidance in how to approach learning. Benson (1989) and Flowerdew and Miller (1992) agree with this and go further in suggesting integrating language and study skills training into the academic lectures themselves. If more training, of the type suggested here, was available to students then they may be better prepared for attending their lectures in English, and if the engineering lecturers were aware of the type of training courses their students had undergone prior to beginning their studies, then they may be able to capitalize on this in their courses.

‘‘In many cases learners’ alternative frameworks, misconceptions or deficient skills can cause learning difficulties or negative learning outcomes.’’ (Dirver, Guesne, & Tiberghien, 1985, p. 38). By taking account of the students’ previous learning experiences, their English language level, and their background knowledge lecturers can orient their lecture material to suit the students they are teaching better, and by students becoming more aware of the level of language proficiency required and how there are going to be taught in lectures, they may be able to prepare themselves more for listening to lectures in a second language. When these things happen then the negative cycles of expectations will be reduced and learning enhanced.

# 2.4. Theme 4: the establishment of communities of learners and practice

Theme 4 takes as its focus the construction of identities in lectures; this is illustrated in the LSL model by the community of learners and community of practice base-line dimensions. We need to consider how both the students and the lecturers construe their participation in the lecture event as being a part of a social community. In Miller’s (2002) study students and lecturers saw themselves as part of different communities. The students aligned themselves more as being part of a community of learners, with what Hodges (1998) terms ‘‘The Community of Cooperative Learners’’, while the lecturers saw one of their roles as inducting the students into the community of engineering practice. Of course, each party has roles to play in both of the communities—it is the degree to which they assume their roles which seems to be at issue here, in Theme 4.

# 2.4.1. Communities of practice

A community of practice is similar to what Swales (1990) calls ‘discourse communities’. The lecturers are often easily able to align themselves with a particular discourse community. In Miller’s study, in addition to carrying the name of ‘engineering lecturer’ the lecturers talked about undergoing a period of apprenticeship, or apprenticeships, in varies ways: worked in factories; conducted engineering research; attended international conferences; acted as consultants to community projects; and so on. These lecturers gradually become members of the engineering community over many years of participation and by slowly learning about how to be part of the community. It is no wonder then that Miller’s students were not able to identify with, or integrate themselves into the engineering community within their first year of studying engineering.

Lave and Wenger (1991) talk about ‘legitimate peripheral participation’ as part of the process of being part of a community of practice. They consider that to be part of any community the individual often has to take on a peripheral role to begin with (an apprenticeship). Then, as the person becomes more familiar with the practice, he can move from a peripheral to an empowering position. Students attending engineering lectures may be considered to be legitimate peripheral participants. Whether they know this or not is another matter, and perhaps it is something that the engineering lecturers need to be more explicit about.

In post-study interviews with four of the lecturers Miller asked them how they became interested in engineering. Each of them was able to recount stories of growing up with a curiosity about how things worked, and initiation into the world of engineering through family or friends who worked in factories. All the lecturers entered into their university courses with a strong desire to become engineers. None of the students in Miller’s (2002) study were able to recount such stories, or desires. In reply to why they had chosen to study engineering at university the most common reply was ‘I just had enough marks to get onto the course’. The lack of intrinsic motivation to become part of the engineering community must undoubtedly play a part in the students’ lack of identity with the community, or perhaps exclusion from it (Greeno, 1988).

# 2.4.2. Communities of learning

The students in Miller’s (2002) study associated themselves most with being part of a community of learners. ‘Learning’ is often closely associated with being part of a community of practice. However, Lave and Wenger (1991) warn about construing communities of learning within the communities of practice metaphor. They argue for a separation of the concepts and that ‘‘. . .learning must be understood with respect to a practice as a whole, with its multiplicity of relations—both within the community and with the world at large.’’ (p. 114). Lave (1993) talks about learning as ‘situated activity’ and points out how researchers have previously attempted to investigate the learning process as an activity that exists in the learners mind. The world in which the learning takes place is often ignored, in our case, the lecture event, and when this happens we deviate from the perceptions we have of learning and learners: ‘‘Without a theoretical conception of the social world one cannot analyze activity in situ’’ (Lave, 1993, p. 7).

Viewing the students as participants in a community of learners, as opposed to a community of practice, allows us to situate their learning process within the social context most familiar to the students. After all, the students had many years of socialization within an educational context, and so it is a context that they can all relate to easily. If we view the students’ participation in lectures as part of their community of learning then it helps to analyse the learning as process, and the learners’ identities as always in a constant state of being formed. This introduces a multi-layered perspective of teaching and learning. Lectures have to be located in a variety of ‘‘field’’ contexts (Bourdieu, 1977) such as tutorials, workshops, and laboratory sessions, all of which aid in ideologically sustaining the practices of engineering. For the students in this study, in order to be part of the community of learners they must understand and participate in two main dimensions to their learning: they must be able to conceptualize their learning in lectures within the different other sources of learning, all of which contain some elements of induction into the field of studying engineering; and secondly, they need to see themselves as belonging to a peer group of learners, who share similar experiences, emotions, successes and failures. The degree to which students perceive themselves as part of a community of learners will affect the ways in which they organize their learning, and perhaps their performance at lectures (a part of that learning).

Rogoff et al. (1996) maintain that we must view learning as a developmental process where both teacher and learners are active participants within their community. Learning is not a one-way flow of information from external to internal (Prior, 1998). When we start viewing students as active participants in their lectures we construe academic listening as an active process and one in which the students have a legitimate right to be a part of. How lecturers and students perceive their roles within their communities of learning and practice affects the lecture event at one of its most fundamental levels, as shown in the LSL model in Fig. 1.

# 3. Implications and conclusion

Although the LSL model (Fig. 1) is a theoretical concept, it is grounded in the extensive ethnographic research reported on in the introduction to this paper. The implications of ethnographic work are local in that it is the participants who take part in the study who may benefit the most from the findings. However, we are able to widen the scope of our interpretations and suggest possible other implications for a general audience. These implications are for L2 students and their teachers.

# 3.1. Implication for students

It would be easy to generate a list of ‘dos and don’ts’ for L2 students when they attend their lectures given in English. Indeed, this is the type of information contained in textbooks on academic listening (cf. Adkins & McKean, 1983; James, Jordan, & Matthews, 1979; Rogoski & Palmberg, 1990). As Flowerdew and Miller (1997) demonstrated, though, such lists are only of limited help when we compare the textbook practice situations with the real-life contexts of lectures in a second language. The real benefit to the students in Miller’s (2002) ethnographic case study was not in helping them develop specific academic listening strategies, but to involve them in reflecting on and talking about their experiences in attending their engineering lectures. Near the end of the data collection part of the study, and after the students had been writing in their diaries for a while, they were asked to talk about being part of the research project. Some of their representative comments were:

Terry (Focus Group): . . .maybe I more understand about the lectures now because I have to think about the lecture to write something in the journal, so I have to revise what I know about the lecture. If I not write anything then I just forget about it.

Nelson (Focus Group): . . .we can examine the presentation style of the lecturer and they have their own style and we can learn a little about how they are teaching us.

Ernie (Focus Group): We can write the English more fluently because before we only write something like a report in English, but in the journal it is another type of essay, so it can help us to express our ideas more easy.

The students portrayed positive comments on the process of reflecting on and writing about their lectures. They identified a better understanding of their lecture content, the ways in which they were being taught, and an increase in their English proficiency skills as a result of taking part in this study. These students were involved in thinking about their lectures perhaps for the first time. Their comments certainly indicated that this was a different experience for them, and one they appeared to enjoy, and learn from.

L2 students need to be given opportunities to talk about their learning. This can be done by the content lecturer or by the EAP teacher. Lectures are often supplemented with tutorial classes. In these classes, the lecturer can encourage the students to talk about their learning in the lectures. This would not simply be a question/ answer session on problems the students have with the content of a lecture, but a reflective session in which the wider dimensions to the students’ learning is explored. Students would be encouraged to stop and think about what they are learning, how they are learning, and perhaps ask why they are learning certain things. Not only would the students benefit, but their lecturers would also benefit by receiving on the spot feedback on their lectures, rather than wait for an end-of-semester questionnaire survey by which time it is too late to make any changes to the lectures. Some of the same procedures and research instruments as used in Miller’s ethnographic case study may be found useful for lecture discussion sessions. An alternative to content lecturers developing activities to allow their students to reflect on their learning would be to conduct such activities in the language support classes.

Students need to become aware not only of how to improve their English proficiency level and develop strategies which they might use to become more effective listeners in their lecture, but also of the way the lecture is used as a means to convey information, from the language, pedagogical, content and wider social dimensions. Furthermore, L2 students need to become aware that they have active parts to play in the process of the lecture, and that their roles as members of the community of learners can be expanded to take account of how they wish to construct their learning at university.

# 3.2. Implications for content lecturers

In order for content lecturers to become more familiar with the challenges of teaching L2 students some lecturer training may be required (Lynch, 1994). As most EAP teachers hold teaching qualifications and are often already familiar with some of the issues involved in teaching academic listening, they may be considered useful in helping to provide some of this training.

# 3.2.1. Team-teaching

Team teaching is not new in EAP contexts (see British Council, 1980). However, it is also something which is not widely used in universities. This may be because of factors outside the control of the teaching staff, for example, budgetary or timetabling factors. But when it is used, team teaching is a useful strategy which yields good results (cf. Graham & Beardsley, 1986). Team teaching can be done in several ways, for instance, an English support teacher can teach alongside a content lecturer during the same period and explain points of grammar and vocabulary as they arise during the lecture, or, the English teacher can organize classes in conjunction with the content lecturer so as to present the type of language the content lecturer will use in the lectures. In this way, the language support classes may better focus on the students’ real academic needs, and in the process, the content lecturers may become more sensitive to how they are teaching their disciplines.

# 3.2.2. Teach the language of the discipline as well as the discipline

Lectures teaching L2 students need to be aware of the linguistic difficulties their students face when attempting to understand the concepts presented in a second language, especially when these learners have low-proficiency language abilities. Lecturers need to become aware of how they, themselves, use language to talk about their discipline, and then integrate a high level of meta-language into their lectures, that is, they need to talk not only about the content but also explain how they are talking about the content. Greater planning of how to introduce the students to the genre of lectures in the specific discipline—both from the descriptive, codified perspective, and from the socially constructed point of view, is required. There are several ways this may be achieved two of which are, professional lecturer training in order to sensitise the lectures to how they talk about their discipline, and team teaching (see earlier).

# 3.2.3. Encourage interaction in lectures

If lectures continue to be used as the main conduit for teaching at universities then serious consideration needs to be given to how the teaching is conducted, and an attempt made to move away from a monolog format. More student interaction with the lecturer during lectures needs to be encouraged. One way to find out if L2 students are comprehending and understanding the lecture is to engage them in the lecture, this means that lecturers need to spend some time talking with the students about the content, rather than always talking to them in a lecture. Although the lecture theatre environment may not appear to encourage any kind of interaction, lectures can be introduced to techniques for teaching large classes. Some examples of ways to encourage interaction in lectures are: buzz group discussions—the teacher stops talking and sets a question for the students to talk about with those sitting near them, after a few minutes, the teacher stops the discussion and asks for an answer; linking work done in tutorial classes closely with the lecture—the lecturer asks students to consider a problem/example/equation in a tutorial then in the lecture asks for the known answers as a way for students to participate.

# 3.2.4. Make use of the community of learners

Lineham and McCarthy (2001, p. 130) maintain that we often overlook what is happening in communities as ‘we already know what the community is.’ Perhaps lecturers and students need to talk more about their roles in the community of learners. In this way, both will gain a perspective of what is expected of them, and how the other stakeholders view them. Lectures may attempt this by clearly stating at the onset of a series of lectures the topics, the format of the lectures, what will happen in the lectures, and what is expected of the students. This may even become the way of beginning each lecture. In response to this, students may be given opportunities to tell the lecturer what their problems are in the lectures, and how they would like the information to be presented so as to make it more accessible to them. In order for this to happen, lecturers may need some guidance on how to prepare detailed lecture plans so that they are able to articulate clearly to the students what they are trying to do in each lecture.

More negotiation of the roles and expectations of each of the stakeholders in lectures will go some way to cater for the diversity of learners and help them establish their unique identity as active participants in learning via lectures. It will also allow for a socially constructed perspective on the creation of the genre of each lecture. In this way, genre then can be seen as ‘‘. . .a way to ensure the production of what could be called ‘community-based’ discourse, a discourse whose meaning is created by and for the collective or group.’’ (Pare & Smart, 2000, p. 146). This will then, perhaps, allow for a shift in motivation and goal setting—from surface to deep learning (Biggs, 1993), and from performance to mastery goal setting (Hidi & Harackiewicz, 2000) and allow for a more complete development of the community of learners.

# 3.2.5. Induct student into the community of practice

The students in Miller’s (2002) study only saw themselves as belonging to a community of learners, and seemed to have little notion of the fact that they may enter the wider community of engineering practice. It is easier for these students to see the contextualization of the learning as situated in the university, and more difficult to comprehend the decontexualized apprentiship of an engineer their university education leads them towards. This is partly because the engineering industry, which was once so prevalent in Hong Kong, has now been relocated across the border in mainland China. As a result of this, students growing up in Hong Kong have little practice or everyday contact with engineers or factory life. In order to enable the first-year students to more closely associate themselves with what they are studying, lecturers need to front-up the concept of the community they are preparing their students for. This can be done is several ways: provide more practical examples in lectures about real-life practice; use rhetorical devices to include students in the community of practice—use ‘we as engineers/lawyers/sociologists’ when talking about concepts; set up visits/internships to outside sites; invite practitioners to give talks; give the first-year students a wider perspective on the courses they will do in their second and third year and how the first year courses prepare them for their further studies.

# 3.3. Implications for EAP teachers

# 3.3.1. Review of language support classes

If the English language teachers of first-year university L2 students become involved in team-teaching with the content lecturer, as suggested above, then they may be able to address many of the language issues that cause the students their immediate comprehension problems in lectures (see Graham & Beardsley, 1986). However, if this practice is difficult to implement, then other ways to aid L2 students attending lectures in English need to be found. One obvious solution is to conduct a large-scale needs analysis so as to identify the specific areas that cause the most problems for students. Such a needs analysis may focus on the specific language needs of students, their general language requirements, and their study skill needs. Then the existing language courses offered to such students can be re-designed to suit their contemporary requirements.

# 3.3.2. Offer more ESP type courses

The students in Miller’s study were very clear that they preferred the English for Science and Technology (EST) courses they took at university rather than the more general EAP courses. With the limited amount of time that can be spent on support language classes the university departments need to consider the degree to which this time may best be spent. Two options are to offer content-area English language courses (Mohan, 1986), or specially focussed EST courses (Robinson, 1991). In both cases the students’ time will be focussed specifically on the type of English they need to follow their courses, and which will eventually allow them to join their community of practice.

The preceding implications are derived from the LSL model presented in this paper, which is based on ethnographic work carried out with Hong Kong Chinese students, and they are open for discussion. Other researchers need to interpret the model in their own cultural contexts, and when this happens we will have a better understanding of lectures in a second language, and will be in a better position to help our students learn more effectively.
