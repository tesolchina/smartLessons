This paper explores the forms and functions of intertextuality in academic tweets composed by research groups. Academic tweets are dialogic and intertextual texts, usually composed by incorporating other voices and taking up text-visual elements from other contexts. Based on the analysis of 300 tweets taken from the Twitter accounts of four research groups in two different disciplines (Chemistry and Medicine), this study investigates the ways in which intertextual practices contribute to the communicative purposes of the genre. The analysis shows that the affordances of Twitter (e.g. hyperlinking, modularity, multimodality) and the purpose of academic tweets shape the forms and functions of intertextuality in these tweets. When composing these tweets academics both reconfigure well-established forms of intertextuality and display novel forms which help them to promote their research, negotiate their relationships with their readers, and share content with diverse audiences.

# 1. Introduction

Twitter is anetworking site increasingly used by academics to promote and share their research activity and output, connect with peers, diffuse their ideas and opinions, and reach the general public (Cote & Darling, 2018; Mohammadi et l., 2018). Academics achieve these purposes by creating their own content, but also by sharing information taken from other texts and content produced by others (Puschmann, 2015). ince tweets are highly intertextual and dialogic texts, where users take up and repurpose semiotic re sources from other places and enter into discursive relations with others (Gillen & Merchant, 2013), a focus on intertextuality seems particularly relevant to understand how academic tweets are constructed and interpreted.

Twitter is a conversational platform, whose technological affordances (e.g. interactivit, reach, hyperlinking) and main dis tinguishing features (e.g. hashtags, $@$ mentions, retweeting) facilitate dialogue and the creation of intertextual relations. Hashtags enable twers to connect their twets toother thmatically related twets and thus create intrtextual chains (Bonilla & Rosa, 2015) The $@$ mention feature serves t refer to other users and enables readers to access these users profile (Honeycutt & Herring, 2009). The retweeting button allows users to forward a tweet to others (Puschmann, 2015) and hyperlinks make it possible to incorporate in formation from non-Twitter websites, giving readers acces to complete texts. Finally, the multimodal ffordances of the medium, and the search and aggregation functions of Twiter, support \*multimodal quotation (Zappavigna, 2022): twees tend to include not only written text, but various types of visual resources (pictures, videos), which are ften taken from other sources and recontextualized to achieve the purpose of the tweet.

Studies of Twitte for academic communication have focused on academics motivations for tweeting, revealing that in academia

Twitter is a tol for sharing content, self-promotion and engagement (e.g. Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2022; Puschmann, 2014; Velet sianos, 2012). However, although interextuality plays a key role in meaning-making in twees, research is lacking on the multiplicity of texts and voices in academic tweets and on how inertextuality contributes to achieving the purposes) of these tweets. Research on intertextalelations in aadmic tweet as be retricted to he analysis of witr cittions (i. ferene to a scholarly publication or another digital document by mentioning the URL or the title (Priem & Costello, 2010; Welle e al. 2011). These studies have analyzed the distribution of citations or their impact but have not examined how they contribute to the construction of the tweet. There is no study of the intertextual practices engaged in by academics in Twittr to increase their visibility, share content, build networks and enter conversations. The aim of this study is to contribute to filing this gap by exploring how intertextuality works in academic twets compose by reearch groups, how it isaffected by theaffordances and practices of digital text production and by the particular features of dgital texualit, and how it contributes to the communicative purose(s) of the tweet. The study seks to answer the following research questions.

RQ1: What diffrent types of intertxtual representations occur in the academic tweets of research groups, that i, in what ways do these tweets refer to or incorporate other texts? RQ2: What functions do intertextual representations serve in the tweets? This involves analyzing the sources that are referred to (i. e. the voices that are incorporated to the tweet) and how these texts are recontextualized to achieve the purpose(s) of the tweet.

Answering these questions will provide information on what kind of relations with other texts and other social actors are facilitated by Twitter textuality and on how these relations contribute to constructing meaning in these tweets and to accomplishing social actions.

To answer these questions, this paper provides a qualitative analysis of intertextuality in academic twets produced by four research groups. A quantitative approach, which sees to determine the features of a type of text by quantifying them, is not adopted here because twets are fluid, highly unstable texts, which exhibit considerable variability and creativity. The purpose of this study is, by contrast, to highlight and analyze forms of intertextuality and their function in academic twets, with no attempt at quantifying them.

# 2. Twitter in scholarly communication

Research on how scholars use Twitter has provided insights into the purpose(s) and intended audiences of academic tweets. Ac. ademics twee to share resources and publications with arious publics but mainly with their peers (Cote & Darling, 2018; Mohammadi et al. 2018) and to promote their work and increase their visibility (Luzon & Albero-Posac, 2020; Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2022). They also tweet to engage in social interaction with peers,commenting on academic ssues, discussig emerging reearch and sharing useful resources, and to develop their disciplinary networks (Choo et al, 2015; Velesianos, 2012). Twets are also used to communicate with peers during academic conferences (Luzon & Albero-Posac, 2020; Puschmann, 2014; Weller et al., 2011). By including the conference hashtag in their tweet, users oranizers, atendes and non-tendees) can connect the wts to the broader conference conversation, discuss ssues related to the presentations, interact informally, and share various resource e., ther own papers and posters, other researchers papers, datasets) rated to the confrce. inl, aadmics also hness the potenti of Titter to reach a more diverse audience, and use it for communication not only with the scholarly community but also with other publics (media, educational organizations, general public, practitioners) (Cho0 et al., 2015; Cote & Darling, 2018; Puschmann, 2014; Tardy, 2023). Twitter helps academics to disseminate science and research results to the interested public and to increase public engagement with science.

Since one of the primary uses of academic Twiter is the dissemination and sharing of information, studies have also analyzed the type of content that iscited and shared by academics on Twiter. Academics oten cite cholarly publications (Jung et al., 2016; Priem & Costell, 2010, i.e. they make reerence to a scholarly publication by mentioning the URL or by linking to an intermediary webpage that in tun includes a link to the publication. Reearch suggests that Twitter citations diffr from citations in scholarly papers, since they do not provide support for arguments, but serve promotional and networking purposes. Jung et al. (2016) observed that Twitter users cite papers mainly to share them or to promote them to their followers. In addition to published papers, scholars cite other types of texts. Wellr et al. (2011) distinguished between external citations, which include all URLs in tweets (e.g. lins to publications, blogs, conferences, slides, media, non-scientific publications), and interal or inter-Twiter citations, ie retwets. Studies on Twitter citation have revealed that scientists' twets include a higher number of URLs than the general population of twees, that scholars retweet more than typical users and that citation practices (e.g. types and frequency of links, frequency of retweets) vary between disciplines (Holmberg & Thelwall, 2014; Weller et al., 2011).

Twitter affrdances for interaction and reach have facilitated the emergence of new Twitter genres whose purpose is to discuss research or disseminate scientific knowledge. Two examples are Twittr-based journal clubs, where researchers can examine and discuss new paper (e.g. the International Urology Journal Club on Twitte, https://twitter.com/iurojc), and "tweetorials, i.e. long Twitter threads written by experts to explain complex concepts to public audiences or share reearch findings (Graham, 2021; Tardy, 2023). Graham (2021) distinguishes various emerging twetorial subgenres: article or preprint review, misinformation corrective, clinical experience report, and literacy support tweetorial, where key scientific concepts are reviewed.

Twitter is therefore used by academics to engage in a variety of social purposes, and new Twitter (sub)genres and practices are emerging to meet various rhetorical needs. Since most uses of academic Twiter involve responding to other texts in various ways (sharing or discussing other texts, entering broader conversations around specialized topics), we are likely to find a variety of intertextual forms in these twets. An analysi of these forms and their functions might contribute to our knowledge of how academic

tweets are composed.

# 3. Intertextuality and recontextualization in social media

Drawing on Bakhtin's (1981) work on dialogism and heteroglossia and his idea that when using language we revoice the words of others, Kristeva (1980) coined the term \*intertextuality' to refer to structural relationships existing between texts and claimed that "any text is constructed as a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another' (Kristeva, 1980, p. 66). Fairclough (2003, p. 39) defines the intertextuality of a text as \*the presence within it of elements of other texts (and therefore potentiall other voices than the author's own) which may be related to (dialogued with, assumed, reected, ec. in various way". That is, every text is created by accommodating other voices. Fairclough (1992) proposed the terms \*interdiscursivity' to distinguish be. tween two types of relations between texts. While \*intrtextuality refers t the property texts have of being ful of snatches of other texts' (p. 84), which involves incorporating others' words or making reference to previous text(s), \*interdiscursivity" refers to the incorporation of conventions associated with other genres or discourse types. The distinction between intertextuality and inter discursivity has been adopted widely in discourse analysis to account for the diverse ways in which a text derives is meaning from previous texts (e.g. Bhatia, 2004). In this paper, I fous on the concet f intertxtualit, although in diial gnre intertextuality and interdiscursivity are cosely intrtwined and dificult to searat in practice. Rearch on intertxtuality has identified various ways of intertextual repreentation (i. of reresenting or referring to thers voice in one's text), including direct quotation, indirect report or summary, mentioning, comment or evaluation, presupposition, negation, irony, re-use of text segments from documents written within a single organization or group (Bazerman, 2004; Fairclough, 1992; Shaw & Pecorari, 2013).

An important aspect to consider in the analysis of intertextuality is that, as Bazerman (2004, p. 94) states, \*intertextuality is not ust a matter f which ther texts you refer to, but how you use them, what you use them for, and ultimatel how you position yourself as a writer to them to make your own statement", that is how it helps the writer to accomplish social actions. I order to understand the function of intertextuality as a meaning-making and text-creation practice in academic tweets, the concept f recontextualization is apposite When a rament f a tex i lied from tsorginal contex and use in  new context it s reontxtalized i. it aquires a new meaning in the new context (Bazerman, 2004; Faircough, 1992 inell 1998). The proces of recontextualization often involves textual changes, such as the \*simplification, condnsation, elaoration, and reousingf th riginl text (Linell, 98, p. 155). In the digital environment, text reusing, remixing and embedding are prominent tex-creation practice, which inolve election of texts (or fragments of text t transfer and recontextualize (Adami, 2012, 2014; Johansson, 2019). Selected textual lements are extracted from their original context and edited to convey new meanings, and mee the goal f the new text (Adami, 2012). As Adami (2014,p.224) contends, in the online environment, the afordances of the modes and of the media foster networked distribution of content and new recontextualization and meaning-making practices: "any text can be linked to another, forwarded into another space, embedded in some other text'.

Research on digital discourse has shown that digital texts reconfigure forms of intertextuality found in other media (e.g. quotations), but also use new forms of intertextuality facilitated by technological affordances (e.g. linking to other websites that incorporate' relevant content to the digital text) Johansson (2019, p. 154) for instance, shows how the genre of online political opinion review is constructed by integrating written quotations and what she calls digital quotations' (i.e. "a tweet video, or other digital element that is recontextualized from a digital context by being copy-pasted into digital news texts"). Other studies have analyzed how texts are shared and circulated on social media in diffrent semiotic modalitie, showing that in social mediainterextuality often involves multimodal recontextualization. Adami (2014), for instance, discusses what she call crossposting", ie. a form of digital remediation in which an artefact uploaded on an online platform s recontextualized (e.g. reposted, embedded) in other online spaces by making use of the multimodal affordances of each space.

Much research on intertextuality in social media, and particularly in Twitter, has focused on various types of quotation practices and their communicatie functions. Retweeting, in particular, has been paid considerable attention. Herring (2013, p. 13) considers retweeting as "a form of quoting that is adapted to, and reconfigured by, the Twittr environment". Puschmann (2015) and Gruber (2017) also analyzed retweeting as a quotation practice whose function and form are shaped by technology. Research on retweeting has emphasized its social and interpersonal function (Boyd et al., 2010; Gruber, 2017; Puschmann, 2015). In addition to their informational value, reeet serve to tablish lins btween the reeeter, the retweted user and the reders (Boyd et a., 2010) and to reinforce social ties between members of a community. Regarding the expression of stance, while uncommented retwees tend to have an endorsement function (i. the retweeter aligns with the stance expressed in the original twet, in commented tweets the retweeter tends to evaluate the content of the retweeted text (Gruber, 2017). Retweting also has an interactional function, since it introduces new voices in the Twitter interaction. This function is particularly eident in commented retweets, i. tweets where the retweeted mesage is prefaced by a comment. Gruber (2017, pp. 4-5) points out that these retweets "establish stged micro-dialogues between the retweetr and the retweeted text (and/or it author) in front of the retweeter's ollowers" I should be pointed out that retweets may have variety f functions (see Boyd et al., 2010), which deend on the community to which the tweter belongs and the specific context of use (Puschmann, 2015).

Some studies of intertextual practices in social media have also analyzed multimodal quotation practices, involving memes (Vandelanotte, 2020; Zappavigna, 2022) or quote cards (Pfurscheller, 2020). A meme is a highly intertextual element; it s a group of digital items which make rference to previous texts and events (usually mass culture texts) and are \*circulated, imitated, and/or transformed via the Internet by many users (hifman, 2014, p. 41). The purpose is usually to express subjective responses in a humorous way (Vandelanotte, 2020). A quote card, another form of multimodal quotation, s a combination of a visual quotation and a written quotation extracted from a previous text and recomposed for recirculation on social media. In Facebook posts, quote cards serve as "ws bites r "ptizrs" they draw attention to the linked paper and courage the reders tovisiti Purtscheller, 2020).

Allthese studies reveal that forms of intertextuality are reconfigure in the digital medium, and that the afordances f the medium facilitate new and more complex types of relations between texts, and new functions for quotation.

# 4. Corpus and method

# 4.1. Corpus

The dataset analyzed in this study is a corpus of 300 tweets taken from the Twitter accounts of four reearch groups in two different STEM disciplines: Chemistry- Martin Group, Fors Research Group- and Medicine SOLTI Group and TOPIC Research Group. Medicine was chosen because Twitter has become an important tool for academic communication and science disemination in this iscipline (Choo et al., 2015; Tardy, 2023); and Chemistry because researchers in this discipline seem to use Twitter for scholarly communication, and to engage in intertextual practices such as retweeting, more ofen than researchers in other disciplines (Holmberg & Thelwall, 2014). The Twitter accounts were retrieved by using the Google searches: \*Twitter $^ +$ research group $^ +$ medicine" and "Twitter $^ +$ research group $^ +$ chemistry". To be selected for the study, the research groups' Twitter accounts had to meet two criteria: (i) active aouns with relar weet and  ratiely hih mber follower (more than 1,00, atough he f the gous had about 4,000 followers; and (i) ll or most of the tweets should be written in English (only the Twitter profile of one of the groups includes some tweets in Spanish). The Chemistry groups o research on organic Chemistr and their Twittr accounts are run by PhD students in the group. The soLTI research group does research on breast cancer and organizes workshops for practitioners and patients. The TOPIC research group does research on mental health and states on their webpage that their work is \*underpinned by close consultation with children, young people, parents/carers, and practitioners" (https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/topic-research-group. Hence, for the Medicine groups sharing content with audiences beyond academia, and not only with pers is important. Since the groups ar interested in sharing different type of content with different audience, analyzing th four datases may reveal a wide range of intertextual practices.

Starting on 16 December 2021 and in reverse chronological order, the first 75 tweets from each account were collected. Although this may seem a relatively small corpus, it provides enough analytic data for the type of study (i. qualitative and exploratory) re ported in this paper (ee aso Tardy's (2023) qualitative study of academic twets with a smallcorpus). The dataset included tweets and retweets, both commented and uncommented. The tweets making up the corpus were publicly availale and were collected manually and saved as PDF documents.

# 4.2. Method

The purpose of this paper is to identify the forms of intertextual representations in academic tweets and their function. Therefore, I followed the procedure proposed by Bazerman (2004) for analyzing intertextualit: (i) identify the traces of other texts in the corpus compiled for analysis; (i) determine how these instances of intertextuality are expressed (e.. direct quotation, paraphrase) (ii) interpret the intertextuality, i. consider how or for what purpose the intertextual element is being used in the new text" (p. 92) Following this procedure, I first identfied instances of intertextuality in the twets in the corpus, considering that the elements that may be incorporated from other texs may be written text but also (audio)visual elements. It should be pointed out that it is not aways possible for the analyst to identify all xample of intertxtuality, since the text may allude to discourses with which the analyst is not familiar. Using Atlas.ti (software for qualitatie content analysis), I coded these instances of intertextualit in terms of (i) type of intertextual representation, i. how the intertextuality is expresed, how other sources are referred to or incorporated in a text (i) type of content that is incorporated in the tweet; and (ii) source. The coding of intertextual instances according to type was done by starting with an initial list of anticipated codes based on previous resarch on intertextualit and on Twitter textuality eg. Bazerman, 2004; Gruber, 2017; Shaw & Pecorari, 2013; Zappavigna, 2022). However, since intertextuality in tweets may be quite diffrent from intertextuality in printed texts, this initial code list was complemented with codes generated on the basis of my observation of the data using the \*coding in vivo option of Atas.ti. The type of content that is incorporated in the twet was also coded following an inductive approach, strting from the data. Regarding the source, a distinction was made into internal (i. the source was a member of the group, or an institution related to the group, such as the research center where the group works), and extenal (e.g. another researcher or group, a journal, a magazine). This distinction seems to be relevant in this context, since groups tend to retweet tweets by their members, and incorporate intertextual representations of their own previous texts (e.g. summaries, links), thus increasing spreadability of their own content. Table 1 presents the framework of analysis.

The second step consisted in examining the instances of each type of intertextual representation at the micro-level, adopting a contextual and functional approach (Bazerman, 2004), in order to determine how the intertextual elements were integrated into the tweet and what function they had in the tweet. This was done by considering the purpose of the twet and examining how the intertextual element contributed to that purpose. For this analysis,I drew on previous research (Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2022) which revealed that tweets by research groups may have one or more of the following purposes: i) community building and networkin e.g. tweets used to share resources and disciplinary information or to evaluate other researchers positively); (i) self-promotion and publicizing of their research output (e.g. tweets used to notify that a new paper has been published or inform of the members achievements) (ii call toaction (i. wees encouraging various stakeholders to do something); and (iv) publi dissemination and outreach (i.e. tweets intended to disseminate academic knowledge to wider audiences).

# 5. Results and discussion

In this section I discussach type f intertextual representation found in the corus and its function .. ow it i interated into the tweet to contribute to the twets purpose. This wll help to unveil research groups' intrtextual practices in Twitter and the rationale behind them.

# 5.1. Retweets (commented and uncommented)

Retweets are digital quotations not modified by the user, which, as pointed above, may be commented (i.e. prefaced by a comment). A large number of tweets in the corpus $( 6 6 . 6 6 \% )$ were retweets. This is in agreement with previous studies of academic Twitter (Holmberg & Thelwall, 2014) and indicates that retweeting serves important functions in the Twittr activit of research groups.

Retweets in the corpus always helped to spread and amplify previous messages, and thus share' the content of other tweets. This sharing" served more specific purposes in the corpus. One prominent function is promotion of the group. Groups usually retweet tweets where a user provides positive evaluation of the group, informs of the group's new publications, achievements or academic outputs, thanks or congratulates the group, or shares the group's resources. The source of the retweted tweet may be internal or external. A common practice, illustrated by Fig. ${ 1 , } ^ { 2 }$ is retweeting a tweet by one member of the group (internal source), where their research is promoted, thus echoing and amplifying the message.

Retweeting others' tweets about the group also serves a promotional purpose. In example 1 below by retweeting a tweet by an external source (a researcher not belonging tothe group), the group spreads the positive evaluation of one of the members ("amazing) to their audience ehances the visbilit of the group members and, at the same time, seks to acknowledge the original tweter. Fig. 2 provides an example of a commented retweet used for promotion. A tweet where one of the group's papers is promoted by the Twitter account of the journal (external source) is retweeted and commented by the group to spread it and add positie evaluation. The embedded twet serves to bring the paper to the audience's atention and provide a link to the publication, and the comment is used to present the main finding or claim, inform that itis a collaboration with another group, helping thus to strengthen the links with that group, and evaluate the paper positively ("new", "we can rapidly').

[+picture of Brett Fors delivering his talk] (@forsgroup)

Retweets also served a social and networking purpose (see Boyd et al., 2010): in addition to acknowledging other voices (as illustrated in example 1 above), they may be used to help other groups/researchers spread thir announcements, call, job postings, and information about their research output, which in tun helps the group to maintain interpersonal relations. In example 2 below the group retweets an announcement of a PhD position, upon the original tweeters request to retweet Retweets spreading others' information have a two-fold networking function: they contribute to establishing social elations with other researchers by helping them amplify the audience of their twees, and, at the same time, they spread information that may be useful for members of their disci. plinary community.

@Co2perate_ITN   
(EU grant 859910). Fully funded with great salary and research conditions (@forsgroup)

Uncommented retweets were also used to endorse others' thoughts and publicly agree with others (see Gruber, 2017). These are retweets where the retweeted source expresses his/her opinion or stance on something, or thanks or congratulates somebody. In Fig. 3a, by retweeting the message by NHS Maudsley, the TOPIC research group endorses its support to#IternationalPronounDay. In Fig. 3b retweeting serves to share another researcher's conversation and endorse her opinion (I belie these results ..). Both examples show that in a single tweet there may be various layers of prior texs and quoted voices. In Fig. 3a the TOPIC group incorporates to their tweet the NHS voice, and in turn the voice of the producers of the embedded YouTube video, thus aligning with these voices and displaying the group's position regarding asocial isue. In Fig. 3b, the soL group incorporates the voices of both user 1 and user 2.

Although retweeting always involves interacting and introducing other voices into the tweets, some commented retweets were used to answer back explicitly and etablish a micro-dialogue with another user. In Fig. 4 the tweet incorporates a previous tweet where a postdoc student expresses her excitement of working with the group. The comment is the explicit response to this researcher. This collegial and warm response in front of the group's followers helps to construct a positive image of the group.

Retweets were also very frequently used by the groups to amplify the sharing of resources (both their own and others resources) with peers or with wider audiences. In the case of commented retweets, the retweeted tweet links to the resources, and the comment usually provides positive evaluation, to encourage the readers to access these resources (e.g. \*fantastic resource' in Fig. 5)

Retweeting also served to encourage the readers to take action. Groups retweeted twets informing of conferences, talks or courses (so that readers register, or studies where readers can participate. In Fig. 6 the group retweets a tweet where parents are asked to participate in one of their studies (My-CArs Study), thus amplifying the audience for the tweet and increasing the number of people who can take it up and respond to it in several ways, ie. by spreding it further, by liking it, by participating in the study. In the case of commented tweets, the comments usuall include evaluative vocabulary and directives, in order to provide positive evaluation of the event and repeat the request in the source tweet.

In sum, research groups retweeted for promotional and networking purposes (e.g. endorsing others opinions, helping them to spread their tweet), but also to amplify the audience of tweet calling to action or intended to disseminate knowledge to wider audiences.

# 5.2. Written quotation: direct quotation and summary

In the twets in the corpus, there were very few cases of direct quotation, i.. incorporation of the exact words of a previous text. Direct quotations occurred only in tweets by the sOLTI group and were used to emphasize and bring to the audience's attention somebody's message. However, a frequent type of intertextual representation in the corpus was a summary of what had been said or written in a previous text, frequently used by the groups to promote their own reearch. In twees publicizing their new publications, groups often provided a brief summary informing about the topic or about the main findings and evaluating them positively, in order to attract thr rerchrs, tohr wth  ink to gie rders as tthe ll papr (e ig 7). ht is, the s txt (i. arts of the research paper) is recontextualized by condensing it (to meet the requirements of the tweet format) and by tesing the positive evaluation ("'reduce .. without the need'), in agreement with the promotional purpose of the tweet.

An interesting communication practice in the Twitter account of the soLT group is composing threads of tweets to provide long summarie of their papers or conference presentations/osters, thus making use of twiter threads (se Graham, 2021; Tardy, 2023 for promotional and research visibility purposes. Fig. 8a shows the first tweet in an 8-twee thread which recontextualizes the group's poster discussion at the sAcs21 conference. Each of the tweets in the thread embeds a picture f the poster and a brief description of what is represented visually (see Fig. 8b). The tweets are intertextuall connected with the poster presentation in two ways: they incorporate pictures of the conference poster, and they echo the poster presentation in a condensed Twitter-suitable form. The database of the sOLTI group also includes a 9-tweet thread summarizing one of their papers. The tweets in the thread incorporate a figure/table taken from the journal paper and a brief writen summary of the most important information of the paper related to the visual. That is, written and visual elements of the research paper are taken up, modified and recomposed to fit the purpose of the tweetorial genre.

Some conference tweets (see Luzon & Albero-Posac, 2020; Puschmann, 2014) in the corpus also summarized (and evaluated positively) ther researchers presentations (se example 3). These twees, written by the group organizing the conference, served both aself-promotional and networking purpose: they simultaneously promoted and increased the visibilit for the conference (and thus the

5.3. Multimodal quotations

3.1. Embedding unmodified visuals Tweets from research groups tend to embed visual elements and multimodal ensembles (e.g. graphical astracts, pictures of conference slides, embedded videos), which are taken from other contexts with no modification. The aggregation affordances of social media platforms make it etremely easy to replicate, recontextualize and recirculate these elements. Some of these elements are in stances of genres designed to be spread via social media, e.g. graphical astracts, embedded short videos. Tweets announcing a new paper by Chemistry groups usually embed the graphical astract, as a way to summarize the paper without surpassing the word limit of the tweet, and atrct the readers to the research paper. Slides from conferences were also recontextualized in tweets in the corpus analyzed. In conference tweets, the group may embed pictures of their own slides (or other researchers slides), in combination with a brief summary text to help the readers visualize and provide evidence of what is said in the text. Conference tweets may also embed slides of other researchers presentations to comment on them in the tweet, evaluate them or initiate adiscussion or conversation with the presenter based on the visuals, which helps the tweeters toassert their authority as experts. In Fig. 9 the quoted visuals enable the tweeter to connect to and replicate the context of the conference presentation, and provide a referent so that the audience (and the presenter) can understand the tweeter's evaluation ("very nice data') and questions.

# 5.3.2. Quote cards

A visual unique to social media is \*quote-cards, multimodal ensembles extracted from a previous text, aimed at encouraging the reader to visit i (Pfurtscheller, 2020). The tweets in the corpus displayed a wide variety of forms of quote cards, intended to atract diverse audiences towards the source text. The most frequent type consiss of a graphical abstract and a short quotation taken from the journal paper (usually consisting of the title and fragments of the abstract), incorporated in tweets aiming at publicizing a new publication (see Fig. 10a). The corpus also featured quote cards from other digital texts (e.g. a guide, a report), consisting of a text quotation and the picture of the quoted person, or a text quotation and a quote-related visual (see Fig. 10b).

# 5.3.3. Memes

Memes also occurred in the corpus of tweet, although only in the Fors group dataset Intertextuality was used here for a humorous effect, which helps to create intimacy and solidarity. In most of these memes, in order to obtain the intended humorous effect, users need two types of knowledge: knowledge of the previous text, i.e. template (an image, a phrasal template, or both), which readers are expected to recognize, that is, familiarity with the meme, and disciplinary knowledge. Solidarity is constructed because only members of an exclusive group (e.g. discipline members, PhD students) can get the full humorous efect. Fig. 11a is a variation of the If I take one more step" meme, which draws on a scene and words of the Lord of the Rings movie where one of the characters (Sam) says: f I take one more step, it wil be the fartherest away from home I've ever been'. In Fig 11a the image has ben modified in order to construct the characters as polymers and the phrasal template (\*f I take one more (step)) has en completed to construct a sentence related to the group's reearch. The meme seems to have been successful in creating solidarity, as reflected in the number of retweets $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 6 )$ and likes $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 9 5 )$ . Fig. 11b is another example of memes intended to create solidarity. The example is a variation of the meme "if you don't love me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best' Inthis meme, the text i usually acompanied with two images: a bad one and a better counterpart. In Fig. 11b, the \*worst' is represented by $\mathbf { \ddot { \omega } } _ { 1 0 0 \mathrm { m } g } ,$ and the best' by an image representing a bigger measure, thus adapting the meme to the discipline context. The humorous effect is difficult to appreciate for readers outside the disciplinary community, which helps to create solidarity.

# 5.4. Hyperlinking

Citation through hyperlinking (Priem & Costell, 2010; Weller et al., 2011) is an esential component of twets composed by research groups, since the purpose of many of these tweets is to share research outcomes or useful online resources (Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2022). Most citations of scholarly publications are intenal, that is, lins to the groups newly published journal papers in tweets intended to promote these papers. Other types of texs incorporated to the twet-text through hyperlinking play an important role in achieving the purpose(s) of the tweets, e.g newspaper articles or webpages with news of the group (promotional) reports and useful resources for the readers (see Fig. 5) (networking and dissemination), disciplinary news of interest to the community (networking), webpages where the reader can do something (cal to action). Links are oten combined with evaluative language and directives, intended to bring the linked tex to the reader's attention. The link can be a URL, but alo frequently a quote card or other types of visuals. In example 4 the link enables the writer to bypass the 280-character limit and extend the tweet with an online text. This tweet isthe first i in a tweet-thread commenting on and evaluating a decision by the FDA (Food and Drug Adminstration). The URL in the twet lins to the FDA document (\*FDA approves abemaciclib with endocrine therapy for early breast cancert), which readers can access and read in order to understand the tweeter's comments in the following tweets in the thread.

# 5.5. Digital mentions: hashtags and @mentions

One of the techniques of intertextual representation identified by Bazerman (2004, p. 88)is the "mentioning of a person, document or statement', without providing more details, which helps the writer to imply meanings by relying on \*the reader's familiarity with the original ource'. This type f representation occurred scarcely in the dataset (see Lord of the Ring-opening" in Fig. 11a). However, the corpus displayed a large number of digital mentions. The term \*digital mention' is used in this paper to refer to the mentioning of other voices through digital resources, i.e. hashtags, $@$ mentions (see example 5).

(5) For the 3rd of our #CoVideos, we spoke to $@$ Cathy Creswell and Yasmeen. They spoke about, $@$ EmergingMindsUK helping young people and parents during the pandemic $^ +$ the importance of #LivedExperience in mental health research. http:// mentalhealthresearchmatters.org.uk/covideos, #MentalHealthResearchMatters ( $@$ topic_group)

Researchers have emphasized the intertextual function of hashtags. Bonilla and Rosa (2015, p. 5) note that hashtags have the intertextual potential to link a broad range of twets on a given topic or disparate topics as part of an intertextual chain (2015, p. 5), and Zappavigna (2015, p. 289) claims that \*hashtags signal the potential presence of other users in the social network'. Zappavigna (2015) discusses how hashtags not only have an experiential (topic related) function, but also an interpersonal function (enacting interpersonal relationships) and atextual function (organizing text). In example 5 the hashtag #MentalHealthResearchMaters relates this twet to  the her tes wth he same  inextal uction), bt  res t xpress th witers stance (sha with the members of the hashtag community). Some tweets in the corpus included conferences hashtags, which enabled the user to link the tweet to other tweets related to the same conference and make it a part of the conference conversation (see #SABcs21' in Fig 8a). Hashtags were sometimes used to link twets related to specific projects, or tweets that are part of aseries in the Twitter feed, and signal their relation. This is the case, for instance, of the hashtag #CoVideos' (example 5), or tweets such as #MettheMartinis" in the Twiter feed of the Martin group, which helps to connect the tweets used to introduce the members of the group. Finally, some tweets in the corpus also display multiple related hashtags (e.g. #SinCienciaNoHayFuturo #NoScienceNoFuture #SinCiencia NonHaiFuturo), a practce which creaes an intertextual link between several discssions in witer. Alltese use of hashtags help the groups to improve the visbility and searchabilit of the twees and in turn increase their own visibility and construct their identity. $@$ mentions are another digital intertextual device aiming at incorporating other voices in a tweet. $@$ mentions had several overlapping functions in the corpus, among them referentiality (see \* $@$ EmergingMindsUK' in example 5) and addressivity, which facilitates further interaction with the mentioned user and signals social allegiances. As with hashtags, multiple mentions were displayed in a single tweet to build intertextual links between related Twitter accounts and related voices and increase visibility (e.g. $@ s \mathrm { E O M }$ $@$ 1969carodriguez $@$ SOLTI $@$ prat_aleix $@$ BelletMeritxell $@$ itsnot_pink $@$ OncoAlert).

# 5.6. Template reuse

A frequent practice in the Twitter accounts analyzed, facilitated by the modularity affordance of digital texts is the reuse of templates to compose tweets serving aspecific purpose, e.g. introduce the members of the group. This was a common practice in the Twitter acount o the Martin group and the TOPIC group (see Fig. 12) in tweets intended for group promotion. The use of the template facilitates the composing of the twets, and creates inertextual links between the tweet created with the same template, helping the readers to identify them as providing the same type of content.

# 5.7. Function of intertextuality in research groups' tweets: a summary

Academics hness the affordances of tweetsto refer to, link to or incorporate ther texts and voices, and recontextalize them to fit the tweets purpose. Intertextual representations in the twets in the corpus analyed served avariet f functions (see Table 2), which helped these groups accomplish several social actions: promoting the group and their research output, networking, community building and negotiating relations with their audiences, persuading readers to take specifi actions, increasing the interested public's science literacy in relation to their feldf reearch), and constructing their identity (as competent reearchers, members of a specific community).

Two productive intertextual practices which contribute to promoting the group involve retweeting. The first is retweeting tweets that inform of the group's research activity and outcomes, both tweets by group members (i.e self-reposting) and by other internal or external sources, thus amplifying the audience. The second practice is retweeting others' positive evaluation of the group, which enables the group to validate and showcase their achievements while avoiding self-praise. Another promotional inovative practice is the use of tweet threads, where visual quotations and text summaries are combined, to present the main results of the group's conference presentations or publications. This can be considered a type of tweetorial (Graham, 2021) intended for experts. Other inno vative intertextual practice served networking purposes, e.g. discipline-related memes to create intimacy and solidarity, retweting to endorse others' opinions or to help other researchers spread their information, hashtags and $@$ mentions to signal the group's affiliation to networked communities, maintain relationships and participate in conversations.

A large number of intertextual representations were clearly intended to publicize the research and achievements of the groups see \*promotion of the group' in Table 2), but i could be argued that all instances of intertextuality served to promote the groups and increase their visibilit. As Page (2012) notes, Twitter is ideally suited to self-branding, and intertextualit is a useful resource to achieve this promotional purpose. For instance, by incorporating $@$ mentions and hashtags and by informing or retweeting about others' research, groups not only promote others' work and strengthen their bonds with them but also increase the spreadability of their tweet, project their scholarly authority, and ultimately enhance their own visibility. imilarly, hyperlinks to discipline-related resources and news have a networking and dissemination purpose, but also serve to represent the tweeters as competent members of the community.

Intertextuality plays therefore an important role in the creation of the group's digital identity. The various possibilities for intertextuality i academic tweets enable the tweeters to incorporate a multiplicity of voices, e.g. of the members of the group, other researchers, academic organizations. The groups create their own voice and identity by appropriating these voices and adapting them to serve their own purposes, or as Bakhtin (1981) would put it, populating them with their own intentions. The groups in this study exploited intertextualit to provide cumulative information about their (members') academic interests, research and expertise, their academic llegiances and connectios, their values and mission, and, in this way, they constructed a multifaceted group identit. The groups' intertextual practice (i.. the texs and voices that each group chooses to incorporate or exclude in their tweet, how they are incorporated, and the group's stance about them) helps them to project particular identitie e.g. as competent researchers, as researchers involved in science dissemination).

# 6. Conclusions

In this paper I have explored the intertextual practice of research groups in their Twiter accounts. The academic twets in the corpus are highly intertextual, often composed by incorporating or referring to a wide range of previous texts and voices. Academic tweets both reconfigure well-established forms of intertextuality, by adapting them to the Twittr evironment, and display novel and innovative forms of intertextuality facilitated by the technological affordances: retweeting (and commenting on) tweets which are extracted from a previous Twitter conversation and incorporated into the group's Twittr feed for several purposes; embedding other digital elements (videos, pictures, graphical abstracts, memes), which may act as "appetizers' for the text from which they have been extracted or serve as means of expressing solidarit and creating community; linking to and connecting the tweet physically to other digital texts, creating a network through which the reader can navigate. The analysis has shown that the forms of intertextualit in academic tweets are influenced by the affordances and constraints of Twitter. The retweeting feature and the easines with which elements from other online spaces can be copied-and-pasted or embedded facilitate new forms of quotations. Many tweets embed other artefacts (e.g. other twees, graphical atract, short videos), with the purpose of hanesing the reach' and \*ublic affordances of Twitter o amplify the audience of these texts. Hyperlinking makes it possile to incorprate ther digital texts tuning the tweet into a platorm for the distribution and sharing of texts with various audiences for different purposes. Digital mentions (hashtags and $@$ mentions) refer to other tweets, simultaneously incorporating other voices to the tweet and connecting the tweet to a broader conversation.

The study has also revealed three features of intertextuality in this digital context. First, the intertextual representations in these tweets are usually multimodal he semioticresources that are taken up from previous context are not only written text, but very often visual resources or a combination of text and (audio)visual elements. Secondly, intrtextuality very ften merges with hypertextuality: most intertexal instance connect the text to previous texts not only diursively, but aso phsicall, since the rder can click on the link, the retweet or the embedded element and traverse to another digital space. Thirdly, intertextuality in academic tweets is characterized by diversit,complexity and multi-layeredness. Many twets in the corpus analyzed are a mosaic of other texts, which display several layers of retweeing and embedding, and multilicit of intertextual relations, combined to achieve the communicative purpose(s) of the twet. The possbilit of incorporating a variety and multiplicity of inertextual representations in a single twet is what makes twees such effective toos to spread various types of information, wit littl text-producing effort, and achie various purposes simultaneously.

The functional analysis of intertextuality in these academic tweets has also shown that the intertextual practices of academics when composing tweets are haped by the communicative purposes of the tweets, that is, by the social actions that these tweets accomplish. The Twiter ccount f research groups is an open genre, always in the making, intended to pred content taken up from other digital (and non-digital) spaces, connect with other users and promote the group. This openness of academic Twitter and its potential for immediate real-time sharing helps academics to achieve the promotional, networking and outreach purposes of the genre, and to negotiate their identity and relationships to their social context. Interestingly, although some forms of intertextuality are common in the Twitte accounts of the four groups (e. retweeting, hyperlinking), not allth forms occur in the four datasets or are used with the same functions. This is the case, for instance, of the use of tweet threads to summarize papers, the use of memes to create solidarity, or the use of retweets and hyperlins to disseminate information to wider audiences. This sugests that thee groups are creative in using intertextuality to meet their purposes and that individual agency and the group's specific purposes play an important role in shaping their intertextual practices.

It should be noted that this study is exploratory and limited in the number of twees and disciplines in the corpus. Future research could examine intertextual practices in twets composed by reearchers in other discilines. Another limitation of the study i that it is purely text-based, with the functional analysis of intertextuality relying on the analyst's interrtation. In future rearch, this analysis could be complemented with discourse-based semi-structured interviews with the tweeters in order to get information about their perception regarding the purpose of the intertextual instances they incorporate in their tweets and corroborate the analyst's interpretation.

Despite these limitations, this study has important implications for EAP instruction and for the teaching of digital genres for ac. ademic communication. Due t its public natre and its potential to include a variety of intertextualities, Twiter constitutes a unique arena where groups can interact with others to spread their own and others' content and share them within their discipline and with wider audiences. The key role of intertextuality in achieving the social purposes of academic tweets suggests that an important skillin meaning making in these wets i the abilit toskilfully adat and recontextualize various semiotic elements in previous texts. Thus. EAP instruction could include activities that involve digital multimodal composing (see Hafner & Miler, 2019) and recontextualization of academic content, where learners need to exploit the affordances of the genre being composed to accomplish specific social actions. Since academic tweets exhibit considerable variability, it sems appropriate to teach them as choice by focusing on their affordances and rhetorical purposes, so that as Devitt (2004) laims, genre awareness can lead to individual cretivity. This study can therefore be used to help scholars (and research groups in particular) become aware of the multiple ways in which intertextuality can be harnese to compose efective twets in order o achiee specific purposes. More generall, the reults of ths study can also help to raise awareness of intertextuality in traditional research genres, by engaging learners in exploring the similarities and differences between intertextual practices in social media and print-based genres. Comparing the choices available regarding the forms and functions of intertextuality in these genres, with an emphasis on how authors integrate previous texts to achieve their own rhetorical purposes, could help learners gain a better understanding of intertextuality and voice in academic writing.
