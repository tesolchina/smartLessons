This paper describes the co-selection of patterns and functions of the authorial $I$ in soft science articles under the analytical framework of local grammar. Based on the taxonomy of Tang & John (1999), we generalized four functional categories in terms of the writer roles enacted by I: i.e. $I a s$ architect, I as data analyser, I as recounter of research process, and I as opinion holder/originator. We then identified the frequent semantic-functional patterns and lexico-grammatical patterns of $I$ under each category of function. In so doing, we explored the connections among patterns and collocations of I and functions that I is used for. It is hoped that this paper would help novice soft science writers to gain a better understanding about how to use the authorial I more appropriately to construct authorial identity in academic writing.

# 1. Introduction

Traditional views hold that academic writing should adopt an impersonal writing style. As Smith (1996: 2-3) argued, \*the first person should not appear in the scientific papers." Spencer and Arbon (1996: 26) also argued that \*in the writing of traditional and formal style I and we should not be used in the main body of the article." However, recent corpus-based studies have provided ample evidence on the common use of first person pronouns in academic writing of various genres (e.g. McGrath, 2016; Taylor & Goodall, 2019), discilines (e.g Isik-Tas, 2018; Yeo & Ting, 2014), and languages (e.g. Duenas, 2007; Kim, 2009). As Hyland and Jiang (2017: 45) noted, \*the convention of avoiding the first person to convey an impersonal stance, once a hallowed principle for style guide writers and science authors, now seems to be less rigidly adhered to." Compared with the first person plural we, which can be reader-inclusive (Harwood, 2005) and signify a reader-oriented hedge to mask the authorial presence, the frst person singular I is totally write-exclusive and makes the authorial presence explicitl visible. In the area of language and academic literacy education, teachers are sharply divided on whether I should be used in academic writing. As Taylor and Goodall (2019: 135) described, some lecturers do not seem to mind it appearing in a piece of student academic writing, whil others strongly object to it. Teachers divergence makes the issue more problematic for student academic writing in the soft disciplines. However, the issue is nothing as simple as whether or not soft science writers should use $I .$ It is necessary to look closely at the combinatory behaviour of $I$ to better understand how soft science writers use I trategically and appropriately, as "native-like formulaicity builds upon knowledge about specific phraseological patterns, regarding approriate register, situational context, pramatic unctions and pattens f usage (Wang & Zhang, 2021, p. 48).

The aim of alocal grammar is to establish a connection between form and function in social contexts (Su, 2017). Compared with traditional or general grammars, which account for a function in terms of grammatical elements, local grammars offer new approach for describing the realisations of a function in terms of both lexico-grammatical patterns and semantic-functional patterns. The semantic-functional pattern inks at one end with the function by breaking the function into meaning elements, and at the other end with the lexico-grammatical pattern, where each meaning element maps onto a set of lexico-grammatical elements (see Section 2. for detailed description). By incorporating the semantic-functional pattern, local grammar pushes forward the description of the relationship between syntactic elements from the lexico-grammatical level to the discourse-semantic level (Su, 2019), and reveals more explicitly how form and function map onto and interact witheach other, which in turn facilitates the establishment of a clearer connection between form and function. Following this line of thought, we have conducted the present study within the framework of local grammar to examine the actual use of the authorial $I$ in soft science articles, with a view to characterizing the most prominent functions that I is used for and the most common local grammar patterns of I for each function. Accordingly, the research questions used to guide the analysis of this article are as follows:

(i) What are the main functions that the authorial $I$ is used to realise in soft science article writing? (ii) What are the local grammar patterns in terms of both semantic-functional patterns and lexico-grammatical patterns under each functional category of $I _ { \ast }$ and what are the most frequent collocating verbs in each lexico-grammatical pattern? (iii) How the patterns of $I$ are co-selected with the functions of $I ?$

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. First person singular I in academic writing

A number of studies have been carried out to explore the discourse-pragmatic functions of first person singular $I$ in various acalemic discourse. Functions of I in previous studies have been identified and classified from two main perspectives.

1) Common research acts or rhetorical moves that reflect the development of a research paper (e.g. Duenas, 2007; Harwood, 2005a; Hyland, 2002; Isik-Tas, 2018; Molino, 2010; Taylor & Goodall, 2019; Vassileva, 1998). To our knowledge, Vassileva (1998) was the first study to construct a taxonomy of ten functional categories for use of I in terms of the research acts that an I-sentence (the sentence where I ocurs) in linguistics research articles may perform, but his/her taxonomy includes not only the authorial I but the unauthorial I as well. Hyland (2002) delineated the functions of authorial reference (e.g. the authorial $I _ { : }$ my, me, we) and identified five functional categories of authorial reference in student reports and research artices i.. Explaining a procedure, "Stating results or claim", \*Elaborating an argument", Stating a goal/purpose", and "Expressing self-benefits". Other functional taxonomies of the authorial I from this perspective are similar to Hyland (2002), but the specific functional identifications and classfications may vary slightly to bettr it different research data. Harwood (2005a) refined Hyland's (2002) classification by adding two new functional categories for use of I based on the two corpora (a student corpus and an expert corpus) used in his study, and defined seven categories: "I to state results and claims", I to elaborate an argument", "Methodological $T '$ , "I to state a purpose", I to express self-benefits", I to define terms", and I as disciplinary servant. Molino (2010) set the threshold of \*in at least one sub-corpus at a minimum frequency of one instance per 10,o00 words ibid: 91) to determine which function of I (the function that an I-sentence achieves) can be considered \*major", and Molino (2010) identified six major discourse functions for use of $I$ in research articles: "Announcing goals or purposes", "Stating assumption'", "Providing definitional clarifications", "Explaining procedures", "Making clams and elaborating an argument, and "Referring back to the text'. Taylor and Goodall (2019) proposed a typology of eight functions for use of I based on the analysis of thirteen genres of student academic writing: "Acknowledging support and expressing gratitude, "Reflecting on self/actions", "Expressing intentions and decisions', "Stating a purpose", "Explaining a procedure, "Elaborating an argument", "Offering suggestions and recommendations" and "Stating results/claims' Isik-Tas (2018) took astep further and regrouped the functions of I in light of their chances of exposing the author to readers' direct challenges. Isik-Tas (2018) suggested that research acts such as "stating a goal or purpose" and "explaining a procedure" are low-stakes functions, while "stating personal opinions or knowledge claims" and "proposing a theory or approach' are high-stakes functions.

Fig. 1. Tang & John's functional taxonomy of first person pronouns (Tang & John, 1999, p. 29).

(2) Writer roles or writer identity in academic writing (e.g. Dong & Qiu, 2018; Leedham & Fernandez-Parra, 2017; McGrath, 2016; Rausova, 2018; Tang & John, 1999; Zareva, 2013). As noted by Tang and John (1999), \*language does not serve merely as a tool to express a self that we already have, but serves as a resource for creating that elf, the authorial  is found to be also a powerful means to signal writer roles and to construct writer identity in the text. Taking a cue from Ivanic's (1998: 307) idea of the continum of I, Tang and John (199) developed a taxonomy of i functions of first person in academic writing in terms of the roles that first person pronouns were mainly used to signal: "I as representative", I as guide, I as architect, I as recounter of research process", "I as opinion holder" and "I as originator. The six functions were ordered along a continum from the least powerful authorial presence to the most powerful authorial presence, as shown in Fig. 1. However, it should be noted that. although Tang and John (1999) labelled the six categories as $^ { \ast \ast } T ^ { \ast }$ , they actually considered all the various forms of the first person pronoun (i.e. I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, and ours) when building their taxonomy (ibid: 26).

Based on Tang and John's (199) classification, other functional taxonomies of the authorial I have been developed in academic discourse across disciplines, text types, languages, writing expertise levels, and so on. Starfield and Ravell (2006) proposed a taxonomy of five functions of I in Ph.D. theses in history and sociology: I as guide or architect - to structure the discourse and state a purpose", Methodological I - explains what was done (as researcher), Ias opinion holder, I as originator - claim maker, and "Reflexive $T '$ . The taxonomy added in Tang and John's (1999) classification the function \*Reflexive $I ^ { \prime \prime }$ , which is found to be commonly used by thes writers to \*create a powerful textual sef that draws its authority through its explicit ttention to autobiography and the use of $I$ to locate the writer as subject within the research process" (Starfield & Ravell, 2006, p. 231). Similarly, McGrath (2016) developed a taxonomy of six functions of self-mention in anthropology and history research articles: "Guide/architect', "Origi. nator/claim maker', Methodological $I ^ { \prime \prime }$ , "Opinion holder", "Reflexive", and "Narrative'. Zareva (2013) identified five categories of functions of the speaker-related I in TsOL graduate student presentations as "Guide", Architect, \*Recounter of research process" "Opinion holder, and "Originator'. Leedham and Fernandez-Parra's (2017) devised five functional categories of we and I in Chinese, Greek and British students assignments in engineering: "Guide", "Opinion holder, Reflector', Recounter", and "Representative". To summarize, numerous studies have set out to explore the functions of the authorial $I$ (e.g. Duenas, 2007; Harwood, 2005a; Hyland, 2002; Iik-Tas, 2018; Leedham & Fernandez-Parra, 2017; McGrath, 2016; Molino, 2010; Rausova, 2018; Starfield & Raveli 2006; Tang & John, 199; Taylor & Goodall, 2019, Vassleva, 1998; Yeo0 & Ting, 2014; Zareva, 2013). Although some studies have established links of the functions of the authorial I with the power of authorial presence signalled by the use of I (e.g. Hyland, 2002; Rausova, 2018; Tang & John, 199), or discussed the rhetorical strategies underlying the use of I, such as the reasons why writers use or the desired effcts of such usage f I(e.g. Fortanet, 2004; Harwod, 2005b; Ye0 & Ting, 2014), no study to date has attempted to account for the relisations of th functions f in termf semantic-functionl patterns, lexicorammatical patterns, and ollocations from a local grammar approach.

# 2.2. Local grammar

Computational linguist Gross originated the concept of local grammar to capture shared features across instances of collocations and frozen sentences (Gross, 1993, p. 26). Later the concept of local grammar was developed by corpus linguists to deal with functions (e.g. Barnbrook & Sinclair, 2001; Hunston & Sinclair, 200). As Hunston and Su (2017: 5) indicated, a local grammar is \*a grammar of a discourse function in specific registers and genres. Each local grammar "sees to account for, not the whole of a language, but one meaning only' (Hunston, 2002, p. 178). Within the local grammar framework, a sentence of a particular function is analyzed and parsed into two kinds of pattern: the semantic-functional pattern, which is identified according to the semantic or functional role played by each constituent in the sentence, and the lexico-grammatical pattern, which is identified according to the words and word classes of each semantic or functional role. In each local grammar analysis, the semantic-functional pattern is matched with the lexico-grammatical pattern.

According to our knowledge, Hunston and Sinclair (2000) was the first to inroduce the concept of local grammar to corpus lin guistics and constructed the local grammar of evaluation. They firt identified six lexicorammatical patterns that are typically used to evaluate, and classfied the sentences of evaluation into different categories of lexico-grammatical patterns accordingly. They then identified the semantic-functional pattern for each of the six lexico-grammatical patterns by using such meaning/function-specific labels as "evaluator', \*evaluative category", \*evaluating response', \*thing evaluated" and \*hinge". Table 1 shows some examples of the second lexico-grammatical pattern \*there $^ +$ link verb $^ +$ something/anything/nothing $^ +$ adjective group $^ +$ about/in $^ +$ noun group/-ing clause"' in Hunston and Sinclair's (2o00) local grammar analysis of evaluation.

Hunston and Sinclair's (2000) investigation provided important methodological and theoretical guidance for later research on how to apply the local grammar approach to dealing with functions. Based on the data of 4 adjective complementation pattrns, Hunston and Su (2017) derived the local grammar of evaluation consisting of 22 \*Analyses' that were grouped into five broad categories. In a reversal from Hunston and Sinclair (2000), Hunston and Su (2017) made the local grammar analysis of evaluation by using semantic-functional patterns as the first-level classifier and summarizing lexico-grammatical patterns for each of the semantic-functional patterns. Table 2 shows some examples of "Analysis 1 $( H i n g e + E \nu a l u a t i o n + T a r g e t$ in Hunston and Su (2017).

Whichever of the above approaches to analys is adopted, the local grammar always acounts for a function by first establishing the mappings between lexico-grammatical patterns (such as "it v-link ADJ that-clause, \*it v-link ADJ wh-clause, "it v-link ADJ to-inf." etc. in Table 2) and semantic-functional patterns (such as \*Hinge $^ +$ Evaluation $^ +$ Target' in Table 2) to constitute meaning-form pairings, and then matching a set of such meaning-form pairings with the function. By so doing, local grammars describe the relationship between syntactic elements not only in lexico-grammatical categories but also in semantic-functional categories. In this sense, local grammars are more informative for language description than traditional or general grammars, as local grammars identify a syntactic element in terms of both its semantic-functional and lexico-grammatical categories, rather than simply (lexico-)grammatical category. This is more fully addressed in Su and Zhang (2019).

What is noteworthy about local grammars is that they push the emphasis on phraseological/lexical-grammatical patterning towards an emphasis on discourse-semantic pattrning, which further brings our understanding of text organisation and development to a new level. To be specific, traditionall, researchers and education practitioners consider text organisation and development in terms of patternings of lexical-grammatical forms; in contrast, research on local grammars allows us to understand text organisation and development from a relatively new perspective and at a higher level of abstraction: what we see in text is not just the strings of co-occurring phraseological forms but also strings of discourse-semantic patterns.

(Su & Zhang, 2019, p. 15)

Two approaches can be distinguished among previous studies, regarding how to apply local grammar analyses to linguistic de. scriptions; one starts from a particular function and the other from a specific form.

Many studies on local grammars adopted the first approach (hereafter the \*function-driven approach'), that is, taking one particular semantic or functional phenomenon as the starting point (e.g. Allen, 2005; Barnbroo, 2002; Bednarek, 2008; Cheng & Ching, 2018; Hunston & Sinclair, 2000; Hunston & Su, 2017; Su, 2017; Su & Zhang, 2019). Both Hunston and Sinclair (2000) and Hunston and Su (2017), as mentioned above, were studies of this type. Apart from evaluation, a local grammar approach is relicable for other functions, and in a similar vein, a number of studes developed the local grammars of different functions, for example, a local grammar of definitio (Banbrook, 2002), a local grammar of cause and effct (Alle, 2005), a local grammar of affect (Bednarek, 2008), a local grammar of request (Su, 2017), a local grammar of disclamer (Cheng & Ching, 2018), and a local grammar of apology (Su & Wei, 2018). Those studies focused on the description of one meaning or function only and have demonstrated the validity and applicability of a local grammar aproach to describing diffrent functions. Studies of this type have suggested that local grammars have a noticeable advantage over general grammars in describing specific functional domains, as they are more systematic and detailed, and more straightforward (Su, 2017, p. 74).

The second approach to developing local grammars takes one particular lexical or grammatical form as its starting point (hereafter the "form-driven approach'). This approach is in line with Gross (1993) motivation to originate the concept of local grammar to analyze restricted inguisticforms. The form-driven approach was developed as a complement to the function-driven aproach to suit different research nees and for more thorough local grammar descriptions. As pointed out by Su (2018: 3),the form-driven approach can facilitate the development of loal grammars \*in a more systematic and principled manner'. To the best of our knowledge, four studies to date have made local grammar analyses by using the form-driven approach. Sinclair (2007: 38-46) examined the local grammarsofthe mult-word lexical item wit seras its invariable core and made the case that local grammars can better acount for multi-word lexical items which exhibit variation asi often the case (Warren & Leung, 2016, p. 3). Based on Sinclair (2007), Warren and Leung (2016) extended the theory and application of local grammars to identify the patterns of co-selection found in the four collocational frameworks any .. ay, may.. ny, any . sall and shal.. ay. u (2018) and Su (2019) demonstrated the possbility and feasibility of using lexico-grammar patterns as the input to develop local grammars; the former developed local grammars of the pattern  n on n" for eight functions, and the later developed the local grammars of the pattern V n as n for three broad meaning groups. One of the main conclusions in both studies is that lexico-grammatical patterns are a good starting point for developing local grammars, because searching lexico-grammatical patterns facilitates the identification of specific meanings in corpora and local grammars are dedicated to describing such meanings.' (Su, 2019, p. 3).

While there have been a small number of studies to illustrat the feasibilit of developing local grammars of restricted linguistic forms, there has ben no attempt sofar to make local grammar analyse of the function-rich word, the authorial , and look into the co selection features or combinatory behaviour of the word when it fulfil different functions.In view of this based on a careful ex. amination of a two million word corpus f oft science articles, our study firt identifies the four main functions that an I-sentence may realise, and then examines the most frequent lexico-grammatical patterns and semantic-functional patterns for each function of the authorial  from a local grammar approach, with a view to characterizing the co-selection potential of functions and patterns of I soft science articles.

# 3. Research methodology

# 3.1. The corpus

We based our study on the CARE corpus (Wei & Zhang, 2020). CARE (Colection of Academic Research Essays) is a discipline-specific comparable corpus of research articles published from the years 2003-2013, writen either by English native speakers (CARE-ENS) or by Chinese native speakers (CARE-CNS). Please refer to Wei and Zhang (2020) for a more detailed description of CARE. CARE-ENS contains 2640 research articles written by English native speakers It covers eight oft science disciplines, with reference to the notion of soft cience identified by Kolb (1981: 241); they are economics and management, education, history, law, linguistics, politicl science, psychology, and sociology. The overall orpus size of CARE-ENS iseight million tokens, and the first person singular I occurs 8872 times throughout the corpus. As wil be described in Section 3.3, the identification of the references and functions of $I$ is a hugely labour-intensive process. The amount of 8872 instances was considered to be too big to handle manually. Hence, for the convenience of operation, we generated eight smaller groups of texts, each of which have roughly the same size of 250, 000 tokens, from the eight soft disciplines of CARE-ENS, respectively, and formed a small corpus, CARE-Sample, which was used to examine the functions and patterns f Iin soft science artice. CARE-Sample contains 17 reearch artices with a manageable size f 2, 001,412 tokens and 34,363 types, and its standardised type-token ratio amounts to $2 6 . 5 5 \%$

# 3.2. Analytical framework

The framework applied to the analysis of the authorial  is two-layer: (1) the identification of functions with aview to the writer role enacted by I in discourse, and (2) the determination of the local grammar for each function in terms of semantic-functional patterns, lexico-grammatical patterns, and collocations.

At the first layer, our functional categorization of the authorial I draws on Tang and John's (1999) taxonomy. However, as mentioned before, Tang and John (199: 26) built their taxonomy by considering a wider set of first person pronouns and therefore included in thir taxonomy the uses which relate to items such as we, us, our, et., rather than to I. With this in mind, we scrutinized the six functions categorized in their taxonomy, i.e. \*representative", guide through the essay', \*architect, recounter of research process", "opinion holder" and "originator", and filtered for the functions which can be realised by I. Specifically, we made the following modifications.

(1) According to Tang and John (1999), the role of representative" is the usage of "a generic first person pronoun, usually realised as the plural we or us, that writers use as a proxy for a larger group of people" (ibid: 27). This writer role signals collective ownership and is most unlikely to be undertaken by the authorial Ii research articles, therefore, we removed the function from our classification.   
(2) The role of guide through the essay' i \*always implicitl or explicitly accompanied by the reader, this particular usage of the first person pronoun is usually realised in the plural, inclusive form of we or us" (Tang & Joh, 1999, p. 29). In this sense, the role refers to both authors and readers and unlikely involves the authorial I. However, Tang and John (ibid: 29) also indicate that \*this particular role is ofte signalled explicitly by the use of vers like see, note, and observe in Halliday's (1994) terms, mental processes of perception, specifically visual perception). We hand-checked the pairing of the authorial I with the verb of visual perception in our data and found dozens of such cases, in most of which the authorial i not used to guide readers through the text, but to analyze data or result, such as in the example sentence However, I observe neither private benefits nor manageridl expertise. Therefore, we removed the role of \*guide through the essay' from our taxonomy but added a new role of I into it, i.e. "data analyser', which foregrounds the person who gleans useful information or result (factual) through the observation and analysis of data. Unlike the roles of "opinion holder" and originator', which are both associated with expressing a view, the role of "data analyser' emphasizes on extracting factual information from data. As in the above example, the result of the observation neither private benefits nor managerial expertise is not an opinion but a fact.   
(3) Tang and John (199: 34) suggested that the role of "opinion-holder" and the role of "originator" would beter be discussed together, because \*there is often a natural progression from the role of opinion-holder (expressing an opinion of someone else's views) to the role of originator (venturing one's own take on an issue) in mature academic writing". In line with their view, we merged the two roles into one, which we tentatively call "I as opinion holder/originator'.

Based on the above modifications to Tang and John's (199) taxonomy, we finally constructed ataxonomy of four functions for the autril  in ot scie rt, ..  s hitect, I   yr, I s ronr of reh pr, ad  s  hd/riginr.

At the second layer, no local grammar of self-mention, realised by the authorial  in particular, has yet been proposed based on our knowledge. We therefore developed a framework for local grammar analyses of the authorial I. As noted earlier, a local grammar analysis involves the identification of both semantic-functional patterns and lexico-grammatical patterns. The identification of two types of pattern is highly consistent cross ocal grammars of dfferent functions, excet that the categoric labels for meaning elements in semantic-functional patterns may vary depending on the specific function under study. For example, Hunston and Su (2017: 15) labelled the meaning elements in their local grammar analyses of evaluation as "evaluator, "evaluation', \*evaluative act", "target" "hinge", "action', and specifier'. Su (2017) labelled the meaning elements in his analyses of request as "requester', \*requestee" "requested action", intended action'", hinge", \*indicator", and \*mitigator'. Following the approach and labelling convention of local grammar analyses, we tentatively proposed the terms for meaning elements in semantic-functional patterns for each function of I The terms are illstrated in Table 3 below. One term that needs to be explained here is \*hinge'. The concept of "hinge" varies across the local grammar studies. Some studies defined the term as a grammatical linking operator (e.g. Barnbrook & Sinclair, 2001; Hunston & Sinclair, 2000), but others have seen the term as a functional linking operator (e.g. Cheng & Ching, 2018; Hunston & Su, 2017). This article takes the latter position and uses t to label the element that links dfferent meaning elements in a semantic-functional pattern. In this terminology, hinge" consists of not only grammatical words but also content words. For example, in the sentence I chose to examine one of the untested ssertions underlying the field, which is used to describe the research proces, I functions as the \*research processor, examine is the "processing action, and chose to is the hinge' that links the "research processor" with the "processing action".

# 3.3. Procedures

Data processing and analysis followed the three steps below.

First, we POS tagged all the texts in the CARE-Sample corpus with the tagging software CLAWS and its C7 tagging set, to distinguish between the first person singular I and the signs or symbols that have the same form with T (such as the Roman numeral "one"). The first person singula was tagged as  Ps1 by thesoftware. Then we used Wordsmith Tools 6 to retrieall the concordances which contain the tag "I PPIs1" from the corpus, and obtained a preliminary output of 1821 concordances of the first person singular I.

Second, we noticed that in many cases I ccurs in the citations, such as quoting the original words of subjects in experiments. I f this type is not author-related, so we read carefull the context where each instance of the first person I occurs, and determined whether I in each concordance refers to the author or not. Afer performing this step, we extracted 696 concordance f the authorial! from the corpus for further analysis.

Third, we applied the two-layer framework, as described in 3.2, to the analysi of the functions and patterns of the authorial i soft science articles. To be more specific, we performed the following sub-steps. (1) We identified the function of each I-sentence by referring to the local textual environment or even to the extended context in which I occurs, and classified the 696 instances of the uthoria n or tio catri:   chet f the ey, I s d yr, I s recontr f rh ros, d s opinion holder/originator. (2) We identified the semantic-functional pattern of each I-sentence under each functional category above, by using the labels of meaning elements as shown in Table 3. (3) We generalized the frequent lexico-grammatical paterns for each semanticfunctional pattern and the most common vers collocating with I in each lexico-grammatical pattern. We categorized the collocating verbs of $I$ into three groups by essentiall following Hyland and Tse's (2005: 130) identification of the three kinds of activity that verbs can refer t,  h act, whch reent primentl actiities or actions carrid t in the rel wod dmonstre, shws) cognition acts, which are concerned with the rearcher's metal processes .assume, believe); and discourse acts, which focus on the expression of cognitive or research activities (e.g. report, conclude).

# 4. Results and analysis

# 4.1. Local grammar analyses of the four functions of I

Tables 4-7 reveal the diffrences in the frequency distribution of functions of the authorial I. It is shown that I as recounter of research process is the biggest functional type, with 302 instances accounting for $4 3 . 3 9 \%$ of the 696 occurrences of I in the corpus. This identity role is prevalent in the author's decription of the various steps undrtaken in rearch or the stratgies and techniques utilized in the data collection and processing. Such an extensive use of I reveals that, compared with other identity roles of $I _ { : }$ the soft science writers preferentilly us I to manfest their athorial identity as deigner r conductor f rarch and decision-makers in the research process. As Zareva (2013: 79) argued, \*they probably saw their self-mention in reference to the detail f their research inquiries as illuminating the objectivit and depth of their thinking proces and, consequently, validating their opinions, beliefs, conclusions, and findings drawn from their research'. The role of I as opinion-holder/originator ranks second, with 227 instances $( 3 2 . 6 2 \% )$ . The soft science writers front this role with the authorial $I$ to share opinions, to make claims, or to originate new ideas. According to Tang and

John (199), this role i the most powerful role as the author exerts ownership over his or her writing by \*claiming authority as the source of the content of the text and showing that they perceive themselves as people who have the right and the abilit to hold an opinion or to originate a new idea ibid: 29). Although not as frequent as the role of I as recounter f reearch proces, this rol is til highly common, suggesting that the soft science writers do not shy away from making overt authorial presence to take a stand or put forward a view. The role of I as architect ranks third, with 131 instances $( 1 8 . 8 2 \% )$ . This usage of the authorial I foregrounds the person Who organizes, structures, and outlines the content of an articl. This role shows the least powerful authorial presence. I as data analyser is the smallest functional type of $I _ { \mathrm { i } }$ with only 36 instances $( 5 . 1 7 \% )$ . This role foregrounds the person who finds out factual result based on analysis of data, which can then be used as a basis for agreing, disagreeing, or putting forward a claim, view, etc. Compared with ther roles, soft sciene writers are es likely to enact this role y using I, but tend more to use es direct ways, such as the use of dummy-it constructions (157 instances), to state factual information in data analysis.

Tables 4-7 also provide an overview of the local grammars of the authorial I for each of the four functions, mapping semanticfunctional patterns on to lexico-grammatical patterns. It should be noted that only the local grammar paterns with more than 3 occurrences of I-sentences are displayed in the tables. The local grammar patterns in each table represent the most frequent and salient patterns, but not necesarily an exhaustie reresentation ofall the patens that are found to realise each function. More specifically, overall, the three local grammar patterns in Table 4 can cover $9 8 . 4 7 \%$ - $( 9 6 + 1 7 + 1 6 ) / 1 3 1 )$ of the total occurrences of I as architect; the one pattern displayed in Table 5 represents $9 7 . 2 2 \%$ (35/36) of the occurrences of I as data analyser; the three patterns in Table 6 represent $9 8 . 6 8 \%$ $( 2 3 4 + 2 8 + 3 6 ) / 3 0 2 )$ of the occurrences of I as recounter of research process; and the three patterns in Table 7 represent $9 7 . 8 0 \%$ $( 1 7 2 + 3 4 + 1 6 ) / 2 2 7 )$ of the cases of I as opinion-holder/originator.

(1) Function 1: I as architect

When enacting the role of I as architect, the authorial $I$ is found to typically co-occur with the locator' in three main semanticfunctional patterns: (1) locator, architect $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ thing architected $^ +$ (aim)", (2) "hinge $^ +$ architect $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ locator, thing architected", and (3) "thing architected $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architect $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ locator' (Table 4).

Semantic-functional pattern (1), with 96 instances, isthe one most frequently used to realise this function. It accounts for $7 3 . 2 8 \%$ (96/131) of the occurrences of I o enact the role of I s architec. In the pae occurs n the mai clause as in the example sentence Inthis sectio  xn thexento which sdy de pt me as flow freiniveed.. Th r onsists of three types f adverbials txt dexis . in ection5) listig adverbia e. firsy) and time dverbial (. now). The \*hinge" consists of the modal vers (e.g. will shall, have) and the verbs of intention (e.g. attempt to, see to, wish to). The "architecting action' is commonly realised by reearch act verbs (e.g. use, examine, explore show, demonstrate, undertake provide and discourse act verbs (e.g. laorate, decribe, diss, peent, sugst, review, in concude), and osionall y the cotion act vers considr and fous on. The "thing architected is mainly realised by noun phrases or wh-clauses (the subordinate clause that'sinroduced by one f the wh-words. When realised by noun phrae, the \*thing architcted is often followed by toinfinitive clause to indicate the am of research (e.g. In th tion th  th o h fi chg  . n i hriion above, the lexico-grammatical pattern for semantic-functional pattrn (1) is generalized as text deixis/time/listing adverbial $+ I +$ (modal verb/verb of intention) $^ +$ verb of research/discourse/cognition act $^ +$ [nominal $^ +$ (to-inf)]/wh-clause".

Semantic-functional pattern (2) occurs 17 times in total, accounting for $1 2 . 9 8 \%$ of the occurrences of I as architect. In this pattern, the authorial I occurs in the subordinate clause introduced by as, as in the example sentence As I argue elow, laws may expres digust nti-sodomy laws in the United States. The ocator" consists typically of two types: text deixis (e.g. below, above) and time adverbial e.g. rlier). The chteting ation is mnly relisy dcourse act vers . nte, ge, decrbe s, sget, ad in a few cases by the research act verb demonstrate. Thus, semantic-functional pattern (2) can be matched with the lexico-grammatical pattern $\mathrm { \Delta } a s + I$ $^ +$ (modal verb) $^ +$ verb of discourse/research act $^ +$ text deixis/time adverbial $^ +$ main clause".

Semantic-functional pattern (3), with 16 instances $( 1 2 . 2 1 \% )$ , is a common variant of pattern (2). In the pattern, I occurs in the attributive clause of the thing architected, as in the example sentence The reuls present here demonstate that fedelism does play a part in. The ocator consists mostly f text deixis (e.g. here, above), and thearchtecting action consists mainly of discourseact vers (e.g. present, describe, discuss), forming the lexico-grammatical pattern \*nominal $^ +$ attributive clause((that) $+ I +$ verb of discourse act $^ +$ text deixis adverbial} $^ +$ main clause".

# (2) Function 2: I as data analyser

When enacting the role of Ias data analyser, the authorial I shows a strong tendency to co-occur with the \*specifier'. 35 out of 36 instances of $I$ in this role $( 9 7 . 2 2 \% )$ are found to occur in the semantic-functional pattern: \*specifier $^ +$ data-analyser $^ +$ (negation) $^ +$ analysing action $^ +$ thing found $^ +$ (specifier)' (Table 5). Six main types of specifiers are found in the pattern: scope (e.g. in untabulated reults), mnr (. siublic filing), tir . he), ation . thre), listing . fily), nd const . however). The "negation hinge consists of the negative verb fail and adverb not to indicate the unexpected or unsatisfactory result. The \*analysin action consists of vers of ption. osere, se, note, find) and vers of verifction e. cofim verfy. The \*thing found" onsists of the object clause, the noun phrase, and the noun with appositive clause (e.g. evidence that ., fact tht ..). In accordance with the analysis, the lexico-grammatical pattern is generalized as \*source/manner/result/inference/addition/listing/ contrast) adverbial $+ I +$ (negative verb) $^ +$ verb of perception/verification $^ +$ [object clause/noun $^ +$ (appositive clause)]".

# (3) Function 3: I as recounter of research process

hen enacting the role of I as recounter of reearch proces the authorial I tends to occur in three main semantic-functional patterns.

(1) "(specifier) $^ +$ research processor $^ +$ (initiative) $^ +$ processing action $^ +$ thing processed $^ +$ (specifier), (2) "specifier $^ +$ research processor $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ processing action $^ +$ thing processed $^ +$ (specifier)", and (3) "(specifier) $^ +$ research processor $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ processing action $^ +$ thing processed $^ +$ (specifier) (Table 6).

Semantic-functional pattern (1) is the most common one to realise the function. Its frequency reaches 234 times, amounting to $7 7 . 4 8 \%$ of the occurrences of I in this role. The patten is signalled with the predominant use of research act verbs (e.g. ask, choose, compute, condct, deonstate, deep, stingush, divid, xi, exclude, expre, extend, gte, give, idntify, hndcheck, ind intrview, instigate, kee, lael le iit mach, on, prvide, rn, rn, srate, take, use). The iitive hinge (.. choose t decide to, ept to, want to i tyicly found toco-occur with the reeach ct vero indicate ow ommited the athor is to his/her methodological decisions. Various types of the "specifier are shown in the pattern, such as aim (e.g.In order to maximize the availble sample), manner (e.g. By using mean ROA instead of realised ROA), cope (e.g. for each industry in each year), result/inference (e.g. therefore, adition (.. Barring that), listing (.. next), emphasis (e.g. in particlr) and conrast (e.. hwever). The \*thing processed is commonly relised by the noun phrase, oten followed by the \*specifier, such as amg. use muinmil logisti reession naysis tomodel t obiit f, td.teo cpute l stnd ers in the ustr d, se . t trdctions on my sample of nonguante susidiy), and comarator (.  mach suries wth det outstdingtoins offirms). The lexico grammatical pattern is thus summarized as "(addition/aim/contrast/emphasis/manner/listing/scope/ result/inference adverbial) $+ I$ $^ +$ (verb of decision/intention) $^ +$ research act verb $^ +$ nominal $^ +$ (aim/ method/scope/comparator/etc.)".

Semantic-functional pattern (2) occurs 28 times $( 9 . 2 7 \% )$ . In the pattern, I occurs in the adverbial clause, in particular, introduced by the subordinating conjunction because, except f, when, and as, as in the example sentence . except I clude all utlitie from the sample. Like semantic-functional pattern (1), the \*processing action' of this pattern consists mostly of the research act verbs as exemplified above, and the \*thing processe" is mainly relised y the noun phrase, typically fllowed by the \*specifier of am, scope, and comparator. However,different from semantic-functional pattrn (1), verbs of decision (e.g. choose to, decide to) are not found in this pattern, and verbs of intention (g. wish to, want to, need to) are only found in the averbial clause of rson (e.g. because I need to later merge my dat with the Fixed Income Securities Daabase (FIsD) .) but not in other type of adverbial clause. The lexico-grammatical pattern for semantic-functional pattern (2) is generalized as "subordinating conjunction $+ I +$ research act verb $^ +$ nominal $^ +$ (aim/ scope/comparator/etc.)".

Semantic-functional pattern (3), with 36 instances $( 1 1 . 9 2 \% )$ , features the use of cognition act verbs (e.g. consider, estimate, ignore, focus on) o peform th rocesing action as in the example sntence ntreting alldet leels as equivalent,  igore a lre amount of informatio. Thespecifie in this pattn consists f addtion, am, ontrast, emphasis, liting, manner, tc., andthe \*thing processed" consists mostly of noun phrase, oasionally followed by the aim or manner "specifier (e... estmate them by sutracting capitl expenditres from end-of-period assets and adding depreciation.). Semantic-functional pattern (3) can be matched with the lexicogrammatical pattern \*(addition/aim/contrast/emphasis/listing/manner adverbial) $+ \ I \ +$ cognition act verb $^ +$ nominal $^ +$ (aim/ manner)".

# (4) Function 4: I as opinion-holder/originator

The identity role of I as opinion-holder/originator is most ofen realised in three semantic-functional paerns: (1) \*(specifier) $^ +$ opinion-holder/originator $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ opinion-holding/originating action $^ +$ opinion", (2) "opinion, opinion-holder/originator $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ opinion-holding/originating action, opinion", and (3) "topic/opinion $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ opinion-holder/originator $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ opinion-holding/originating action $^ +$ (opinion) $^ +$ (specifier) (Table 7).

Semantic-functional pattern (1), with 172 occurrences $( 7 5 . 7 7 \% )$ , is the one most frequently used to express an opinion. The "specifie in th  onst f vris tys of arbils  rticar, ret/ne  for this rson), adtion .onthe other hand), am (e.g. To simplify matters), contrast (e.g. by contrast), manner (e.g. in this way), scope (e.g. In the case of conflict avoidance), and text deixis (e.g. here). The \*hinge consists largely of the "mitigatort, which is realised by the modal verb would and the verbs of wish (e.g. wish to, hope to), and the \*nitiative", which isrelised by the verbs of intention (e.g. want to, prefer to, prose to. The "opinion-holding/originating action" consists mainly of stance-related words or constructions, which include cognition act verbs (e. sse beie cone, ct  iz, pt, pe, th d, fid,  xt cosidr, preer, reat verbs (e.g. posit, propose, suggest, define, postulate, state), delexicalized verbs collocating with stance nouns (eg. make no such assption, did t he y rripdctios, ffr th oosal), d ecatctive . ea/rl onident that, remain true to). The "opinion' i relised in two main structures: the object clause (e.Iargue that historical contingency had an impact on how models were constructed ..) and the noun phrase that is sometimes fllowed by the complement (e.g. consider some of them to be like more thn just a business lionshp..) or the appositive claus . I have no doubt inded we hae se t he, th ther pproches t recognition can provide accurate accounts of some of the indings that we explored.). In line with the analysis the lexicogrammatical pattern is generalized as "(result/inference/addition/ aim/contrast/manner/scope/text deixis adverbial) $\textit { \textbf { + I + } }$ (would/verb of intention) $^ +$ stance-related verb/ adjective/noun $^ +$ [object clause/nominal $^ +$ (complement/appositive clause)]".

Semantic-functional pattern (2) occurs 34 times $( 1 4 . 9 8 \% )$ and ranks second in frequency. The pattern functions as the parenthesis that is inserted into a main clause, as in the example sentence One reason, I sugest isthat the psychiris is the contemporary rite of abnormality. The "opinion-holding/riginating action" is mostly realised by stance-related verbs, but compared with those occurring in semantic-functional patern (1), the variety of verbs i this patten is much limite, consisting mostly of believe, claim, hope, maintain, think, and sugest. The mitigatort" would is occasionally found to preced the stance-related verb, while the \*tiatie" is not shown in this pattern. The lexico-grammatical pattern for semantic-functional pattern (2) is thus \*main clause, parenthess $\left\{ I + ( w o u l d ) + \right.$ stance verb}, main clause".

Semantic-functional pattern (3), with 16 instances $( 7 . 0 5 \% )$ , is the least common one, but not to be missed, for this function. It functions as the attributive clause with the \*topic specifier as its head noun, as in the example sentence This enterprise, which I term crustal mobility, was concemed with... The most frequent vers to perform the "opinion-holding/originating action' in the pattern are discoure act ver . all te interret) and the delexicalizd verb make. Only theiniative hinge" want ts found in this pattern, and it onlyoccurs with the head noun point, as in the sentence The point I want to make here is that .. The lexico-grammatical pattern can be summarized as \*head noun $^ +$ attributive clause((that/which) $+ \ I +$ discourse act verb/delexicalized verb $^ +$ (nominal) $^ +$ (adverbial)} $^ +$ main clause".

# 4.2.  Co-selection of functions and patterns of I

The local grammar analysis reflects the mappings or co-selections of functions, meanings, and patterns. To be more specific, the authorial tens to collocate with certain vers and to occur in certain lexico-grammatical patterns and semantic-functional patterns in order to realise particuar functios, and  pecific function aso promotes and retrct the use f  in cran pattens and with certain collocations. Co-selection underlying the use of I prevails into multiple levels and can be elaborated on from three aspects.

(1) Co-selection of lexis and lexis. The Sinclairian idiom principle accounts for the phraseological tendency, viewing language as essentially being made up of strings of co-selected words; in other words , the selection of one word restricts the selection of another. Our analyses accord with this view. For example, as shown in Table 4 above, when enacting the role of I s architect the authorial I in semantic-functional pattern (2) occurs mostly with discourse act verbs, occasionally with research act verbs, and hardly with cognition act verbs. For another example, despite the large number of stance-related verbs, the verbs that occur with the opinion-holder/originator I in semantic-functional pattern (2) are highly limited, consisting mostly of believe, claim, hope, maintain, think, and suggest (Table 7). Although the co-occurrences of I and its following verb are not ful formulaic, they represent preferred ways of achieving particular functions in academic writing. These tendencies for preferred combinatory behaviour of the authorial $I$ and its following verb reflect the co-selection between lexis and lexis: once $I$ is selected for a given function, its following verb is simultaneously constraint to a varying extent.

(2) Co-selection of lexis and grammar. Co-selection points to the integrity of lexis and grammar (Sinclair, 2006): a word has its preferred grammatical structure for making meaning, and a grammatical structure selects a limited range of lexical words for achieving a function. For example, \*(addition/aim/contrast/emphasis/manner/listing/ scope/result/inference adverbial) $+ I$ $^ +$ (verb of decision/intention) $^ +$ research act verb $^ +$ nominal $^ +$ (aim/method/scope/comparator/etc.)' is the most used to realise the function of recounting research proces (Table 6). The patern consists of lexical words (e.g. 1), grammatical categories (e.g. adverbial, verb), semantic categories (e.g. research act verb), and functional categories (e.g. aim/method/scope/comparator) so they are not purely grammatical or lexical. Patterns of this kind are the product of co-selection of lexis and grammar. It is argued that words in creating meaning naturally attract other words to their company, and the linear arrangement of words inevitably result in phraseologies that incorporate lexis and grammar. In other words, the linear arrangement of language entails the co-selection of lexis and lexis and the co-selection of lexis and grammar on the syntagmatic axis (Sinclair, 2006).

(3) Correspondence of formal elements and meaning elements in a local grammar. By identifying the semantic-functional pattern and the lexico-grammatical pattern of each $I { \big . }$ sentence, local grammar analyses help to establish the connection between meaning elements and formal elements. For example, in the analysis of I as architect, three main semantic-functional patterns have been identified: (1) "locator, architect $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ thing architected + (aim), (2) hinge $^ +$ architect $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ locator, thing architected'", and (3) "thing architected $^ +$ (hinge) $^ +$ architect $^ +$ architecting action $^ +$ locator'. The three semantic-functional patterns correspond to the three lexico-grammatical patterns, respectively: "text deixis/time/listing adverbial $+ I +$ (modal verb/verb of intention) $^ +$ verb of research/discourse/cognition act $^ +$ [nominal $^ +$ (to-inf)]/wh-clause", (2) ' ${ \cdot } a s + I +$ (n $\mathrm { 1 0 0 d a l v e r b ) + V }$ erb of discourse/research act $^ +$ text deixis/time adverbial $^ +$ main clause", and (3) "nominal $^ +$ attributive clause $\{ ( \mathrm { t h a t } ) + I + \mathbf { v }$ erb of discourse act $^ +$ text deixis adverbial} $^ +$ main clause' (Table 4). The high degree of correspondence between lexicogrammatical patterns and semantic-functional patterns suggests that the coselection between meaning elements and formal elements is highly possible for I-sentences to achieve a function in soft science articles. The mappings of formal elements and meaning elements in local grammar analyses also demonstrate that the relationship between form and meaning isfr from arbitrary. Each word occurs in a limited set of patterns, and words which share pattern also share meaning (Hunston & Sinclair, 2000). In other words, particular forms support or modify pertinent meanings, and particular meanings corrlate with and select certain forms. Conceived of in this way, it is argued that not the single word $I$ but I and its local grammar patterns (in terms of both lexico-grammatical patterns and semantic-functional patterns) are central in meaning creation. The exercise of local grammar analyses enables us to view text production as "not just the strings f co-occurring phraseological forms but also strings of discourse-semantic patterns" (Su & Zhang, 2019, p. 15), in so doing, local grammars help to establish a more transparent connection between form and meaning.

# 5. Conclusion

Based on the analysis of 696 authentic occurring instances of the authorial $I$ in soft science articles, this paper has examined the links between functions and patterns of I from the local grammar approach. The functions of I, in terms of the writer role enacted by I, are divided int four groups: I s achitect I s da analyser, I s recounter f rch proces, and I s opinon hoder/ignator. In the local grammar analyses of the four functions of I, we have generalized the semantic-functional patterns of $I$ to realise each function, the frequent lexico-grammatical patterns for each semantic-functional pattern, and the colocating verbs in each lexico-grammatical pattern.

This study has extended the local grammar analyse from starting from a function to starting from a restricted form, by making the case that local grammars can be explored to more fully describe the combinatory behaviour of the authorial $I .$ It has been illustrated that the local grammar approach is better at describing expressions of meaning, as it captures both the lexical-grammatical resources and their asociated discourse-semantic patterns, therey offering an inventory of linguistic strategies availablet language users to express secific meanings in communication (Su & Zhang, 2019, p. 1). The co-selection among patterns, meanings, and functions of I is going on at multiple levels: the co-selection of lexis and lexis, the coselection of lexis and grammar, and the co-selection of patterns and functions. Those co-selective relationships have provided strong evidence that form and meaning are inseparable from each other, and linguistic description should keep to the unity of form and meaning I inclair's words, there i ultimately no distinction between form and meaning' (Sinclair, 1991, p. 7).

The study has also found that, as a sign of strong authorial presence, the authorial $I$ is not absent from soft science writing. In contrast, the occurrenes f I re unnorable. However, the isue is not as simple as how frequently oft science writers should use I. As noted by Lee and Swales (2006: 57), \*what apprentice writers may be mostly missing is fine tuning of lexical and syntactic subtleties particularly in terms of thir strategic and rhetorical implications'. A knowledge of the strategic use of Iis thus of great value to apprentice writers as they must know, in the process of writing an articlefor publication, how to emphasize their personal contr. butions to their field of research and how to seek cooperation and stres solidarity with expectd readers and their disciplines" (Kuo, 1999, p. 136). Scrutiny of the local grammars of the authorial I captures more of the subtleties of the co-selection patterns of $I$ and provides detailed and contextualized insights into the lexico-grammatical and discourse-semantic constraints on the strategic use of $I .$ It is hoped that a beter understanding of the co-selection betwen functions and patterns of the authorial I ased on thistudy would help soft science novice writers to construct their authorial identity more strategically and effectively.

This article has identified the local grammars of the authorial in soft sciences in general, following the hard-soft distinction that "offer[s] useful way of examining gneral siilritis and differences between fields Hyland, 2004, p. 93). One factor which has not yet been considered in the analysis, but which may exert an influence on some of the results obtained here, is the possible inter- or intra-disciplinary variations in the use of I within soft sciences. Some of the findings may not be able to bring discipline specificity to self-mention resources, but ths article shows the diversity of approaches g. local grammar i this study to exploring the co-selection patterns of the authorial $I$ and contribute methodologically to the establishment of connections among form, meaning and function. Further research can investgate the local grammars of I in different soft science disciplines or in different types f research within a discipline (e.g. qualitative research versus quantitative research). In addition, the corpus used in this study is a comparable corpus of English research artices written by English and Chinese natie speakers. Following hs study, we also intend to explorethe differences and similarities in the use of I by L1 English and L1 Chinese writers in order to beter understand the complex interplay between national cultures and disciplinary cultures (Molino, 2010) regarding the use of I.
