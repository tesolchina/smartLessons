# Abstract

This paper considers the generic structure of Conclusion chapters in PhD theses or dissertations. From a corpus of $4 5 ~ \mathrm { P h D }$ theses covering a range of disciplines, chapters playing a concluding role were identified and analysed for their functional moves and steps. Most Conclusions were found to restate purpose, consolidate research space with a varied array of steps, recommend future research and cover practical applications, implications or recommendations. However a minority were found to focus more on the field than on the thesis itself. These field-oriented Conclusions tended to adopt a problem–solution text structure, or in one case, an argument structure. Variations in focus and structure between disciplines were also found.

# 1. Introduction

The genre analysis of academic writing has tended to focus on the research article (RA) far more than on longer theses and dissertations for research degrees (Bunton, 2002; Swales, 1990). Where Conclusions have been considered, it has usually been as part of the Discussion section of an RA or MSc dissertation (Dudley-Evans, 1986, 1994), the one exception being Yang and Allison’s (2003) study of the final sections of RAs in applied linguistics, where they found and analysed final sections called Conclusions and Pedagogic Implications. However, in a PhD thesis the Conclusion usually has the status of a separate chapter, as confirmed by Paltridge’s (2002) survey of guide books and actual practice, in which there is a Conclusions chapter in each of four thesis types he presents:

Traditional-simple and Traditional-complex (drawing on Thompson, 1999), Compilation of research articles (drawing on Dong, 1998) and Topic-based. However, there is a lack of published research on the actual structure of PhD Conclusions, the closest being Hewings’ (1993) analysis of six MBA Conclusions. This study, therefore, set out to discover what common, generic features PhD Conclusion chapters in a range of disciplines share and what variety they display.

The paper begins with a review of previous research into Discussions and Conclusions, describes the corpus of $4 5 ~ \mathrm { P h D }$ theses and methods of analysis, then presents the findings and proposes three models for Conclusions with some disciplinary variation.

# 2. Previous research

In one of the early studies of the research article, Hill, Soppelsa, and West (1982, pp. 335–338) categorised the “rhetorical divisions” of an experimental-research paper as Introduction, Procedure (Methods and Results) and Discussion. They suggested that the Introduction moves from the general to the particular, the Procedure then focuses on the particular, and the Discussion moves back as a ‘mirror image of the Introduction’ from the particular to the general: from ‘the solution of the problem that motivated the study to the implications of that solution for the larger field’. The conclusion of the Discussion which they analysed notes limitations of the study and suggests areas for future research. To paraphrase, Hill et al. typify the Discussion as comprising: ImplicationsoLimitationsoRecommendations.

Some of the most important work on Discussions has been done by Dudley-Evans. His work is particularly relevant to this study as it was carried out on the longer genre of the Masters dissertation, rather than the research article. His 1986 study of the Introduction and Discussion sections of seven MSc dissertations found three main parts to the Discussions: Introduction, Evaluation of results and Conclusions and future work. He identified 11 moves, modified in 1994 to nine moves, in the Evaluation of results: Information move, Statement of results, Finding, (Un)expected outcome, Reference to previous research, Explanation, Claim, Limitation and Recommendation. He noted that the moves were usually cyclical, with each cycle normally headed by a Statement of results, which was the only compulsory move, the others being optional. The Conclusions and future work part, the most relevant to this study, he found to contain:

Summary of main results Summary of main claims Recommendations about future work.

Even in this research on MSc dissertations, the Conclusion described is still a part of the Discussion section rather than a separate section or chapter.

Peng (1987), looking at chemical engineering research articles, found Discussion moves very similar to those of Dudley-Evans. She also found that the cycles were either at a higher level, answering research questions, or “at a lower level (dealing) with each separate step in the author’s argument.” (p. 94). Peng does make a short reference to a Conclusion section in which “deductions and implications of a wider nature are presented” (p. 112). Posteguillo’s (1999) study of Computer Science RAs analyses their final sections but does not distinguish between those called Discussion and those called Conclusion and the analysis is based on Dudley-Evans’ Discussion moves with the addition of Swales’ (1990) Deduction and hypothesis move.

Even in advice given to students, the distinction between Discussions and Conclusions is not always made. Swales and Feak (1994, p. 195), in a chapter on writing research papers (not dissertations/theses), state: “we will not distinguish between these two terms (discussion and conclusions) since the difference is largely conventional, depending on traditions in particular fields and journals.” They point out that Discussions are interpretive, dealing with points, in contrast to Results which are descriptive, dealing with facts. They propose three moves for Discussions, the first quite extensive, consolidating research space, and the other two quite short, dealing with implications and further research.

Another research-based book of advice to students, Weissberg and Buker (1990, pp. 160–162), makes a similar point about the Discussion/Conclusions distinction: the last section of the experimental research report, they write, is “usually titled discussion.(but) sometimes.is called conclusions.” They then summarise the content of a discussion as including first those elements most directly related to the study and later those focusing more generally on the importance of the study for other workers in the field. These later elements are:

Implications of the study Recommendations for future research and practical applications.

Nwogu’s (1997) analysis of the structure and functions of the medical research paper has no separate Conclusion section, but the final move in the Discussion section is Stating research conclusions, concerning further research rather than practical applications or generalisations.

One of the only studies that report on separate Conclusion sections in RAs is Yang and Allison (2003) as they set out to see how writers in applied linguistics move from results to conclusions. They found Conclusion sections in 13 of 20 such RAs $( 6 5 \% )$ on empirical research, and six final sections $( 3 0 \% )$ on Pedagogic Implications. The more frequent moves and steps they found in the Conclusion sections are set out in Table 1.

Finally, Hewings’ (1993) study of MBA dissertation Conclusions (which also included RAs) showed Reporting, Commenting (e.g., evaluations, deductions, speculations)

Table 1 Moves and steps in RA conclusion sections

and Suggesting functions which operate in four different domains: the world, previous research (literature), and the current study’s procedures or findings.

This review has shown that Discussions are more prominent in the literature than Conclusions. The Conclusion is usually seen as an alternative (and less common) name for the Discussion section of a research article, as the final part of the Discussion section of an MSc dissertation, or the final chapter of an MBA dissertation. None of the studies look at PhD thesis Conclusions.

The study from which this research grew (Bunton, 1998) found that the structural prominence of Discussions and Conclusions with the PhD theses is reversed: there was nearly always a final chapter with Conclusion(s) or Summary in the title but rarely a chapter with Discussion in the title. In that study, some theses had sections called Results and Discussion or Findings and Discussion, and some had sections called Conclusion(s) in most of their chapters. Those earlier Conclusion sections were all found to contain discussion (see Section 4.1).

A key question which this paper will set out to answer is what happens when the Conclusion becomes a chapter? Or to put it another way, if there has already been discussion in earlier chapters or sections, are there qualitative differences in the concluding chapter of a PhD thesis compared with the final part of an article or dissertation Discussion?

# 3. Method

This study expanded the original corpus of $1 3 \ \mathrm { P h D }$ theses in Bunton (1998) to 45, the same 45 theses as in the study of PhD Introductions reported in Bunton (2002). Theses were selected from departments and faculties across the University of Hong Kong (HKU) proportional to their PhD output, but with not more than four theses from any one department. The faculties represented (and the number of theses) were: Arts (3), Education (3), Social Sciences (7) Architecture (1), Engineering (10), Science (12), Medicine (6), Dental (1), plus the School of Business (1) and the Centre for Urban Planning & Environmental Management (1). Most of the thesis writers were Chinese speakers from Hong Kong or mainland China. However, 11 theses, nearly a quarter of the corpus, were written by non-Chinese research students, most of them native or near-native speakers of English from Western countries or the South Asian sub-continent. It should also be noted that about $40 \%$ of supervisors and $60 \%$ of the external examiners at the time were non-Chinese from other countries, indicating a strong influence of international academic conventions on the thesiswriting process at HKU.

One interest in the study was to see if there were disciplinary differences in the way Conclusion chapters were written. Swales’ (1981) study of RA Introductions selected them from three fields: (a) hard sciences, (b) the biology/medical field and (c) social sciences. Casanave and Hubbard (1992) separated their corpus into science and technology disciplines (ST), and humanities and social sciences (HSS). This study adopted the ST/HSS distinction for comparison purposes, with 30 theses coming from ST disciplines and 15 from HSS disciplines.

The first task was to identify the concluding chapters, but this was not as straightforward as one might expect. Analysis began with the final chapter of each of the 45 theses. However, in two cases it was found that the second last chapter was called “Conclusion(s)” and the final chapter was called “Recommendations” or “Future Work” respectively. As these are common section headings in other Conclusion chapters, the final two chapters of these two theses were analysed as if they were one chapter in two sections. Another thesis was in two parts with a Conclusion chapter to each part but no overall concluding chapter. In the same way, these two chapters were treated as if they were one chapter in two sections. Conversely, one thesis had no chapter that played any concluding role and so it was omitted from the analysis, other than to note that one of 45 PhD theses had no concluding chapter and to reduce the number of ST Conclusions to 29. Finally there were three cases in which the concluding role was found only in the final section of a longer final or penultimate chapter. In one case the final chapter, with a topic-specific title, covered a new area of the research, with the final section called “Conclusion” (the previous three chapters, by contrast, ended with sections called “Summary”). In the second case the final chapter was titled “Discussion” and was the first instance of discussion in the thesis; its final section was called “General discussion and future direction of study.” In the third case, there were only three chapters, Introduction, Discussion and Experimental, and the final section of the Discussion chapter was titled “Conclusion.” A check on RAs in this field (Chemistry) showed that it is common to have the method described in a final part of the article called ‘Experimental’ In these three cases the final section of the final or penultimate chapter was treated as the conclusion. This left a corpus of 44 thesis conclusions, 38 of them single chapters, three being two chapters, and three being the final section of a final or penultimate chapter. Nonetheless, in this paper I shall refer to them all as concluding chapters (or Conclusions) as this is their most common status.

Once the 44 Conclusions were identified, their titles, section headings and lengths were compared, as well as the number of references they make to previous research in the literature. The biggest task was to analyse the Conclusions for the generic moves and steps their authors make to achieve their purpose. Moves and steps already identified and described in the literature (particularly Dudley-Evans, 1994; Swales & Feak, 1994; Weissberg & Buker, 1990) were taken as the starting point for analysis, but where part of the text seemed to have a purpose different from anything already identified in the literature, a new move or step was proposed. As work progressed all Conclusions were re-analysed at least once to see whether they too contained moves or steps newly identified in other Conclusions. Finally, models of thesis Conclusions were proposed using the moves and steps usually present (i.e. in at least half the chapters) and those present in a quarter of them, with particular attention given to differences between the ST and HSS disciplines.

It should be noted that citations from certain theses do not contain keywords indicating the subject matter in order to respect a promise of anonymity given to writers in the original study. What is cited is thus the non-subject-specific language which, in fact, constitutes the linguistic signals of these moves and steps. Key lexical signals are given in bold.

# 4. Findings

This section will report the findings, first on the status and titles of concluding chapters, then on their length, number of references, section headings, and finally the generic moves and steps identified, proposing three models for thesis Conclusions

# 4.1. Status of concluding chapters

As we saw in the literature review, RA Conclusions have often been found to be the final part of a Discussion section, not constituting a section in their own right. If that is so, the structural status of Discussions and Conclusions is virtually reversed in PhD theses. Forty one of the 45 theses in this corpus have one or even two chapters that play a concluding role, although their titles vary considerably (see Table 2). Only six theses (all in ST disciplines) have chapters called “Discussion” that are not Conclusions, while nine more have “Discussion” in the title of the concluding chapter. It is more common for sections to be titled “Discussion”: 15 theses (12 in ST disciplines) had between two and six sections of chapters called “Discussion” or “Results and Discussion.” Twenty four of the 45 theses had no chapter or section with ‘Discussion’ in its title. Of course, discussion often takes place in chapters or sections with other, topic-specific titles. Analysis in the earlier study (Bunton, 1998) on 13 of these theses showed that discussion was taking place before the concluding chapter in all of those theses, only four of which had sections called “Discussion.”

# 4.2. Titles of concluding chapters

Titles are important as they give some idea of the role which the writer sees a chapter or section playing. The titles of concluding chapters were found to vary considerably. Only 24 of the 44 are called simply “Conclusion” or “Conclusions.” Two are called “Concluding Remarks.” Three, all in ST disciplines, are called ‘General Discussion’ to distinguish them from ‘Discussion’ sections elsewhere in those theses. One concluding chapter had a topic-specific title rather than a generic one but was found to play a concluding role. The other 16 concluding chapters had different titles that combined various elements that are often seen as part of a concluding role. They are all set out in Table 2.

Table 2 Titles of 44 PhD concluding chapters/sections   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Conclusion (13)</td><td>General discussion (3)</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusions (11)</td><td>General discussion and conclusions</td></tr><tr><td>Concluding remarks (2)</td><td>General discussion, implications and conclusions</td></tr><tr><td>General c&#x27;onclusion</td><td>General discussion and future direction of study</td></tr><tr><td>Concluding general discussion</td><td>Discussion</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusions and recommendations</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Conclusions and Implications</td><td>Summary Summary and conclusions</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusions and prospects</td><td>Summary and future research</td></tr><tr><td>Conclusion-discussion</td><td>General summary</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Topic-specific title</td></tr></table></body></html>

These varied titles indicate six major roles that the writers see a conclusion playing:

† Summarising thesis findings   
† Discussing the findings more broadly than in earlier chapters † Coming to conclusions (more generalised than findings) † Giving implications of findings   
† Making recommendations   
Suggesting areas of future research.

# 4.3. Length

The lengths of the 44 thesis Conclusions ranged from 2 to 38 pages, averaging 9.2 pages. There was a marked difference, however, between those in ST disciplines and those in HSS disciplines. ST conclusions averaged 4.9 pages, while HSS conclusions averaged 17.2 pages.

# 4.4. References

The number of references to other authors in a thesis Conclusion is of interest as it gives some indication of how much the conclusion refers back to previous research in summing up the findings and significance of the thesis and in making recommendations for further research. When this is expressed as a percentage of the number of references in the thesis as a whole, it gives an indication of the importance of the concluding chapter compared with other chapters in positioning the research study in relation to the literature. In these 44 thesis Conclusions, the number of references to the literature ranged from nil to 112, averaging 21.0. There was again a marked difference between ST Conclusions, which averaged 16.6 references (or $3 . 7 \%$ of the total number of references in the thesis) and HSS Conclusions which averaged 29.2 references (or $6 . 0 \%$ of total references).

Compared with other chapters in the thesis, all but two ST Conclusions had the lowest or second lowest number of references. This was also true for nine of the $1 5 \ \mathrm { H S S }$ Conclusions, indicating that reference to previous research may play a relatively small role in most thesis conclusions, especially in the ST theses. On the other hand, it could be argued that where there has been an extensive literature review, it may only be necessary to refer to a few key studies in order to place the current research in context and show its significance. By contrast, two HSS Conclusions had the second highest number of references in the thesis, one in Education, the other in Architecture.

# 4.5. Section headings

Section headings are also helpful in showing what the writer is hoping to accomplish in different parts of the chapter, the moves the writer has in mind. However, slightly more than half of the concluding chapters (23 of 44) were not divided into sections (especially in ST disciplines). The 21 that did have sections had between two and eight sections, the ST Conclusions with sections averaging 2.5 sections each and the HSS Conclusions with sections averaging 5.2 sections each.

Table 3 Keywords in generic section headings in 12 ST PhD conclusions   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Present more than once</td><td>Present only once.</td></tr><tr><td>1st section heading</td><td>1st section heading</td></tr><tr><td>Summary (2)</td><td>Contributions</td></tr><tr><td>Discussion (2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Conclusion(s) (5)</td><td>Intermediate section heading</td></tr><tr><td>Intermediate section heading</td><td>Methodological aspects Limitations</td></tr><tr><td>Recommendations (2)</td><td>Implications</td></tr><tr><td>Final section heading</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Future work (4)</td><td>Final section heading. Future directions</td></tr><tr><td>Future/further research (3)</td><td>Further studies</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Epilogue</td></tr></table></body></html>

The vast majority of section headings were generic ones indicating the function of the section, but where there were topic-specific headings there were usually between two and five of them, more often in HSS disciplines.

ST thesis writers seemed to have two main moves in mind: one presenting conclusions about the present study and the other concerning future work. Keywords from their section headings are presented in Table 3.

The HSS concluding chapters, which we have seen were generally longer and had more sections when sections were present, had more varied patterns of headings, including research questions, implications and theory (see Table 4). In one case, the four topicspecific section headings were the thesis’ research questions.

# 4.6. Two types of concluding chapter

Analysis of the moves and steps in concluding chapters soon indicated that while most Conclusions focussed mainly on the thesis itself, beginning with a restatement of purpose and a summary of findings and claims, a minority of Conclusions focussed mainly on the field and only mentioned the thesis and its findings or contributions in the context of the whole field. This difference affected the move structure of the chapters. I have classified the two types of Conclusion as thesis-oriented and field-oriented. There were eight fieldoriented Conclusions: four in ST disciplines and four in HSS areas, the other 36 being thesis-oriented Conclusions.

# 4.7. Thesis-oriented conclusions

It should be noted that this paper adopts a 2-level Move and Step analysis (as in Swales, 1990), where a number of the Steps correspond, as Yang and Allison (2003, p. 377) point out, to the “more narrowly specified Moves” in Dudley-Evans’ (1994) analyses. Yang and Allison show the difference in this way: “The concept of Move captures the function and purpose of a segment of text at a more general level, while Step spells out more specifically the rhetorical means of realizing the function of the Move” (p. 370).

# 4.7.1. Introductory restatement

Most thesis-oriented Conclusions were found to begin with a distinctive move that restates the overall issue being researched. In the HSS Conclusions it tended to be the purpose, research questions or hypotheses that were restated. The ST Conclusions tended to restate the work carried out, to use a term from Dudley-Evans’ (1986) analysis of MSc dissertation Introductions. It was decided that such an opening constituted an Introductory Restatement (IR) move, and it occurred in 34 of the 36 thesis-oriented Conclusions.

This move is relatively easy to identify, appearing at the beginning. A typical restatement of territory, niche and work carried out is as follows, citing the beginning and end of the first paragraph of the concluding chapter:

Although the X of As has been extensively studied in the past few decades, the X of ABs has remained relatively unexplored...In this work, the X, Y and Z of ABCs and ABDs have been presented and discussed in detail. (ST1)

# 4.7.2. Consolidation of research space

The largest part of most thesis-oriented concluding chapters was taken up with summarising methods, results/findings and claims, with references to previous research. The nature of this important move is best captured in Swales and Feak’s (1994) term, Consolidate your research space. This main move in a concluding chapter, Consolidation of research space (C), occurs in all 36 thesis-oriented Conclusions.

# 4.7.3. Recommendations

Towards the end of most thesis-oriented Conclusions were one or two moves that stood out as going beyond the present research and linking it to the wider world and/or to future research. Writers often signalled them with headings such as “Future Work,” “Future Research,” “Recommendations” or “Implications.” However, the term recommendations is used with two different meanings in this corpus and in the literature. It is most frequently used in the literature for future research (e.g., Dudley-Evans, 1986, 1994), but is also used by Weissberg and Buker (1990) in connection with practical applications as well as future research. This duality is illustrated by a section headed “Recommendations” in one ST Conclusion and including three recommendations for research directions, then in the next paragraph, three more regarding social measures that should be taken in view of the research findings. There were clearly two different kinds of recommendation being made in this thesis and in the corpus as a whole, so it was decided to differentiate them as two separate moves:

† Practical Applications, Implications or Recommendations (P) when it concerns realworld uses for the research or advice for real-world situations springing from the findings, and   
Recommendations for Future Research (FR) when the move indicates further avenues for research.

ST Conclusions more often made Recommendations for Future Research as a distinctive move, while HSS Conclusions more often had a distinctive move about Practical Applications, Implications or Recommendations. However, brief recommendations of either kind were also found embedded in other moves, particularly the Consolidation move.

# 4.7.4. Recommendations for future research

Typical Recommendations for Future Research moves from ST and HSS Conclusions respectively begin as follows:

This method certainly merits further investigation especially in problems involving a lot of unknowns, such as the following:. (ST5)

The findings of this research study provide the following insights for future research:. (HSS11)

4.7.5. Practical applications, implications and recommendations

Two of the Conclusions in the Social Sciences had sections called “Policy Recommendations” and six of the Conclusions found to be making practical recommendations used the words “recommend” or “recommendation.” Such recommendations also tended to use strong modal verbs such as “should” or “must” or other words such as “vital,” “essential” or “necessity.”

Moves or steps classified here as Practical Implications, on the other hand, tended to use weaker modals such as “can,” “could,” “may,” or “might” or a less certain verb such as “hope.” The term “implications” was also found to be used in two ways, one HSS Conclusion indicating the difference very clearly with one section headed “Practical Implications” and containing a number of Findings, Claims and Practical implications and another headed “Theoretical Implications” and containing mainly Findings, Claims and Theory steps.

The distinction between real world implications and theoretical implications is not made clearly in the literature. Weissberg and Buker (1990, p. 162) refer to “implications of the study (generalizations from the results)” and Peng refers to “deductions and implications of a wider nature” (1987, p. 112), while Swales and Feak (1994) say that Discussions should be:

more theoretical, or more abstract, or more general, or more integrated with the field, or more connected to the real world, or more concerned with implications or applications, and if possible some combination of these. (p. 196)

Analysis of this corpus indicates that Practical implications and applications (i.e., connected to the real world) have a greater prominence in thesis Conclusions than the literature has suggested.

Practical Applications are more common in ST Conclusions than in HSS ones. Writers are much more direct (without need for modals) either because the application has already been made, for example:

The understanding gained from this research has provided an input to the XY (industry). (ST4)

or because the writer is more certain that the application will be made, for example:

D is used as an E indicator, which is intended for applications in G and H (establishments). (ST7)

Writers in the Humanities and Social Sciences on the other hand convey a sense of exhortation as they are often relying on a broader range of individuals and organisations in society to carry out their recommendations or heed their implications. This is done with the use of modality to say that something should be done in the real world, for example:

An implication of these findings is that both B and C should be taken into account on evaluating a D. (HSS10)

Practical Applications, Implications or Recommendations moves appear earlier than Recommendations for Future Research moves by a margin of eight to three. They also appear as steps embedded in the Consolidation move, to connect different parts of the research to real world uses or situations, more often than Future Research steps.

Table 5 gives an overview of the number and proportion of ST and HSS thesis-oriented Conclusions containing these moves. As can be seen there, there was occasionally a Concluding Restatement move, which reiterated overall findings and claims, rather than purpose.

Table 5 Moves found in thesis-oriented PhD conclusions

The moves, in 30 of the 36 thesis-oriented Conclusions, appeared in a single progression, typically $\mathrm { I R } \wedge \mathrm { C } \wedge \mathrm { P } \wedge \mathrm { F R }$ . Only in six cases was there any cycle of recurring moves, for example, ${ \mathrm { I R } } \wedge { \mathrm { C } } \wedge { \mathrm { P } } \wedge { \mathrm { C } } \wedge { \mathrm { F R } }$ . In this sense, the move structure of these Conclusions is more straightforward than that of the Introductions to the same 45 theses, where only three showed a single progression of the moves (Establishing a Territory, Establishing a Niche and Occupying the Niche); with the number of move cycles in Introductions averaging 5.5 (Bunton, 2002).

# 4.8. Different ST and HSS models for thesis-oriented conclusions

In contrast to the moves, which mostly occurred in a single progression, the steps within the moves often occurred in multiple cycles, particularly in the Consolidation move:

† One HSS Consolidation move reported 105 Findings, made 23 Claims, and 38 References to previous research, with many cycles of FindingoClaimoReference; † One ST Consolidation move had 31 Findings, 22 Claims and 52 References to previous research.

From the data on frequency and distribution of the various moves and steps in ST and HSS thesis-oriented Conclusions, it is possible to propose two different models with the moves and steps that occur in at least half of the ST and HSS thesis-oriented Conclusions respectively, plus an additional record of moves and steps that occur in at least a quarter of the respective Conclusions. The frequency of these moves and steps is also recorded as the number of occurrences divided by the number of Conclusions being analysed (in this case, $2 5 \ \mathrm { S T }$ and 11 HSS).

As can be seen in Tables 6 and 7, three moves are usually present in both models, the first two being Introductory Restatement and Consolidation. They differ in their final move, ST concluding chapters usually finishing on Future Research while HSS concluding chapters more often have a Practical Implications and Recommendations move.

We have already noted that the ST Introductory Restatement usually focuses on work carried out while HSS ones more often focus on purpose, research questions or hypotheses. In both models the Consolidation move includes summaries of method, findings/results and claims as well as making references to previous research. However, the ST Consolidations also report on products of the research (see next section), in some cases evaluating them as well. While only $36 \%$ of the ST thesis-oriented Conclusions had a distinct Practical Applications and Recommendations move, another $28 \%$ had such applications or recommendations embedded in the Consolidation or Future Research move. Conversely, only $36 \%$ of HSS thesis-oriented Conclusions had a distinct Recommendations for Future Research move, but another $36 \%$ embedded such recommendations in the Consolidation move or in Practical Implications and Recommendations.

# 4.9. Distinctive steps

This section will discuss more fully some of the steps in concluding chapters which are not adequately accounted for in the literature on Discussions.

# 4.9.1. Method

Methods had greater prominence in these concluding chapters than the Discussion literature would suggest. Only Dudley-Evans (1994, p. 225) mentions methods in his moves for Discussions and this is always in a less prominent sense, as an aspect of another move: in Information moves (giving background on theory, aims, methods or previous research), in Limitations (giving caveats about findings, methods or claims), and in Recommendations (for future research or methods). Methods were particularly prominent as steps in the Consolidation move of 20 of the $2 5 \mathrm { { S T } }$ thesis-oriented concluding chapters, and in six of the 11 HSS ones. Method steps were also found in five of the eight fieldoriented Conclusions. A typical example is as follows:

The X and Y variations of A are studied by B and C models. Computed results of the B model indicate that.The C model demonstrates that. (ST4)

# 4.9.2. Product

More than half the ST theses have a strong product orientation (14 of the 25 thesisoriented Consolidation moves). For example, in three different paragraphs of the same concluding chapter:

A set of Q functions is developed and adopted as.A new R method is developed and applied to.S functions are employed .for the development of a new T technique. (ST6)

In cases like this one, the method is treated as a product and is then evaluated as such.

# 4.9.3. Evaluation of method or product

In nearly half of the thesis-oriented Conclusions (17 of 36) an evaluative step was found which related directly to Method and/or Product steps. For example, a positive evaluation of a product:

Based on the D experiments, an E model has been formulated.Predictions of the model can greatly assist in the effective planning of Gs. (ST4)

or a negative evaluation of one method followed by a positive evaluation of another method:

Although results obtained from the H functions are not satisfactory, good results are obtained from the use of J functions. (ST5)

Evaluation also plays a key role in field-oriented Conclusions, appearing in all but one as part of the Situation–Problem–Solution–Evaluation text structure (see Table 8).

# 4.9.4. Theory

This step occurs when a writer mentions a theory in support of a method or findings, usually without citing any author or publication. It occurs in thirteen of the concluding chapters, proportionally more in HSS disciplines, for example:

No B assumptions are imposed and CD theory is adopted. (ST6)

This is in line with the notion of XY. (HSS12)

# 4.9.5. Caution or warning

This step occurs in eight Conclusions, all but one in HSS areas. It usually occurs with Practical Implications or Recommendations and warns or cautions about what may happen if the writer’s advice arising out of the implication is not heeded. This example is from the last two sentences of a thesis:

The alternative of not (doing this) has been expressed by J: “.”. This surely is a situation that none of us would like to see (4559).

# 4.9.6. References to previous research

This step, of course, is commonly mentioned in the literature, but rather than Dudley-Evans’ (1994) category for references that compare results with previous research, it seemed more useful to identify references that either support or contrast results or findings with previous research. This study, therefore, made a distinction between supportive and contrastive references to previous research. HSS writers made 187 supportive references to previous research and 34 contrastive references, while the ST writers made 129 supportive references to previous research and 11 contrastive ones.

Proportionally contrastive references were about twice as frequent in HSS Conclusions as in ST Conclusions $( 1 5 \mathrm { - } 7 \% )$ .

A further category was also identified, where the reference to previous research adds to the background before results are given or claims/explanations are made. These were more common in ST Conclusions (26 instances) and rare in HSS Conclusions with only two instances.

# 4.10. Field-oriented conclusions

Having considered thesis-oriented Conclusions, the majority in this corpus, we shall now consider the eight field-oriented Conclusions. As mentioned in Section 4.6, these Conclusions focussed mainly on the field rather than on the thesis or the specific research study itself. Seven of the eight were characterised by a Problem–Solution–Evaluation structure (e.g., Hoey, 1983) in their approach to issues in the field. The eighth, in the field of Literature in English, followed an argument structure of Claim–Counterclaim– Justification (e.g., Jordan, 1984). Following is an example of a Problem–Solution– Evaluation cycle in a field-oriented ST concluding chapter:

In some A regions, the peaks of the Bs are too close PROBLEM together and are completely unresolved. This   
intruduces error in the final determined Cs.   
Obviously this handicap can be solved if one can study SOLUTION A one B at a time   
However, the Bs are extremely expensive... NEG EVAL Instead, the DF-meter can be integrated into the SOLUTION B GF-meter to separate the Bs in real time. (ST3) (POS EVAL)

There is an implied positive evaluation in the last sentence, especially as it is the last sentence of the chapter and thesis.

Five of the eight field-oriented Conclusions fully integrate a wide range of moves and steps with the focus always on the field, while three, after a substantial section on the Field, move on to one or two of the moves already identified in thesis-oriented Conclusions. Those three could be considered to have these moves:

FieldoConsolidation FieldoPractical RecommendationsoConsolidation FieldoRestatementoFuture Research

To illustrate the transition from field- to thesis-orientation, the 5-page chapter characterised above as FieldoConsolidation begins with three-and-a-half pages summarising the world-situation in this field with a Situation–Problem–Solution– Evaluation structure, with only one reference to the purpose and approach of the thesis, culminating with Hong Kong’s unique situation in this regard with further Problem– Solution analysis. Only in the final page-and-a-half does the focus change, signalled with the words: “Through examining Hong Kong’s X characteristics with regard to the Y criteria, we have shown that.” (HSS42).

A summary of the steps found in at least a quarter of the field-oriented Conclusions, together with their frequencies, is presented in Table 8.

# 5. Conclusion

This paper has indicated that the generic structure of the Conclusion chapter of a PhD thesis differs qualitatively from the final part of a Discussion section in a research article or masters dissertation, displaying a wider range of moves and steps Concluding chapters showed some disciplinary variation between science and technology disciplines and those in the humanities and social sciences. HSS Conclusions tend to be longer and have more sections than ST ones. ST Conclusions often had a smaller number of higher-level cycles, concentrating on broader results and claims, while HSS ones more often had a large number of lower-level cycles focusing on individual findings and claims. There was a greater emphasis on future research in ST Conclusions and just under half refer to Practical Applications which the writers see being put to immediate use in their field. HSS Conclusions more often have Practical Implications and Recommendations which the writers exhort others in the wider world to heed.

A few of the concluding chapters did not fit this pattern. They focussed more on the field as a whole than on the thesis itself, mostly adopting a Problem–Solution text structure, although one had an argument structure. More research is needed on fieldoriented Conclusions, particularly ones with an argument structure before a model for that can be proposed.

Given the lack of differentiation in thesis-writing guide books between Discussions and Conclusions, the provision of research-based models could be of real value to PhD students and their supervisors. As noted in Bunton (2002, pp. 73–74), supervisors “will be more able than their students to see what variations are conventional in their particular fields” and so use the model as “a pedagogical framework around which they build the knowledge they already have, intuitively if not explicitly expressed, about the way research is presented in their disciplines.”
