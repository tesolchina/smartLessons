# Doing a Master’s dissertation in TESOL and applied linguistics, Lindy Woodrow (Ed.). Routledge, London and New York (2020). 243(e-copy), ISBN: 978-0-429-50406-8.

Writing a dissertation is a challenging undertaking for most Master’s students, since it is the first time they will design, conduct, present, and disseminate an empirical study. As a recent graduate in applied linguistics, I experienced confusion at every stage of my dissertation and faced anxiety due to my many queries; for example, about which section of the dissertation I should write up first. My confusion and lack of certainty began with the task of choosing a research topic, and continued until after submission, since I was not sure about how the assessment process worked. The vast majority of guidebooks on dissertation writing focus on how to write different parts of dissertations such as the organization of each chapter of the dissertation (e.g., Bitchener, 2009) or focus on how to write a particular type of research (e.g., Woodrow, 2014); however, few provide inexperienced researchers such as myself with a visible representation of how the dissertation project proceeds, stage by stage. In responding to this need, Lindy Woodrow’s book is a valuable addition to existing reference texts on dissertation writing.

The book comprises 16 chapters. Chapter 1 provides general information of the processes involved in completing a Master’s dissertation. Part I (Chapters 2e6) helps readers develop a framework for the dissertation (e.g., possible approaches to decide the research topic, ways to identify literature sources, possible choices of methodological approaches, research proposal writing procedures, and how supervision is likely to operate). Part II (Chapters 7e8) describes the practical procedures involved in conducting research, including data collection and analysis for both qualitative and quantitative studies. Part III (Chapters 9e13) presents how each section of the dissertation (i.e., literature review, methodology, results and discussion, and other sections) is developed. Part III not only illustrates the organization of each section, but also attaches importance to advancing readers’ awareness of academic writing. Part IV (Chapters 14e15) provides information and advice to address writing tasks other than the main body of the dissertation (e.g., abstract, acknowledgments) and about the examination process for a dissertation. Part IV also provides students with ideas about possibilities of what could be done after examination such as publishing a journal article, or giving conference presentations. Chapter 16 lists numerous resources to assist dissertation writing, such as sources for the literature review, examples of abstracts, guidelines for dissertation writing and research proposal writing, and handbooks in TESOL and applied linguistics.

This book is easy to follow in terms of both its structure and content. Each chapter follows a similar format, beginning with a brief introduction of the chapter and ending with a summary, common mistakes, frequently asked questions, further reading recommendations, and references. Woodrow’s writing style is accessible, and the content in each sub-section is concise, which reduces the reading load for Master’s students who are novice researchers and may also be L2 language learners. The consistent structure and presentation of each chapter helps readers to quickly locate the information they need.

I found the tasks that accompany the presentation of each sub-section across chapters very useful. For example, Task 9.2 guides students in how to develop an appropriate outline of their dissertation by focusing on three coherent questions (i.e., the requirements of the organization of the dissertation in the department, common structures in completed dissertations, and the organization of the student’s own dissertation). This helps students to develop insights into their dissertation as they try to work out the answers to questions in the task boxes, which facilitates their learning. More importantly, the book not only helps students to write their dissertations, but it also nurtures the development of academic thinking through question-asking and investigating. It reminds me of the proverb: ‘Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime’. According to my personal experience as a Master’s and doctoral student in applied linguistics, learning how to think like a researcher is a major goal of the Master’s dissertation.

Another highlight of this book is the provision of figures and tables to demonstrate examples of dissertation writing. Woodrow employs authentic examples extracted or summarized from previous dissertations as instruments for elaborating ideas. For example, after justifying the need to write a research diary, the author first provides Fig. 8.1 to illustrate the main components of a research diary, followed by an authentic example. More importantly, Woodrow considers possible variations for organising the sub-sections of the dissertation. For example, she provides three possible organization approaches of the methodology chapter in Fig. 11.1e11.3 by referring to three recently completed and authentic dissertations. In this way, she creates a virtual scaffolding context for Master’s students by posing questions in task boxes to arouse students’ attention (e.g., Task 10.2), providing authentic examples to these questions through tables and figures as instructional instruments (e.g., Fig. 10.1e10.4), and re-visiting these questions in new task boxes to stimulate students’ thinking about their own dissertation (e.g., Task 10.3).

Another thing I appreciated about the book is the author’s thoughtful consideration of the unforeseen situations that may arise during data collection. Woodrow discusses the possibilities of some unexpected situations while collecting data, including not getting permission to access participants, not receiving responses from participants, not preparing enough materials, not gaining access to adequate research sites, managing participant lateness or absences, and difficulties with recording devices. She also makes suggestions for how to deal with these unforeseen circumstances, especially those that may threaten the quality of the study. For example, regarding not receiving responses from participants, the author suggests that the students recruit more participants than are needed, and remain flexible about rescheduling interviews or turning to alternative approaches to face-to-face interviews such as email or online interviews. Recalling my experiences of collecting data from 53 participants for my doctoral thesis, I found this section particularly useful for Master’s students who have to collect data for the first time, because they are, like I was at that time, inexperienced in envisaging the unexpected disorder during data collection, in mentally preparing for unforeseen challenges, and in strategies for responding to these difficulties. The book prepares inexperienced researchers to be aware of the possibilities of unforeseen circumstances, and to plan ahead.

The book is, however, not without its minor shortcomings. First, some difficult but important ideas of dissertation writing are not elaborated, but are simply introduced in a general and brief way. For example, the author provides an example of synthesizing sources in the literature review (p. 126), but does not explain when and how students should approach this difficult task, and introduces the two methods of citing (i.e., information-led, and author-led) to the students with the support of examples, but does not explain when it would be appropriate to use each variant. It would make this book more useful for target readers if it either provided more accounts of difficult concepts or resources for further reading on these concepts. Second, the section of the common mistakes in each chapter highlights errors that usually appear in each section of dissertation writing by simply listing them. It would have been more helpful to have added some basic information about these mistakes, together with one or two typical examples.

These minor weaknesses do not undermine the great value of this book as a comprehensive and practical guidebook for inexperienced researchers. When I read this book chapter by chapter and recalled my experiences of my own Master’s research, this book would have made my dissertation writing more manageable, its goals more visible, and its difficulties more able to be prepared for. This book might not be of interest to experienced researchers, but is primarily a valuable reference book for Master’s students who need to write a dissertation in the field of TESOL or applied linguistics.
