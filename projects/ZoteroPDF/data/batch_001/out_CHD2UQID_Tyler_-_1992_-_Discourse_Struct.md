# APPENDIX

# Evaluation of Teaching Assistants

After you watch the video tapes of various teaching assistants, you will be asked to rate them. Some are native speakers; some are nonnative speakers. We want to know whether they were easy or difficult to understand. Pay attention to the way they explain as well as the way they actually speak. You will be asked to rate their pronunciation, grammar, fuency, vocabulary. and their ability to handle questions and present information clearly. If you think that there are virtually no problems in the speaker's presentation in a given category, you should give him or her a score of 3.

For each speaker, please record your response on the answer sheet provided

# Discourse Structure and the Perception of Incoherence in International Teaching Assistants’ Spoken Discourse

ANDREA TYLER University of Florida

Work by discourse analysts shows that listeners’ interpretation of discourse is determined not only by a speaker’s pronunciation and grammar but also by discourse-level patterns of language use. To date, relatively little is known about the discourse-level patterns typically found in the English of nonnative speakers, how they diverge from discourse produced by native speakers, or how differences in nonnative discourse patterns affect native English listeners’ understanding of the discourse. Using a qualitative discourse-analytic framework, this paper compares the planned spoken English of a native speaker of Chinese whose English discourse was perceived by native speakers of English as difficult to follow with that of a native speaker of U.S. English. The analyses reveal a variety of differences in the use of discourse structuring devices, specifically in the areas of lexical discourse markers, lexical specificity, and syntactic incorporation. It is argued that these differences in discourse-level patterns interfere with the listeners’ ability to construct a coherent interpretation of the Chinese speaker’s discourse.

English proficiency of international teaching assistants (ITAs) in U.S. universities. These ITAs are advanced learners of English who have scored high enough on the TOEFL and GRE to be admitted to their respective universities but who nevertheless often have difficulty communicating effectively with their English-speaking students. For those working with such advanced learners, a persistent question is just what aspects of the ITA’s oral production interfere with their listeners’ ability to understand the intended message. Work in discourse analysis (e.g., Green, 1989; Gumperz, 1982a; Hatch, 1992) has established that the listener’s understanding is affected not only by pronunciation and grammar but also discourse-level patterns of language use. It seems clear that an important step in effectively addressing the “foreign TA problem” is a more accurate understanding of how the presence and/ or absence of particular discourse-level patterns in ITA speech may affect the native listener’s ongoing interpretation of the discourse. Recent pedagogical work has recognized that use of discourse structuring cues affects comprehensibility (Davies, Tyler, & Koran, 1989; Pica, Barnes, & Finger, 1990). For instance, Pica et al. (1990) encourage ITAs to attend to discourse structuring cues in order to improve the comprehensibility of their spoken discourse. However, studies aimed at identifying these discourse structuring cues and how they may affect native listener understanding are few (Bardovi-Harlig & Hartford, 1989; Tyler, 1988; Tyler, Jefferies, & Davies, 1988). This paper reports on a qualitative discourse analysis the purpose of which is to begin to identify those elements.

# PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Research on U.S. English speakers’ discourse in an academic setting (Biber, 1988; Chafe, 1982; Danielewicz, 1984; Griffin& Mehan, 1979) indicates that native-speaker speech contains a number of devices that orient the listener to the relative importance of the ideas within a discourse and simultaneously convey the interrelationships among those ideas. Some of the discourse structuring cues which have been identified are lexical discourse markers, patterns of repetition, prosody, anaphora (e.g., patterns of ellipsis and pronominalization including demonstrative pronouns), and use of syntactic incorporation (hypotactic constructions) versus use of simple clauses conjoined by coordinating conjunctions (paratactic constructions). These information structuring devices provide native listeners with a set of cues which facilitates their construction of a coherent interpretation of the discourse. Among other things, discourse structuring cues often signal logical and prominence relations among the ideas being expressed.

Work in contrastive discourse analysis demonstrates that languages vary in their use of information structuring cues, distributing the signaling load differently among various levels of linguistic structure (Connor & Kaplan, 1987; Gumperz, 1982b; Li & Thompson, 1981; Scollon & Scollon, 1981). Thus, a potential source of cross-linguistic/ cross-cultural miscommunication is the failure of the speaker to use information structuring cues in ways that match the listener’s expectations. To date, we have little information about how ITAs use these cues in their English speech.

Some of the information structuring cues identified in native English speakers’ discourse have been investigated in an L2 context. Chaudron (1983) examined effects of repetition, conditionals, and synonyms on

L2 listeners’ recall and recognition of topic restatements. Chaudron and Richards (1986) examined the effect of manipulating macrolevel organizational phrases (those which give information about the global structure of the discourse) and microlevel discourse markers (those which give information concerning more local, intersentential relations) on L2 listeners’ comprehension of English lectures. Both these studies provide important information about the effects of repetition, synonyms, and lexical discourse markers on L2 listeners’ comprehension. However, they do not provide information on L2 speakers’ production of these cues. The present study investigates L2 speakers’ production of several discourse structuring cues in comparison to native speakers’ production and presents a qualitative analysis of the potential effects of these discourse-level patterns on native English listeners.

A range of problems in lTAs’ production of discourse has been noted over the years (Bailey, 1983, 1984a, 1984b; Hinofotis & Bailey, 1980; Sadow & Maxwell, 1983; Tyler, 1988; Tyler, Jefferies, & Davies, 1988). For instance, Hinofotis and Bailey (1980) examined the effects of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and speech flow on undergraduates’ ratings of videotaped samples of $\mathrm { I T A s } ^ { \prime }$ discourse. Bailey (1983) found a significant correlation between ratings by undergraduates and ITAs’ level of oral proficiency; ITAs who scored $^ { 1 + }$ or lower on the FSI (Foreign Service Institute) oral interview tended to receive lower ratings for teaching. Of course, a rating of $1 + \mathrm { o n }$ the FS1 oral interview indicates a variety of problems with grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Tyler (1988) and Tyler et al. (1988) examined the discourse of Chinese and Korean ITAs whose speech had been judged as difficult to follow and found that these speakers used lexical discourse markers (both macro and micro) in nonnativelike ways, rarely used relative clauses and other forms of syntactic incorporation, and had nonnativelike prosodic patterns.

Although several of the problems identified in these studies overlap with elements examined here, the orientation differs in important ways. Most of the previous work on ITAs’ discourse has tended to quantify grammatical errors and examine the relationship between number of errors and ratings of teaching effectiveness. The present study differs from earlier work in its attempt to clarify how the presence (or absence) of particular linguistic patterns affects an ongoing interpretation of the discourse. This analysis is not concerned with grammatical or pronunciation errors in general; rather, the analysis specifically focuses on aspects of the linguistic code which signal logical and prominence relationships. For instance, the only pronunciation-related aspect considered is the function of prosody as a discourse structuring device. Many of the problems noted in this analysis are not technically errors or would not be perceived as errors if the sentence were considered in isolation, for example, the employment of a series of independent clauses conjoined by coordinating conjunctions versus employment of syntactic incorporation. Thus, the analysis examines the effects of certain elements of the linguistic code overlooked in past analyses.

# METHOD

# Procedure

The current study presents a qualitative discourse analysis of the planned spoken English discourse of one Chinese graduate student, following the methodology developed by Gumperz, Jupp, and Roberts (1979) and Gumperz (1982a, 1982b) in their studies of interethnic miscommunication. The methodology uses data from (a) the text of the discourse in question, (b) information concerning speaker intent gathered through discussions with the speaker, and (c) information gathered from native speakers of English acting as audience. This discourse is then compared to the discourse produced under similar circumstances by a native speaker of U.S. English.

The analysis takes as its basic framework the theory of conversational inference articulated by Gumperz (1982a, 1982b): Participants in a linguistic exchange depend on a complex constellation of cues from all levels of linguistic structure to construct an ongoing interpretation of the discourse. Within a given context, listeners expect a constrained pattern of cues to help guide them through the discourse. When these discourse expectations are violated, communication problems arise.

# The Speakers

Both speakers involved in the study were members of training classes for prospective TAs. As part of the regular course work, speakers were asked to prepare and give a brief introductory lecture on a topic in their area of specialization aimed at an undergraduate class of native speakers of U.S. English. The presenters were instructed to keep in mind that the listeners would not be experts in the presenter’s field. Neither speaker had any previous university teaching experience. The lectures were videotaped.

# The Experimental Audience

In order to obtain judgments concerning the comprehensibility of the two texts which were not influenced by nonnativelike pronunciation or knowledge that the discourse was produced by a nonnative speaker, it was decided to present the two texts to a new audience using a method which removed nonnativelike pronunciation. Therefore, a transcript of each of the two lectures was read by a native speaker of English to 15 native speakers of U.S. English who were graduate students in linguistics. These native speakers were asked to listen to the texts as if they were class lectures and take notes on the material. In addition, they were asked to describe their overall impression of the lectures. They were not informed about the language background of the original speakers. The listeners did not read any background material pertaining to either of the lectures.

A persistent problem in ITA studies and training programs is lack of access to audiences which match the background knowledge and motivation of students in an ongoing class. Many ITA programs attempt an approximation, as in the present study, by using two or three native-English-speaking students as audience members. Although the audience members do not provide a perfect match, the reactions of these native speakers of English to the two texts can give us many insights into which aspects of the nonnative speakers’ discourse cause difficulty in establishing an interpretation. An important next step will be to investigate the reactions of audiences whose background knowledge more closely match that of the intended audience.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

# The Chinese Speaker’s Discourse

The speaker whose discourse is examined here is a native speaker of Chinese originally from Taiwan. At the time the discourse was produced, he was a graduate student in traffic engineering at a U.S. university, enrolled in a training class for prospective ITAs. All students in the class were asked to take a SPEAK (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) test, which is a retired version of the Test of Spoken English (TSE) developed by the Educational Testing Service. The test is scored for pronunciation, grammar, fluency, and comprehensibility. Comprehensibility represents a more general assessment of the test taker’s communicative ability and is based to an extent on the other three components. Comprehensibility is scored on a 300- point scale. This student scored 216 on the comprehensibility component. A score of 220 has been adopted by the State of Florida as the minimal score for international students to be employed as graduate teaching assistants. A score of 216 indicates that the speaker will still have a number of problems with grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary. A transcript of the initial portion of the lecture appears in Figure 1.

Note. The discourse is divided into two sections labeled A and B for ease of exposition and does not indicate any theoretical claims in terms of the existence of the paragraph as a unit in oral discourse. The native speaker who read the transcript aloud read from a version of the transcript which used conventional punctuation; thus, the reader did not attempt to imitate the stress, pausing, and intonation as originally produced by the Chinese speaker. Numbers represent syntactically defined clauses.

The original audience for the Chinese speaker was composed of the ESL instructor, the other international students in the ITA training course, and 3 additional native speakers of U.S. English. The discourse struck these listeners as circuitous and difficult to follow. Of the 15 additional English listeners who heard the transcript read by a native speaker, not one was able to catch more than three of the five points enumerated in the section labeled A. When asked in an open-ended question for their general assessment of the discourse, they used such descriptors as muddled, rambling, and speaker seemed unsure of his main point. None of the 15 described the discourse in terms synonymous with clear or easy to follow. The analysis which follows sheds some light on this assessment. Although there are problems at many linguistic levels which should be dealt with in a complete analysis, here I will concentrate only on lexical discourse markers, lexical specificity, syntactic incorporation, and prosodies (which will be addressed briefly in the section on interactive effects).

# LexicaI Discourse Markers

When lexical discourse markers match native listener expectations, they act as explicit announcements about how the listener should incorporate information into the overall discourse (Keller, 1979). In this discourse, the speaker uses lexical discourse markers in an unexpected, nonparallel manner. As a preorganizer (in Clause 2), he announces that there will be 5 subtopics and (in Clause 3) introduces the initial subtopic with the phrase the first one. However, the speaker then abandons the strategy using instead the sequential marker and then (in Clause 7) to introduce the second main point, which violates the established expectation that the organizational schema will be a numerical one. Perhaps more importantly, the speaker mixes the sequential markers (and then in Clause 7 and after that in Clause 10) with simple additive markers (also in Clause 9 and and in Clause 10). In this context, the additive markers give ambiguous signals. It is not clear if they are signaling the elaboration of an already established topic or the introduction of a new, major point. This is particularly apparent in the 10th clause where it is unclear if the phrase and the . . tool for design should be interpreted as an elaboration’ of the major elements for designing traffic signals or as a separate topic. (The speaker’s intention was to indicate that the tool for traffic design was the fifth major point.)

# Lexical Specificity

The overarching notion of lexical specificity is that the referent in the discourse should be sufficiently identified to avoid confusion for the audience. A number of devices have been identified as helping provide lexical specificity: pronominalization, certain patterns of adjectival modification, repetition, and appropriate lexical choice (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Johnstone, 1987; for a fuller theoretical discussion of the issues surrounding lexical specificity and lexical cohesion, see Green, 1989, and Tyler, 1992). Moreover, because any one word can have a wide range of meanings, within any particular exchange, interlocutors must establish a mutual interpretation of key lexical items. This often includes establishing a set of context-specific synonyms (Tyler, 1992). When introducing a synonym, a speaker can provide explicit links to signal the listener that, in this particular exchange, this new lexical item should be taken to have the same interpretation as the established lexical item. One way of establishing such links is repetition of modifying phrases which were previously linked to a lexical item whose interpretation is taken to be established.

To see the effect of the lack of establishing lexical specification in the Chinese speaker’s discourse, consider the general comprehensibility of both paragraphs. The first seems relatively easy to understand, whereas the second emerges as a series of non sequiturs. In part, the second paragraph is more difficult to follow because of the expectations set by the introductory paragraph in which the speaker announced that the first topic would deal with where and when traffic signals should be installed (in Clauses 4 and 5); when the speaker returns to an expansion of the first topic, the listener expects a phrase signaling location (the where and when) of traffic signals. Thus, the announcement that the first topic will be warrants for traffic signal installation (in Clause 11) is unexpected and confusing. This is followed by a declarative statement that a Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices exists (Clauses 12 and 13). The speaker offers no overt link between the warrants and this manual. Then come Clauses 14 and 15: Any traffic signal used in the public roadways in the United States, its color, size, shape, lighting, composition, whatever, should conform with that manual, which at best seem only tangentially related to the preceding discourse.

One of the reasons there seems to be so little connection between this sentence and the rest of the discourse is that the list of signal characteristics given here deals exclusively with a physical description of signals, whereas the previous discourse focuses on the regulations concerning placement of traffic signals or the undefined warrants. Without a phrase such as the where and when of traffic signal installation which explicitly provides a link between the warrants, the contents of the manual, and the surrounding discourse, the connections are obscure at best. Finally, in Clause 16, warrant is again mentioned but its relation to the manual and the physical description of traffic signals remains obscure. Even if the listener inferred the initial link between the where and when of traffic signal installation and the warrants for traffic signal installation (which is weakly made in Clauses 4, 5, and 6) there is an important switch in referring phrase between the mention of warrant in Clause 11, let’s see the warrants for traffic signal installation, and the phrase in Clause 16, so I put the first warrant on your handout. Normal interpretation is not that warrants and the first warrant are coreferential. Subsequent conversations with the speaker revealed that to him, the where and when of traffic signal installation is synonymous with the first warrant and that the warrants are synonymous with the information contained in the manual. But to the listener who does not start with this presupposition, the change in terminology is perceived as a change in reference, not cohesive paraphrases. Moreover, the phrase warrants for traffic signal installation appears to have two interpretations—both the general list of regulations governing all aspects of traffic signals and the more specific interpretation of regulations governing location for traffic signal installation. The lack of lexical specification results in the impression that much of the discourse consists of disconnected detail.

# Syntax

Considering the syntactic relationships among clauses, note that of the 6 sentences in the second paragraph, 4 are simple clauses. Studies by Biber (1988), Chafe (1982), Danielewicz (1984), Lakoff (1984), and Schachter (1973) have indicated that native English speakers use relative clauses, complements, and other subordinate structures as important information organizing devices to provide cues about prominence, focus, and logical relations.

Heavy reliance on coordinate conjunction and juxtaposition in lieu of syntactic incorporation essentially strips the discourse of important sources of information regarding prominence and logical relationships. This is the case in the discourse under consideration. For example, the relationship between the 11th clause, which announces that the topic is warrants for traffic control, and the 12th clause, which announces the existence of the manual, is particularly obscure. These seemingly disjoint pieces of information are expressed in two separate “sentences” which the listener tends to interpret as being equal in prominence and centrality to the argument. The logical and hierarchical relationships between these clauses (which the speaker claimed he intended) must be inferred on the basis of juxtaposition. In this case the context is not sufficiently rich for the English listener to establish a meaningful connection between the warrants and the existence of the manual. However, when the clauses are linked through syntactic incorporation, a more interpretatable connection emerges: let’s see the warrants for traffic signal installation which are found in the book called Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The pattern of weak interclausal connection is repeated throughout the discourse. The resulting impression is that the speaker is wandering or continually digressing from the main point.

# Interactive Effects

Thus far, we have considered each discourse structuring device in isolation. However, there are often multiple, interacting problems within a single clause. The final clause illustrates interactive effects:\*

1. 17. let's / see the / ftst case/ of of / this warrant // 18. that's for a / volume //.

Clause 18 is one of the most difficult to integrate into the discourse. In part, this is because of the unspecified use of the word volume.

This is the first time the notion of volume has been presented. The immediately preceding discourse (Clauses 14 and 15) deals with a list of the physical properties of traffic signals. The expectation is that the first warrant will deal with something like physical specifications for traffic signals. The listener is thus surprised by the unexpected announcement that the first warrant deals with some kind of neverbefore-mentioned volume. In terms of anaphora or pronominal reference, it is not entirely clear what the pronoun that is referring to. The most plausible explanation would seem to be that the clause is giving information which modifies or further defines the first warrant in Clause 17. Syntactically, the expected structure to signal this relationship is the relative clause. The choice of the pronoun that precludes the relative clause interpretation because this clause is a nonrestrictive relative, and hence the use of that is unacceptable.

Moreover, prosodic cues indicate that the clause is independent. The falling intonation pattern used by the Chinese speaker on the final word of the preceding clause (18), warrant, signals the listener that the sentence has ended. This interpretation is reinforced by the long pause preceding the final clause and the high pitch on that’s. According to Hirst (1986), English uses high pitch to signal the beginning of a new idea. The heavy stress placed on that’s suggests that the pronoun is working as the subject of a new sentence. In sum, the interpretation of this clause is made extremely difficult because of a number of conflicting or ambiguous cues. The prosodic and syntactic cues point to the interpretation that the clause is an independent sentence. However, in terms of semantics, a relative construction seems most appropriate. Finally, the lack of lexical specification leaves the lexical interpretation murky.

# The Native Speaker’s Discourse

We turn now to an analysis of the planned spoken discourse produced by a native speaker of U.S. English. The transcript in Figure 2 is an excerpt from his first videotaped teaching demonstration.

The lesson is aimed at first-year university students in an introductory biology class. The speaker started the lecture with a brief demonstration concerning the diffusion of perfume molecules into the air. He refers to the process by which the perfume molecules spread in his first sentence with this process.

A transcript of the English speaker’s lecture was read to the same 15 subjects who heard the Chinese speaker’s discourse. All 15 listeners were able to list the four major points enumerated by the native English speaker. Terms such as well-organized and clear were used to describe the discourse. Although two of the listeners complained about the

lecture being dry, none described it in terms synonymous with confusing or incoherent.

The overall discourse structure and organizational strategy used in the English speaker’s discourse are strikingly similar to those used in the Chinese speaker’s discourse. Notice that, like the Chinese speaker, the native speaker begins by announcing the general topic, then announces the number of subpoints to be covered. In both cases, the introductory announcement is followed by an enumeration of the subpoints. Both speakers begin with a numerical strategy for alerting the listeners to each of the subpoints. Despite the similarity in global structure, the native-speaker discourse struck the English listeners as being relatively easy to follow, whereas the discourse of the nonnative speaker was perceived as being, as one native listener said, “rambling and scrambling.” Close analysis reveals that the native speaker’s use of discourse structuring cues is quite different from that of the Chinese speaker.

# Lexical Discourse Markers

The native speaker uses a consistent numerical strategy as seen in Clauses 4 (first), 11 (second), and 21 (fourth). Notice that in Clause 13 the native speaker does switch from the numerical strategy, introducing the new point with another way. However, this switch is not confusing (as was the switch in strategy in the Chinese speaker’s discourse) because of the speaker’s use of a parallel syntactic structure to introduce each of the subpoints as well as his repetition of the noun way in the phrase another way. This last point will be elaborated in the discussion of lexical specificity. Moreover, the native speaker returns to the numerical strategy when he introduces the fourth point (in Clause 21). Recall that once the Chinese speaker abandoned the numerical strategy, he did not resume it. In addition to the consistent numerical strategy, in Clauses 17 and 18 the native speaker uses the phrases In this situation and In the case of to focus attention on contrasting information. Finally, the native speaker’s use of so in Clause 10 conveys the expected sense of logical conclusion or result (Halliday & Hasan, 1976), linking the information in the 9th clause with that in the 10th. This is in contrast to the Chinese speaker’s nonnativelike use of so to link the information presented in Clauses 14 and 15 with the information in 16.

# Lexical Specificity

The discourse produced by the native speaker contains several repetitions at both the word and the phrase levels which are lacking in the Chinese speaker’s discourse. The native speaker’s repetitions work to specify and establish discourse-situated interpretations of key lexical items and give directions on how the information should be incorporated into the ongoing discourse.

Consider the specification and linking of the lexical items way, process, and means in this discourse. The speaker begins (in Clause 4) by establishing a narrow, context-specific interpretation of way: ways that substances pass into and out of cells. In the following sentence (Clause 6), way does not appear but is implied in the first [way] which we’re going to discuss today is diffusion. The syntactic positioning of way in Clause 4 places it in the controlling, focus position (Erhlich, 1988; Fox, 1987) and therefore makes it the priority candidate for anaphoric reference (either pronominal or elliptical) in Clause 6. In the next sentence (that’s just the process of. . . ), way is linked with process, establishing that way and process should be interpreted as synonyms in this discourse. In Clause 11, means is explicitly established as a synonym of way and process through repetition of the phrase of getting substances into and out of cells. In Clauses 13 and 14, the speaker explicitly repeats the links between way and process in another way is active transport which is a process.

In part, it is this explicit establishment of the context-situated interpretation of way which allows the listener to easily interpret another way in Clause 13 as introducing the third major point even though the speaker does not continue with the established numerical strategy.

Comparing the native speaker’s use of lexical specification and repetition to the Chinese speaker’s, the Chinese speaker’s discourse is almost totally lacking in the use of this discourse structuring device. The Chinese speaker does not effectively establish a mutual interpretation of key terms (such as warrant) and fails to provide links between intended synonyms (e.g., when and where you should have traffic signal installation and warrants for traffic signal installation).

One place where phrasal repetition does occur is in Clauses 4 and 5, where and when we should have traffic signal and where and when we should not have traffic signal. However, this repetition does not serve to link any new concepts or lexical items. This kind of immediate repetition seems to signal special focus or contrast which is lacking in the content.

# Syntax

The importance of syntactic incorporation in making logical and prominence relations explicit has already been established here and in previous work (Biber, 1988; Lakoff, 1984; Schachter, 19’73; Tyler, Jefferies, & Davies, 1988). A number of instances of syntactic incorporation occur in the native speaker’s discourse. To see how they signal prominence and logical relations, we will consider Clauses 21 through 25 (see Figure 1).

If we convert these complex structures into simple clauses conjoined by and or simply juxtaposed, the argument becomes much less explicit:

2. And the fourth is called phagocytosis and plandicytosis. They are two processes and they simply engulf. Something, a drop or a particle is outside and the cell involves the membrane and the membrane surrounds and engulfs it. That’s these processes and they are two despicable processes of the cell.

Table 1 shows the frequency of the differences in the use of discourse structuring devices in the two speakers’ texts.2

A Hotelling-Lawley Trace test was performed on the data. The results indicated that the differences in the amounts of syntactic complexity used by the two groups were significant, $F \left( 3 , 4 0 \right) = 4 7 ,$ $p { < } . 0 0 0 1$ . However, in spite of the high level of significance, these statistical results must be viewed with some caution as the number of native speakers is quite small.

The important point here is that the native speakers in this study used more relative clauses, complements, and subordinations than did the nonnative speakers. This finding parallels the finding of the qualitative analysis and lends empirical support to the hypothesis that the discourse of the Chinese speaker did not signal the intended logical and prominence relations.

# CONCLUSION

This study has presented a qualitative discourse analysis of two texts. Using an integrative discourse framework, we have found several distinct patterns of difference between the English discourse produced by a native and nonnative speaker in the areas of lexical discourse markers, lexical specificity, and syntactic incorporation.

At first glance, it may appear that some of the findings in this study are at variance with earlier findings. For instance, Chaudron (1983) found that synonyms were not a particularly helpful device in aiding L2 listeners’ recall and recognition of topic reinstatements. The present analysis argues that establishment of a synonym set is an important discourse structuring device in native-speaker discourse. Chaudron and Richards (1986) found that the addition of microlevel, intersentential connectors did not improve L2 listeners’ comprehension of English lectures. Here it is argued that cuing of logical and prominence relations at the microlevel (through syntactic incorporation and lexical discourse markers) does make an important contribution to comprehensibility. A crucial difference between the present study and the two earlier studies is that the present study considers the potential effect of these discourse structuring cues on native listeners, whereas the earlier studies consider their effects on L2 listeners. The fact that L2 listeners seem not to use these cues in aiding their listening comprehension is arguably consistent with their failure to produce similar discourse structuring cues in their own spoken discourse.

In terms of pedagogy, the analysis suggests that discourse-based differences contribute substantially to communication problems encountered by advanced language learners and points to the need to develop teaching materials and techniques which train L2 speakers in nativelike use of discourse structuring devices. One relatively straightforward application of the present findings is to ask students to compare native- and nonnative-speaker discourse, such as the excerpts presented here, with an eye towards specific discourse structuring cues. For instance, students can be asked to identify sets of synonyms in the native-speaker discourse in order to focus their attention on the uses of paraphrase and repetition. Once they have been introduced to this pattern in native-speaker discourse, they can be asked to add repetitions and paraphrases to discourse which lacks this discourse structuring cue. The next step is to analyze transcripts of their own discourse for the occurrence of paraphrase and repetition and make appropriate modifications. My students have used this exercise successfully both as individual homework and as a cooperative, small-group activity in which three or four students analyze and modify each others’ transcripts.

Finally, in spite of the difficulties listeners had in comprehending the discourse of the nonnative speaker in this study, he obtained a score on the SPEAK test which is very close to the level needed to be allowed to teach. The present findings suggest that general language proficiency tests, such as the SPEAK test, are likely to be inadequate as the sole assessment for determining the readiness of a nonnative speaker to provide comprehensible academic discourse. At the very least, this study points to the need to include some additional measure of appropriate discourse structuring cues as a relevant variable in assessing the English skills of potential ITAs.
