# ABSTRACT

The overarching goal of this design-based research was to explore WhatsApp’s potential for facilitating and supporting speaking and pronunciation instruction in an EFL large-class speaking course. More specifically, this paper explored the perceived learning outcomes of WhatsApp-supported pedagogy in large English-speaking classes. Ninety-nine English students practiced their English by recording themselves, listening to the recordings, and comparing their recordings to native speakers’ pronunciation. When satisfied with the quality, they sent their own recordings to a five-member WhatsApp group made up of their classmates. The recordings involved speed reading, singing a song or reading the lyrics aloud, tongue twisters, and making a video summary. Students listened to the recordings of the other four group members and provided feedback on pronunciation. The data were collected via an open-ended survey and individual and focus-group interviews. Qualitative content analysis of the data indicated that the vast majority of the participants reacted positively and mentioned the following major contributions to large speaking classes: (1) educational affordances for pronunciation, speaking, motivation, vocabulary, and reading; and (2) technological affordances, i.e. ease of use and accessibility. The adopted approach supported speaking and pronunciation instruction, specifically through instructor and peer feedback, speed reading, and ease of access. The paper concludes that it is rewarding to unravel WhatsApp’s potential as a mobile instant messaging (MIM) tool in large-classes.

# 1.  Introduction

Speaking is a practical skill, and learning and teaching of practical skills require practice. However, successful speaking practice is often challenged by time and space constraints of the physical classroom environment. In order to overcome these restrictions, many practitioners have been attracted to the integration of technology in speaking instruction (Akkara et  al., 2020; Andújar-Vaca & Cruz-Martínez, 2017). Mobile assisted language learning (MALL) has become a powerful way to integrate technology in higher education (Cheon et  al., 2012) by providing learners with more exposure and the opportunity to practice the language both in and outside the classroom. Mobile devices, with their increasing popularity, have prompted researchers and practitioners to utilize applications (henceforth, apps) that have the potential to allow collaborative learning (Andujar, 2016), blended learning (Kim & Yoon, 2014), and autonomous learning (Reinders & White, 2016). Mobile apps are effective tools to fulfill MALL by positively affecting English as a foreign language (EFL) learning (Klimova, 2018). Mobile instant messaging (MIM) tools, such as WhatsApp and WeChat, are also commonly used by learners, teachers, and researchers because they provide ‘a rich context for open and transparent interaction that alerts communicants to the temporal and time-span constraints of the interaction’ (Rambe & Bere, 2013, p. 546). Also, the use of MIM has the potential to increase motivation in language education (Andujar, 2016). Drawing on WhatsApp’s nuanced potential as a popular MIM tool, this study sets out to investigate the role of using this platform in large speaking classes.

Getting the second language (L2) learners to speak in large classes can be challenging due to an unwillingness to participate or reticence (Zhang & Head, 2010). Language teachers can overcome this reticence by giving students more say in choosing their materials and picking or creating their own activities to practice speaking (Zhang & Head, 2010). Various technologies and digital tools have been used to create such learning environments in language education contexts, as they are increasingly widespread in language learning, positively influencing learners’ motivation (Golonka et  al., 2014). Similarly, Chapelle (2001) regards language learning potential, learner harmony, and authenticity as computer-assisted language learning (CALL) task appropriateness criteria.

In Turkey, to enroll an English Language Teaching (ELT) program, candidates are measured through multiple-choice questions that gauge learners’ reading skills, including vocabulary and grammar knowledge. This has consequences at the macro- and the micro-level of language teaching and learning inside the classroom, such as forcing university students to delay their productive skills, particularly speaking. Studies on these productive skills are important since the Turkish assessment and evaluation system does not measure pronunciation and speaking skills (Bakla, 2018; Kartal & Özmen, 2018). From this viewpoint, it is vital to provide learners with opportunities to interact and practice language both in and outside the classroom.

There has been growing popularity in integrating mobile devices as language learning tools because they help enhance student interaction (Tang & Bradshaw, 2020) and teach language skills (Kartal, 2019) beyond the language classes. Based on a survey study with university students, Tang and Bradshaw (2020) conclude that both face-to-face communication and MIM allow for adequate meaningful team interactions about coursework assessment projects. Active involvement of learners seems to fluctuate in large classes, in which the time is limited, and it is difficult to involve all students equally. The teacher’s extra efforts are critical in large classes (Biggs, 1999), and these efforts can be combined with the power of using MALL, which allows learning anytime, anywhere (Shippee & Keengwe, 2014).

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Theoretical perspective

This study is grounded mainly on the noticing hypothesis (Schmidt, 1990), the socio-cultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978), and the self-determination theory (SDT). The noticing hypothesis maintains that acquiring a language feature requires becoming aware of it. The notion of noticing plays a significant role in second language (L2) learning. It is a process of consciously attending to linguistic features in the input (Schmidt, 1990). This study subscribes to the noticing hypothesis, assuming that conscious attention to accuracy will help one acquire the correct pronunciation. Gass (2003) regarded noticing as a tool to mediate between communication and acquisition, which allows noticing the gap between the current language and the target language. This study intends to make the participants notice the particular features of L2, which is the main goal of different techniques and interventions of the noticing hypothesis.

The socio-cultural theory attaches significance to the essential role of learners’ cognitive development with other people’s help. To contextualize this research study under the socio-cultural theory, it is necessary to consider notions such as the zone of proximal development (ZPD), constructivism, scaffolding, and interaction. Vygotsky (1978) defines the ZPD as ‘the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by the individual’s independent problem-solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving in collaboration with more capable peers’ (p. 86). Another fundamental principle in social constructivism is the idea of scaffolding, which, according to Vygotsky (1978), refers to the teacher or peer support that enables students to perform increasingly well. Based on the socio-cultural theory, interaction plays a significant role in L2 development (Swain, 1985), since it is a fundamental factor that helps students construct knowledge actively. Previous research revealed evidence on the effects of sociocultural factors on pronunciation learning (Kennedy & Trofimovich, 2008; Munro et  al., 2006).

The SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2009) can also explain the students’ motivation to learn the language with movies; when pedagogical design satisfactorily addresses learners’ needs, they are motivated to engage in learning tasks. Ryan and Deci (2009) maintain that ‘SDT begins with the presumption that human beings are inherently proactive and endowed with a natural tendency to learn and develop as they engage not only their outer environments, but also their inner world of drives, needs, and experiences’ (p. 171). Therefore, when a task is self-determined, the locus of causality is perceived as internal (Takahashi & Im, 2020). Since using WhatsApp is already among learners’ behavioral patterns, bringing daily routines to the learning environment may contribute to classroom language learning because SDT predicts intended L2 learning efforts (Takahashi & Im, 2020). The SDT is also related to online language learning outcomes (Hsu et  al., 2019). Self-direction, motivation, and positive learning dispositions are among the students’ roles that gain significance in an online learning environment (Chiu & Hew, 2018).

# 2.2.  Speaking and pronunciation instruction in large classes

Promoting speaking skills in L2 learners is essential for all proficiency levels (Nation & Newton, 2008) because it drives students to speed up and automatize their language use. However, as the related literature shows, several factors may interfere with L2 learners’ oral performance. Specifically, in Turkish contexts, the development of oral communication is the concern of many researchers (Kartal & Balçıkanlı, 2018). Despite many attempts to increase English proficiency, Turkish learners of English experience problems with oral communication (Coskun, 2016). Some of the outstanding reasons are speaking anxiety, which mainly occurs due to negative self-evaluation and perceived low proficiency (Subaşı, 2010), fear of making a mistake (Dörnyei, 2001), negative judgments towards EFL classrooms, and limited time to respond (Mak, 2011).

The time constraint is a significant problem in large classes. One way of overcoming this problem is by exploiting peer correction. As a pedagogical application for boosting noticing and as a way of collaboration, corrective feedback has been widely used in language learning (Ögeyik, 2018). Similarly, peer correction can be applied in pronunciation learning (Juansyah, 2012; Martin & Sippel, 2021). Previous studies (e.g. Ahangari, 2014; Tost, 2013) found evidence that peer correction was even superior to teacher correction. Using peer-mediated repeated oral reading, Tost (2013) found evidence that peer-supported reading aloud could help students improve their speaking and pronunciation. Peer correction is helpful both for the receiver and the giver in pronunciation instruction (Martin & Sippel, 2021). Considering the need of Turkish EFL learners to improve their oral skills due to the constraints mentioned above, peer correction would be an effective way of improving pronunciation skills. Moreover, comparing self, peer, and teacher correction, Ahangari (2014) found that peer correction was more effective on pronunciation than teacher-feedback.

# 2.3.  The use of MIMs in foreign language classess

Previous research found empirical evidence that the MIM tool WhatsApp, which offers users a very convenient mode of communication, could be used to improve L2 speaking skills (Akkara et  al., 2020; Andújar-Vaca & Cruz-Martínez, 2017; Escobar-Mamani & Gómez-Arteta, 2020; Minalla, 2018). Following a mixed-methods approach, Akkara et  al. (2020) examined whether collaborative learning activities and problem-solving tasks facilitate teaching and speaking. Some of the tasks were pronounce it, find the odd one, interviewing, 30-second presentation, text me what $I$ said, and word clouds. The results showed that interaction via WhatsApp developed students’ speaking skills. In another study, Andújar-Vaca and Cruz-Martínez (2017) designed an experiment in which the participants were involved in daily interactions in a WhatsApp group for six months. The results yielded significant improvements with regard to oral proficiency. Escobar-Mamani and Gómez-Arteta (2020) aimed to improve the speaking skills of Peruvian adolescents by using WhatsApp for sending and receiving text and voice messages, emojis, calls, and video calls. The authors found that WhatsApp developed the communication skills of the participants. Minalla (2018) used WhatsApp for group chat and confirmed enhanced verbal interactions outside the classroom.

A review of the empirical studies that used WhatsApp in language learning by Kartal (2019) showed that WhatsApp was used to teach the four main language skills, integrated language skills, and vocabulary. This review also yielded positive effects on increasing learner autonomy, decreasing anxiety, and increasing motivation. Applying a mixed-method model, Cetinkaya and Sütçü (2018) compared WhatsApp and Facebook’s use for vocabulary instruction. They found that WhatsApp was superior to traditional teaching and via Facebook. WhatsApp was also found to foster language learner autonomy by Hazaea and Alzubi (2018) through accessing reading materials and peer and teacher interaction outside the classroom. WhatsApp was also helpful to alleviate foreign language speaking anxiety via dialogue activities (Han & Keskin, 2016). Moreover, the majority of the studies on WhatsApp have shown that the participants developed positive attitudes towards using WhatsApp for language learning. The critical analysis of WhatsApp research in language learning by Kartal (2019) revealed that pronunciation is one of the less researched language areas. In a qualitative study, Afifah (2021) investigated the role of WhatsApp in language learning and concluded that it provided advantages of time flexibility and easily accessed materials. Similarly, a classroom action research study by El-Sulukiyyah (2016) revealed WhatsApp’s effectiveness in pronunciation learning and increasing enthusiasm in studying pronunciation. Using another MIM tool, Wang (2017) explored the role of WeChat in learning pronunciation by Chinese English learners. The results revealed that WeChat could help create a better autonomous learning environment and enhance pronunciation learning flexibility.

# 2.4.  The present study

Although numerous studies have utilized mobile technologies to supplement classroom learning, this study is rare in exploiting MIM in large-speaking classes. Similarly, there is a scarcity of research on MIM tools in facilitating English pronunciation learning (Kartal, 2019; Wang, 2017). Also, no previous research adopted a design-based research (DBR) approach to address EFL learners’ needs and the pedagogical requirements for developing speaking skills in a large-speaking class. The DBR methodology requires iterations of analyzing practical problems, developing solutions and prototypes, testing and refinements. Previous research reveals a gap between practical problems and developing solutions with learners. Addressing these gaps by drawing on MIM’s nuanced potential for language learning, this study investigated WhatsApp’s potential in facilitating and supporting speaking and pronunciation instruction in large English-speaking classes. Considering the needs of the participants, the study employed the tasks of speed reading, singing a song or reading the lyrics aloud, tongue twisters, and making a video summary using WhatsApp. Students provided explicit correction on pronunciation since L2 pronunciation instruction benefits from Schmidt’s (1990) noticing hypothesis (Kartal & Korucu-Kis, 2020). Also, the students focused on their speaking and pronunciation by utilizing the socio-cultural theory’s tenets (i.e. interaction and collaboration). The following research questions have guided the study:

1. What are the barriers or enablers for learners when using WhatsApp in large English-speaking classes?   
2. How do the learners view WhatsApp-supported pedagogy in large English-speaking classes?

# 3.  Method

This study adopts a DBR approach to address EFL learners’ needs and the pedagogical requirements for developing speaking skills in a large-speaking class. The DBR has been adopted as the research methodology since it is ‘a systematic but flexible methodology aimed to improve educational practices through iterative analysis, design, development, and implementation, based on collaboration among researchers and practitioners in real-world settings and leading to contextually-sensitive design principles and theories’ (Wang & Hannafin, 2005, pp. 6–7).

Employing a case study approach, this DBR study focuses on a large-speaking classroom as a case. An in-depth analysis of issues or unique cases of a phenomenon is conducted (Given, 2008) by collecting detailed information using various data collection procedures (Creswell et  al., 2007). The case study design requires describing the setting of the cases within contextual conditions (Yin, 2003). The type used in this study is the collective or multiple-case study, where the researcher ‘selects one issue or concern but also selects multiple case studies to illustrate the issue’ (Creswell et  al., 2007, p. 246).

# 3.1.  Context and participants

This study was carried out at an ELT program of a state university in Turkey, where these programs are regulated by the Turkish Council of Higher Education (CoHE) and follow a top-down curriculum. Before being placed in this program, the students take a national English language test that only assesses reading, vocabulary, and grammar. The test does not assess listening, speaking, and pronunciation skills. Therefore, the students in ELT programs need to develop these skills because they will be English language teachers. This test also has a negative washback effect (Bakla, 2018), since it motivates students to study for the assessed skills but not for listening and speaking skills. There were language skills courses in the program, and this study was conducted in a mandatory two-credit course named Oral Communication Skills. The course is one of several compulsory courses (e.g. reading, listening, and writing) offered in the first year of the program.

The study group consisted of 100 students enrolled in the first year of this program. This group was divided into two sections, each consisting of 50 students, but one of the students left the school; therefore, a total of 99 conveniently-sampled students formed the sample size for the study. A background survey was conducted in which the participants answered questions about their demographic information, such as their age and mobile device usage. Students were aged 18 to 24 years and consisted of

70 females and 29 males. All the participants had smartphones to support educational purposes inside and outside the classroom. The analysis of the frequency of daily uses of mobile devices and students’ readiness for mobile learning shows that students are already using mobile devices for educational purposes, i.e. sharing information about their courses, using mobile apps. All participants had internet access, with $9 8 \%$ using their mobile devices for social networking (Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram), and all of them using WhatsApp.

In Turkish state schools, English language teaching starts in the second grade. The students receive around 12 years of formal EFL instruction before university education. The participants’ language proficiency levels were assumed to be similar, as they entered the English Language Teaching program by taking the same national standard test (University Entrance Exam/Foreign Language Test) and earning similar scores. Also, the students took an oral exam, and the ones who received more than 70 points out of 100 were admitted to the program. The ones who received less than 70 points were enrolled in the English prep-class. Two English professors conducted the oral exam, and the threshold level of English language proficiency was approximately B2-C1 concerning the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The participants’ level was satisfactory to use movies as authentic materials, and these materials require high proficiency for higher learning gains (Bahrani & Sim, 2012).

# 3.2.  Procedure and the pedagogical rationale

The DBR proposes a series of principles, procedures, and practices that guide an educational intervention design. As a methodology, the four-phased DBR methodology was followed. The first phase requires iterations to analyze practical problems, which was achieved via a comprehensive the literature review and context investigation. The implementation of this phase started with a needs analysis on the problem in communicative skills, specifically pronunciation. A need of the learners in the Turkish context is the development of oral communication skills. Despite many attempts to increase oral proficiency, Turkish EFL learners experience oral communication problems (Coskun, 2016).

The second phase included the development of solutions and prototypes utilizing existing speaking and pronunciation teaching and learning principles. Develop solutions and prototype phase allowed the researcher and participants to propose some suggestions, such as explicit correction, group work, instant and continuous teacher and peer feedback. There is a bulk of evidence in the literature informing the contributions of MIMS (Cetinkaya and Sütçü (2018), peer correction (Martin & Sippel,

2021), and explicit teaching (Kartal & Korucu-Kis, 2020) to speaking and pronunciation instruction. The participants suggested using a MIM tool. WhatsApp was picked as the MIM tool as it easily allows sharing information such as text and voice messages, videos, and documents. Although several tools allow learners to send and receive voice recordings, WhatsApp was selected because, as previous studies showed, it is one of the most convenient mobile apps that can be used for language learners (Akkara et  al., 2020; Andújar-Vaca & Cruz-Martínez, 2017; Han & Keskin, 2016; Kartal, 2019). The study began with asking participants to form WhatsApp groups of five members. The participants were assigned to the groups randomly. The rules were determined since it is essential to make the use of WhatsApp efficient. The participants were asked to send the recordings on time, not to send irrelevant messages, and to give their feedback in a timely manner. Before working on the WhatsApp tasks, students were introduced to the tasks in the face-toface classroom. Every week the participants did the following tasks: speed reading (reading aloud), singing a song, tongue twister, and summarizing a video (any videos from TED Talks or news from the newspapers of BBC, CNN, The Guardian, or the New York Times).

The third phase is preoccupied with tests and refinements. The WhatsApp tasks were conducted for two weeks and the participants provided feedback on the tasks. The participants offered opinions on the initial design and suggested adjustments during the whole implementation with due regard for DBR. This iterative procedure provided insights into the refinement of the design. The last phase involved documentation and reflection to produce design principles based on the analyses in phase three. In so doing, the iterations led to the last phase in the form of a reflection to produce the principles for the design and enhance solutions. For instance, as a result of the request of some participants, the task of singing was no longer compulsory, and the participants were allowed to read the lyrics aloud. Also, the participants wanted to correct each other’s pronunciation mistakes by voice messages. Some participants also sought teacher feedback in addition to their peers. As a result of these and similar refinements, the following design principles were determined as a requirement of the fourth phase of the DBR: integrating in-class teaching practices with students’ out-of-class self-learning, integrating peer-support into the WhatsApp tasks, guiding students to out-or-class self- and peer-learning. The flowchart of the whole procedure of the study is given in Figure 1.

The first task was speed reading, in which each group was asked to find a short paragraph, and each member tried reading it aloud as fast as possible. The aim of reading aloud with a speed reading task was not developing overall reading skills but to improve students’ physical fluency, which can be defined as the ability to produce the sounds of the target language in a smooth speech. Reading a text aloud contributes to pronunciation because it gives learners a context that allows them to concentrate on pronunciation accuracy. They are able to listen to and analyze their own speech, helping them develop better control of the rhythm of English (Acton, 1984). Tran and Nation (2014) revealed that an increase in a learner’s rate of reading correlates with an increase in the language memory span. Han (2016) suggested incorporating it into pronunciation instruction. Moreover, the study participants were mispronouncing some words while reading fast. The speed reading also aimed to follow the pronunciation of participants in fast reading, which does not allow too much monitoring, just like fluent speaking. The participants were asked to rehearse a few times before sending their recordings because sufficient rehearsals are required to achieve a satisfactory gain in speed (Millett, 2008). When familiar enough with the text, they were asked to shadow, i.e. they read the text aloud and listen to the recording simultaneously (Luo, 2016). Shadowing is an effective tool for teaching pronunciation (Foote & McDonough, 2017). The participants were free to pick any texts they wanted from original English newspapers or talks. The texts for each week were about 150–200 words. Each week the members read/listened to the same text so they would know what it was supposed to sound like. Additionally, the participants were asked to check their pronunciation by listening to the paragraph’s narration by a native speaker. That is why the participants read texts accompanied by native speaker narration. Therefore, the texts were mainly from audiobooks, BBC Learning English, VOA Learning English, and TED Talk captions.

Figure 1. Flowchart of the procedures of the study.

As for the second task, the participants were asked to sing a song or read the lyrics by paying attention to pronunciation. Doing something with songs is important because music can support language learning (Ludke, 2018) and singing provides opportunities for a particular kind of sociability (Rampton et  al., 2002). The third task was reading tongue twisters. The participants recorded themselves and shared their recording of a tongue twister. The last activity was summarizing a video. First, they were asked to find a TED Talk and summarize it, but the participants wanted to find their videos from other sources. This task was the only one in which participants tried to speak fluently and accurately without looking at a text. The teacher checked the videos of the summary recording in order to ensure that the participants did not read the summary. The video summary recordings were three to five minutes in duration and included personal thoughts on the videos they watched. The participants were given a guideline for each task. The participants conducted all the tasks every week. The summary of the tasks is given in Table 1.

The pedagogical rationale for the adopted approach in this study comes from the noticing hypothesis and socio-cultural theory. Also, the findings of previous research guided the study. The abovementioned were used in a large-speaking class because of the related literature on speed reading and reading aloud (Kim & Krashen, 1997; Millett, 2008), singing a song (Engh, 2012; Ludke, 2018), and tongue twisters (Mu’in et  al., 2017). These studies demonstrated the tasks’ contributions to oral skills. Related literature shows that some teachers already use all of these activities in their pronunciation courses (Shabani & Ghasemian, 2017), and songs and tongue twisters are the most preferred activities in a speaking class (Gudu, 2015).

This study integrated peer review into the tasks because it alleviates the teacher’s feedback burden (Ricard, 1986). The participants were trained about peer feedback before the implementation. Training for giving peer feedback started with increasing awareness of the target pronunciation and common errors. The students were also asked to give metalinguistic feedback to prevent further mistakes. For instance, instead of correcting the ‘should’ which is pronounced as/ for giving peer feedbac’l’, students were asked to say ‘the letter l is silent’. As for the speed reading tasks, the feedback was limited to reminding the native speaker’s pronunciation. In order to ensure that students were not giving inappropriate feedback to their friends, the researcher provided constant feedback on the learners’ feedback. Since peer feedback was limited to pronunciation, no rubric was used. The participants were asked to use an online dictionary (i.e. Longman, Oxford, Cambridge) or YouGlish (a YouTube-based dictionary) and send correct pronunciation of the word by using the link from these sources. All of the group members listened to each recording, and the teacher ensured pronunciation error correction by checking the messages in regular classroom meetings. The WhatsApp tasks were checked every week in the last 15–20 minutes of the class. Students were randomly asked to play their recordings, and the instructor provided feedback on the recordings and peer correction during this time. The feedback sessions aimed at improving the quality of the tasks and included comments on the format, peer-feedback quality, and overall performance. Moreover, some students were randomly asked to play their recordings to motivate them to do their tasks carefully.

# 3.3.  Data collection and analysis

To evaluate the effectiveness of the WhatsApp-supported tasks, three kinds of data were collected from the students: an open-ended survey and semi-structured individual and group interviews. This ensured data source triangulation (Carter et  al., 2014), since it allowed comparing what participants said in public (interviews) with what they said in private (anonymous surveys) (Patton, 2015). The open-ended survey (see Appendix A), which was designed to elicit participants’ evaluations, included six questions, and it was given to all of the participants. The survey items were checked by an expert who had more than 20 years of experience in ELT. After gathering responses from all participants, six focus-group interviews (with the original WhatsApp groups consisting of five members) and 15 individual interviews were conducted. The sample size of participants for the focus-group and individual interviews was considered acceptable, since data saturation was accomplished with this number of participants (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Following Tomal’s (2010) recommendation, the researcher conducted focus-group interviews with the WhatsApp groups in a comfortable and non-threatening setting. The participants in the focus group were chosen through convenience sampling. The interviewer did not ask specific questions but instead asked participants to share their feelings and perceptions about the use of WhatsApp and the tasks conducted. The focus groups’ responses in the interviews were used to prepare the questions for the individual interviews. The individual interviews were also conducted to draw out the participants’ real views that might not be obtained in a group setting (Tomal, 2010). To this end, the researcher took notes, and these notes were used while formulating the individual semi-structured interview questions (see Appendix B).

The data from the student survey responses and the interviews were analyzed through a qualitative interpretive approach (Kern, 2006). This required using the stages of qualitative content analysis (Dörnyei, 2007), i.e. transcription of interview data, coding, and classification of data, developing ideas, comparing categories, and finally, interpreting data and making conclusions. The analysis began with examining the participants’ answers to open-ended surveys by seeking commonalities among the participants’ accounts. The researcher read the data to get a general idea and assign open descriptive codes, followed by merging them or excluding some codes to ensure homogeneity within each code.

The study followed Guba and Lincoln’s (1985) four criteria of establishing trustworthiness: credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Credibility was ensured via data source triangulation, member checking, and peer debriefing (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). Member checking is ‘having outside auditors or participants validate findings’, and peer debriefing requires ‘independent analysis of data by one or more researchers’ (Hannes, 2011, p. 4). Peer debriefing was conducted via a colleague who has experience with the topic, population, and method (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Additionally, member checking was conducted by allowing participants to review findings from the data. A thick description of the process ensured transferability. Dependability was met via data collection tools that were carefully designed, commented on, and validated by experts. Dependability concerns led to employ a noninterfering or receptive style during the interviews (Wengraf, 2001). With this in mind, the researcher paid utmost attention to simple introductory questions to ensure a non-threatening data collection process during the individual interviews. As for confirmability, transcript forms were created, and the experts and participants confirmed the forms’ accuracy. The qualitative data were digitized, and the codes were counted to increase reliability. Regarding the ethical concerns of coerced participation and biased reporting due to the dual role as the instructor and researcher (Ferguson et  al., 2004), this study ensured voluntary participation, confidentiality, informing about the purpose and progress of the research, written informed consent, and the freedom to drop out of the study at any time.

# 4.  Results

The findings are presented sequentially but under the same roof, maintaining the integrity of WhatsApp’s mutual contributions, the tasks, and the overall adopted approach. The analysis of how WhatsApp facilitates learning in large English-speaking classes and how students view the adopted approach yielded many themes (Table 2).

As shown in Table 2, the participants expressed mainly positive perceptions and high satisfaction levels with the adopted pedagogy. The findings are given under the main categories (affordances, challenges and concerns, and task-preference) and themes.

# 4.1.  Educational affordances

The data revealed five themes that benefit from WhatsApp-supported pedagogy in large speaking classes. The participants saw educational and technological value in integrating WhatsApp and the tasks, and they reported that the tasks helped them concerning pronunciation, speaking, motivation, vocabulary, and reading. Also, WhatsApp was reported to have technological affordances of ease of use and accessibility. These are discussed with exemplar quotes that were selected based on their ability to represent the themes.

# 4.1.1.  Pronunciation and speaking

The participants were asked to compare their pronunciation with a native English speaker and provide peer correction. This form of pronunciation error correction helped participants improve their pronunciation and learn the correct pronunciation of commonly mispronounced words. The participants stated their belief that they ignored the pronunciation of some new words when they saw them during individual study. Focusing on the words’ pronunciation with the adopted approach resulted in more effective learning of the new words’ pronunciation, as perceived by the participants. The majority of the students believed that attaching significance to every word’s pronunciation in a text, audio, or video throughout the term was beneficial. Therefore, peer correction was useful because it increased attention and motivated them to learn the correct pronunciation. They believed that these tasks helped them notice the mispronounced words. They also improved themselves while giving feedback. The following quotes are given as representative thoughts:

It [WhatsApp] is effective in terms of improving our pronunciations. I can always record my voice and send it to the group so everyone can hear me and correct me. We can discuss several topics or just daily stuff. We can always correct our pronunciation errors. Recordings can be listened again and again to improve ourselves. (Focus-group interview)

And in this text, we sometimes read the words incorrectly but we correct our mistakes and we say the right pronunciation of these words. By this means, we learned some mispronounced words. Although sometimes I find it hard to do these assignments, again and again, it was really helpful, especially in improving my pronunciation. Sometimes, our friends warned us about mispronounced words. When giving feedback, I sometimes checked pronunciation of the words I did not know. This allowed me to learn the correct pronunciation while correcting my friends. (Semi-structured individual interview).

The abovementioned advantages show the role of collaborative and cooperative learning. The findings also showed that the participants noticed some common errors.

It was good for us to correct our friends’ word mistakes. Because, maybe we were making those mistakes. But now we have learned the right one. So we can continue to use WhatsApp, I find it useful. (Focus-group interview)

If our friends notice a mistake, they can correct us. Pronunciation is very important when learning a language so we should not ignore it. This way, we see our mistakes. We learn faster because we force ourselves. It also allows us to learn common mistakes. (Semi-structured individual interview)

It seems that the participants may not notice an error concerning pronunciation during individual study. However, peer correction helped them increasingly focus on these words. Some students also seem to be reluctant to check every word’s pronunciation when others are not observing them. The comments show that students were more careful because their friends were going to check their pronunciation, and thus, they made extra efforts to learn the correct pronunciation. The following quotes bear a striking resemblance to most of the other participants’ commentaries, which mentioned that recording their speaking and sending it to their peers for feedback encouraged them to speak carefully, which resulted in some rehearsals and improvement before sending it to their friends. The extracts below nicely illustrate the common views among participants as to the role of the project:

We are crowded for a speaking class, that’s why not everyone is able to talk. We have small groups in WhatsApp, and thus we have a chance to speak. Furthermore, speaking can only be developed by speaking. Also, recording is very effective. (Semi-structured individual interview)

We had to send the best recording of our reading and speaking, because our friends will listen and our teacher may ask to play our recording in the classroom. As the teacher can understand whether we spoke or read the video summary, we tried to speak naturally and correctly. (Semi-structured individual interview)

# 4.1.2.  Motivation

The students believe that the WhatsApp-supported tasks stimulated participation and helped them enjoy the learning more. One student said: ‘I enjoyed these tasks and as a result I wanted to do them on time with pleasure’. A sense of social presence was another motivation source. One student commented as follows:

Getting to know other classmates in a large class is difficult. This small WhatsApp group and helping each other gave me a sense of belonging and group membership. (Focus-group interview)

Another issue regarding motivation was music. Students mostly agree that the use of music resulted in increased motivation. The following quote nicely captures how the sing a song task motivated them to engage in the tasks.

I listen to songs all the time. When we listen specifically for learning purposes I definitely enjoy this. Also, the lyrics of the songs… I learned from my friends, which increased my attention. I learned many words and their pronunciation and this increased my motivation. (Semi-structured individual interview)

The participants’ accounts of how they felt during the regular face-toface classroom discussions usually included such words as ‘crowded’, ‘peer-pressure’, ‘shyness’, ‘anxiety’, ‘stress’, ‘strain’, and so forth. However, WhatsApp tasks yielded the adjectives of ‘interactive’, ‘enjoyment’, ‘liberating’, ‘no stress’, flexibility’, ‘social presence’, and so on. These words show how they began taking responsibility in a more flexible and liberating environment. Two representative quotes were:

I pick the text and do speed reading. I select a video to talk about. I study with the lyrics that belong to my favorite songs. I feel that I am taking control of my learning. Also, I like doing the things I benefit more and I enjoy. (Semi-structured individual interview).

I already use WhatsApp every day. Turning my daily routine into a win-win situation helped me enjoy and feel socialized more while learning.

# 4.1.3.  Vocabulary and reading

The data analysis revealed that conducting these tasks helped participants learn new vocabulary items, as reported by the students. Similar to learning pronunciation, the students tried learning every new vocabulary item because their friends asked for some words’ meanings. For example, if a word was unknown in a tongue twister, the others asked for that word’s meaning. Therefore, these tasks also helped learners develop their vocabulary.

First of all, I think all tasks were beneficial for my improvement. And it helped me with my pronunciation and I learned new words that I’d never heard before. (Open-ended survey)

I have to learn all of the words because if my friends ask I should be able to share the meaning of that word. Thanks to this I learned new words more carefully. (Semi-structured individual interview)

Another recurrent issue the students noted, pertinent to the benefits of the adopted pedagogy, was their engagement in speed reading and, as a result, an improvement in reading. The participants did not mention an improvement in overall reading skills but reading fluency, increased attention, and motivation to read as the strengths that were positively affected. Here are the views:

Speed reading resulted in more attention while reading with correct pronunciation. Also, we listened to our friends’ narrations and they also helped us increase our reading fluency. (Semi-structured individual interview)

It was a speaking course but these tasks, especially speed reading, improved our reading and I enjoyed this task so much. (Focus-group interview)

# 4.2.  Technological affordances

In addition to the educational affordances provided above, the analysis yielded technological affordances that refer to participants’ perceived ease of using WhatsApp and accessibility. Most of the participants found the interface of WhatsApp easy to use. Also, the temporal affordance of accessibility helped participants benefit more and more. Here are the views of the participants.

WhatsApp is very user friendly. The tool is opened quickly, and I can find everything I look for. (Semi-structured individual interview)

I have access to Whatsapp every time. I can learn with my friends. I have extra internet for my WhatsApp. I can continue using it even if I run out of internet.

I live with my phone. Whenever I use it I check my messages in WhatsApp. The more I open it the more I see the messages.

# 4.3.  Challenges and concerns

Even though the participants largely appreciated the WhatsApp-supported tasks in speaking and pronunciation, a small group of participants reported some challenges and concerns, i.e. unwillingness to participate in group work and lack of non-verbal communication. This group indicated some of the negative issues concerning their unwillingness to participate in group work. These participants cited various reasons, which mostly revolved around such issues as irresponsible group members, the anxiety of being observed by peers, preference for instructor’s feedback, and distractors. Here are some representative quotes:

Some of them [our group members] are so irresponsible about the tasks in the group or preparing for the presentation. For example, someone in my group didn’t do anything, she didn’t do her mission, she didn’t work with us, she didn’t even try. All of us except her tried to cover up her irresponsibility; we had to do the conversation texts for her. (Semi-structured individual interview)

To be fair, I haven’t enjoyed the WhatsApp tasks during this semester, even if it was a joyful task like sing a song because it was like a compulsory thing. I feel stressed because my friends check my performance, and I am reluctant while I’m doing these tasks. (Focus-group interview)

We already have lots of groups and receive lots of messages. I got lost. Also, maybe I would be more willing if my teacher was correcting us all the time but not my friends. (Semi-structured individual interview)

The lack of non-verbal communication was also germane, including the non-existence of eye-contact, body language, and facial expressions. A few participants held the idea that non-verbal communication is essential for successful oral language use. The following quote covers the challenges regarding the lack of non-verbal communication:

This platform is not like the classroom. We cannot see each other. We need to have eye-contact and use communication tools other than verbal ones. I think I like facing the person when I say something. (Open-ended survey)

Although the participants believed that they were less nervous while talking outside the classroom, a few thought that a teacher or a more knowledgeable individual should assess their performance.

# 4.4.  Task preference

The analysis also focused on how the participants acquainted themselves with the tasks they completed on WhatsApp. The students chose the topics themselves. Students were allowed to watch TED Talks or any kind of video they wanted. They particularly liked the activities related to speed reading and sing a song. In response to this question, almost all participants stated that they mainly enjoyed singing a song and the speed reading activity.

I think singing a song and speed reading were really beneficial but the summary of a TED Talk was not so. We started to select our own videos. I like summarizing the videos I selected. (Open-ended survey)

We did a lot of tasks in WhatsApp and I really took pleasure while doing speed reading and reading lyrics. While doing it, we do a lot of tries again and again because it takes some getting used to. Others are not as good as speed reading. (Semi-structured individual interview)

I’m really enjoying our WhatsApp group and the tasks we did, except one. For me ‘speed reading’ is the best task, I like to do it and I think it improves my English. But I don’t like TED Talk summaries. Because every time I want to choose the video that best suits me yet I’m having a hard time to find one. I also think it doesn’t improve my English much. It was helpful after selecting the videos from anywhere we want. (Semi-structured individual interview)

As for the contributions of the tasks, as discussed earlier, one of the motives for task preference is germane to enjoying the task. Aside from being perceived as a way of improving pronunciation skills, it turned out to be the case that the participants displayed a proclivity toward speed reading and sing a song, which were enjoyable for them.

# 5.  Discussion

This study’s primary finding is that participants felt changes in their pronunciation, speaking, motivation and vocabulary. The contribution of the adopted approach to pronunciation supports the findings of El-Sulukiyyah (2016), who found evidence about WhatApp’s role in pronunciation learning and increasing enthusiasm in studying pronunciation. The finding on speaking is parallel to previous research on the effectiveness of WhatsApp on oral skills (Akkara et al., 2020; Andújar-Vaca & Cruz-Martínez, 2017; Escobar-Mamani & Gómez-Arteta, 2020) and vocabulary (Cetinkaya & Sütçü, 2018). The findings also revealed that the use of tasks on WhatsApp increased motivation and willingness to participate, which corroborates Andújar’s (2016) findings. These results are understandable because the participants’ perception is closely related to the students’ experiences (Hsu, 2013) and the ease of use (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017; Kartal, 2019). The increase in willingness to participate is important to overcome reticence, which is a negative factor in speaking classes (Zhang & Head, 2010).

Another perceived benefit of this project is that participants felt less nervous and more flexible concerning time and place. They believed that the entertaining nature of activities created a warm environment. This finding is important because feeling ashamed of making mistakes is a significant problem, affecting the interaction with others when using the target language (Tum, 2015). It is reasonable to conclude that the learners enjoyed the time and place flexibility, the absence of negative facial expressions, and the stress-free environment offered by WhatsApp. This result is parallel to the findings of Afifah (2021). The decreased levels of anxiety are attributable to the research showing that language anxiety is not static but ‘[depends] on the milieu, interlocutors, task and so on’ (Gregersen, 2020, p. 72). The findings also revealed perceived social affordances. WhatsApp facilitated social presence as reported by the students. This finding corroborates the findings of Tang and Hew (2019). An optimal level of social presence is necessary for collaboration (Zhao et  al., 2014). When the usefulness of the tasks is considered, it is found that the participants also reported the contribution of speed reading and songs, which were the most preferred activities. Speed reading was found to contribute to speaking skills in previous research (Tabata-Sandom, 2017). Reading has numerous benefits, including improvement of speaking (Kim & Krashen, 1997). The students were asked to rehearse speed reading before recording and sending it to the WhatsApp group because speed reading practice must be conducted frequently to create satisfactory speed gain (Millett, 2008). The speed reading activity proved that its impact was not restricted to the reading fluency but transferred to the ability to produce sounds correctly in a fluent speech. Voice recording was another tool used in this study, which is beneficial for promoting fluency and one of the most common technology-assisted practices for developing speaking skills (Tecedor & Campos-Dintrans, 2019). The participants also used songs, as previous research has shown that engaging in music activities improves speaking skills, intonation, and flow of speech (Ludke, 2018). Although some students initially believed that they would be too shy to participate, they preferred singing the song instead of reading the lyrics aloud. This finding supports the previous research on the positive impact of songs on the enjoyment of L2 material (Engh, 2012; Ludke, 2018). The finding on enjoyment is important because there has been an explosion of interest in the role that emotions play in L2 learning (Dewaele & Li, 2018).

Although participants did not enjoy summarizing only TED Talks, they reported positive views on summaries after being free to pick the videos they want to summarize. This might be attributable to extensive listening, which has links with self-selected materials (Waring, 2008). Allowing students to choose their materials and freedom to pick their own activities alleviates reticence (Zhang & Head, 2010). It is noteworthy to mention a gap between the goal of the video summary task and its perception by the learners. The learners mainly considered the task to help them increase their speaking. This finding brings to light a very important struggle that students face in the ELT programs in Turkey. Before being placed in this program, the students take a national English language test that only assesses reading, vocabulary, and grammar. The test does not assess listening, speaking, or pronunciation skills. Therefore, the students in ELT programs need to develop these skills because they will be English language teachers. A study on ELT students’ agenda after graduation revealed plans to develop speaking skills as they believed that they were not proficient users of the language (Kartal & Özmen, 2018).

Students listened to native speakers and their classmates. In doing so, while they were practicing their speaking, the participants who were listening to them were practicing their listening comprehension skills at different levels, ranging from decoding phonics to implied meaning or gist of the summaries. Luo’s (2016) findings showed that the majority of the participants found listening to their peers’ recordings beneficial for their own pronunciation. This corresponds to Rieber’s (2006) finding, which implied that comparing native speakers’ pronunciation helps participants revise their own pronunciation problems. The participants also reported perceived benefits from giving feedback. This is parallel to the findings of Martin and Sippel (2021), who found evindence that peer correction in pronunciation learning is also helpful for the giver. The participants reported that WhatsApp allowed them to listen to their own recordings and be evaluated by their friends, which made them feel good, and thus they could increase self-assessment and peer-assessment. WhatsApp’s use as a feedback tool was found to be effective (Soria et  al., 2020).

The results also revealed the technological affordances of the WhatsApp, i.e. ease of use and accessibility. The learners should focus on the learning process rather than the technological tools (Harris & Hofer, 2011) in a learning environment because the technology itself does not embody independent pedagogy (Reinders & Hubbard, 2013). Also, learners are not eager to use technology they consider intrusive or difficult to use (Kukulska-Hulme & Shield, 2007). On the other hand, WhatsApp was already used by all of the participants. One of WhatsApp’s technological affordances is that it can alert students immediately to a message, thus allowing them to respond with one click easily. Also, the participants mentioned accessibility as another technological affordance of WhatsApp. Therefore, the current study’s findings showed that students’ perceptions were concentrated on the learning dimension rather than on the technology itself. A few participants stated some challenges and concerns about unwillingness to participate in group work and distractors. Similar findings were also found in previous studies. Cetinkaya and Sütçü (2018), for instance, reported complaints about unnecessary messages in WhatsApp.

# 6.  Conclusions

In the spirit of the DBR, this study aimed to examine the potential of WhatsApp-supported speaking practice with the tasks of speed reading, singing a song, tongue twisters, and video summary with students in a large speaking class. The results demonstrated that the students had positive reactions to the adopted approach and saw benefits in pronunciation and speaking. There are some implications of the findings. First, these findings may encourage the use of WhatsApp in large EFL classes because it is challenging for the teacher to deal with pronunciation in these classrooms. Teachers can use the adopted approach with the same tasks. In so doing, teachers can give sufficient feedback to each student, which is a burden in large classes (Luo, 2016). In this study, all the participants maintained that WhatsApp is one of the most frequently used apps among their peers and integrating in-class learning with this app helped them utilize the tenets of out-of-class learning more often. Keeping this in mind, language teachers try to improve their teaching methods to foster students’ success, enjoyment, and motivation (Ludke, 2018). The adopted approach showed that WhatsApp could be employed to reach these goals. The findings showed that peer feedback abates the teacher’s burden. Therefore, teachers may consider utilizing peer feedback using WhatsApp. Another implication of the current study is that the teacher should consider whether or not to correct pronunciation errors, and if so, when and how. However, peer feedback should not result in the constant interruption of the students’ performance.

Some limitations should be mentioned. First, communication was asynchronous, i.e. students did not speak simultaneously. Second, the study did not use a speaking test to track the improvement regarding speaking skills. Lastly, this qualitative case study cannot show all the complexities of students’ online learning. The findings and limitations imply some future research directions. A future study may compare whether students perform differently in synchronous and asynchronous speeches. Future studies may collect quantitative data and conduct some speaking and pronunciation tests. Also, a study may consider employing simultaneous shadowing and synchronous communication with the same tasks. Thus, future research can compare how learners perform differently in synchronous and asynchronous speaking. Despite these limitations, when the context of the study and the general outputs of the WhatsApp tasks are considered, it can be concluded that the adopted approach demonstrates how WhatsApp can contribute to language learning in a large speaking class in the related context. Examining how the adopted pedagogy helps EFL learners in different settings after addressing the limitations is now needed.
