# Abstract

It is commonly assumed that most courses taking place in an English for Academic Purposes setting at universities are, in the main, concerned with various EAP issues, such as listening to lectures and writing academic reports (lab reports, final-year undergraduate project reports and dissertations etc.). This article describes a course which, while taking place in an academic setting, is designed to equip undergraduates with general skills training in English for Occupational Purposes (EOP) practices to meet students’ future communication needs after graduation. EOP skills would include report writing (status; recommendation; proposal) and giving business presentations. A main feature of this EOP-oriented course is that it does not rely on any one single approach to syllabus design, but takes an eclectic approach by drawing on elements from a task-based syllabus, a textbased syllabus, and a content-based syllabus for the design of the programme, types of syllabi which can be considered as more established and traditional ones. However, the course is not solely designed with the aim of preparing students for workplace demands purely from an ‘accommodationist’ stance. It also attempts to address some of the more critical approaches to pedagogy whereby students are gently encouraged to develop a critical awareness of workplace practices in order that change might be implemented, where possible.

# 1. Introduction

English for Occupational Purposes (EOP) courses can be considered as a type of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) (see Robinson, 1991, p. 3, for a classification of all the main areas under ESP). Many different syllabus types have been proposed for ESP instruction: structural, situational, functional-notional, task-based, text-based, contentbased (see Feez, 2002; Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Jordan, 1997 for overviews of these different types of syllabi). Whichever type of syllabus is implemented is, to a large extent, dependent on a previously conducted needs analysis which may not only examine the target situation, i.e., what learners are required to do, but also consider learning needs, i.e., how are learners best motivated to acquire the language and skills revealed through the target situation analysis (see Hutchinson & Waters, 1987). However, in reality, many syllabi constructed by course designers for their in-house courses do not neatly fall into one specific category, but draw on aspects of two or three different syllabus types. Moreover in recent years, the notion that ESP instruction should not merely address pragmatic concerns, that is, enhance students’ literacies to ease their acculturation into various academic and professional communities, but also empower students by helping them to develop a critical awareness of those very institutions in order to facilitate change, has been gaining ground (Benesch, 2001; Pennycook, 1997). But these are far from mainstream concerns, as pointed out by Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002, p. 10), “in many ways these are still voices on the margins, and EAP has yet to seriously confront these issues.”

This article will exemplify how a communication skills course at a tertiary institution in Hong Kong combines elements from a task-based syllabus (Ellis, 2003; Littlewood, 2004; Nunan, 1989; Skehan, 1996), a text-based syllabus (Feez, 2002) and a content-based syllabus, Content-Based Instruction (CBI) (Brinton & Master, 1997; Brinton, Snow, & Wesche, 1989; Kasper, 2000; Pally, 1999; Snow & Brinton, 1997), with aspects of Benesch’s (2001) critical pedagogy. At the same time, the course also aims to equip students with oral and written literacies (Barton, Hamilton, & Ivanic, 2000), which will enable them to achieve real-world goals.

In the following Section I first review aspects of the three afore-mentioned approaches to syllabus design, which are pertinent to the design of the communication skills course discussed in this article. I then give a summary of the key findings of the needs analysis that was carried out. This is followed by an application of the needs analysis to the design of the communication skills course, which combines features from all three of the syllabus types outlined below.

# 2. Approaches to syllabus design

A task-based syllabus is concerned with purposeful activities which learners might be expected to engage in real-life situations. As Ellis (2003) points out, this type of syllabus also puts emphasis on meaning and communication, where students are primarily “users” rather than “learners” of the language. Learners may switch their attention to form when performing a task, but the code is seen as peripheral to the focus on meaning. These key features are encapsulated in Skehan’s (1996, p. 50) definition of task as “an activity in which: meaning is primary; there is some sort of relationship to the real world; task completion has some priority; and the assessment of task performance is in terms of task outcome.”

In a text-based syllabus, as its name suggests, the content for such a syllabus is based on whole texts. Another key element of this type of syllabus is that this content is “selected in relation to learner needs and the social contexts which learners wish to access” (Feez, 2002, p. 3). This approach to syllabus design draws on the Australian tradition of genre, which emphasizes the social contexts in which genres are constructed, and how language is used in these contexts. In this approach, the pedagogy is very much influenced by the concept of empowering disadvantaged learners to make progress through mastery of key genres, i.e., those genres necessary for advancement in the workplace. The text-based syllabus also has aspects in common with the task-based approach in that it sees language as a functional rather than formal artefact, to be used as a resource for meaning-making and for achieving purposeful goals. In fact, proponents of this type of syllabus are keen to point out that it can be considered as a type of mixed syllabus.

There are three well-known models of CBI: thematic, sheltered and adjunct, which are all designed to help students with their university content courses. However, they differ in their orientations towards language and content: “in the theme-based model, it is the primary aim of the course to help students develop second language competence, while in the sheltered model, the primary aim is to help students master content material” (Brinton et al., 1989, p. 18). In the adjunct model, as the name implies, the language course is linked with a content course which both share the same content base. With this shared focus on content, the rationale behind the adjunct model is that “the linked courses will assist students in developing academic coping strategies and cognitive skills which will transfer from one discipline to another” (Brinton et al., 1989, p. 17). In this type of syllabus, language is also seen as functional and is integrated with the teaching of content. Moreover, Pally (1999) emphasizes the “sustained” nature of much CBI, putting forward the case that students can only develop and hone the rhetorical and argumentative skills associated with particular subject disciplines through sustained, incremental practice over a period of time.

# 3. Needs-based syllabus design

The communication skills course described in this article is a one-semester course of 30 contact hours for second-year undergraduate science students at a tertiary institute in Hong Kong. The rationale for the course has been heavily influenced by the findings of a needs analysis (Wong & Wu, 1998), which surveyed 581 students and 56 lecturers in the School of Science for their opinions on the renewal of the English curriculum. Two key recommendations for future directions of the program were:

† To give equal emphasis to EAP and EOP in future courses;   
† To use science-related topics as well as other sources to provide variety and interest in course content.

One of the reasons why both the students and subject lecturers prefer the course to be EOP-oriented, rather than purely EAP-based, is that students are not often required to make oral presentations or engage in extended writing in their content courses.

Although EOP courses are usually considered as in-service training, providing trainees with the skills to operate more effectively in English, they can also be delivered “preexperience,” in this case in an EAP setting (see Robinson, 1991, p. 3). These differences between what Robinson refers to as “pre-experience” and “simultaneous/in-service” also have implications for the type of EOP-oriented course offered. The rationale for deciding what kind of EOP-oriented EAP courses to offer is given below, together with an overview of how this course is accommodated within the 3-year curriculum.

In the present set-up students take a general EAP course in their first year, which focuses on writing an academic paper using secondary sources and giving an oral presentation. In the first semester of their second year, more specific EAP areas are covered, such as the writing of lab reports, moving to a more EOP focus in the latter part of the semester. In this component, students are trained in persuasive memo writing, where they are expected to support or oppose certain policies, views or suggestions, which recycles the argument structure (i.e., putting forward arguments, refuting counterarguments, giving supporting evidence etc.) presented in writing an academic paper of the first-year course. This memo writing component also has the advantage of providing students with useful writing practice for the General Training Writing module of the IELTS writing exam, which many students in Hong Kong are keen to take now that this exam has been adopted as an exit text for tertiary students in Hong Kong.

A report writing module introducing students to the general principles of writing an analytical report with a follow-up oral presentation would seem to be a logical extension of the previous language programmes for various reasons. Most importantly, report writing has been specifically mentioned by lecturers in the needs analysis as deserving attention: “in their opinion, students should be taught to use English for a variety of work-related purposes, e.g. .business reports, memos, proposals”(Wong & Wu, 1998, p. 11). Secondly, the analytical nature of report writing, in which alternative solutions are often put forward and their merits and demerits discussed, would also be an extension of argumentation students have been introduced to in previous courses. Thirdly, a general report writing module bridges the gap between EAP-oriented report writing, such as lab reports and finalyear undergraduate project reports, and more EOP-oriented report writing, as all these reports basically follow a similar organizational structure (i.e. Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion and Conclusion/Recommendations). For this reason, the report writing module described in the following section could also be viewed as advanced EAP.

In addition to the needs analysis referred to above detailing students’ and lecturers’ views on curriculum renewal, another needs analysis exists which also sought to solicit the views of employers (Conway, 1995). This analysis revealed that report writing in general, and proposal writing, specifically in response to tender briefs, have also been singled out by Hong Kong employers as key professional documentation fresh graduates will encounter in the target occupational contexts. A large-scale needs analysis conducted by the Open University of Hong Kong (1999), which received responses from 488 employers, found that the skill rated highest by employers was problem-solving, followed by logical reasoning. This provides further evidence for structuring an EOP-oriented course around report writing of a problem-based nature.

The justification for such a report writing module in the second semester of the second year rather than delaying it until just before graduation is based on scheduling constraints.

The science faculty have requested that students should receive only one semester of English in the third year to leave them time for preparing for finals and completing finalyear project reports in the second semester of the third year. There is therefore no choice but to schedule the report writing in the second year as an introduction to the basic principles of report writing, which are then extended and refined in a third-year module on proposal writing.

As for the second recommendation put forward in the needs analysis (Wong & Wu, 1998), that general interest as well as science topics should be used, this stems from the fact that science graduates do not necessarily enter a science-related field upon graduation. Even though students may wish to take up a technical post, for example, as a laboratory assistant, very few of these types of jobs are available as Hong Kong is basically a financial, commercial and service-oriented city. In fact, the needs analysis makes the key point that most graduates will find themselves working in the commercial sector or public service (e.g., as sales representatives, junior executives or management trainees), which seldom demand scientific knowledge or skills. Such background information lends further weight to the view that a broad-based EOP course which improves students’ general level of competence in English in the area of report writing and oral presentation skills would be more appropriate than a narrow-focused EAP course (see Dudley-Evans & St John, 1998, p. 150 for further discussion of broad vs. narrow focus).

The various needs analyses referred to above point to the fact that all stakeholders (students, lecturers, employers) seem to be in general agreement that students should be trained in logical thinking and problem-solving and be proficient in producing various kinds of analytical reports. The following sections describe the course which exploits workplace reports for a group research project students undertake, which may or may not be discipline-focused depending on the project area chosen.

# 4. Application of needs analysis: an integrated syllabus

Key findings from the needs analyses referred to in the previous section have provided the rationale for offering a broad-based report writing module in the form of a group research project. In the following sections, I describe how this target outcome is delivered in a communication skills course through the integration of a task-based, text-based and CBI-based syllabus. I also consider how Benesch’s (2001) concept of critical pedagogy, whilst not explicitly integrated into the course design, has been addressed through the choice of various project topics.

# 4.1. Task-based perspective

The main components of the group research project in which students carry out research on a particular topic in a group of three to four students, produce a final written report and present their findings and recommendations in a $2 0 \mathrm { - m i n }$ oral presentation to the other groups are presented below (similar ideas for writing activities at advanced levels are given in Grabe & Kaplan, 1996, p. 344–345; Jordan, 1990).

† Choose an area for investigation;   
† Identify a problem/need/demand within this area;   
† Collect data from primary sources (i.e., interviews, observations, survey questionnaires) and secondary sources (i.e., print material, Internet);   
† Analyze and interpret the data collected from secondary and primary sources;   
† State implications/make recommendations for future action.

Students are encouraged to choose areas for investigation related to their own subject disciplines, which tend to be either Hong Kong-based, university-based or controversial in the Hong Kong cultural context. For example, in the past, students have chosen to investigate environmental issues such as the increase in pollution levels in Hong Kong, the level of environmental awareness among university students, laboratory safety practices, and the issue of organ donation, which is controversial from a cultural perspective. However, we also allow students to research non-science issues for reasons given in the needs analysis (i.e., many science students take up posts in the commercial and service fields rather than technical fields). Previous research topics that students have chosen based on current academic or administrative university concerns include the allocation of residence places for undergraduate students, mobile phone networking on the campus, and the opportunity to do a final year project in their content courses (as not all the science departments offer this choice within their own curriculum).

Although it is impossible to totally replicate a workplace writing situation, the student research projects do go some way towards simulating a professional writing task for the following reasons. In order to collect their data, students are required to communicate and interact with people in a workplace situation. Students are also writing to a real audience, that is, either university authorities, e.g., Student Affairs Office, academic departmental heads, or outside organizations such as the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department or the Hong Kong Tourist Association, rather than an imaginary one. In fact, the best reports are sent to the departments concerned, which have, in a few cases, taken up the recommendations outlined in the student reports. Another advantage of this simulation is that it opens the eyes of the students to the real workplace situation and sensitizes them to the fact that certain problematic issues may be more difficult to solve than originally anticipated because of various constraints, e.g. budget limitations. Also, it has been found that allowing students to choose their own topic (with guidance from the tutor) is an important motivational factor.

While not wholly CBI-based, in the traditional sense, this communication skills course does share features in common with certain CBI approaches, as described in the following section.

# 4.2. Content-based perspective

Most of the case studies in the literature discuss the implementation of CBI at secondary or university level for academic purposes. The programme reported on in this article in part adopts a CBI approach to workplace communication taking place in an academic setting. While the project topics may be of a general interest nature (e.g., allocation of residence places for undergraduate students) or loosely related to students’ subject discipline (e.g., the level of environmental awareness among students), the input material for the course is CBI-oriented. The course makes use of authentic environmental reports, which are related to the science students’ disciplines, to familiarize them with the basic principles of writing an analytical report using content-based material. This course thus has most in common with the thematic type of CBI as it is content-based in orientation, but text and language-based in its main focus. Another important feature of the course is that it takes up Pally’s (1999) assertion that CBI is best delivered through sustained instruction. Students work on the project throughout the whole 15-week semester, first spending time on refining the objective and scope of their project topic, and then producing an outline and refining a draft before writing up the final project report. The text-based aspect of the course is described below.

# 4.3. Text-based perspective

A text-based approach is implemented for the delivery stages of the teaching cycle, which closely follows the five stages outlined in Feez (2002, p. 28) as is shown in Fig. 1:

It has been noted in the previous section that the input material is content-based in that it consists of authentic professional environmental reports. The report discussed here is an environmental audit of a printing and dyeing factory, with recommendations for improvement of factory operations. In the ‘Building the context’ stage, students are introduced to the communicative purpose of the report, that is, to make a recommendation on some environmental issue. Students’ attention is also drawn to the role and relationships of the writer vs. reader, as these have important implications for the register of the report. The writer is often a senior environmental protection officer from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in Hong Kong who has the authority to request that a company, for example, a dyeing and printing factory, make modifications to their manufacturing processes to minimize the amount of pollutants produced.

Fig. 1. Stages of the teaching/learning cycle (Feez, 2002, p. 28).

In the second stage ‘Modelling and deconstructing the text’ students investigate the organizational pattern and lexico-grammatical features of the workplace report. First, students are asked to identify the overall Problem-Solution macrostructure, as this pattern is the main organizing principle for the Findings and Recommendations section (see Hamp-Lyons & Heasley, 1987 for an application of the Problem-Solution pattern to academic and professional writing tasks). Students are then asked to identify the genrebased prototypical move structures (Swales, 1990) in each main section of the report, such as background, purpose, scope and methodology in the Introduction section (see Flowerdew, 1999, 2000, for an exercise typology which combines both the ProblemSolution pattern and genre approaches to the analysis of text). For example, one task requires students to read through the body of the report on Site Operations and then complete the scope section (effluent discharge and chemical waste storage area) of the introduction below:

Both the text-based approach and the CBI approach discussed earlier emphasize that language structures should be examined from the perspective of rhetorical functions within a contextualized framework. Master (2000, p. 98), discussing the role of grammar in CBI, points out that ‘the grammatical items that best lend themselves to exploitation in CBI contexts are those that are linked to rhetorical structure,’ which is the approach adopted in this course.

For example, in the Recommendations section a variety of phrases for giving recommendations is reviewed such as: It is suggested that.; X should be.; X could be.. Students discuss which would be most appropriate for this context depending on the following factors: whether the report is solicited or unsolicited, written internally to a superior or externally to clients, the author/recipient relationship and the importance or urgency of the recommendation. In the case of the authentic workplace reports, which are used as input material for the course, the report is solicited, external and the writer has the authority to request that the company implement the proposed recommendations. Therefore, a phrase such as ‘It is (strongly) recommended that .’ would be appropriate for the sociocultural context. As Celce-Murcia and Olshtain (2000) note, it is not just sufficient for the user to have lexico-grammatical competence, knowledge of the syntax and lexical semantics in the target language, but also pragmatic competence, an understanding of “how to use language in socioculturally appropriate ways, taking into account the participants in a communicative interaction and features of the context within which the interaction takes place (p. 19–20)”.

Another useful language point covered here is the fact that recommendations are not always written in the passive voice, which tends to be a common assumption held by students, no doubt as this is how they are usually presented in textbooks. For example, in another task, after identifying problem statements in the text, students are asked to write a set of recommendations based on these. In some cases, as in the first problem statement in the table below, the active voice is preferred over a passive construction (e.g. gas emissions should be monitored) as the agent, that is, a member of the EPD or the company, has a key role to play in implementing the recommendations.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Problem</td><td>Recommended action</td></tr><tr><td>No one is responsible for monitoring gas emissions</td><td>The EPD or the company should take responsibility for monitoring gas emissions</td></tr><tr><td>A lot of waste water is discharged into a nearby</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>stream and has already exceeded the approved level</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The chemical waste storage area is open and is not. labeled</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

In stage 3 of Feez’ (2002) model ‘Joint construction of the text,’ practice is given to students in constructing different sections of a report, in which repair work on content and language features is also undertaken. Here, I draw students’ attention to the overall coherence of the report relating to the Problem-Solution pattern as this is a weakness in students’ writing. For example, I have found that students sometimes write the scope section of their introductions in a very detailed way rather than in summary form, which sometimes does not correspond with the information in the Findings section. On other occasions, there is a mismatch in students’ writing between the problem statements in the Findings section and the Recommendations section; for example, new ideas are introduced in the Recommendations which have no basis of evidence in the Findings section. Asking students to relate the recommendations back to the problem statements in the Findings section, which in turn, are related back to the scope of the Introduction helps to raise their awareness of the overall coherence and organization of the report. The two tasks outlined above are also designed with this purpose in mind.

In stage 4 ‘Independent construction of the text,’ students work on their own group project reports described previously under task-based perspective, paying particular attention to the specific socio-cultural context in which they are writing. Whereas the author of the professional report used for modeling activities in stage 2 of the teaching/learning cycle is a Senior Environmental Protection Officer who has been assigned responsibility to prepare this report, in contrast, the authors of the HKUST-based reports are second-year students writing an unsolicited recommendation report to the university authorities. The contrasting author/recipient relationships of the two reports obviously have an impact on the language used. In the environmental reports, the recommendations can be worded quite strongly using phrases such as $\mathbf { \epsilon } ^ { \bullet } \mathbf { X }$ should be..’ However, in the student-initiated report to the Student Affairs Office or academic departments, the students would couch their recommendations in tentative language, for example, ‘we would like to suggest that.’, in view of their status vis-a\`-vis the university authorities. The style and tone of report writing which is influenced by the socio-cultural context, is therefore a key language aspect which is also viewed as falling within the domain of CBI:

All meaningful language communication typically combines formal accuracy and relevant content within every utterance or written sentence. The two components work together to serve communication needs.. Such socio-cultural approaches are generally consistent with CBI. (Grabe & Stoller, 1997, p. 7)

As far as form is concerned, all three approaches to syllabus design advocate dealing with grammar within the context of the content. Master (2000, p. 95–97) cites cases where the content of CBI courses determines the grammatical focus. For example, solving mathematical problems demands the use of prepositions, the passive voice and logical connectors. In the text-based approach, which is underpinned by Halliday’s functional model of language, the actions in formal, written procedural explanations are represented as nominalisations with verbs providing the logical links (Feez, 2002, p. 78). While the importance of form is recognised in the task-based approach, Littlewood (2004) proposes a model which allows for different degrees of focus on form or meaning depending on the teaching purposes.

# 4.4. Critical pedagogies

The critical pedagogy aspect of the course: Why are things the way they are? Who decides? What are the possibilities? has emerged out of some of the project topics chosen by students. In fact, topic choice is, in itself, a contentious issue (see Benesch, 2001, chapter 5, for an invigorating discussion on teacher ‘imposition’ vs. student selected topics). In this regard, Benesch (2001, p. 82) makes the following suggestion: “the most effective way to engage students might be to try a mix of teacher and student choice with whole-class selection of a theme as a third alternative.” However, instead of presenting the afore-mentioned as alternatives, after experimenting with various possibilities, I have found the following format to work best for all parties concerned (project group, peers, teacher). First, I present some examples of projects carried out in previous years, which have had a successful outcome. By successful outcome, I am referring to those projects where the university authorities have taken up, and acted on students’ suggestions (e.g. the provision of more computer express stations in the academic concourse). It could be argued that by presenting such topics, I am overtly encouraging students to engage in topics which would empower them to effect change within the university. But rather, my main aim here is to use these project topics as a motivational tool to demonstrate that the project reports can have real-world significance. Each project group then chooses three possible topics and presents their justification for choosing these topics to the whole class in a following question-and-answer session. Each group finalizes their topic based on the teacher’s and other project groups’ preferences in terms of interest-value and the worthiness of the investigation, thus ensuring that, as far as possible, the choice of topic is a collaborative process.

Carrying out these projects very often gives students a sense of empowerment as they feel they can facilitate change in academic matters. Such projects also raise the issue of power relations existing between undergraduate students and professors who have the status to activate change. Although it may seem rather surprising that undergraduate students could be empowered to effect changes to the academic curriculum, this, in fact, has happened in a small way. For example, a group of biology majors investigating the mismatch between the undergraduate biology curriculum and future career prospects of biology students recommended that more compulsory Mandarin courses be included to give biology students a competitive edge when applying for business-related posts. The students reported that in their interview with the professor concerned, he agreed in principle with their recommendation and said he would raise this issue at a higher level. Yet another project group of physics students took this issue of a vocationally-oriented curriculum one step further by proposing the introduction of minor programmes in business and engineering, based on feedback from student survey questionnaires. They wrote:

But the discussion on minor programs is quite controversial in the university. Some people think these programs are provided based on students’ interests and should not be over-emphasised on their contribution to students’ future career. Another group of people including us believe that the minor programs, as different from the free electives, should be career-oriented in nature. For this reason, a survey has been conducted to show which side is more supported by the Physics undergraduates.

It can be seen that this critical EOP-oriented pedagogy raises challenging questions about the direction of tertiary education, and by extension EAP/EOP provision. It also shows that Benesch’s critical approach to pedagogy, which at the moment is usually considered as peripheral in educational debates, merits a lot more work and discussion.

# 5. Conclusion

This article has described an EOP-oriented course which draws on elements of three different, but somewhat related approaches to syllabus design: task-based, content-based and text-based. It has also shown how Benesch’s notion of a critical pedagogy has been addressed within these more traditional approaches to syllabus design through the choice of topics for the task-based group project. At the same time, the article has also raised questions concerning power relations in making recommendations, and the whole ethos of university education, as uncovered by the project topics, issues which themselves demand far more debate in the literature than they have been accorded in the past.

In a recent paper, Watson Todd (2003, p. 154) has raised the point that much previous work in EAP has focused more on the content of teaching than on the methodology, and calls for a more balanced approach where students’ learning needs, i.e., the how are given equal weighting to their language needs, i.e., the what. It is suggested that the course described in this article goes some way towards attaining a more balanced approach in that the language needs are met by the content-based and text-based elements of the course, whereas students’ learning needs are addressed in the task-based element and the adoption of Benesch’s notion of a critical pedagogy. In light of the student project topics, another dimension that could be added to a consideration of learning needs is why?
