# Policies, politics, and ideologies of English-Medium Instruction in Asian universities: Unsettling critical edgesPramod K. Sah, Fan Fang, in: . Routledge, New York (2023). p. 216 pp 104.00, ISBN: 978-1-032- 00183-8

Against the backdrop of the increasing intenationalization of Higher Education (HE), English has increasingly been taken as the de facto language of knowledge (e.g. Fang & Hu, 2022), which has led to the recent rise of English-Medium Instruction (EMI) in various contexts, especiall in Asia. Over the last couple of decades, much scholarly attention has been paid to various aspects of EMI including the perceptions and practces of stakeholders and the efectiveness of EMI programmes (e.g. Hu & Lei, 2014). However, there has been surprisingly ittle scholarship exploring how English as a hegemonic global language has created an unequal space for students and teachers in the HE context in Asia. Pramod K Sah and Fan Fang's Policies, Politics, and Ideologies of English-Medium In struction in sianniversites ill this auna by providing an exclusive and critical diussion f EM at multiingual universities across Asia. The volume is part of the Routledge Studies in English-medium Instruction series under the general editorship of Diane Pecorari and Hans Malmstrom.

This 216-page volume's appeal is underpinned by inspiring reflections from Ryuko Kubota (Foreword) and Andy Kirkpatrick (Afterword) on critical isues related to the hidden inequalitiescreated by EMI programmes and possible altenatives to the current situation. This edited volume contains 13chapters written by an exciting line-up of both emerging and leading scholars, who critically unpack EMI policy, processes and practices at universities across Asia,including Central Asia (Kazakhstan), East Asia (China, Korea and Japan), South Asia (Bangladesh and Nepal), Southeast Asia (Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam), and West Asia (United Arab Emirates). The introductory chapter (Chapter 1) written by the two editors provides a thought-provoking overview of the growth of EMI programmes in Asia and argues against the uncritical promotion of EMI instruction in multilingual and multicultural universities. Continuing this citical thred, the remaining chapters are further divided into three parts: Part 1 deals with macro-level EMI policies, Part 2 with micro-level language ideologies and practices in EMI programmes, and Part 3 with educational and social inequalities in EMI programmes.

Part 1 (Chapters 2 to 5) i concerned with EMI policies in the contexts of Kazakhstan, Japan, Nepal, and Taiwan. The overarching theme in Part 1 isthe hidden agendas embedded in EMI policy at the national and institutional levels. Chapter 2, written by Sulushash Kerimkulova, Bridget Goodman and Kamila Aitzhanova, presents an examination of key policy documents and interviews with stu. dents faculty and administrators, using these to explore how the development of MI policies in Kazakhstan is framed by discourses of internationalization, as in other Asian countries. Similarly, in Chapter 3, Samantha Curle, Yuwei Lin and Ikuya Aizawa report on the challenges for learning and teaching brought about by EMI programmes, such as difficulty comprehending instructions in English and ineffective classroom ineractions. In Chapter 4, Karna Rana and Pramod Sah outline how EMI has become a widespread de facto practice acros HE institutions in Nepal, although the Nepali government has not enacted any explicit policies favouring EML Enthusiasm for EMI instruction among Nepali students and teachers is driven by Nepal's low economic development and the resulting demand for English qualifications tosucceed in the global job market. The significant differences between the situations in Nepal, Kazakhstan, and Japan highlight the need for more comparative studies adressing EMI policies and teaching practices in countries with varied economic statuses. Meanwhile, Chapter 5, written by Kao Chia-Ling Gupta and Angel M.Y. Lin, reveals misalignments between proposed EMI policy goals and actual policy outcomes in Taiwan's HE context.

Part 2 (Chapters 6 to 10) unpacks language ideologie, beliefs and practices in EMI programmes in the contexts of Vietnam, Korea, Brunei, China, Thailand and Malaysia. To be more specific, this part examines the M (Medium of Instruction) in EMI, i.e, whether it should stand for \*English-medium" or "English-mixed" (with local vernacular languages). Chapter 6, by Roger Barnard, Zuwati Hasim and Banchakarn Sameephet, finds that lecturers in Malaysia exclusively use an English-only approach, whil those in Thailand opt for the mixed use of English and local languages in their EMI teaching practice. In Chapter 7, Kari Sahan, Nicola Galloway and Jim McKinley reveal that in both Thailand and Vietnam, although lecturers and students express positive attitudes toward the use of local languages, they support using English to the maximum possible extent in actual teaching practice. Chapter 8, by Ishamina Athirah Gardiner, Sarah Boye and Suciyati Sulaiman, moves to the context of Brunei, where a bilingual (English and Malay) educational system has been in place for over three decades. This chapter mainly investigates students perspectives of EMI and finds a high level of support for the mixing of English and Malay in both academic and social settings. Rui Yuan and Xuyan Qiu, in Chapter 9, focus on EMI teaching in China and reveal misaligment between EMI teachers beliefs and practices in language use. Chapter 10 by Juyoung Song, investigating language use and Medium of Instruction (Mol) policies in four EMI courses and two non-EMI courses at two Korean universities, finds flexible language use and no clear MoI policies in both EMI and non-EMI courses.

Part 3 (Chapters 11 through 13), mainly questioning the E" (\*English") in EMI programmes, discusses the educational and social inequalitie that result from EMI policies inthe context of the Philippines, Bangladesh, and the United Arab Emirates. The main leson of this part of the book relate to the domnance f English and its entanglement with neolieral idology, and the resulting inequalities faced by students with low English proficiency and those from lessaffluent social backgrounds. Chapter 11,contributed by Ruanni Tupas and Romylyn Metila, explores EMI in the Philppines, a country which has previously been subject to both Spanish and American colonial governance. This chapter demonstrates how neoliberal and colonial discourses function together to perpetuate the dominant status of the English language, thus creating inequalities in society. In Chapter 12, examining the context of Bangladesh, Md. Al Amin and M. Obaidul Hamid reveal four types of inequalities that EMI programmes create for students who previously atended Bangla medium public schoos: systemic, academic, instrumental and social. The last chapter, Chapter 13, written by Sarah Hopkyns, focuses on the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where HE institutions are either exclusively EMI or dominated by EMI, although Arabic is the official language in the public sphere. Employing a mixed-method multiple case study approach, this chapter problematises the un. derlying monolingual and neoliberal ideologies in EMI discourses and highlights the need to make significant changes to current EMI discourses.

As a whole, this edited volume is clearly organised and thought-provoking, and is the first to provide this type of critical examination of EMI policy, proces, and practice at multilingual universitie in Asia. Arguing against the bind and uncritical embrace of EMI in higher eucation (Hu & Lei, 2014), the 13 chapters n this volume lay out several key themes that warrant further discusson, such as the neoliberal ideology embedded in EMI policy, the benefits and challenges of EMI programmes, and teachers' agentic roles.

Despite itstrength, a minor shortcoming of the bookis its lack of specificity in the use of some terms. For example, the term \*roficiency is used 209 times cross multiple chapters, referring to ither students language proficiency, EMI lecturers proficiency or both. There sems to be lile discussion of the distinction between general English proficiency as mesured  geeral Englis tests such as TOEFL) and academic English proficiency (as provided by a general EAP class in the context of EMI teaching and learning. Another isue concerns the participants. Across the different studies in the volume, the participants are limited to teachers and stu. dents. As revealed in many chapters in this book and in ther releant studies (e.g. Hu & Lei, 2014), EMI i usuall a top-down language policy initiated by relevant Ministries of Education or by universty authorite. A more subtle and in-depth understanding of the EMI agenda might be produced by inviting high-level policymakers and bureaucrats to participate in future studies. Finally, the studies described in the book's chapters primarily employ methods such as interviews, questionnaires, and classroom observations. While these approaches can generate useful insights, a more critical understanding of implicit ideologies might have been produced by incorporating additional methods such as critical discourse analysis.

Such issues notwithstanding, the ook provides an urgently needed critical perspective on EMI policies and practice in HE contexts across Asia. This volume is a stimulating read for students and scholars in applied lingustics, EMI, EAP, HE pedagogy, and language education. As Andy Kirkpatrick notes in the Afterword of this book, there is as yet, no clear understanding or agrement about how to implement EMI courses and programmes. (p.204) Transforming the status quo of EMI programmes requires persistent efforts and long-term vision (Kubota, Foreword). This book provides an invaluable first step.
