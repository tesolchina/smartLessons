EFL graduate students often require EAP reading and writing proficiency to fulfill graduation requirements. These skills gain more importance as English medium instruction becomes increasingly prevalent. However, limited research has investigated EFL graduate students' EAP reading and writing needs, and their perceptions of EAP courses. To address this gap, this study identified the EAP reading and writing needs of Taiwanese graduate students and investigated both students' and teachers' perceptions of EAP courses. By surveying 1155 students and interviewing 62 participants, this study identified several themes. First, master's students mainly needed EAP reading, but their writing needs considerably increased when they continued doctoral studies. Second, professors showed greater concern about students' problems than the students. While not perceiving reading and writing as challenging, students reported more problems with reading and writing speed, with those in science and engineering facing more difficulties than their counterparts. However, less than $3 0 \%$ of the students took EAP courses, and they expressed low-to-medium satisfaction. Drawing from the participants' feedback, an EAP reading and writing curriculum framework is proposed. This framework is grounded in the needs of Taiwanese graduate students and is believed to serve the greatest interests of students in Taiwan and other similar contexts.

# 1. Introduction

As English has become the lingua franca of academic knowledge production and dissemination, participating in global academic communication requires the abilit to read and write scientific English with a nuanced understanding of the language of the specialty" (Bazerman et al., 2012, p. 236). In addition, to compete in global rankings, many universities in EFL contexts, such as Taiwan, have been increasing EMI courses and requiring graduate students to disseminate their research findings at intenational conferences and journals. However, this often poses challenges to the students (e.g., Huang, 2010).

Needs analysis is essential for identifying students EAP problems and designing efective EAP courses (Brown, 2016). Needs analysis can be conducted before courses to understand students neds and after courses are delivered to examine if the courses have met the nds. Previous nees analysis literatre mostly examined undergraduates neds (e.., Liu et al., 2011. Some studies targeted graduate students in English-speaking countries (., Shen t a., 2019), and  few small-scale studies in non-nglish-spking contexts (e.g., Nejadghanbar et al., 2022). EFL graduate students EAP needs have not been fully explored, especially in Taiwan.

While universities have offered EAP courses to Taiwanese graduate students,little is known about whether the courses have appropriately prepared students. Since EAP courses are seldom designed based on students' needs (Cortes, 2019), thir efectiveness needs to be reviewed. Moreover, with EMI being increasingly prevalent in EFL countrie, how to design EAP courses that better prepare students wil become more important than ever. Previous studies either targeted EAP programs designed for international students in English-speaking countries (e.g., Tweedie & Kim, 2015), undergraduate EAP programs in EFL contexts (e.g., Yirekli, 2012), or individual EAP courses (e.g., Huang, 2017; Pavanell, 2018). Large-scale investigations into EAP courses for graduate students in EFL contexts are lacking.

To address the gaps above, this study conducted a large-scale survey to investigate the EAP reading and writing needs of EFI graduate students and stakeholders' perceptions of EAP courses in Taiwan. EAP courses here, f not specified, refer to reading and writing courses. Two research questions are addressed.

1. What are the perceived EAP reading and writing needs of Taiwanese graduate students?   
2. What are Taiwanese graduate students' and professors' perceptions of EAP courses?

# 2. EAP needs analysis

Needs analysis i essential for EAP courses because it identifies the ideal course content and teaching methods (Flowerdew, 2013) Hutchinson and Waters (1987) developed a learning-centered approach that emphasizes target needs and learning needs. Necessities, one of the tat neds, are the abilities that stdnts require o unction successully in the trt siation. For EFL gradate students, EAP reading and writing necessties include the competence to comprehend and write a variet of academic genres to fulfill degree requirements. Another target need, lacks, refers to the gap between the required proficiency in the target situation and students current proficiency. While target needs are considered both the starting point and destination of a journey, learning needs are considered \*the route of the journey" (Hutchinson & Waters, 1987, p. 60). Learning needs in EAP include learners' and learning conditions, such as graduate students' learning motivations and the arrangement of EAP courses. Grounded in this framework, this study attempted to identify the genres EFL graduate students needed to read and write in ther respective fields, their EAP reading and writing difficulties, and to understand their perceptions of the existing EAP courses.

# 2.1. EAP reading and writing needs from different perspectives

Most of the EAP needs analysis research has been conducted to understand students' lacks. Previous findings generall agreed that academic writing was very important yet the most challenging for EFL scholars and students alike (Durmusoglu Kose et al., 2019, Holden & Blake, 2022; Liu et al., 2011). Reported writing problems include academic writing style, structure, and language characteristics of academic genres, such as clear and concise expressions, writing literature reviews and discussions, and using appropriate academic language (Cai, 2013, 2017; Gea-Valor, et al., 2014). In Taiwan, a study revealed that Taiwanese graduate students had trouble translating culture-specific terms into English (Ho, 2013).

Less research examined students' EAP reading challenges. A few investigations into EFL readers from different education levels identified various problems, such as having limited vocabulary (Hellekjar, 2009; Phakiti & Li, 2011), comprehending different genres (Durmusoglu Kose et al., 2019), analyzing and synthesizing texts (Nejadghanbar e al., 2022; Padagas & Hajan, 2020), and managing reading load (Hellekjaer, 2009; Nejadghanbar e al., 2022). A study examining six Taiwanese nursing undergraduates reading of RAs indicated that vocabulary and discipline-related knowledge were important factors in determining students' reading comprehension (Wen, 2013). Another study similarly found that Taiwanese graduate students had medium-to-high levels of reading diffculties, mostly related to limited vocabulary and low reading speed. (Chen, 2017).

Research also compared the perceptions of ifferent groups, mostly undergraduates and professors (e.g., Abdolrezapour & Tavakoli, 2013). Previous findings showed that professors and undergraduates had different perceptions of the importance of writing tasks and that students rated their abilities sgnficantly more highly than professors (Caplan & Stevens, 2017). Similarl, another survey in Iran showed different perceptions of professors and undergraduate regarding the ned to learn writing and grammar; however, both groups considered reading comprehension of specialized textbooks and RAs as a main skill to be learned, albeit to different degrees (Afshar & Movassagh, 2016).

# 2.2. Evaluation of EAP courses

Relatively few studies have evaluated EAP courses in the EFL context. Several showed that EAP courses in EFL countries sometimes received negative comments, the major reasons being unmotivating teaching approaches and inappropriate emphases on certain skills (Afshar & Movassagh, 2016; Song & Zhou, 2022). Studies in Taiwan also suggested that EAP courses were insuficient and ineffective (Hsieh & Chuang, 2022; Juan, 2015). Previous research found that $7 0 \%$ of the graduate students surveyed in China had never taken EAP courses (Cai, 2017) and that students unwillingnessto ivest in EAP courses resulted from low course credits and tight schedules (Cicek et al., 2022). On the other hand, an inspection into the development of EAP programs found that insufficient qualified EAP instructors and students' lack of general English proficiency were among the major challenges; it thus suggested collaborations between stakeholders in designing and continued monitoring of EAP programs (Petraki & Khat, 2022). One example was found at one Taiwanese universty, where language and subject faculty collaboratively rformed Sophomore English courses by changing them into ESP courses (Tsou, 2009). In this study, a nees analysis informed the reform and the language experts worked with subject experts in material design.

Nonetheless limited research comprehensively examined how EAP courses prepared EFL graduate students with urgent EAP reading and writing needs, especiall in Taiwan. Moreover, revious reearch rarely compared their needs across educational levels and fields. This study thus aimed to fill the gaps.

# 3. English language education in Taiwan higher education

There exists no overarching, nation-wide EAP policies in Taiwan. At the undergraduate level, students are required to take 4 to 8 credits of Freshman English (usually EGP) and 2 to 4 credits of electives that include EGP and ESP courses. However, few academic writing courses are offred. According to the undergraduate course maps at two Taiwanese universtie, merely five out of 28 and two out of 23 courses focused on writing, and they are all electives (Kao, 2020).

English courses offered to graduate students are mostly EAP courses, but they are insufficient in number (Hsieh & Chuang, 2022). The course ffering is decentralized faculties have much freedom for pedagogies and materials (Lin, 2023). Some EAP courses are housed in language centers and taught by language instructors, whereas others are in individual programs and taught by content scholars. These courses are usually elective and sometimes are excluded from students' graduation credits. Overall AP courses are housed in different faculties between which no clear communication and delineation of responsibilities exist (Minstry of Education, 2021).

To enhance students' global competitiveness and English proficiency, the Taiwan government has promoted EMI (Lin, 2023). In 2020, around $5 \%$ of the undergraduate courses and $1 0 { - } 3 0 \%$ of the graduate courses are EMI courses (Ministry of Education, 2021). However, the definition of EMI courses is broad and vague. As most of the students in the EMI courses are domestic students, the percentage of English ranges from a combination of Chinese and English to Chinese-medium instruction with English language materials (Lin, 2019). A clear direction for EMI implementation and a systematic design of EAP curricula as asupportive mechanism, are thus strongly needed (Ministry of Education, 2021).

# 4. Methods

This study adopted a mixed-method design. Quantitative data were collcted from a large-scale survey involving master's and doctoral students; qualitative data were collected from interviews with students and professors.

# 4.1. Survey

A needs-analysis questionnaire was adapted from previous literature (e.g, Evans & Green, 2007; Phakiti & Li, 2011) and revised based on informal conversations with Taiwanese graduate students at the author's institution. The survey was then piloted on 151 students from four research-oriented universities in Taiwan. No participants reported confusion or suggested revisions. The finalized questionnaire first asked about students' disciplines, graduation requirements, and the genres required to read and write during their study. The next section asked students to identify their difficulties in EAP reading and writing, and the final section asked them to evaluate the existing AP courses, uch as their course satisfaction and thir reasons for not taking the courses. Both sections were raed on a five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire was written in Chinese to avoid misunderstanding. Cronbach a was calculated to evaluate the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The $\alpha$ values for the two sections using a five-point Likert scale (difficulties and course perceptions) were 0.92 and 0.91, indicating good reliability (Dornyei & Taguchi, 2010).

An invitation email with the link to the questionnaire was sent to students from 10 research-oriented universities in Taiwan (not the universities from the piot study) that were granted governmental funding from the Aim for The Top University Project (Minstry of Education, Taiwan, 2013), which specifically aimed at improving the world rankings of Tawanese universties. Compared with other universitie, these universities were ssumed to posess more resources for improving graduate students' EAP literacy. Because students' email addresses could not be accessed, department secretaries were contacted by phone and asked to forward the invitation emails all but two secretaries agreed. Finally, 1155 valid responses from 895 master's students and 260 doctoral students were collected. Among the respondents, $3 9 . 2 \%$ were from science and engineering (SE), $1 9 . 7 \%$ from social sciences (SS), $1 5 . 7 \%$ from medical and life sciences (ML), $1 4 . 4 \%$ from arts and humanities (AH), and $1 1 \%$ from business and management (BM).

# 4.2. Interviews

Recruitment of students for interviews began with an invitation at the end of the questionnaire; the participants left their contact information if they agree to be interviewed. Agreeing participants were grouped by their universty and EAP course experience, four students were randomly selected from each group and contacted by email with a formal invitation that also asked participants to provide signed informed consent. If a participant did not reply, another two rounds of email invitations were sent after 3-day interal. If a participant sill did not reply, another participant from the same group was randomly selected and contacted. In total, 40 par. ticipants were interviewed (27 master's students and 13 doctoral students). Full-time professors from the same universities were invited by email with a similar procedure; 22 professors were interviewed. $2 6 \%$ of the interviewed participants were from SE, $2 1 \%$ from SS, $1 9 \%$ from ML, $1 8 \%$ from BM, and $1 6 \%$ from AH.

The interviews were semi-structured and designed to elicit information that complemented survey results. The students were invited to share their leaning experiences and obstacles and to elaborate on their survey response, such as providing reasons for ther highest and lowest rating. The teachers were asked about their students necessities and difficultie, as well s current EAP courses. Because of the long distances between the researcher and participants, the interviews were conducted individually by phone. The interviews, which lasted $1 5 { - } 4 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ , were conducted in Chinese and were audio-recorded.

# 4.3. Data analysis

The quantitative data from the survey were analyzed using SPss for Windows Version 22. The Likert-scale items were scored as follows: $1 =$ strongly disagree, $2 =$ disagree, ${ } ^ { 3 = }$ neither disagree nor agree, $4 = a g r e e$ , and ${ 5 = }$ strongly agree. Descriptive statistics were calculated to understand master's and doctoral students perceptions respectively. For group comparisons, Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were adopted due to the non-normal distributions and unequal sample sizes. Multiple-choice and open-ended questions were analyzed as frequency counts and percentages.

To analyze the interviews, the 27 master's students were coded as M1-M27, the 13 doctoral students were coded as D1-D13, and the 22 professors were coded as P1-P22. The interview responses were analyzed through repeated coding, categorizing, connecting, and reflcting (Richards, 2003). Then, interview data were juxtaposed with survey responses to answer the research questions. For example, in the survey, students did not consider academic reading to be challenging, but professors' evaluation of students' reading competence was much lower. Furthermore, while the students expressed concern about poor reading peed in the survey, the intervie responses suggested that students dificult in deconstructing lengthy and inricat sentences was one of the major factors that slowed down their reading. By comparing survey and interview responses, a more comprehensive understanding emerged.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Survey responses

# 5.1.1. Perceived EAP reading and writing necessities

Students were asked what academic genres they needed to read and writ in English. Table 1 ls their perceptions of EAP reading necessities.

Doctoral and masters students had similar reading requirements, the top two genres being RAs and textbooks. Disciplinary variation is apparent only in experiment reports; more SE and ML students must read experiment reports. The percentage of other genres was considerably low, indicating that most students read limited genres. The other genres suggested by students included monographs/proceedings (AH), programming language/manuals (SE), and Internet sources/English reviews/case studies (S). It should also be noted that $4 . 5 \%$ of the AH master's students did not need to read any English materials.

Table 2 lists the genres that students reported they had to write in English.

Doctoral students had much more writing demands than master's students, especially in RAs. $7 6 \%$ of the doctoral students stated that writig for publication in English was graduation requirement, which stipulated that doctoral students publish at least one RA or publish in journals with an impact factor higher than one. By contrast, except for ML master's students, around $1 4 . 6 \% { - 2 5 . 1 \% }$ of the master's students had no writing requirements. The necessties reported indicated a huge gap from the master's level to the doctoral level. Another diciplinary variation was identified; fewer AH doctoral students were required to write RAs, whereas alldoctoral students in SH, ML, and BM had writing requirements. A for other genres, classassignments were mentioned by one to three master's students in all fields, the rest being theses/proceedings (AH), PowerPoint slides (SE/BM/ss), and speech scripts (SS).

# 5.1.2. Perceived EAP reading and writing lacks

Table 3 presents doctoral and master's students' perceptions of reading lacks. Surprisingly, the means showed that both groups considered EAP reading easy, as none of the means reached 3.50. Doctoral students rated all aspects statisticallysignificantly lower than master's students $( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , suggesting EAP reading was easier for doctoral students (please see Supplementary Materials for the results of the Mann-Whitney U tests. The two items masterstudents rated above 3 were insufficient reading speed and dificult in understanding the main ideas of paragraphs. Doctoral students similarly considered the two aspects relatively more challenging than the other aspects, though none were rated above 3.

A Kruskal-Walls test revealed statistically significant disciplinary differences regarding all reading lacks $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ except for reading speed (See Supplementary Material). Post hoc comparisons revealed that SE students had significantly more dificulty than ML students with all apects except for reading ped. SE students had the highest mean rans for difficlty in understanding sentence structure, the main ideas of a paragraph, and the argument of a text, suggesting they experienced greater difficulties at the sentence and discourse levels. By contrast, AH students rported significantly greater ifficulty than ML students with disciplinary and academic vocabulary and greater difficulty than sS students with disciplinary vocabulary. Finally, SE, BM, and AH students had significantly more difficulty with content knowledge than SS counterparts.

Table 4 lists students perceptions of EAP writing lacks. Writing was considered more challenging than reading, but neither group rated any of the aspects above 4.0. Master's students rated allaspects significantly higher than doctoral students $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Both groups viewed writing speed as the major problem, and master's students had more dificulties incorporating literature and avoiding plagiarism.

Statistically significant disciplinary variations were identified in students' perceptions of writing lacks (all $p < 0 . 0 1 $ . Post hoc comparisons revealed that SE and BM students had substantially more difficulty using disciplinary and academic vocabulary than ML students; AH students reported significantly more dificulty using disciplinary vocabulary than ML students. At the sentence and discourse levels, SE students reported having significantly more dificulty writing sentences and arranging sentences and paragraphs than SS and AH students. Additionally, SE students reporte significantly greater difficulties with writing speed than BM and AH students, with incorporating literature than ML students, and with avoiding plagiarism than SS and AH students.

In sum, mastrstudents had more dificulty than doctoral students, but both groups considered low reading and writing speed as major obstacles. Disciplinary variations indicated that ML students generally had les difficulty, whereas SE students faced more challenges, especially at the sentence and discourse level. On the other hand, AH students had more problems with vocabulary.

# 5.1.3. Perceptions of current EAP reading and writing courses

Students were asked about their understanding of the courses offered at their universities. Among the 1155 participants, $4 3 \%$ knew that language centers offered EAP reading courses, and $5 3 . 8 \%$ had heard of language centers' EAP writing courses. Meanwhile, $3 1 . 7 \%$ knew EAP reading courses, and $3 3 . 2 \%$ knew EAP writing courses offered by their departments. However, around $3 0 \%$ of the students were unclear about EAP course offerings, and only $2 9 \%$ had taken them before, suggesting that students were not motivated to take EAP courses despite their reading and writing necessities. When providing reasons for not taking EAP courses, $5 6 . 5 \%$ of the students said they were occupied with research, $2 9 . 6 \%$ felt the EAP courseload was too heavy, and $2 8 \%$ replied that the course completion did not count toward graduation credits. On the other hand, $1 7 . 2 \%$ thought the courses focused mostly on general English, whereas $9 . 8 \%$ felt the courses focused too much on content.

Table 5 shows the perception of the students who had taken courses on EAP reading courses. Disciplinary variations were not examined here, as making comparisons between small numbers of students in each field was not meaningful.

Students in the survey showed low to medium satisfaction with EAP reading instruction, as none of the aspects reached above 4.0. Master's and doctoral students shared similar views that they improved reading comprehension most ie., understanding the main ideas of paragraphs and texts). Since understanding the main ideas of paragraphs was one of the students top reading dificulties the courses seemed to have met the students' needs in this aspect. On the other hand, master's students benefited significantly more in recognizing disciplinary and academic vocabulary $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ . The difference is understandable, as master's students reported a significantly smaller repertoire of vocabulary, so it was easier for them to perceive the growth of vocabulary knowledge.

Table 6 shows students' perceptions of how EAP writing courses met their needs.

Students showed low to medium satisfaction with EAP writing courses, as none of the aspects reached above 4.0. The aspects students perceived most improvement in were syntactical structures and arrangement of sentences and paragraphs, and master's students learned significantly more in using disciplinary vocabulary $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$

The survey also asked students about their course expectations regarding content, instructors, and practice. Both doctoral and master's students preferred specific academic skills ( $5 6 \%$ and $5 2 \%$ ) over general academic skills ( $2 5 \%$ and $3 0 \%$ , and team teaching between discipline experts and language experts ( $4 3 \%$ and $3 4 \%$ ) over language experts alone ( $3 0 \%$ and $1 9 \%$ and discipline experts alone ( $2 4 \%$ and $1 4 \%$ . However, the two groups differed in their views of practice. While doctoral students wanted more practice . $2 1 \%$ more practice vs. $7 \%$ less practice), master's students wanted less practice ( $1 6 \%$ more practice vs. $2 0 \%$ less practice).

Several conclusions can be made from the students' views of EAP courses. While many students knew the courses ofered within their instiutions, only a small number enrolled, and some others remained unaware of course availaility. Second, enrolled student expressed low-to-medium satisfaction with the courses. Despite diffrent views on the frequency of practice, students hoped the courses could be improved with contextualized language instruction, as well as the collaboration between discipline experts and language experts.

# 5.2. Interview responses from professors and students

# 5.2.1. Students' reading and writing needs

In the interviews, students elaborated on their survey responses and provided reasons for their low reading speed. One of the reasons was the difficulty of deconstructig long and intricate sentences. M22 (SE) and M23 (AH) reported problems comprehending sentences with relative clauses and sentences with multiple conjunctions and prepositions. They had to read each sentence multiple times and sometimes lost focus in reading. D10 (BM) said,  probably focus too much on understanding the sentence sructure and lose my focus on comprehending the argument of a paragraph. Similarly, D1(SE) reported that he ocasionally had to reread sentences for comprehension. I apears that students might understand vocabulary and sentence structures when they are isolated; however, when these sentence structures are combined with disciplinary terms in academic texts,students require additional time to grasp the contextualized meaning.

Another salient theme was insufficient knowledge of discilinary terms, ften due to students' change of areas of study. M14, with an electrical enginering background, encountered dificulty understanding biology-related concepts in bioelectronics. Similarly, M15, with a health education background, switched to a master's program in health management and sometimes had trouble comprehending management texts.

Professors interviewed similarly considered poor reading speed and comprehension to be students major reading difficulties. Nevertheles, professors were much more concerned about students' reading problems. P14 illustrated how SS master's students reading problems impeded learning, \*When I asked students to report the findings f an article, they summarized the literature review. They could not distinguish between authors thoughts and authors review of literature." A few professors atribute students reading difficulties to their overreliance on Chinese translations. P4 explained, "Some [SE master's students relied on translated versions of English textbooks at cllege; when entering master's programs, they encountered much trouble such as searching for literature using English keywords."

Most of the students interviewed experienced challenges in writing. When elaborating on their writing speed, D3 (SE) said he spent much time writing one English sentence; M2 (AH) admitted that she could write a 400-word Chinese abstract in $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ but needed a Whole day writing the same content in English. One of the major reasons that slowed their writing was vocabulary, which was mentioned by 25 students, such as limited vocabulary and inappropriate choice/use of vocabulary. For example, D7 (BM) expressed frequent uncertainty regarding his choice of vocabulary for translating his thoughts into English. Another major reason was related to sentences, such as simple sentence structure, awkward sentence, and unclear expressions. On the other hand, about one-third of master's students mentioned dificultie in writing literature reviews, as they did not know how to search for appropriate sources and organize literature in a logical way.

Compared with students' views, professors considered students writing much more problematic, and nearly all ttributed students problems to insufficient English proficiency and overreliance on direct translation from Chinese into English. The problems included translating Chinese phrases word for word into English, using Chinese grammar in English sentences, and using Chinese paragraph structures (e.g., no apparent topic sentences). This problem may partly explain why 10 professors reported that their students had grammatical problems, as llustrated by P5, In English, experiments were conducted by people, but [my SE master's] students would write experiments conducted something or use a verb that the subject would never do. Three professors believed students writing problems were a result of a lack of writing practice, and this was confirmed by five master's students interviewed, who reported little need to write in English.

While attempting to guide students through the process of writing abstracts, professors found the task too daunting. Eight pro. fessors admitted that they virtully rewrote the abstracts due to extensive revisions. P1 explained that rewriting his SE master's ad. visees' draft was faster than correcting nearly every sentence; P8 found BM students language problems disturbing, T had no choice but to rewrite the draft for students, as they made similar mistakes even though I had returned it 10 times."

# 5.2.2. EAP reading and writing courses

Nine students in the interviews described their experiences with learning EAP reading; interestingly, many of the courses were either EAP reading courses housed in subject departments , lasic English literature in philosophy) or suject courses that include EAP reading components (e.g., Cross-cultural communication). In clss, students were required to read and report RAs; then, instructors commented on students' reports, sometimes guiding them to comprehend texts and identify key vocabulary. While these courses did not focus solely on language, students felt they learned EAP reading through extensive practice and instructors guidance. Their responses implied explicit EAP reading instruction was infrequent; EAP reading instruction was usually embedded in subject courses that focused on RA reading.

By contrast, explicit EAP writing instruction was often mentioned. Students learned writing in courses such as "English Research Writing" and English Academic Writing for Social Sciences," many of which weretaught by language instructors and a few by content instructors. They considered the courses beneficial when they learned to analyze disciplinary text, had chances to practice writing, and received expert feedback. By contrast students were unsatisfied when the course focused too much on grammar and disregarded disciplinary differences, as ilustrated by D13, \*In Biology we use semicolons to express different genes; however, the instructor corrected my writing because my use of semicolons was not typical."

Fifteen professors interviewed considered EAP writing courses helpful, albeit to different degree. The reasons for those who were reserved are similar: while the courses might be useful, available courses are insufficient, and taking one course does not resole students' writing problems. Their responses resonated with students' reasons for not taking courses. When professors were asked to provide course suggestions, three believed one-on-one consultation was more useful than courses, and another three elt the courses needed to count toward graduation credits.

# 6. Discussion

# 6.1. What has been found

Several findings emerged from this study. First, master's students needed mainly EAP reading, but their writing needs considerably increased when they continued doctoral studies, and nearly all doctoral students needed to write RAs excet for AH students. This shares similarities with graduate students in China, where students with ittleprevious exposure to authentic EAP tasks are required to write RAs in English (Li & Cargil, 2021). To be competent writers, constant learning and practice are necessary; this isevidenced by the finding that ML students had the most EAP requirements but the least dificulty in reading and writing. However, except for ML, around $1 5 \% - 2 5 \%$ of the master's students had no EAP writing requirements. This phenomenon resonates with professors' observations that students' writing problems were partly attributed to insufficient writing practice.

Second, doctoral students reported significantly les difficulty in EAP reading and writing than masters students. One reason may be that doctoral students with more hands-on experience have developed some competence. However, their lower rating may also be attributed to the perceived expectation of them performing better in EAP tasks. Future investigations into students actual performance can complement this study.

On the other hand, the findings confirmed previous literature that students considered reading easier than writing (Song & Zhou. 2022) and that students overestimated their own abilities based on professors perspectives (Caplan & Stevens, 2017). While students did not specify any aspects as particularly challenging, professors were concerned about students problems. The survey items students rated relatively higher and student interview responses thus deerve some atention. Both groups f students suffered from low reading speed and incomprehension of main ideas due to unfamiliarity with disciplinary vocabulary and inabilit to deconstruct lengthy sentences. This finding supported another survey showing Taiwanese master's students top dificulties were limited vocabulary and low reading peed (Chen, 2017). Specifically, some students in this study faced more difficulty in disciplinary terms because they changed majors. This confirmed the observation that discipline-based knowledge and vocabulary knowledge are keys to comprehending RAs (Wen, 2013). Since interdisciplinary leaning is trending (Juan, 2020), the number of students who change their major and encounter problems with technical vocabulary might be increasing. This specific group may need extra guidance upon entering a new field.

The students' dificulties in understanding the main ideas and deconstructing lengthy sentences pointed to the need for EAP reading skill courses (Afshar & Movasagh, 2016). In addition, the course content nes to be contextualized, such as instruction that focuses on differentiating authorial voices from literature reviews. Specifically, AH students may need more instruction on vocabulary, whereas SE students need more guidance at sentence and discourse levels.

In terms of writing, both groups of students mostly suffered from poor writing speed due to inappropriate use of vocabulary and sentences, and these are in line with those reported by EFL writr (Cai, 2017; Gea-Valor, et l., 2014). A potential rason, as perceived by the profesor in this study, was students overeliance on direct Chinese translations. To overcome these writing problems, students need to be made aware of the stylistc variations between Chinese and English writing and need to expand their productive knowledge of vocabulary. Specifically, AH and BM students may need more guidance on vocabulary, whereas SE students may need explicit instruction on all levels.

Students' perceptions of EAP courses revealed several important issues. First, EAP courses were housed in different departments, supporting the observation that course fferings in Taiwan are often decentralized (Lin, 2023). Second, despite the availablecourses, about one-third of the students were unaware of them; even though they were aware, less than $3 0 \%$ took courses. Students' reasons for the lack of motivation included hectic schedules and credits with no impact on graduation, supporting previous literature about students unwilinnes to courserollment (Cicek et al., 2022). Another sse rased is stdents ow to medum satisfaction with EAP courses. It appears that the EAP curriculum lacks a coherent desig,a indicated by insufficient EAP reading courses and decentralized course offerings. Second, some EAP courses may not be carefully designed to consider students needs (Cortes, 2019). On the other hand, professors concerns that taking one or two EAP writing courses was insufficient to compensate for students inadequate writing proficiency indicated insufficient training and the low credit impact Like undergraduates in China who took few EAP writing courses (Feng et al., 2019), Taiwanese students rarely took EAP writing courses, especially when the course credits were excluded from graduation requirements. The issues above call for a thorough review and revision of EAP courses.

Fig. 1. A proposed framework for EAP reading and writing curriculum.

# 6.2. A needs-based framework for EAP curriculum

To address the issues above, this study advises that Taiwanese graduate programs encourage student enrollment by mandating certain EAP courses; meanwhile, universties should provide sufficient EAP courses with flexible formats to allow students o enrol with their hectic chedules. Stakeholders should review current EAP courses offred by different departments and consolidate them systematicall. For this purpose, a framework grounded in the findings of this study is proposed (Fig. 1). This framework is also informed by the multi-stage model suggested in Li and Cargill (2021) for students in China, which begins from noticing language features in authenticreading to genre-and corpus-informed writing courses and advocates input from content scholars. Stakeholders can compare the current courses against this framework and determine the addition and/or revision of courses.

This framework has threestages. As some students may lack EAP training at the undergraduate level, the frst stage aims to teach master's students (or doctoral students who lack basic academic skills)common core EAP reading and writing skils, specifically efficien trategies. On the other hand, senior doctoral students can hold sporadic workshops on common disciplinary vocabulary for first-year students who change their area of study.

After students are equipped with common core skill, more contextualized courses are offered to both master's and doctoral students in the second stage. Genre-based pedagogies and the content-based model for connecting reading and writing described by Hirvela (2016) are recommended, as they provide context-rich materials and taior-made sills to addresstudents' challenges (Cicek. et al., 2022). The contextualized instruction will demonstrate how reading supports writing by raising students awareness of the generic features of RAs in their repective fields, helping students notice the stlistic iffernces between Chinese and English writing, and providing extra guidance on the particularly challenging aspects faced by students in certain fields. For example, SE students experienced more ifficult arranging sentences and paragraphs; they can be guided to notice how writers use metadiscourse markers in RAs to achieve coherence and practice writing with the markers. Language and subject experts should collaborate at this stage, Where language instructors focus on raising students genre awareness and subject instructors demonstrate disciplinary expectations.

In the third stage, language and subject experts should deepen their collaboration in individual tutoring services arranged for students with specific needs, such as revising manuscripts and dealing with reviewers comments. In addition, students willbe made critically aware of the contested nature of academic literacy practices uch as the dominancef tandard English in RAs, aspects that have seldom been attended to in EAP writing instruction (Zhang & Curry, 2022, p. 11).

This progresson matches Holden and Blake's (2022) EAP curriculum design for graduate students in Japan; both aim to provide "remediation, a comprehensive grounding in the sills students would need to meet the demands of their degree, and courses that would enable students who needed to present and publish to do so (p.105). It i also similar to the undergraduate English curriculum design at one Taiwanese universty, where students with different Eglish proficiencies are assined to different modules, from EGAP courses for students with CEFR Bl or below to Honors English courses (e.g., academic writing in English) for students with CEFR C1 or above (Kao, 2020; Tsou, 2009). However, i the undergraduate curriculum, ESP teachers are the instructors, whereas the collaboration of language and subject experts is emphasized in this proposed framework. In addition, this framework does not require students to achieve a certain English proficiency levelto proced to the next stage; the universities can set ther own criteria to ensure the courses match students abilitie. To the best f the author's knowledge, no EAP curriculum frameworks have been specifically designed tosuit the needs of Taiwanese graduate students. It is hoped that his framework, grounded in Taiwanese graduate students needs, can meet the best interests of students in Taiwan and other similar contexts.

# 7. Conclusions

This study has identified Taiwanese graduate students' EAP reading and writing needs, understood stakeholders perceptions of EAP courses, and proposed aframework for EAP currculum. This curriculum is grounded in Taiwanese graduate students needs and course expectations; therefore, this framework is believed to benefit the largest number of students in Taiwan and other similar contexts. Universities in other EFL countries can adapt this framework to customize courses that fit their needs.

The findings of this study should be interpreted with care as they might be limited to Taiwan. Moreover, students' diffculties are confined to textual levels, as no participants brought up aspects beyond textual levels. Future reearch can investigate students needs in relation to advanced EAP literacy that \*demands rhetorical insight into the disciplinary community's ways of bulding and disseminating knowledge (Tardy, 2005, p. 326)." Finally, this study does not addres the impact of ChatGPT, the use of which in language leaning istil open to deate Kohnke et al., 2023). More resarch i nedd to investgate the role of ChatGPT and ther AI toos in leaning AP reading and writig. Despite the limitations, this study is one of the first attempts to comprehensively investigate the EAP reading and writing nees of EFL graduate students with comparisons across education levels and discplines and to propose a needs-based EAP curriculum framework for graduate students. Since English has become the lingua franca of global academic communities, students' EAP skills will be more important than ever, and they require continuous investigation.
