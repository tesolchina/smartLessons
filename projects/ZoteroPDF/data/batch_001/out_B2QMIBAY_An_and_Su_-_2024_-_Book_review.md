While the importance of language in science education has long been recognised, the association between teachers language use and its impact on subject-based teaching and learning has not been adequately explored. In this context, Joanna Baumgarts book. Corpus Lingustics and Cros-Disciplinary Action Research: A Study of Talk in the Mathematics Classroom, offers a comprehensive inves tigation into classroom interactions and the role of teacher talk in mathematics teaching and learning in Ireland. Baumgart demon. strates how vide analysis of lassroom data, eflective dialogues between reearchers and teacher, and pedagogical interventions can enhance teachers' language awareness. Overall, the book is a timely contriution to exploring the impact f teachers language use on subject-based teaching and learning.

Structurall, the book comprises eight chapters. Chapter 1 sets the context by providing an overview of the research and its background. Chapters 2 and 3 provide detailed review of relevant litrature, focusing on teaching and lening as social practices,the structure and features of classroom discourse, mathematical lnguage, and the intersection of language awareness and teaching practice. In Chapter 4, Baumgart inroduces the research design and analytical framework. Specificall, she proposes a continuous professional development (CPD) intervention for mathematics teachers, which aims to promote teachers' professional growth through self-reflection on classroom data and discussions with the researcher. Thre pedagogical interventions - peer teaching', poster presentations, and steps (brief explanations alongside equations, p.8) - are proposed to enhance classroom interaction. Subsequently, a hybrid framework combining Mortimer and Scott's (2003) model for science teaching with Walsh's (2006) SETT framework is employed to analyse teacher talk and classroom interactions.

Chapters 5 to 7 present an in-depth analysis of language and interaction across three key stages of the video-recorded lessons: the opening and closing, the presentation of new material, and the main phase. The analyses show that the implemented interventions had a positive impact on clsroom discourse and teacher development. Over the five-week period, there wasnotable decrease in teacher talk during both the presentation and main stages, declining from $9 2 . 8 \%$ to $7 7 . 4 \%$ in Lesson 1 and from. $8 0 . 2 \%$ to $6 6 . 5 \%$ in Lesson 5, respectively. In contrast, student talk during the presentation phase increased by $^ { 1 5 \% }$ across the five lessons. While student participation during the main stage varied, it peaked at. $3 3 \%$ in both Lesson 3 and Lesson 5. The action research project significantly deepened the participating teacher's understanding of pedagogical practices and facilitated her professional growth. The teacher's positive evaluation of this project indicates that subject teachers would benefit from tasks such as analysing classroom recordings for elfreflection, which in turn would allow them to refine their teaching practice. This is reinforced by findings from reflective meetings and post-research interviews, which revealed that the teacher finds interventions such as pair work and peer teaching highly beneficial. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes the book and suggests some important areas for future research.

We now turn to a detailed examination of the book's key findings, which are organised according to three central themes: pedagogical functions and discursive features, interactional structure, and corpus analysis of lexical features. Regarding the frst theme, the book reveals astrong alignment between discursive features and pedagogical functions throughout the teaching process. In the opening and closing phases, the extensive use of questions and feedback - often embedded in IRF (Initiation-Response-Feedback; p.94) sequences - plays a crucial role in organising the learning environment. These elements are primarily employed to check and correct homework and to support learners with ther asignments. During the presentation phase, strategic uses of discursive features facilitate the delivery of new mathematical concepts. For instance, signposting devices structure lessons and aid comprehension, questions asess understanding, and informal expressions asist students i grasping and inernalising the material In the main phase, questions and IRF chains guide students and facilitate the internalization of mathematical knowledge.

Interactional analysis reveals a clear dominance of teacher talk in classroom discourse, as indicated by the high teacher-learner word ratio. In both the opening and closing phases, exchanges are characterised by extended teacher turns. In the opening phase, teacher tal focuses on classroom management, whil in the closing phase, i shift to checking understanding and supporting students facing dificultie. Throughout the lessons, the teacher predominantly employs an interactive/authoritative approach (Mortimer & Scott, 2003) and directs and controls the discourse through structured IRF chains. However, after implementing the pedagogic in. terventions, claroom interaction shift from a predominantly teacher-centered model to a more cllaborative one. The teacher uses fewer IRF chains and focuses more on monitoring learner work and providing supportive feedback. This change promotes shared responsibility for learning between the teacher and students, as shown by more positive learner engagement and enhanced peer collaboration.

Turning to the third theme, corpus linguistc analyses of frequency lists, keywords, and clusters further confirm earlier observations regarding the stinct pedagogical functions, interactional structures, and topical foci across ifferent phases of the lesons. They also underscore the complexity of mathematics classroom discourse, where mathematical terms intertwine with everyday language. Relying on everyday terms to explain mathematical concepts may not always reduce cognitive load as expected; instead, it can hinder precise and clear mathematical communication, potentially leading to misconceptions (Schleppegrell 2007). As Baumgart notes, "using correct mathematical language and articulating mathematical concepts are key to the acquisition of the required register" (p.60). This points to the need for mathematics educators to prioritise technical terms and avoid unnecessrily mixing them with everyday language. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a prevalence of gammatical metaphors and pronominal forms, which diminish the precision typically associated with mathematical language.

Overall, Baumgart's book presents a substantial contribution to educational linguistics, enriching both intial teacher education and ongoing professional development. It shows that teacher talk serves as a model for disciplinary discourse, which highlights the importance of raising subject teachers' awareness of subject-specific discursive knowledge. This is essntial because students discourse competencies "do not develop by themselves' but must be "specifically identified, named and focused upon through conscious didactic effort and support measures" (Vollmer, 2009, p. 9). Consequently, subject teachers must "become language-sensitive in their field of teaching" (Vollmer, 2009, p. 10). The intervention and teaching strategies proposed in the book have been shown to be useful for ehancing classroom interactions and improving teachers' awarenes of classoom practice. This in tu points to the significance of interdiscilinary collaboration and calls for C intiatives that are taloed to the immediate teaching context.

In addition to highlighting the importance of teacher talk in disciplinary discourse communities, the book sugests several avenues for future research. These include developing integrated frameworks, incorporating corpus linguistics and discourse analysis for exploring classroom interaction. It would also be worthwhile to explore the long-term effects of CPD interventions on classroom discourse nd on teacher profesional development. Insted f ffring merely a snapshot at a specific point, longitudinal investigation can provide further insights into the extended interactional processes and paterns that emerge in specific groups of teachers and students. Such a prolonged investigation into classroom discourse and the professional growth of teachers over their careers would be particularly beneficial for educational linguistics.

Notwithstanding the value of the book, there i room for potential improvement. For example, an in-depth analysis of the societal and cultural dimensions that could influence classroom discourse, particularl in the multicultural stting, may enrich the study and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between language, culture, and mathematics education. Moreover, as the book focused primaril on teacher talk, it lacs a detailed examination of classroom discourse from the students perspective. Incorporating student feedback, observations, or interviews might offer valuable insights into the teaching and learning processes, which can provide a more holistic understanding of the classroom dynamics.

To recapitulate, this book explores the association between teachers' language use and subject-based teaching and learning. t highlights the crucial role ofteacher talk and aligns with currcular reforms such as the Council of Europe's Languages in and for Education" project and reland's Project Maths, both of which stess the importance of raising teachers awarenessof their language use in education. The book also showcases how the action research approach, through reflective practice and collaboration between teachers and researchers can lead to improved classroom interaction. This methodology is particularly relevant to EAP contexts, where cross-disciplinary action research can provide valuable insights into students' specific needs and help refine the teaching methods. Furthermore, the book underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, which suggests that EAP practitioners should work closely with subject specialists to ensure that language instruction aligns with the academic demands of various disci. plines. These strengths and features of the book indicate that it would be of inteest to teachers, teacher-educators, and reearchers in the domains of educational linguistics, discourse analysis, and EAP; as such, it is highly recommended.
