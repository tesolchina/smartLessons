# ABSTRACT

Previous research on cross-linguistic transfer has provided evidence about the transfer of reading performance and strategies. However, little knowledge exists regarding how motivational factors (e.g. self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation [IM], extrinsic motivation [EM]) transfer and how they facilitate the transfer of reading from the first language (L1; i.e. Chinese in this study) to the second language (L2; i.e. English in this study). Furthermore, there is little agreement on the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in L1 and L2 studies. This study aimed to (1) explore the relationship between selfefficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in both L1 and L2; (2) identify whether self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading performance can be directly transferred from L1 to L2; (3) and investigate how self-efficacy affects the cross-linguistic transfer of reading comprehension. 2,894 fourth-graders from 38 Hong Kong schools participated in this study. Results found that the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension was consistent in both L1 and L2. For crosslinguistic transfer, IM, EM, and reading performance can be transferred directly from L1 to L2, but reading self-efficacy cannot. Findings also indicated that self-efficacy indirectly affected L2 reading through several potential pathways. Implications for bilingual reading education are discussed.

# Introduction

According to Cummins’ (1981) language interdependence hypothesis (LIH), bilingual learners’ second language (L2) acquisition largely depends on the first language (L1) proficiency and experience. The LIH implies a considerable relationship between L1 and L2, with the L1’s concepts, language abilities, experience, and knowledge being fully utilized to promote the development of L2 literacy, under the conditions that there is enough exposure and motivation to learn L2 (Bialystok 2018; Cummins 1979). A wealth of research on language transfer fortifies Cummins’ LIH, and researchers have found evidence of cross-linguistic transfer of different language skills, such as oral language, phonological awareness, morphological awareness, decoding, vocabulary, reading comprehension performance and strategies (Tse, Lin, and Ng 2022; Melby-Lervag and Lervag 2011; Yang, Cooc, and Sheng 2017).

However, researchers have also suggested that the degree of similarity between L1 and L2 may affect the acquisition of reading comprehension (Perfetti 2007). In the case of languages as different as Chinese and English (with different levels of phonological processing and orthographic depth; e.g. Gottardo et al. 2001; Keung and Ho 2009), cross-linguistic transfer of reading-related skills may not always occur, and there are still inconsistent findings regarding the transfer of reading skills between Chinese and English. Considering the significant differences between the two languages, the extent to which they can transfer remains a worthy topic of discussion. Furthermore, little knowledge exists regarding the transfer of motivational factors, such as reading self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation (IM), and extrinsic motivation (EM).

Thus far, there are ample studies that examined the influence of reading self-efficacy (Chen 2007; Jaekel 2020), IM (Becker, McElvany, and Kortenbruck 2010; Cartwright, Marshall, and Wray 2016), and EM (Froiland and Oros 2014), or all three (Yang et al. 2018) on L1 or L2 reading comprehension individually, but very few have explored their relationships in both L1 and L2 simultaneously. As for L1– L2 transfer studies, the research focus is preliminarily placed on motivation generally $( \mathsf { K i m } \ 2 0 1 \ 1$ ; Takase 2007), while there is little evidence to clarify the transferability of self-efficacy, IM, and EM specifically, and the influence mechanisms of these motivational factors in reading transfer. It is worth exploring the contributions of these motivational factors in their transferability and the potential transfer pathways because they are key variables that explain individual differences, and can promote students’ learning behavior and outcomes in bilingual reading (Ellis 1994; Talebi and Fallahi 2021). Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading performance in both L1 and L2; and to explore how motivational factors transfer and facilitate the L2 reading.

# Literature review

# Self-efficacy optimizes reading comprehension

Self-efficacy is a future-oriented competency belief in one’s ability to achieve the targeted performance level (Bandura 1986). Specifically in reading, many studies have shown that students’ selfefficacy is an important predictor of reading comprehension in both L1 and L2. For example, Wigfield and Guthrie (1997) found that self-efficacy was moderately correlated with the reading amount and breadth in L1, which is a predecessor to reading performance in fourth and fifth graders. Solheim (2011) reported that reading self-efficacy positively influenced reading performance after controlling for vocabulary, listening comprehension, and nonverbal ability. Similarly, in L2, researchers demonstrated that self-efficacy positively predictd English reading comprehension among EFL learners (Chen 2007; Wang, Shen, and Yu 2021).

# The influence of IM and EM on reading comprehension

Motivation is a multifaceted structure that is often divided into IM and EM (Wigfield and Guthrie 1997). IM pertains to undertaking an activity purely for the purpose of deriving pleasure and satisfaction from it. EM refers to carrying out an activity as a means for other purposes, rather than for its own sake (Ryan and Deci 2000).

In general, IM positively predicts L1 reading comprehension. For instance, researchers found that students who were intrinsically motivated to read were more likely to be involved in reading at a high level, which leads to greater reading performance (Becker, McElvany, and Kortenbruck 2010; Cartwright, Marshall, and Wray 2016). However, the influence of IM on L2 reading comprehension has yielded inconclusive findings. In one bilingual study, Takase (2007) found that both L1 and L2 IM predicted reading comprehension among high school students. Nevertheless, in another, Lin, Wong, and McBride-Chang (2012) reported that only ‘recreation’ of L1 IM was positively associated with L1 reading comprehension, while L2 IM had no effect on L2 reading comprehension.

For EM, prior literature presented inconsistent results about its influence on reading comprehension in either L1 or L2. While Froiland and Oros (2014) found that EM positively influenced adolescents’ L1 reading comprehension, the study of Wang and Guthrie (2004) suggested that EM had a negative influence on L1 reading comprehension in fourth-grade students. In L2, Lin, Wong, and

McBride-Chang (2012) found that ‘instrumentalism’ in EM was positively correlated with L2 reading comprehension. Moreover, in Becker et al.’s (2010) longitudinal study, they found that students’ IM in grade 4 was positively related to their reading performance in grade 6, while students with high EM scores were poorer in reading.

To sum up, more evidence points toward a positive impact of IM on L1 reading, while there remains inconsistency in the influence of IM on L2 reading, and EM on both L1 and L2 reading performance. This may be due to different instruments or participants. With increasingly more students learning two languages worldwide, the gap in research on the influence of IM and EM on reading performance in a bilingual context needs to be filled up.

# The relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension

As shown in the literature, there is a strong relationship between self-efficacy and reading comprehension. Conceivably, the influence of self-efficacy on reading comprehension can be indirect, with self-efficacy initiating changes in motivation, which in turn contribute to reading comprehension. As Burrows (2013) pointed out, the higher the students’ self-efficacy, the more they were motivated to engage in reading activities, and the higher level they attained in reading performance.

Many empirical studies confirmed the influence of reading self-efficacy on IM and EM. For instance, Lau (2019) reported that Hong Kong secondary four students’ reading self-efficacy was positively correlated with IM and EM. Similarly, D’Lima, Winsler, and Kitsantas (2014) found that self-efficacy moderately correlated with IM, and weakly correlated with EM among undergraduates. On the contrary, some researchers suggested that self-efficacy positively correlated with IM, but not with EM (Walker, Greene, and Mansell 2006).

Several studies have taken a step forward to examine the mediating role of motivation in L1 or L2 contexts. For instance, researchers noted that self-efficacy affects students’ L1 reading performance through influencing their motivation (e.g. Shell, Colvin, and Bruning 1995). In L2, Kim and Shin (2021) reported that self-efficacy indirectly influenced L2 reading comprehension via integrative motivation.

Taken together, the above studies indicated that there are strong relationships between selfefficacy, motivation, and reading performance. However, as previous studies have explored the mediating role of motivation as a whole and less about the mediating effects of fine-grained motivation (e.g. IM and EM), the relationship between self-efficacy with IM and EM in bilingual reading contexts remains unclear.

# Cross-linguistic transfer: from Chinese (L1) to English (L2)

Cross-linguistic transfer pertains to the resultant state of being dependent on L1 knowledge or rules when the new L2 knowledge is not fully developed (Gass and Selinker 1983). LIH supports the transferability of L1 and L2 proficiency, which means that L1 proficiency can predict L2 proficiency.

Melby-Lervag and Lervag (2011) conducted a meta-analysis of 47 studies to examine the crosslinguistic transfer of reading-related skills. They found small correlations between L1 and L2 oral language (vocabulary and listening comprehension), and a moderate to large correlation between L1 and L2 phonological awareness and decoding. Moreover, they found a small to moderate correlation between L1 decoding and L2 reading comprehension, and the correlation declined reliably with age. However, this meta-analysis focused mostly with the study of alphabetic language pairs that share greater similarities (e.g. Spanish-English Spanish-French). As many researchers have pointed out, the degree of similarity between L1 and L2 may influence the reading acquisition process and the transfer (Figueredo 2006; Perfetti 2007). The present study focuses on Chinese and English, which are very different systems in terms of phonology and orthography. Regarding phonology (including phonemes, syllable structure, and the use of tones to distinguish word meaning), Chinese is a monosyllabic script with a much simpler phonological structure than

English. Compared to English, Chinese syllables lack consonant blends or clusters (Hashimoto 1972). Moreover, tones are a unique feature of the Chinese language, and the tones of Mandarin can be categorized into five major groups (Cheng 1991), while Cantonese is more complex, with six tones (Chao 1947). For orthography, Chinese employs strokes to form Chinese characters, while English uses letters to form words. Given the differences between the two languages, the extent to which cross-linguistic transfer occurs between Chinese and English remains a compelling question.

Research on cross-linguistic transfer between Chinese (L1) and English (L2) has demonstrated that phonological awareness and rapid naming can transfer across languages (Keung and Ho 2009; Luo, Chen, and Geva 2014), but vocabulary (Bialystok, Luk, and Kwan 2005; Pasquarella et al. 2015), and orthographic skills (Gottardo et al. 2001; Keung and Ho 2009) cannot. In contrast, Wang and Geva (2003) demonstrated a general development of phonological and orthographic skills across languages between Chinese and English. In a recent meta-analysis, Yang and colleagues (2017) found cross-linguistic transfer between Chinese and English in terms of phonological awareness, decoding skills, vocabulary, and morphological awareness.

Building on this, the present study aims to provide further evidence for cross-linguistic transfer between Chinese and English in terms of more general reading comprehension proficiency, and to incorporate psychological motivational factors to provide new perspectives on bilingual learning and transfer.

# Cross-linguistic transfer: self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension

Bilingual researchers are also interested in whether motivational factors in L1 can influence L2 reading, and results showed that reading motivation is transferable, with L1 motivation affecting L2 motivation (e.g. Day and Bamford 1998; Kim 2011). However, Takase (2007) found no significant correlation between L1 and L2 reading motivation by using a mixed-method design. Along with the transfer within L1 and L2 motivation, there is also a transfer from motivation to reading comprehension between L1 and L2. For example, Yang (2009) found that students’ motivation in L1 appeared to transfer to L2 reading behavior, thereby influencing their L2 reading outcome. Similarly, Takase (2007) showed that L1 motivation directly facilitated students’ L2 reading comprehension, despite the uncorrelated motivation of L1 and L2 reading.

As for the transfer of reading self-efficacy, to what extent L1 reading self-efficacy directly influence L2 reading self-efficacy, and to what extent L1 reading self-efficacy promotes the cross-linguistic transfer of reading remains unexplored. With the task-specificity and context-dependent nature of self-efficacy (Bandura 1986), it may be hard to find an association between L1 self-efficacy and L2 self-efficacy. Even so, some researchers suggested that, given the L1–L2 LIH, it is reasonable to assume that self-efficacy is an important factor influencing learning transfer across languages (Fryer and Oga-Baldwin 2017). Indeed, a small number of studies pointed out that self-efficacy may affect the process of L1 and L2 reading (e.g. Kamhi-Stein 2003). In one recent study, Thompson et al. (2022) suggested that self-efficacy helped to resolve reading problems in bilingual learners, which had a bidirectional effect on how L1 and L2 were learned in the brain. These studies imply that L1 self-efficacy may affect both L1 and L2 reading comprehension through multiple direct or indirect transfer pathways. However, relevant research is still lacking at present. Given that such research has the potential to improve our knowledge of the effect of self-efficacy and the transfer of related skills, researchers have called for an investigation on how self-efficacy is transferred between L1 and L2 (Schunk and DiBenedetto 2016).

# The present study

Hong Kong introduced the ‘biliterate and trilingual’ policy since 1997 (Education Department 1997) with the aim of encouraging students to become biliterate (in written Chinese and English) and trilingual (in spoken Cantonese, Putonghua and English). Hong Kong students will satisfy the need of connecting with both mainland China and the international community, given that they are wellversed in both Chinese and English (Koo, Kam, and Choi 2003). It is in this context that understanding the students’ reading attainment level is crucial to both educators and policymakers.

For Hong Kong students, the process of learning to read English L2 is proved to be influenced by phonological awareness, decoding skills, morphological awareness, and reading strategies in Chinese L1 (Author 2022; Cheung, Chan, and Chong 2007; Leong et al. 2005; Yang, Cooc, and Sheng 2017). Besides these linguistic factors, it is also important to consider the motivational factors of Chinese L1 and English L2 reading, in order to foster the reading comprehension transfer from L1 to L2 and promote bilingual reading among Hong Kong students. Therefore, exploring how reading-related motivational factors transfer and how these factors promote L2 reading may provide us with some insights. The existing evidence has highlighted the importance of self-efficacy, IM, and EM on L1 or L2 reading comprehension. However, the consistency of the relationship between these variables in L1 and L2 reading remains unclear; and whether these motivational factors can transfer from L1 to L2 and facilitate the transfer of reading comprehension from L1 to L2 is underinvestigated.

Therefore, the present study sets out to explore the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in both L1 and L2, and how the motivational factors contribute to the L1–L2 transfer of reading comprehension. The following three research questions were formulated to guide the study:

RQ1: What is the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in both L1 and L2?   
RQ2: Can self-efficacy, IM, and EM transfer from L1 to L2?   
RQ3: How does L1 self-efficacy affect L2 reading comprehension?

# Method

This study is part of ‘The Fifth Study of the Progress in Chinese and English Reading Literacy Study (in 2016) at Primary 4 in Hong Kong and Approaches to and Strategies for Enhancing the Quality of Teaching and Learning of Reading’, a bilingual reading literacy study series conducted in Hong Kong (Tse et al. 2007; Tse et al. 2013; Tse, Lin, and Ng 2019), which is also an extension of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Survey (PIRLS).

# Participants

2,894 fourth-grade students $( 4 9 . 1 \%$ females, $M _ { \mathsf { a g e } } = 9 . 3 5$ ) from 38 schools in Hong Kong participated in this study. Sampling was conducted at the school level and the class level. All schools which participated in the first four cycles of this series of reading literacy studies were invited to participate. Purposeful stratified sampling was performed based on students’ L1 average reading performance until an almost equal number of high, medium, and low students was attained. Then, two primary four classes from these 38 schools were randomly selected. The sampled students who were invited and their parents gave consent to participate.

This study focuses on fourth-graders for two main reasons. First, in the early stages of second language learning, students may rely more on their native language skills, increasing cross-language correlations in the early grades (Kroll and Stewart 1994; Kroll et al. 2010). Second, in terms of the stages of reading development (Chall 1983), fourth-grade is a critical period in students’ reading development when they transition from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn’. As Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city that uses both Chinese and English to access education and information, it is essential for its young learners to acquire adequate reading skills in both languages for learning.

Therefore, it is beneficial to grasp the key stages of students’ reading development and transfer to promote bilingualism.

# Measures

# Self-efficacy

The measure was adapted from PIRLS 2011 (Foy and Drucker 2013) and 2016 (Mullis and Martin 2015), which solicits students’ degree of agreement (from 1 strongly agree to 4 strongly disagree) with eight statements on reading self-efficacy for each of the languages (e.g. Chinese/English reading is easy for me). Cronbach’s $a$ for Chinese self-efficacy was 0.71, and for English selfefficacy was 0.75.

# Intrinsic motivation (IM)

The measure of students’ IM was derived from the Students Like Reading instrument in PIRLS 2016 (Mullis and Martin 2015) and the IM subscale of the Chinese reading motivation questionnaire (Lau 2016), which solicit students’ reading interest and enjoyment. Both the Chinese and English IM scales consisted of 14 items (e.g. I like to read Chinese/English in my leisure time). Items were rated on a 4- point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). Cronbach’s α was 0.83 for Chinese IM scale and 0.89 for English IM scale.

# Extrinsic motivation (EM)

EM was measured based on the reading motivation scale developed by Lin, Wong, and McBrideChang (2012). Students were scored on Chinese and English EM scale according to their degree of agreement (from 1 strongly agree to 4 strongly disagree) with 11 statements for each of the languages (e.g. My parents require me to read Chinese/English for better results). The Cronbach’s α of Chinese EM scale was 0.76, and that of English EM scale was 0.82.

# L1 and L2 reading comprehension

International English and Hong Kong traditional Chinese versions of PIRLS reading comprehension tasks, containing passages and questions, were adopted as instruments to assess bilingual reading literacy. The Chinese version of the passages and questions were translated from the original English version and precise equivalence was verified by external translation verification companies using multiple forward-and-back translations between the two languages (Ebbs and Wry 2017). Two different genres of passages (information-giving passages and literary and narrative passages) were used, and each genre has two different topics. Each Chinese passage (around 1300 characters) and English passage (around 780 words) is followed by multiple-choice and construct-response questions using the same language as the passage, with 12–16 questions for each passage. As in the design of PIRLS 2016, all passages and questions were similar in terms of difficulty level.

# Data collection

Data collection took place over three sessions, with the first two sessions taking place on the same day. The participants attempted the reading comprehension tasks in one of the languages in the first session, and the other language in the second. Taking the counter-balance effect into consideration, half of the participants attempted the Chinese task first, while the other half attempted the English task first. Each session is 40-min long, with a 10-min break in between. The third session included questionnaires on self-efficacy, IM and EM, and other factors that were administered within a week following the reading comprehension tasks, and it took $3 0 \mathsf { m i n }$ .

# Data analysis

Two structural models were conducted to answer the research questions by using Mplus 8.4 (Muthén and Muthén 2017). Model 1 (M1) examines the relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in L1 and L2. Model 2 (M2) with the transfer paths of all variables from L1 to L2. Bootstrapping procedure with 1000 samples was performed to examine all potential mediating effects in M1 and M2. The following indices were used to examine the goodness of the model fit: comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). CFI and TLI larger than 0.90, and RMSEA and SRMR less than 0.05 are regarded as good fit (Hu and Bentler 1999).

# Results

# Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations of all variables are reported in Table 1. It showed that L1 and L2 reading comprehension were positively correlated; IM was positively correlated with reading comprehension in both L1 and L2; L2 EM was significantly correlated with L2 reading comprehension; and self-efficacy was positively correlated with reading comprehension in both L1 and L2. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between IM and EM in both L1 and L2, and the L1 and L2 self-efficacy were also positively correlated.

# The relationship between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in L1 and L2

To answer RQ1, M1 was first conducted. The results showed that M1 fit the data well with $\chi ^ { 2 }$ (10) $= 1 2 6 . 5 0 $ , ${ \mathsf { C F l } } = 0 . 9 8$ , ${ \sf T L I } = 0 . 9 4$ , RMSEA $= 0 . 0 7$ , $\mathsf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5$ . Figure 1 shows the standardized estimates of M1. It can be seen that L1 self-efficacy positively predicted L1 reading comprehension $( \beta = 0 . 2 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ), L1 IM $( \beta = 0 . 5 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), and L1 EM $( \beta = 0 . 2 8 ,$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). Similarly, L2 selfefficacy positively predicted L2 reading comprehension $( \beta = 0 . 3 4 )$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), L2 IM $( \beta = 0 . 5 9$ , $p <$ 0.001), and L2 EM $( \beta = 0 . 3 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). For the role of IM and EM, L1 IM had a positive effect on L1 reading $( \beta = 0 . 1 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), and L1 EM had a negative effect on L1 reading $( \beta = - 0 . 1 0 ,$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . Moreover, the influence mechanism was the same in L2 (L2 IM: $\beta = 0 . 1 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; L2 EM: $\beta = - 0 . 0 9 _ { i }$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). The mediating effect test results also suggested that IM and EM are partial mediators of the relationship between self-efficacy and reading comprehension performance in both L1 and L2. Specifically, L1 IM was a positive mediator $( \beta = 0 . 0 6 ,$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), while L1 EM acted as a negative mediator $( \beta = - 0 . 0 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). The influence mechanism was the same in L2, with L2 IM having a positive mediating effect of 0.07 $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , and L2 EM having a negative mediating effect of $- 0 . 0 3$ $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ .

# The transfer from L1 to L2

To answer RQ2, M2 (see Figure 2) was conducted to examine the transfer of self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading performance from L1 to L2. M2 fitted the data well $( \chi ^ { 2 } \ : ( 1 0 ) = 1 6 0 . 9 1$ , ${ \sf C F I } = 0 . 9 7$ , ${ \sf T L I } = 0 . 9 2$ , $\mathsf { R M S E A } = 0 . 0 8$ , $\mathsf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5$ ). The results showed that L1 self-efficacy did not influence L2 selfefficacy $( \beta = 0 . 0 4$ , $p > 0 . 0 5 $ ). L1 IM positively affected L2 IM $( \beta = 0 . 3 2 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ , and L1 EM positively predicted L2 EM $( \beta = 0 . 4 9$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). Moreover, L1 reading comprehension had a moderate influence on L2 reading comprehension $( \beta = 0 . 3 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). Overall, the results indicated that reading self-efficacy did not transfer from L1 to L2, whereas IM, EM, and reading comprehension did.

# Potential pathways by which L1 self-efficacy affects L2 reading comprehension

In response to RQ3, we further examined the pathways between L1 self-efficacy, L1 and L2 IM, L1 and L2 EM, and L2 reading performance. The results illustrated that L1 self-efficacy may indirectly affect L2 reading performance through five different pathways (see Table 2). Specifically, L1 self-efficacy indirectly affected L2 reading performance via L1 reading, with a mediating effect of 0.07 $9 5 \%$ CI $= [ 0 . 0 5$ , 0.09], $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ); L1 self-efficacy also indirectly affected L2 reading via L1 IM and L2 IM $( \beta$ $= 0 . 0 2$ , $9 5 \%$ ${ \sf C l } = [ 0 . 0 0 1$ , 0.02], $p < 0 . 0 5 )$ ), and L1 EM and L2 EM $( \beta = - 0 . 0 1$ , $9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } = [ - 0 . 0 2 , - 0 . 0 0 2 ] ,$ , $p < 0 . 0 5 $ ). Furthermore, L1 self-efficacy indirectly affected L2 reading performance via L1 IM and L1 reading $( \beta = 0 . 0 3$ , $9 5 \% \mathsf { C l } = [ 0 . 0 2 , 0 . 0 4 ]$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ), and L1 EM and L1 reading $( \beta = - 0 . 0 2$ , $9 5 \%$ CI $= [ - 0 . 0 2 , - 0 . 0 1 ]$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ).

# Discussion

This study explored the relationships between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading performance in L1 and L2, and investigated the L1–L2 transferability of self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension. The findings revealed that in both L1 and L2, self-efficacy positively predicted IM, EM, and reading comprehension; IM positively influenced reading comprehension, while EM had a negative influence on reading comprehension. IM, EM, and reading performance transferred from L1 to L2, but self-efficacy did not. Finally, L1 self-efficacy indirectly affected L2 reading comprehension via L1 and L2 IM/EM, and L1 reading comprehension through five pathways.

# The relationships between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension in L1 and L2

The results showed that self-efficacy was associated with reading comprehension to a low to moderate level, which is in agreement with previous self-efficacy studies in L1 and L2 reading. Specifically, students with high self-efficacy are more likely to spend more vigorous and persistent efforts, and use more cognitive and metacognitive strategies (Bandura 1997; Pajares and Schunk 2005), so their positive behavior leads to high reading performance, in both L1 and L2. Moreover, selfefficacy was directly related to IM and EM. Linnenbrink and Pintrich (2003, 134) claimed that ‘students are motivated to engage in tasks and achieve when they believe they can accomplish the task’. Researchers also suggested that students’ adaptive motivational beliefs, like interest, value, and utility, might develop out of their ability beliefs (Bandura 1997; Wigfield et al. 1997). This also implies that self-efficacy can contribute to both IM (e.g. interest, involvement, and recreation) and EM (e.g. grades, comparisons with peers or expectations of parents and teachers, utility, and value).

For the relationships between IM, EM, and reading comprehension, our results are consistent with the majority of previous studies: IM was positively associated with reading performance, while EM negatively influenced reading comprehension in both L1 and L2 (Becker, McElvany, and Kortenbruck 2010; Kanonire, Lubenko, and Kuzmina 2022; Schiefele, Stutz, and Schaffner 2016; Wang and Guthrie 2004). Specifically, students with high IM enjoy reading more, and they tend to read more in terms of frequency and amount (Becker, McElvany, and Kortenbruck 2010). Such high reading engagement in turn improves reading performance. Students with high EM, however, read less, and they read only when necessary or monitored (e.g. reading to please somebody, or receiving a reward). The external drives may cause pressure to them that blocks the pleasure of reading, and increase the negative emotional experience of reading, thus resulting in poor performance in both L1 and L2 (Kanonire, Lubenko, and Kuzmina 2022; Wang and Guthrie 2004).

Corroborating with previous bilingual reading studies, the present study may shed some light on the inconsistent findings. Some researchers believed that EM negatively affects L1 reading, but has a positive relation with L2 reading (e.g. Kim 2015; Lin, Wong, and McBride-Chang 2012). Scholars who hold such a view usually believe that L2 is more instrumental than L1 for students’ future learning and work. One possible reason for this view not being positively confirmed by this study is that ‘instrumentalism’ is only part of the overall EM scale, and other factors such as grades and socialpeer/family may be confounded with the influence of instrumentalism. Thus, the overall EM still shows a negative effect on L2 reading. As mentioned earlier, motivation is a multifaceted construct, and the findings would be different when we use different instruments or focus on different granularities or facets of motivation.

# The transfer of self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension from L1 to L2

For cross-linguistic transfer, results suggested that L1 reading was moderately correlated with L2 reading, which means that reading performance can be transferred from L1 to L2. This is consistent with previous research (e.g. Chuang, Joshi, and Dixon 2012; Keung and Ho 2009), supports Cummins’s LIH, and also explains the process of reading acquisition for Hong Kong primary school students. Specifically, most Hong Kong primary school students’ dominant language is Chinese; therefore, the whole meaning-making processes occur first in Chinese before being applied to English. Moreover, although Chinese and English have dissimilar phonological and orthographic systems, this study supports the transferability between the two languages. As other studies have shown, the transfer of phonological awareness, decoding skills, morphological awareness, reading strategies, and meaning-making processes can largely facilitate the contribution of Chinese reading to English reading (Chuang, Joshi, and Dixon 2012; Leong et al. 2005; Yang, Cooc, and Sheng 2017).

Furthermore, IM and EM can also be transferred directly from L1 to L2. Previous studies have shown that students who have positive attitudes toward reading in L1 also have positive attitudes toward L2 reading (Day and Bamford 1998; Kim 2011). Moreover, some researchers have reported the cross-contextual interplay between motivation across contexts, which provides a basis for motivation transfer from L1 to L2 (Hagger and Chatzisarantis 2012). In particular, students with high L1 IM enjoy the reading process more and are more willing to engage in reading activities. This enjoyment of the reading activity, as well as the meaning-making process, allowed them to maintain high motivation in L2 reading. For students with high L1 EM, students’ pursuit of grades, parental expectations, and their concern for peer comparison typically have high consistency in academic performance across disciplines. This external drive allows students’ L1 EM to transfer to L2 successfully.

In addition, the results showed that reading self-efficacy cannot be transferred. This is interpretable in light of the characteristics of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is task- and context-specific and not generalizable (Bandura 1997). Students’ reading self-efficacy in both L1 and L2 is developed in specific language contexts (Raoofi, Tan, and Chan 2012). In terms of sources of self-efficacy, students’ L2 self-efficacy may not come from their L1 self-efficacy, but more from their previous L2 performance, L2 acquisition contexts, and alternative experiences, which are also usually specific and do not seem to be common across languages.

# The influence mechanism of L1 self-efficacy on L2 reading comprehension

This study advanced the literature by highlighting the important role of motivational factors on reading performance transferring from L1 to L2, especially the antecedent position of L1 reading self-efficacy. The findings suggest five potential pathways by which L1 self-efficacy influences L2 reading comprehension. Specifically, L1 self-efficacy can directly or indirectly influence L1 reading performance, which in turn contributes to students’ L2 reading performance. Furthermore, L1 selfefficacy can also improve L2 reading performance by activating motivation transfer (e.g. L1 Selfefficacy $ \mathsf { L 1 } \mathsf { I M }  \mathsf { L 2 } \mathsf { I M }  \mathsf { L 2 }$ Reading). Previous research has reported a positive effect of selfefficacy on transfer of learning (Pugh and Bergin 2006). Students with high self-efficacy are more confident in their ability to successfully transfer learning, therefore more motivated to make transfer attempts. It is obvious that motivational factors play an important role in the transfer process. This is because they may influence cognitive engagement, which includes depth of processing, use of learning strategies, and engagement in metacognitive activity (Colquitt, LePine, and Noe 2000; Pugh and Bergin 2006). These factors can theoretically facilitate learning transfer.

It is worth noting, however, that not all transfer pathways are positive. In this study, EM negatively affected students’ reading performance; thus there may be a negative total effect for pathways involving EM. Indeed, students may activate inappropriate transfer if they are not motivated to enjoy reading for its own sake (Harp and Mayer 1998), but to pursue external rewards or praise.

# Conclusions

The present study provided empirical evidence to support the role of motivational factors in crosslinguistic transfer of reading comprehension among bilingual primary school students in Hong Kong. The findings suggested that motivational factors had the potential to influence both Chinese L1 and English L2 reading performance, and their transferability from L1 to L2 may provide a variety of pathways to improve students’ L2 reading performance.

We also identify the following limitations to inform future research. First, this study is a cross-sectional survey from which causal inference cannot be drawn. Future studies could explore the causal relationships between self-efficacy, IM, EM, and reading comprehension using experimental or longitudinal research designs. Second, this study relied exclusively on students’ self-reports to measure their self-efficacy, IM, and EM. Although the self-reported approach is valuable, it is often subject to overestimation due to the social desirability of the responders. Therefore, future research can incorporate methods such as observations and interviews to further uncover how motivational factors influence reading transfer.

Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study has notable theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on the transfer of reading comprehension between two dissimilar languages, Chinese and English. More importantly, this study extends the LIH by shedding light on assumptions regarding the transfer of motivational factors from L1 to L2, which innovatively expanded cross-linguistic transfer studies to nonlinguistic domains. Practically, the findings make significant contributions to uncovering the underlying mechanisms of the motivational factors transfer in the early learning stages, which suggests ways to support the integration of L1 and L2 motivational factors and reading performance in formal educational experiences. Linguistic transfer is strategic and transitory (Kroll and Stewart 1994; Kroll et al. 2010; Wang and Geva 2003). Therefore, it is important to promote the transfer of reading comprehension at critical stages. As mentioned above, fourth-grade is an important stage when students transition from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn’. Focusing on the development and transfer of L1 and L2 reading skills, as well as related motivational factors during this period is critical to facilitating the subsequent learning development. Specifically, teachers should leverage the positive pathways of motivational factor transfer from L1 in order to improve the effectiveness of L2 learning and teaching. Although this study revealed that self-efficacy is not transferable from L1 to L2, it provides evidence for the important role of L1 self-efficacy on L2 reading comprehension. As Nes Ferrara (2005) emphasized, self-efficacy is an important aspect of the transition from an ordinary reader to a good reader. Teachers need to focus on cultivating students’ self-efficacy by guiding them to set appropriate learning and behavioral goals, creating opportunities for students to succeed, and emphasizing the pleasure and love for reading. Moreover, both L1 Chinese and L2 English teachers, as well as the teacher–librarians, should collaborate to cultivate students’ self-efficacy, designing reading activities in the two languages instead of in isolation, to enhance the enjoyment of reading.
