# ABSTRACT

Public speaking is considered the most anxiety-provoking speaking activity for English as a foreign language (EFL) learner. While traditional lecture-based classrooms hinder EFL learners’ constant practice and frequent interaction due to large class sizes and limited time, recent developments in technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automatic Speech Analysis, and Virtual Reality (VR), may enhance language learning by offering accessible and personalized learning experiences. This study aimed to investigate the effects of technology-enhanced learning on reducing EFL learners’ PSA. Thirty-three university students were divided into three groups and received either lecture-based, mobile-assisted, or VR-facilitated instruction for four weeks. The students’ perceived PSA levels were reduced in all three groups after their respective instruction, but only the VR-facilitated group reached statistical significance, and there were no differences in the three groups’ final oral performances. However, the two technology-enhanced language learning (TELL) groups achieved more convergent performances on the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety scale compared with the non-TELL group, which indicated that the impact of individual differences may have been compensated by technology assistance. The findings suggested that the instructional feedback generated by AI decreased the participants’ PSA, although the irreplaceable role of teachers as facilitators was also emphasized, while the potential of using VR in teaching public speaking was evident.

# 1.  Introduction

Interest in investigating foreign language anxiety (FLA) that second language (L2) learners experience in language classrooms has increased in the field of L2 acquisition in recent decades, owing to the growing attention given to individual differences and affective factors of language learning (Krashen, 1987). Foreign language anxiety has been found in reading (Matsuda & Gobel, 2001; Saito et al., 1999), listening (Kim, 2002; Vogely, 1998), speaking (Chou, 2018; Luo, 2014), writing (Cheng, 2002; Chou, 2013), and combined skills (e.g. reading and listening: Capan & Karaca, 2013; speaking and writing: Gkonou, 2011). However, speaking, among the four language skills, is considered the most anxiety-provoking one for L2 learners to perform (Luo, 2014). In the study of Horwitz et  al. (1986), students who tested high on anxiety reported that they were particularly afraid to speak in the foreign language: they endorsed statements like ‘I start to panic when I have to speak without preparation in language class’ and ‘I feel very self-conscious about speaking the foreign language in front of other students’, while they rejected statements like ‘I feel confident when I speak in foreign language class’. Horwitz et  al. conclude that ‘anxious students feel a deep self-consciousness when asked to risk revealing themselves by speaking the foreign language in the presence of other people’ (p. 129). Speaking L2 in front of people, or public speaking, seems to trigger the greatest anxiety.

Previous studies have identified multifaceted reasons for public speaking anxiety (PSA) in a language learning classroom, including aspects of speaking context, teachers and peers as the audience, and learners as speakers. Anxiety induced by public speaking context includes embarrassment of being conspicuous in front of people, the perception of being ‘subordinate’ to the audience, fear of appearing nervous, and so on (Genard, 2015; Griffin, 2009). Evaluations given by teachers (Liu, 2006; Mak, 2011; Young, 1990) and peers (Gkonou, 2011, 2014) also leads to learners’ distress. In addition, learner variables like gender and proficiency level may affect PSA, though the effects are inconclusive. Gender is identified as a crucial factor in some studies (Bensalem, 2018; Lou, 2014; Öztürk & Gürbüzb, 2014), claiming that female learners are more anxious than the male counterparts; yet in other studies (Y. C. Chen, 2021), gender did not contribute significantly to the perceived anxiety level. Regarding the effects of L2 proficiency on PSA, no significant correlation was found in some studies (Lou, 2014; Torres & Turner, 2016), while some (Y. C. Chen, 2021; Liu, 2006) identified that the more proficient learners tended to be less anxious. Anxiety may bias learners’ perception of their proficiency, as Torres and Turner (2016) suggest that self-efficacies perceived by learners at different proficiency levels may attribute to their perceived anxiety levels. Learners’ low self-perceptions of their speaking ability also result in high levels of anxiety (Bensalem, 2018; Mak, 2011; Woodrow, 2006). Finally, insufficient preparedness before class (Gkonou, 2011), previous negative learning experiences (Riasati, 2011), apprehension about high-stakes tests (Zhang  & Liu, 2013), and worries about failing the school (Horwitz & Young, 1991) are possible reasons of high PSA.

Proposals to deal with PSA have included strengthening training in speaking strategies (Liu, 2018; Y. C. Chen, 2021), raising learners’ awareness of emotional responses (Sadighi & Dastpak, 2017), modifying the types of teacher feedback (Zarei & Rezadoust, 2020), and increasing opportunities to practice public speaking in authentic contexts (Y. C. Chen, 2021). However, language classrooms are constrained by class size and time, and preventing teachers and students from engaging in frequent interaction and constant practice. Owing to the development of technology, the above-mentioned suggestions can be carried out with its help. Mobile devices, including smartphones and portable tablets, enhance language learning by providing learning resources and generating learning opportunities. Recent technological innovations, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), provide extant feedback on speaking in a more efficient manner. Furthermore, the development and application of Virtual Reality (VR) technology may create opportunities to experience exposure to various situations, giving learners more opportunities to immerse themselves in various simulated contexts, even as they are physically using it in the classroom.

Despite the growing interest in technology-enhanced language learning (TELL), few empirical or design-based studies have been conducted, which has led to a scarcity of empirical evidence on using technology as a solution for PSA. This gap in the research on the pedagogical effects of using technology-enhanced solutions, including applications (apps) that implement AI, ASR, and VR, to reduce PSA and improve speaking ability must be addressed with concrete evidence and solid support from empirical studies before TELL can be put into use in general L2 contexts.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TELL on reducing EFL learners’ public speaking anxiety. With quantitative data as well as qualitative information, the present study explored the effects of learning public speaking through TELL to find critical factors leading to such effects and to provide pedagogical suggestions for both EFL teachers and learners who are eager to advance their public speaking.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Mobile-assisted language learning

Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is defined as language learning that is assisted or enhanced through the use of a handheld mobile device, and learning activities are mediated through mobile applications (apps). The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has turned machines into language teachers by feeding them huge amounts of authentic language data and identifying patterns of language use with high accuracy. On the other hand, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) turns spoken language into written language and facilitates efficient spoken data processing. The combination of AI and ASR enables users to obtain a great amount of language inputs, generate spoken outputs, receive analytical feedback, and monitor and track their progress.

The traits of MALL address the strategies needed to reduce PSA. First, with mobile devices, L2 learners can access speaking practice without constraints on time and space (Wu et  al., 2012), and then practice speaking in front of a gadget individually without feeling anxious or pressured (Junining et  al., 2020). Second, with the help of ASR and AI, L2 learners can receive immediate speech analyses together with instructional feedback on their oral performance (McClain, 2016). Most importantly, AI technology can track users’ behavioral patterns and keep track of their learning progress, and it can even tailor users’ capability to provide suitable training. Finally, since more than two million mobile apps are available on mobile platforms (Statista Research Department, 2021), teaching and learning resources for MALL are rich.

Research has found that mobile-based learning can decrease learners’ speaking anxiety. Shamsi et  al. (2019) had 15 students use an instant messaging mobile app and upload their recorded speeches to the conversation group; students then received feedback from the instructors in terms of grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, fluency, and ideas through the app. After four weeks, nine out of 15 participants reported a significant decrease in speaking anxiety, significantly owing to the reduced fear of feedback by peers or teachers. Yet two participants mentioned in the interviews that the period of m-learning was too short to have better results. On the other hand, C. Y. Chen (2021) interviewed four students who had experienced one semester of a MALL speaking class and found that the students perceived a great improvement in vocabulary use, pronunciation, and overall speaking fluency. Nevertheless, the study was a qualitative one with few participants, and thus the results could not be generalized; additionally, the study focused on the students’ self-perceptions but did not provide objective proof of their improvement.

# 2.2.  Virtual reality exposure therapy

Virtual Reality (VR) has grown in popularity recently owing to the development of mobile-based VR apps. Virtual Reality is a technological interface that allows users to experience computer-generated environments within a controlled setting (Maples-Keller et  al., 2017). Virtual Reality incorporates auditory, visual, and other sensory feedback, such as haptic, and creates an immersive environment that is similar to the real world. In terms of speaking instruction, VR has been acknowledged as a way to facilitate preparation and encourage active learning (Xie et  al., 2021).

Virtual Reality has been used in exposure therapy to treat emotional disorders and to adjust behaviors. The technology can provide virtually real stimuli for patients who have trouble imagining scenes and who are too phobic to experience real situations (North et  al., 1998). In addition, VR renders control and flexibility to the therapy process: the quality and intensity of the exposure can be entirely decided by therapists according to patients’ needs; and the pace of progress and frequency of practice can be managed by patients. Most importantly, VR tools can be used in a private space, in which the safe and controlled environment can also prevent patients from experiencing other negative feelings such as embarrassment.

Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is believed to be useful in treating fear of public speaking. Slater et  al. (1999) had their participants ‘face’ a virtual audience in a VR setting and examined their PSA. The participants’ PSA levels were positively correlated with their perceived responses from the virtual audience: higher perceived audience interest increased their self-rating of presentation success and reduced their public speaking anxiety. Pertaub et  al. (2001) conducted a follow-up study and confirmed that the degree of PSA was directly related to the virtual audience feedback that the speaker received. More recently, Lindner et  al. (2019) compared therapist-led and self-led scenarios using internet-administered VRET software and found that both scenarios led to a reduction in PSA, and the results were maintained at twelve-month follow-up. They thus claimed that VRET was a novel, low-cost, and easily accessible way to reduce PSA.

# 2.3.  Rationale and research questions

Based on the reviewed literature, several causes of PSA have been identified, and the three most prominent include: (1) fear of facing an audience; (2) fear of making mistakes; and (3) fear of being evaluated. Moreover, three strategies are believed to be useful in reducing PSA: (1) adaptation to the speaking environment; (2) instant and personalized feedback; and (3) sufficient practice and preparation. Among the pedagogical suggestions that have been made to alleviate language learners’ PSA, TELL solutions, including MALL and VRET, are promising but still lack empirical support.

The main objective of the present study was to empirically investigate the effects of TELL pedagogies on reducing EFL learners’ self-perceived public speaking anxiety. The research questions are stated as follows:

Research Question 1: What are the effects of non-TELL instruction and TELL instruction—MALL and VRET—on reducing EFL learners’ PSA? Which instruction mode is the most effective in reducing PSA?

Research Question 2: What differentiates the effects of the three pedagogies on reducing PSA? How does the facilitation of technology influence EFL learners’ perceptions of PSA?

# 3.  Methodology

# 3.1.  Participants

Thirty-three Taiwanese university students, including 26 females and seven males, responded to the recruitment request and volunteered to participate in the present study. Thirty participants were from the College of Social Science, and three were from the College of Business; none of them were from the English or language-related Departments. Based on their self-reported performances on language proficiency tests taken, their English proficiency levels ranged from A2 to B1 in the Common European Framework of Reference. When asked to evaluate their English ability as well as their English-speaking ability on a 4-point Likert scale ( $1 = \mathrm { ^ { \circ } p o o r } ^ { \prime }$ and $4 =$ ‘great’), the means were 2.19 ( $\left. S D = 0 . 6 9 \right)$ ) for English ability and 2.22 $\mathrm { { \it S D } } = 0 . 7 9 \mathrm { { \it \Omega } }$ for English-speaking ability. Because the participants had similar proficiency levels, the potential bias of learner variables resulting from language proficiency levels could be controlled.

The participants were assigned to three groups, each with 11 students, without knowing which instruction would be given in advance. During recruitment, three time slots were provided. The participants were asked to indicate all their available time slots and list their preferences in the order of most to least preferred; they were then assigned to one particular time slot according to their indicated preferences. If more than 11 students chose the same time slot, those who had a second preferred time slot were assigned to that time slot.

# 3.2.  Instruments

# 3.2.1.  Personal report of public speaking anxiety

The current study adopted McCroskey’s (1970) Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA) as the instrument. The PRPSA consists of 34 statements about feelings or perceptions related to giving a speech in a public context, and it is a validated scale strictly tailored for public speaking anxiety (McCroskey, 1997, 2009). The statements are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from $5 \ =$ ‘strongly agree’ to $1 \ =$ ‘strongly disagree’, indicating how well each statement corresponds to respondents’ feelings or perceptions. The instrument’s reliability was higher than 0.90 and was found to maintain high reliability in subsequent research (McCroskey, 1997; McCroskey & Richmond, 1992). In addition, the PRPSA has been used in the Taiwanese context (Hsu, 2012; L. Y. Chen, 2009) and was suited for use in the present study. The total score of the PRPSA ranges between 34 and 170, and according to McCroskey (2013), the levels of public speaking anxiety are interpreted as low (34 to 84), moderate (85 to 119), and high (120 to 170).

The PRPSA was chosen over the Foreign Language Speaking Anxiety Scale (FLSAS: Öztürk & Gürbüz, 2014) mainly because of the research focus: the PRPSA was concerned with ‘stage fright’, the communication apprehension in the public speaking context (McCroskey, 1997), while the FLSAS was concerned with classroom speaking situations that foreign language learners commonly experienced. Since pubic speaking was the main focus of the present study, the PRPSA was suitable for the purpose.

# 3.2.2.  Semi-structured interviews

Nine participants, three from each group, were invited to take part in the semi-structured interviews. They were first chosen according to their willingness to participate, and then screened to find those who had significant changes in their PRPSA pretest and posttest scores (i.e. either a significant increase or decrease in improvement based on their scores). The objective of the semi-structured interviews was to find the causes of the significant changes in the participants’ learning. The participants in the MALL and VRET groups were asked additional questions about their perceptions, suggestions, and criticism of using the assigned technology while practicing public speaking. Each interview lasted about 20 minutes. All interviews were conducted in Chinese, the participants’ native language, to reduce stress and to enhance the clarity of the interviewees’ responses. The interviews were audiotaped and were transcribed for analysis.

# 3.3.  Data collection instruments

# 3.3.1.  Teaching materials

The study prepared materials that covered successful public speaking. A handbook of PowerPoint slides was made that included tips on performing public speaking. Topics included vocal delivery skills (volume, breath, intonation, pace, pronunciation, fluency and vocal fillers, and accuracy of pronunciation), nonverbal cues (posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, and appearance), and speech organization (components of the speech, tips to open and close a speech, speech transitions, and styles of public speaking). The handbook was given to the participants of the three groups with minor differences: the handbook for the non-TELL group had 96 slides containing the instruction and speaking activities; the handbook for the MALL and VRET groups also had 96 slides, but the slides containing speaking activities were replaced with those introducing the mobile app for the MALL group and VR technology for the VRET group.

# 3.3.2.  Mobile applications

The mobile apps were selected following two criteria: (1) the app must be free of charge, at least for the basic functions; advanced functions could be purchased based on users’ needs1 ; and (2) the app must be available in both iOS and Android platforms, the two major operating systems for mobile devices. The objective was to ensure that the technology was accessible for every student.

3.3.2.1.  Orai: Communication coaching application.  Orai (https://www. oraiapp.com/) was selected for use in the MALL group, as it fulfilled the required features of MALL: provide constant feedback and allow self-practice anytime and anywhere using AI and ASR. Orai can track a speaker’s speaking traits, and it provides both a dashboard of metrics and a summary of advice on how to improve. Users speak to the app, and the app’s ASR functions turn spoken data into written data that is immediately processed by the AI system for speech analysis. Six types of feedback are provided—Pace, Filler Words, Clarity, Energy, Conciseness, and Confidence—and AI suggests areas to improve via comments that users can play back and listen to immediately. According to the Orai User Guide, Pace is defined as spoken words per minute over time; Filler Words refer to meaningless sounds like ‘um’; Energy is scored based on vocal pitch variation and volume variation; Clarity is scored based on word enunciation; Conciseness is scored based on usage of unwanted phrases, repetition, and passive voice; and Confidence’ is scored based on filler word usage and awkward pauses. As the app founder Danish Dhamani (2017) has said, “public speaking is a teachable skill,” and Orai provides a safe environment in which to practice public speaking and to receive positive reinforcement through feedback for improvement. Figure 1 shows screenshots of operation interfaces of Orai.

3.3.2.2.  Virtualspeech: Soft skill training with virtual reality.  VirtualSpeech (https://virtualspeech.com/product) was selected for use in the VRET group. This app creates realistic scenarios for users and provides constant feedback through speech analysis. The scenarios include a classroom, a meeting room, and an interview setting; each setting has an audience along with animated noise. In addition, the app provides real-time feedback, including pace (i.e. how quickly the user is speaking), confidence (i.e. the number of hesitation words), clarity (i.e. volume or loudness of voice), and engagement (i.e. intonation); VR technology also enables the analysis of speaking performances, such as eye contact and posture. The app provides a tracking function for free, with which users can track their progress and listen to previous speeches. The slogan of the app, ‘train in immersive virtual reality environments’, represents its major characteristic precisely (VirtualSpeech - VR App Guide & Tutorials & Features, 2021). Figure 2 shows screenshots of operation interfaces of VirtualSpeech.

# 3.4.  Procedure

The experiment was carried out over four successive weeks between late September and mid-October in 2019, with one hour of teaching time each week. The process was similar to the routine school schedule in order to reduce the influence of purposeful arrangement found in some laboratory experiments. The first week involved a ten-minute orientation: the participants were introduced to the objectives and schedule of the four-week learning experiment on public speaking. The participants of the MALL and VRET groups were told specifically to bring their own portable devices, with smartphones preferred. At this stage, all three groups were asked to complete the PRPSA, which took about 15 minutes, to measure their PSA before training.

After the orientation, the participants began to receive their respective instruction, learning about PSA and strategies to reduce anxiety via their assigned teaching methods. The total learning hours in the first three weeks was about 2.5 hours. For the non-TELL group, the participants received printed handouts and were instructed to prepare a public speech step by step. For the MALL group, the participants were instructed to download the selected mobile app according to the topic. For the VRET group, the participants were oriented to the process of downloading VirtualSpeech and operating a VR headset. The teacher inputs given to the participants were the same; the major difference among the three groups was in the practices. Take speaking speed for instance: the non-TELL group audio-recorded their speaking for one minute, counted the number of words, and calculated their speaking rate; the teacher then gave general feedback to the whole class. The MALL group spoke using the Orai app and received feedback reports, while the VRET group put on headsets and spoke in a virtual room, and then received feedback reports.

In the fourth week, the participants were required to give a five- to ten-minute speech in front of the group. Afterwards, all the participants completed the PRPSA again to measure their progress in PSA. To measure the participants’ speaking performances, all 33 speeches given by the students in the three groups were audio-recorded and analyzed by Orai for comparable results.

# 4.  Results and analysis

# 4.1.  Quantitative analyses

To examine whether there were differences in the participants’ PSA levels before and after the respective instruction methods in the three groups, a comparison of the participants’ PRPSA pretest and posttest scores among the three groups was conducted. A one-way ANOVA was performed, and the results shown in Table 1 revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in the PRPSA pretest scores among the three groups, $F ( 2 , 3 0 ) { = } 1 . 0 4 $ , $ { p } = 0 . 3 7$ , before receiving their respective instruction. To determine the effects of the instruction modes on reducing PSA, a one-way ANOVA was performed again to compare the PRPSA posttest scores among the three groups. Table 1 shows that there were no statistically significant differences in the posttest scores among the three groups, $F ( 2 , 3 0 ) { = } 0 . 0 0$ , $p { = } 1 . 0 0$ , suggesting that the three different instruction modes did not result in obvious differences in the learners’ perceived PSA.

To examine the participants’ perceived PSA after receiving their respective instruction, the PRPSA pretest and posttest scores were compared with a paired-sample $t$ -test. Table 2 shows the results of the three groups. All three groups obtained lower mean scores in the posttest (Non-TELL: $M = 9 9 . 7 3$ , $S D { = } 3 0 . 1 0$ ; MALL: $M = 9 9 . 3 6$ , $S D = 1 3 . 7 1$ ; VRET: $M = 9 9 . 4 5$ , $S D = 1 8 . 8 3 _ { \ L }$ ) compared with the mean scores in the pretest (Non-TELL: $M = 1 0 2 . 4 5$ , $S D { = } 2 7 . 1 4$ ; MALL: $M = 1 0 8 . 5 5$ , $S D { = } 1 1 . 8 3$ ; VRET:

Note. Paired differences were calculated by subtracting posttest scores from pretest scores. $^ { \ast \ast \ast } p < 0 . 0 0 1$ .

$M = 1 1 4 . 1 8$ , $S D = 1 4 . 8 0 _ { \it \_ }$ ). The lower PRPSA scores suggested lower PSA levels, meaning that the participants became less anxious about public speaking after training, no matter what instruction mode they received.

However, the differences between the pretest and posttest scores of the non-TELL group and the MALL group did not reach a statistically significant level (Non-TELL: $t ( 1 0 ) { = } 0 . 4 8$ , $ { p } = 0 . 6 4$ ; MALL: $t ( 1 0 ) { = } 2 . 1 4$ , $ { p } = 0 . 0 6 )$ ; only the VRET test scores showed a significant difference (VRET: $t ( 1 0 ) { = } 3 . 6 8$ , $ { p } < 0 . 0 0 )$ , with a large effect size (Cohen’s $d = 1 . 1 0 )$ . The VRET participants also generated the biggest difference in scores between the pretest and posttest and the smallest amount of variation ( $M$ of differenc $\gtrsim 1 4 . 7 3$ , $S D = 1 3 . 2 8 )$ , whereas the non-TELL group had the smallest difference between the two tests but the greatest dispersion ( $M$ of difference $= 2 . 7 3$ , $S D = 1 9 . 0 3 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). The results indicated that the participants who experienced learning with VR showed the largest difference in PSA levels. The contrast between the participants who learned with the facilitation of technology, particularly the VRET participants, showed rather consistent changes compared with those who did not learn with the facilitation of technology, suggesting that the impact of individual differences may have been compensated with the assistance of technology.

To determine whether instruction mode and perceived anxiety levels influenced the participants’ speaking performances, all the participants’ final speeches were analyzed by Orai and AI feedback was given. Pace, Energy, Conciseness, and Confidence feedback and Overall Score were represented by percentile ranks, while Clarity and Filler Words feedback used qualitative comments. In analyzing comparable feedback, only the

Pace, Energy, Conciseness, and Confidence feedback and Overall Score were taken into account, and the percentile ranks were treated as interval scales. Table 3 summarizes the means of the four types of AI feedback and overall score for the participants in each group. However, the one-way ANOVA found that none of the types of AI feedback had statistically significant differences among the three groups.

To further examine the relationship between the participants’ perceived PSA and their performances, Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient was calculated. Table 4 shows that the PRPSA posttest scores did not significantly correlate with any of the feedback, meaning that the participants’ perceived anxiety levels did not necessarily correlate with their actual speaking performances. However, the PRPSA posttest scores were found to be negatively correlated with Pace $\stackrel { \prime } { r } = - 0 . 3 3$ , $\hbar { > } 0 . 0 5 )$ and Confidence $( r { = } - 0 . 1 5$ , $\hbar > 0 . 0 5 ,$ ), suggesting that when the participants were less anxious, they tended to speak slower and reduce their use of filler words. In other words, the participants’ anxiety was observable through physical manifestations, but their anxiety level did not always predict their success in public speaking.

# 4.2.  Qualitative analyses

The main purpose of conducting the semi-structured interviews was to reveal the factors that resulted in changes in perceived PSA. Nine participants, three from each group, were invited to take part in the interviews. Pseudonyms were assigned to assure the anonymity of the interviewees. Table 5 summarizes the interviewees’ information.

# 4.2.1.  Experiences in learning through different modalities

In the non-TELL group, Eva and Penny agreed on the beneficial effects of receiving lecture-based training. Eva specified speed, appearance, and speech organization as the most useful tips for her, and she was most impressed by the tip to present ideas using a three-point approach as it was more effective and memorable. As for Penny, she identified speed, intonation, and eye contact as the most useful tips as they could grab the audience’s attention. However, Tina took a neutral stand toward the training. She specified her need for solutions to her most serious speaking problems, including difficulties in structuring a speech, discomfort with eye contact, and overuse of filler words. It is worth noting that Tina became more conscious of her long-lasting problems after receiving the training and talked about them precisely. The training seemed to raise her awareness and motivated her to reflect on her past experiences.

In the MALL group, all three interviewees agreed on the benefits of the training using the mobile app. Tips on using the phone’s microphone, posture, and appearance were specified by the three interviewees. Sarah mentioned that she never would have noticed those details in public speaking if she had not participated in the training. Jack, on the other hand, mentioned his surprise in acquiring new knowledge (see Excerpt 1):

Excerpt 1, Jack: I’m very surprised. For example, syllables can be used in speaking.   
They are used in music. I never knew that speaking is also rhythmic.

However, the three interviewees suggested giving more practice time in the training sessions. Vivian indicated that only four sessions of training, for a total of 2.5 hours, was not enough to familiarize her with the app’s interface, let alone for practice. When asked if they also used the app in other contexts, Sarah complained of the inefficiency of her mobile phone (see Excerpt 2):

The PRPS A scores range from 34 (the least anxious) to 170 (the most anxious).

Excerpt 2, Sarah: Many apps on my mobile phone can’t be downloaded…. I think it’s more convenient if everyone has the same system, but some just can’t. Maybe find apps with similar functions.

In the VRET group, the interviewees seemed to be impressed. David used the word 新奇 (‘novelty’) to describe his experience. Angie and Jennifer did not put much emphasis on the strategies learned but focused more on the new technology. Angie gave detailed descriptions about her experience of ‘interacting’ with the virtual audience (see Excerpt 3). Jennifer also mentioned her experience of applying the Triangle Technique, a strategy to engage in eye contact with everyone in the audience, in the VR setting (see Excerpt 4).

Excerpt 3, Angie: I think it’s great, because when I first saw those people in VR, I felt very uneasy. Some scratched their heads, some smiled and nodded at me. I thought what I said was great! I felt like I was speaking in a conference hall, and I found myself not as nervous as before.

Excerpt 4, Jennifer: It gives you a feeling that everyone is watching your report and simulated the real situation…. I think it’s pretty good, teaching some skills, like looking at the audience in triangulation.

4.2.2.  Technology-enhanced learning experience and public speaking anxiety In the non-TELL group, the interviewees mentioned that they had previous experience of using technology for various purposes, such as reciting English vocabulary, practicing English listening, and communicating with friends. However, when specifically asked about their opinions toward using technology for language learning, all three interviewees held negative opinions. Tina considered reading printed materials the most effective way to improve English, and contended that using technology was not necessary. Eva and Penny mentioned the harmful side effects on the eyes, whereas Penny also mentioned the possibility of being distracted by other apps on her mobile phone (see Excerpt 5):

Excerpt 5, Penny: It hurts the eyes. I think it can be used as an experience, but it can’t be used for teaching all the time.

In the MALL group, all three interviewees mentioned using technology to communicate with friends and to watch videos. Both Jack and Vivian mentioned their habits of using their mobile phone to look up English words. Jack identified himself as a low-frequency user of his mobile phone since he was too busy working and studying, but after receiving the training he admitted that there were many useful apps. Sarah, on the other hand, gave high praise to MALL due to its convenience (see Excerpt 6):

Excerpt 6, Sarah: I think it’s very convenient. Everyone carries mobile phones with them everywhere.

Sarah’s emphasis on convenience was also reflected in her answers to the questions about the predicted potential of using VR (see Excerpt 7):

Excerpt 7, Sarah: I think it should be more entertaining, but the convenience may not be as convenient as a mobile phone, because VR requires some tools, which are not easy to obtain.

In the VRET group, all the interviewees were impressed by the application of VR in learning public speaking. David and Angie thought that the simulation of real environments was the greatest advantage, while Jennifer greatly favored the AI evaluation (see Excerpt 8):

Excerpt 8, Jennifer: It can score my performance. I like this function. Knowing what I did not do well is the way to make progress.

The interviewees offered suggestions to improve the VR system: Angie wanted the interface to be changed, Jennifer wanted various and diverse VR scenarios, and David wanted more interactive feedback on his performance (see Excerpt 9):

Excerpt 9, David: I think it can increase feedback and give me direct suggestions like a real teacher, a bit like an online teacher, teaching me how to be better and improve my abilities.

However, when asked about their willingness to continue using TELL, the three interviewees from the VRET group said yes, they were willing and definitely willing to continue its use, while those from the MALL group hesitated. Sarah, in the MALL group, said that she was definitely not willing to continue using TELL because the operating system and the inefficiency of mobile phones did not motivate her (see Excerpt 2). Jack and Vivian said they might continue using TELL depending on the situation.

# 5.  Discussion

# 5.1.  Effects of explicit instruction on public speaking anxiety

The present study examined three groups of EFL learners who received the same strategy-focused instruction by different methods—lecture-based, mobile-assisted, and VR-mediated learning. The results showed that all three groups reduced their perceived PSA after their respective instruction. The findings not only implied the importance of receiving explicit instruction in the process of learning L2 public speaking but also conformed to previous studies on the beneficial effects of explicit instruction on language learning.

Explicit instruction is characterized by a series of scaffolds to guide learners through the learning process (Archer & Hughes, 2011). In speaking, the scaffolds could be given as strategies for or guidance to effective oral communication. Sabnani and Goh (2021) suggested that teachers should enhance students’ metacognition, making them aware of the elements and processes in speaking. Chou (2018) investigated EFL learners’ speaking anxiety and strategy use and found that learners exposed to full English-medium contexts decreased their speaking anxiety and practiced speaking strategies more frequently compared with those who received partial English-medium instruction. These findings support the idea that explicit instruction is effective in raising EFL learners’ awareness of strategy use and reducing EFL learners’ speaking anxiety.

Explicit instruction can also be presented through feedback given to L2 learners. In the present study, the interviewees of the TELL groups recognized the usefulness of receiving instant AI feedback and attributed their improvement to the suggestions and instruction given. In classroom-based speaking training, teachers are unable to give each student immediate feedback due to time limitations, whereas students might fail to process feedback due to language anxiety. Mobile-assisted feedback allows flexibility in teacher-student interactions. In the research of Xu et  al. (2016), teacher feedback given via a social communication app enabled the EFL students to notice specific problems, gain more confidence, and engage more actively in the learning activities. With the advances in AI, in addition to teacher feedback, elaborative feedback that ‘explains, directs or monitors students work’ (Murphy, 2007, p. 110) can be generated by machines, and such feedback helps learners to pay attention to details in language learning tasks (Cárdenas-Claros, 2020).

It should be noted that the effects of receiving feedback solely from technology are inconclusive. Loewen and Erlam (2006) study on EFL beginners using chatrooms found no significant gains in response to computer-generated corrective feedback. They attributed the ineffectiveness to the synchronous nature of chatrooms, which reduces occurrences of uptake in response to feedback. Similarly, Rassaei’s (2017) study, which adopted video-conferencing, resulted in equal effects of computer-mediated and face-to-face feedback on L2 speaking development. The two studies showed that only receiving feedback was not enough to make learning happen; facilitative channels of receiving feedback should also be included to ensure its uptake. Most recently, Dai and Wu (2021) applied a social networking app with ASR functions to teach pronunciation and found that peer feedback given through the app had a better learning effect than the ASR feedback. They suggested leveraging social networking apps and their embedded ASR technology; in this case, learners can be engaged in autonomous and collaborative learning even outside of class to maximize the potential of MALL. The present study corresponded to that suggestion, as David from the VRET group pointed out the need to have an interactive process when receiving feedback (see Excerpt 9).

# 5.2.  Impact of technology enhancement on public speaking training

The participants in the two TELL groups reacted positively to the technology and reported significantly higher levels of technology acceptance in learning after experiencing learning with technology facilitation. The participants who were interviewed indicated convenience as the main reason; in addition, the interestingness and novelty of operating through and learning with apps attracted them.

Technology enhancement is deemed promising in speaking instruction mainly owing to the development of AI and ASR. Chiu et  al. (2007) argued that ASR-based speaking programs showed potential in engaging EFL learners in speaking. Bashori et  al. (2020) also confirmed that students felt less anxious when speaking in front of ASR-based websites compared with speaking to peers or other people. However, Bashori et  al. (2020) also emphasized the differences between the participants’ actual performances and their perceived improvement. The participants seemed to believe that their speaking anxiety could be reduced by means of language learning websites, although statistical analyses showed no significant differences in anxiety levels before and after using the ASR-based websites.

Similar to Bashori et  al. (2020), the present study found no significant correlation between the participants’ perceived anxiety levels and their actual performances. One possible explanation is the metacognitive accuracy of individuals, as Seliger (1979) claimed that external explanations are unlikely to match psychological reality, conscious experience is subjective, external observation is impossible, and introspection is ‘notoriously unreliable’ (Schmidt, 1990, p. 130). Another possible reason may reflect the inconclusive effect of FLA on language performance. MacIntyre (1995) posited that FLA could be facilitated since anxiety may improve performance through increased effort. Dalkilic’s (2001) study proved such an assumption, showing that the students’ grades turned out to be higher as their level of language anxiety increased. A high level of anxiety and its correlation with performance may not always be negative.

Bashori et  al. (2020) identified three conditions to explain an increase in anxiety caused by learning with ASR-based websites: unprepared environment and inadequate equipment; students’ unfamiliarity with using the system; and missing the teacher’s role as a learning facilitator. These three conditions also corresponded to the findings of the present study. In the interviews, the inefficiency of mobile phones was one complaint, as it inhibited the participants from downloading or running the app smoothly (see Excerpt 2). Participants such as Vivian asked for sufficient time to familiarize themselves with the apps. Finally, teacher facilitation was brought up (see Excerpt 9), highlighting the importance of teacher-student interaction.

# 5.3.  Impact of virtual reality on public speaking anxiety

The present study adopted a mobile-based VR application, hypothesizing that the simulated effects of exposure therapy would help EFL learners reduce their PSA. The results of the ANOVA test on the PSA show no difference in the posttest between groups; however, members of the VRET group show significant decrease on their anxiety levels in the posttest comparing to the pretest, suggesting that the VRET group benefitted more from the instruction. The novelty effect was the most crucial factor, according to the interviews. In the same vein, Lai and Chen (2021) found that the novelty effect of the VR game in their study played a role in raising interest in learning and improving the learners’ vocabulary retention.

In addition, VR was supported by the participants in the present study due to the immersive sense of presence VR creates. Angie described her experience of ‘interacting’ with the virtual audience in the virtual world (see Excerpt 3). Jennifer mentioned her practice of sweeping her eyes around the virtual conference room (see Excerpt 4). Both were impressed by the immersive learning experience with the VR app. This trait has been evidently indicated in previous studies (Lindner et  al., 2019; Pertaub et  al., 2001; Slater et  al., 1999). From a cognitive perspective, educational psychologists (Ladendorf et  al., 2019; Yildirim et  al., 2019) have explained the benefits of VR learning, suggesting that the immersive environment can administer a stronger sense of presence and motivate learners to process the information deeply. From the perspective of the social cognitive theory, the authenticity of a context created by VR—whether it is a simulation of a real environment that mimics the real world or an artificial environment that is inaccessible through direct experience in the real world—is the biggest pedagogical benefit of using VR in foreign language learning (C. J. Chen, 2009; Von der Emde et  al., 2001).

Finally, no matter how promising a VR app is for learning speaking, the role of teachers as facilitators is still irreplaceable. Promethean (2020) called on teachers to merge VR systems with traditional teaching methods, positing that this hybrid approach has the potential to transform the world of education. Klaassen et  al. (2018) suggested that teachers should be actively involved in guiding students in using VR, familiarizing them with the functions and assisting them in gauging feedback provided by the metrics of the system.

# 5.4.  Limitations and suggestions for future studies

The main limitation of the study was the small sample size of each group $\mathbf { \tilde { n } = 1 1 }$ ), and the homogeneity of the participants may have narrowed the scope of implementation in more diverse contexts. Furthermore, the limited time of the instruction modes (i.e. a total of 2.5 hours) may have influenced the participants’ general comprehension and their uptake of public speaking. However, judging from the statistical effect sizes, such as the one detected for differences in the PRPSA pretest and posttest scores of the VRET group (Cohen’s $d = 1 . 1 0 ,$ ), the effects were large enough to be meaningful in the real world. The results thus are deemed evident and the findings are considered practical as long as they are treated carefully before generalizing them.

In the literature, the mismatch of the participants’ perceived anxiety levels and their actual speaking performances highlights the difficulty of assessing anxiety, a subjective emotion. To obtain more valid findings, the current study approached the topic from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives: the credibility of the PRPSA has been established in previous research, and the interviews facilitated the interpretation of the quantitative data. Even so, future studies are encouraged to develop more objective measures of learners’ perceptions and to treat perception data more cautiously. In addition, the extent of the usefulness of AI feedback perceived by the participants should also be investigated; since the participants mentioned the need to have interactions with their teacher, it is worth evaluating whether AI feedback is indeed effective for speaking performance.

Moreover, different types of anxiety should be taken into consideration. McCroskey (2001) argues that the types of communication apprehension vary: anxiety should be related to trait, context, audience, and situation. While the PRPSA as the pretest was administered at the very beginning, the post PRPSA was given after the students gave the final speech. For the former, the anxiety measured could be restrained to trait anxiety, whereas for the latter, the anxiety students reported could be related to situational anxiety. As the types of anxiety explored are not the same, in order to make valid comparison, instead of a trait type of questionnaire, a state type of questionnaire that measure students’ anxiety immediately after the speech should be administered, and a speech should be added before the pretest.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study was an exploratory study with an experimental design, targeted at exploring EFL learners’ perceptions of public speaking anxiety and suggesting reasons that affected the EFL learners’ self-perceptions. The study delivered the instruction of public speaking strategies to 33 participants using three modalities: traditional lecture-based (the non-TELL group), mobile-assisted (the MALL group), and VR-facilitated (the VRET group). The results showed reduced anxiety levels in all three groups, but no statistical significance was determined. The VRET group showed a significant decrease in their PRPSA scores in the posttest, suggesting the greatest reduction of PSA. The results of the interviews revealed that the mobile-based app allowed the learners to monitor their speaking performances in detail, such as speaking rate, intonation, and incidence of filler words, and the VR app was particularly useful in training eye contact. The convenience of technology and the accessibility of mobile-based apps allowed the EFL learners in the TELL groups to engage in individualized speaking training at any time; in addition, combined ASR and AI functions generated instructional feedback in a non-threatening way and inferably alleviated anxious feelings and fear.

Regarding the EFL learners’ perceptions of the technology-enhanced learning experience, the interview responses showed a great difference between those who experienced TELL and those who did not. The interviewees from the non-TELL group held negative attitudes and demonstrated low motivation for integrating TELL into future learning, mainly because of the side effects of using mobile phones such as eye strain and distractions. The interviewees from the TELL groups, whether through the mobile app or through virtual reality, were positive about their learning experiences, and the main reason was their convenience. However, not all TELL learners wanted to continue learning in that mode, and their reasons varied. Except for limitations resulting from the need for equipment, the interviewees indicated the irreplaceability of real-life educators, in that the interaction between students and teachers is crucial to the uptake of learning.

Future studies are suggested to take the primary findings yielded by the present study, integrate the ideas into the curriculum accordingly, and implement the various teaching methods in a larger group of participants in real classroom contexts. In doing so, it is expected that the results generated in a well-planned manner will contribute to language teaching in EFL contexts.
