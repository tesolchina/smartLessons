# Abstract

In this article, I describe mainstream middle school classrooms designed to re-think the conditions under which language minority students who have lived in the United States for a number of years can develop English language skills while also gaining access to a rigorous curriculum. I describe a variety of transactions that students used to engage in group social studies tasks, and I show how students used language differently for discussing ideas within their groups and for preparing to present these ideas to their teacher and classmates. I argue that in order to document the wide range of language demands and language learning opportunities inherent in doing academic work, as well as to understand what students from language minority backgrounds are able to do to meet these demands, the notion of ‘‘academic English’’ must be expanded beyond the ‘‘academic’’ vs. ‘‘conversational’’ language distinction.

# 1. Introduction

Many students worldwide attend secondary schools in which subject matter instruction is available only in a language other than the one they speak at home. Increasingly, this language of instruction is English, both for language minority students in Englishdominant countries and for all students where English is not the societal language but is the common language of instruction. Educators in both kinds of settings face the dual challenge of fostering the development of students’ English language skills while providing access to core academic content in the language. Because of this link between language and content, discussions surrounding the nature of ‘‘academic English,’’ and the conditions under which students can best develop it, cannot be separated from issues related to equitable access to core school curriculum (Valde´ s, 2004). This article focuses on a middle school in the US but is intended to raise larger issues also relevant to other contexts in which English is the medium of instruction for students who do not speak it at home.

Mainstream content classrooms in many US schools do not represent a promising atmosphere for either language development or content learning for language minority students. Mainstream teachers often receive little training in working with linguistically diverse students (de Jong & Harper, 2005; Ga´ ndara, Maxwell-Jolly, & Driscoll, 2005). Curriculum is usually designed primarily for monolingual English speakers, and there are rarely instructional strategies to meet the needs of English learners. For these reasons, a combination of English as a Second Language and sheltered content classrooms1 is often provided to students as a way to help them develop language and understand content (Genesee, 1999; Kaufman & Crandall, 2005). However, for language minority students who have been in the US for longer periods of time, being separated from mainstream English-speaking peers and curricula in sheltered classrooms may limit opportunities to develop both language and content. The negative effects of academic tracking (Donato, Menchaca, & Valencia, 1991; Oakes, 1985) are especially troublesome for language minority students who may be sealed off in what Valde´ s (2004) has called ‘‘self-contained, hermetic universes’’ (see also Harklau, 1994; Talmy, 2004; Valde´ s, 2001).

In this article, I describe middle school classrooms designed as an alternative to both mainstream settings that ignore the needs of linguistically diverse students and sheltered instruction classrooms that may not serve the needs of longer-term language minority students. A university-school partnership resulted in (a) redesigning 7th grade mainstream social studies classrooms with the needs of linguistically diverse students in mind and (b) integrating long-term US resident students with their mainstream peers in these classrooms. In order to understand the resulting linguistic challenges and opportunities, I explored the language that students used in small groups as they engaged in their assigned tasks and prepared to make classroom presentations. To do so, it was necessary to employ a broad conceptualization of ‘‘academic English.’’

Conversations about the language of schooling often focus on (a) how language used for academic purposes varies from its putative non-academic counterpart, termed variably everyday, ordinary, informal, conversational, interpersonal, basic, playground, and even street language and (b) how language minority students who may be fluent in the latter often lack the former (Collier, 1987; Hakuta, Goto Butler, & Witt, 2000). Widely influential has been Cummins’ distinction between ‘‘cognitively demanding,’’ ‘‘decontextualized’’ academic language and less demanding ‘‘conversational’’ language with more contextual cues (Cummins, 1984, 2000).2

Schleppegrell (2004) points out that school language has often been equated with ‘‘literate language,’’ putatively more explicit, complex, and cognitively demanding. She argues, however, that such a perspective ‘‘ignores the cultural and experiential roots of knowledge about language use at school’’ and at the same time ‘‘devalues the explicitness, complexity, and cognitive demand of interactional spoken language’’ (p. 16). Schleppegrell concludes that ‘‘to call any language decontextualized ignores the context all language realizes’’ (p. 16). Meanwhile Cummins’ model has been criticized as ignoring the sociopolitical context of schooling, as conflating language proficiency and academic achievement, and as privileging the language of the educated classes (Bartolome, 1998; Cummins, 2000; MacSwan & Rolstad, 2003; Rivera, 1984; Rolstad, forthcoming).

Other approaches have also distinguished the language of schooling from language used elsewhere. Scarcella (2003) contrasts ‘‘academic’’ with ‘‘everyday’’ English along linguistic, cognitive, and what she calls ‘‘sociocultural/psychological’’ dimensions, arguing that using academic English encompasses all of the competencies of everyday English plus additional requirements. Butler, Lord, Stevens, Borrego, and Bailey (2004) document linguistic features and language functions of textbooks and content standards used in elementary math and science classrooms. Systemic functional linguists (Halliday & Martin, 1993; Schleppegrell, 2004; Unsworth, 2000) have described constellations of linguistic and discourse features uniquely associated with particular school subject areas.

All of these approaches emphasize the role of ‘‘language that stands in contrast to the everyday informal speech that students use outside the classroom environment’’ (Bailey & Butler, 2003, p. 9). This distinction has been used successfully help identify the challenges facing many language minority students and the problems with overestimating students’ language proficiency based on some language tests (Cummins, 1984). However, it also potentially masks, or at least downplays, the important ways in which students use language in a wide range of ways, including ‘‘conversational’’ or ‘‘everyday’’ uses of English, to engage in academic tasks. Sociocultural approaches to studying academic discourse (Gutierrez, 1995; Hawkins, 2004) have pointed out that there are ‘‘multiple sorts of events, subject areas, genres of language, and discourse and participation structures represented in the classroom’’ (Hawkins, 2004, p. 25, emphasis added). Sociocultural theories have also emphasized the importance of interactive talk for learning, both among students and between students and their teacher (Wells, 1999). Barnes (1992) has argued that students’ use of more informal ‘‘exploratory’’ talk may actually be more beneficial for learning than focusing on the formal language desired by the teacher. Meanwhile, at the higher education level, scholars have shown how a wide variety of linguistic resources, including those often associated with ‘‘informal’’ or ‘‘conversational’’ language, are used for academic work (Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Byrd, & Helt, 2002; Csomay, 2005; Grimshaw, 1994).

I began my analysis not by attempting to contrast ‘‘academic’’ with other sorts of language, but by asking the broader question ‘‘how did students use language to engage in academic tasks?’’ Because language represents action (Austin, 1975; Searle, 1969), and using language is a way to ‘‘get things done in the real world’’ (Brown & Yule, 1983, p. 13; see also Clark, 1996), my focus was on the variety of ways that students’ use language to ‘‘get things done’’ in the world of 7th grade classrooms.

# 2. The school, the students, and the intervention

Gerona Middle School3 is in central California. During the 2000–2001 school year, $7 6 \%$ of students were identified as Latino, $12 \%$ as non-Hispanic White, and a combined $12 \%$ Filipino, African American, Asian, and Pacific Islander. Of the majority Latino students, most were of Mexican descent, either immigrants to the US, children of immigrants, or members of Mexican American families who had lived in the area for several generations. Over half were from poor families, and two-thirds came from homes with parents with no formal education beyond high school. Teachers and students suffered from low morale, partly due to students’ low scores on state-mandated standardized tests.

Over half $( 5 7 \% )$ of the students were designated by the school as Limited English Proficient (LEP), the official statewide designation at that time for students still in need of support in order to access content-area instruction in English. Many students not designated as LEP also came from language minority backgrounds but were not identified as needing language support, either because they were initially designated as Fluent English Proficient (FEP) or had been redesignated as FEP at some point before the 7th grade.4 A minority of students, including Latinos, Anglo-Americans, and others, were designated ‘‘English Only’’ (EO), indicating that their families had stated that no language other than English was spoken at home.

A university-school partnership, designed to create and study the conditions under which 7th grade students could access the language and content of grade-level social studies curriculum and interact with English-speaking peers, resulted in changes to classroom student composition, organization, and curriculum (Bunch, Abram, Lotan, & Valde´ s, 2001; Bunch, Lotan, Valde´ s, & Cohen, 2005).5 Students identified by the school as no longer in need of explicit ESL instruction but not yet ready for regular mainstream content area classrooms were placed into the newly designed mainstream social studies classrooms instead of the traditional separate, sheltered classes they otherwise would have attended. As a result, in six different classrooms taught by two different teachers, these ‘‘transitional’’ LEP students studied with classmates with greater English proficiency: those designated as ‘‘mainstreamed’’ LEP (students still carrying the official LEP designation but who had previously been deemed ready for mainstream instruction), FEP, and EO.

The new curriculum and classroom organization were based on Complex Instruction (CI), characterized by intellectually challenging, open-ended tasks completed by small linguistically and academically heterogeneous groups (Cohen & Lotan, 1997). I focus on two thematic CI units used in these classrooms: The Mosaic of Islam and Challenging the Authority of Institutions: the Reformation. Each 2-week unit consisted of a series of handson activities, each lasting two class periods. For example, during one Reformation Unit activity, students used excerpts from the Twelve Articles of the Peasant’s Rebellion of 1524–1525 to design a ‘‘Peasant’s Declaration’’ poster that would be used to convince others to join the movement (Fig. 1). In another, they studied Reformation-era political cartoons and then designed an original cartoon that challenged the authority of a current

# CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY OF INSTITUTIONS

# Activity 3: The Twelve Articles and the Peasants' Rebellion of 1524-25 Resource Card

Luther's challenging the authority of the Roman Catholic Church coincided with challenging the authority of other institutions. Many peasants, discontented with their poverty, began to openly challenge the authority of the Church and lords over their earnings. Inspired by the ideas and actions of Martin Luther, the peasants led a rebellion in 1524-25. They pronounced their goals in the Twelve Articles. Below follow a few of the Twelve Articles.

Peasants challenged the Church

The Second Article - Since the right tithe is established in the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New, we are ready and willing to pay the fair tithe of grain, but it should be done properly. The Word of God plainly provides that it should be given to God and passed on to his own. If it is to be given to a minister, we will in the future collect the tithe through our church elders sufficient for the livelihood of the minister and his family. The remainder shall be given to the poor of the place.

What   
should be done with the   
donations

The Third Article - It has been the custom for men to hold us as their own property, which is pitiable enough considering that Christ has redeemed and purchased us without exception. Accordingly, it is consistent with Scripture that we should be free and wish to be so..

Why   
peasants should be free

The Fourth Article - In the fourth place it has been the custom that no poor man was allowed to catch venison or wild fowl, or fish in flowing water, which seems to us quite unbrotherly and selfish...Accordingly, if a man holds possession of waters , he has purchased the right to use those waters.

One right demanded by the peasants

The Fifth Article - In the fifth place, we are aggrieved in the matter of wood cutting, for our noble folk have appropriated all the woods to themselves alone...It should be free to every member of the community to help himself to such firewood as he needs in his home.

Another right demanded

The Seventh Article - Seventh, we will not hereafter allow ourselves to be farther oppressed by our lords. What the lords possess is to be held according to the agreement between the lord and the peasant.

Another right demanded

class. The teacher and one or two teaching assistants circulated among the groups but had been encouraged to delegate as much authority to students as possible and not to ‘‘hover’’ excessively.6

The CI curriculum at Gerona was designed to promote language development and content learning while providing students with exposure to authentic primary and secondary historical documents (Bunch et al., 2001, 2005). Students were grouped heterogeneously so that language minority students would have the opportunity to communicate with students at higher levels of English language proficiency, and so that all students would benefit from each others’ intellectual contributions. CI is designed to promote equitable participation in these groups (Cohen, 1994; Cohen & Lotan, 1997). Students are assigned rotating roles, such as ‘‘facilitator,’’ ‘‘materials manager,’’ and ‘‘reporter.’’ Teachers implement ‘‘status treatments’’ by pointing out no one in the group is good at all of the abilities that each task requires but that everyone is good at least one of them, and by publicly recognizing intellectual contributions made by low-status students. To support struggling readers while still providing access to authentic texts, resource cards included marginal notations (see Fig. 1). Evaluation criteria (Abram et al., 2002; Cohen, Lotan, Abram, Scarloss, & Schultz, 2002), rubrics, and model language were also provided to foster effective writing and presentations.

# 3. The study

To understand the opportunities and challenges facing language minority students in these CI classrooms, I studied how linguistically heterogeneous groups in two classrooms used language to engage in group tasks.7 Using data collected as part of the larger study, I transcribed audio-taped recordings of 15 group sessions, each lasting about $5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , representing approximately 12 total hours of talk. The selected sessions came from two different classrooms, each taught by a different teacher using the same curriculum. Two student groups were included from the Islam unit and two from the Reformation unit. I focused on the language used by student groups, rather than on individual students, both because of the nature of the curriculum and in order to understand the broader context in which individual students were placed. I concentrated on student-to-student interaction, rather than interactions with the teacher, because students conducted the vast majority of their work without the teacher present in the groups.

I began my analysis guided by the open-ended questions ‘‘What is going on here?’’; ‘‘What are these people doing in this situation?’’; and ‘‘How are they accomplishing this in talk?’’ (Grimshaw, Feld, & Jenness, 1994). The data were analyzed and interpreted using a conventional qualitative approach, which included recursively identifying, revising, and challenging findings through multiple readings of the transcripts. The first finding was that all groups focused on a number of similar tasks related to their assignments, such as reading their activity and resource cards, answering discussion questions, designing and completing their multi-media products, and preparing for the class presentation. I use the term transaction to describe the collective focus of each group’s talk during any given stretch of talk during a session.8 I coded each part of every transcript as primarily representing one transaction.9 After identifying the major transactions, I focused on one transaction at a time and analyzed all instances of that transaction across all 15 transcripts.

# 4. Transactions during groupwork activities

Student groups consistently engaged in eight different transactions, mostly conducted in English10:

$\bullet$ beginning the interaction, $\bullet$ introducing the group, $\bullet$ reading the activity card, $\bullet$ accessing resource cards, $\bullet$ answering discussion questions, $\bullet$ creating the multimedia product, $\bullet$ preparing for the presentation, engaging in other talk11.

Focusing on the transactions allowed me to follow, from beginning to end, the language used throughout each entire activity, as students initiated their groupwork, came to terms with the details of their assignment, completed the work, and prepared for the presentation. While the same set of transactions occurred across all groups, units, and activities, there was variation regarding when and how groups engaged in each transaction. To highlight the range of language used within and across transactions, I present brief profiles of three of these transactions (accessing resource cards, creating the multimedia project, and preparing for the presentation). I then focus in more depth on a fourth: answering discussion questions, exploring how students used language differently for different academic purposes and audiences even within one transaction.

# 4.1. Accessing resource cards

Resource cards provided the primary and secondary texts at the heart of each activity (Figs. 1 and 2). Students made substantive use of the resources: they discussed and debated interpretations of what they read, evaluated the cards for their usefulness, made comments or observations regarding the information presented, paid close attention to the details, and occasionally connected the information to the central ideas of the unit. In all but one session, students read at least parts of the resource cards aloud and discussed their contents. In almost half of the sessions, students read these cards aloud as part of their routine of getting started on the assignment. In some cases, students also paraphrased the information, interpreted it, made an observation, or linked it to a question or the required product. Whether or not they read the resource cards aloud as part of their initial routine, groups used the resources later in the session for assistance in answering discussion questions, completing their product, and preparing for the presentation.

Students occasionally struggled to read particular words aloud, and at times individual students or the entire group was confused about what they were reading. In most groups, however, there was at least one student who could help with the problem, whether it be decoding or comprehension. In some cases, students asked the teacher for help, or the group found a way to complete the activity without relying on the ‘‘missing’’ information. The problems with reading these rigorous texts did not seem to prevent any group from completing its work.

# 4.2. Creating the multi-media product

As they rotated through their activities during both units, groups were responsible for creating a wide variety of ‘‘products’’ to be shared the next day with the teacher and class: skits depicting historical events, posters representing student-designed laws and manifestos, illustrated trade maps, three-dimensional models of the printing press, Islamic-style artwork, political cartoons, and news briefs. While working on these products, students talked about managing time, materials, and labor; discussed the content and design of their work; and proposed and revised language of the product itself. Different kinds of products called for different uses of language. Creating a skit, for example, involved assigning speaking parts, inventing lines for each character, and designing costumes. Building a printing press included discussions surrounding mechanical procedures, design decisions, and required materials.

# 4.3. Preparing for the presentation

All groups spent time explicitly preparing for their presentations. At times, students focused on the extent to which group members understood the central concepts and were prepared both for their individual role during the presentations and to respond to potential questions from the teacher. At other times, students discussed whether the necessary work was completed and whether they had answers prepared for their assigned questions. Occasionally, an individual student asked the group for assistance in understanding something or advice concerning what she should say during the presentation. In most sessions, students also discussed the logistics of the presentation, including who would say what when. Often these logistical discussions provided opportunities for students to practice what they were going to say, clarify their answers, and get feedback from their groupmates. Students also rehearsed their presentations, quizzing each other to ensure everyone was prepared, helping each other practice the pronunciation of key words or phrases, and revising the content and wording of their presentations.

These three transactions demonstrate the variety of ways in which students were called upon to use English for academic purposes in these classrooms. No one variety of ‘‘academic’’ English was sufficient to complete all transactions. Given the requirements for group interaction inherent in each of these transactions, students did not leave their ‘‘conversational’’ or ‘‘everyday’’ language at the classroom door.

In the next section, I explore how students used ‘‘conversational’’ resources in order to do academic work, and how they demonstrated their awareness that different audiences and purposes often call for different uses of language, even within a single transaction.

# 5. Two ways to ‘‘answer’’ discussion questions

Students were expected to discuss assigned questions printed on their activity cards and be able to respond to them as part of their group presentation. They were told that every member of the group should be prepared individually to answer every discussion question during the presentation if asked by the teacher. Groups often read the questions in their entirety toward the beginning of the session and then addressed them at various points, often interweaving these discussions with other parts of the assignment.

As groups talked about their assigned questions, they demonstrated awareness of two different kinds of audiences: (a) their fellow group members, as students ‘‘answered’’ the questions by proposing and discussing responses and (b) an outside audience, as students constructed official ‘‘answers’’ to be shared with their teacher and classmates during the group presentation. Both students’ preliminary discussions prompted by the questions and their construction of their ‘‘final answers’’ were central aspects of the ‘‘academic English’’ of these classrooms.

# 5.1. The language of ideas: answering questions by talking about them

In the following example, students discussed rights sought by peasants during the Rebellion of 1524–1525. The excerpt comes after the group had meticulously read aloud the entire activity card, read and paraphrased each of the peasants’ complaints while accessing the resource card (Fig. 1), and summarized the complaints again in reference to the first discussion question. The group then turned to Question $\# 2$ :

Excerpt 1 12,13

7. well they do get protection from their   
8. from their lords   
9. and stuff   
10. Isabel: I know but   
11. Gina: yeah but   
12. if they’re free   
13. Isabel: they do get   
14. Gina: they could have their own land   
15 . and   
16. they could   
17. Albert: no protection

23. Isabel: uh huh   
24. leave the

28. Gina: yeah?   
29. Albert: yeah   
30. Isabel: freedom   
31. ((10 turns omitted))   
32. Isabel: or which one do you think is like a good one   
33. Gina: which one do YOU think   
34. when she say freedom   
35. he said freedom   
36. I said freedom   
37. Aaron: like   
38. Gina: which do YOU think   
39. Aaron: water   
40. Gina: why   
41. Aaron: clean water   
42. well because like   
43. the water’s like   
44. I wouldn’t even care if like   
45. like   
46. if we had freedom   
47. cause like   
48. Gina: like if   
49. Aaron: like if he has all the water   
50. you won’t die   
51. or nothing   
52. cause you have water   
53. Gina: but if you want   
54. if you had like one wish granted of all these   
55. which one would you want   
56. Aaron: well it would depend what kind of position I’m in   
57. Gina: well they’re peasants   
58. Aaron: ok I would want water

Students in this excerpt engaged in a discussion about ideas centrally related to their academic work in a unit focusing on how individuals and groups have historically challenged prevailing institutions. Isabel staked out and defended her position that ‘‘freedom’’ would be the hardest right for peasants to fight for during the rebellion, and apparently the most important (Lines 2 and 4). Aaron immediately challenged the response by arguing that peasants actually benefited in some ways from the lords (‘‘well maybe not freedom cause maybe people/don’t really want/well they do get protection from their/from their lords/and stuff,’’ Lines 5–9). Gina supported Isabel’s initial position by arguing that with freedom, ‘‘they could have their own land/and/ they could/ythey could work for themselves/not for everyone,’’ Lines 14–19). Isabel added that ‘‘they could get the water without asking,’’ Line 20). Albert added to the advantages of freedom (‘‘they could leave,’’ Line 22), to which Isabel elaborated: ‘‘uh huh/leave the/if they wanna xx to a /move to another city/they could leave,’’ Lines 23–27). Aaron, however, maintained his minority position and, when pressed on which right he would argue would be the most important, stated ‘‘water’’ (Line 39). When pressed for reasons why, he argued that the guarantee of physical survival afforded by access to water would trump the more abstract notion of freedom: ‘‘clean water/well because like/the water’s like/I wouldn’t even care if like/like/if we had freedom/cause like/ylike if he has all the water/you won’t die/or nothing/cause you have water’’ (Lines 41–52).

As they engaged with these ideas, students’ language was replete with features typical of interactive communication as opposed to the ‘‘decontextualized,’’ ‘‘detached,’’ or ‘‘literate’’ language often associated with ‘‘academic English’’ (Brown & Yule, 1983; Chafe, 1982; Ochs, 1979; Schleppegrell, 2004). The talk is marked by single-word and short-phrase responses; repetition; abandoned constructions; informal affirmations (uh huh, yeah, and o.k.), oral discourse markers (well, like), phrases typical of informal conversation (‘‘well they do get protection from their lords/ and stuff,’’ Lines 8–9) and some features of nonstandard English (‘‘you won’t die/ or nothing,’’ Lines 50–51). However, all of these features serve important functional and social purposes (Jucker & Ziv, 1998; Schiffrin, 1994; Underhill, 2003), and therefore serve as resources for students to complete their academic work. To emphasize its academic importance, I call the interactive language such as used by the group here the language of ideas.

# 5.2. The language of display: constructing ‘‘answers’’ for the presentation

In responding to their assigned discussion questions, students at Gerona did not only use the language of ideas. They also constructed more formal ‘‘answers,’’ using what I call the language of display, with more features of the ‘‘decontextualized’’ or ‘‘literate’’ language often associated with academic language. The following stretch of talk, after one group addressed its assigned discussion questions referring to a Reformation-era political cartoon challenging the selling of indulgences (Fig. 2), illustrates the use of both the language of ideas and the language of display:

Excerpt 214

1. Sylvia: and the second part of the question   
2. this is also part of question one   
3. it says ‘‘what visual symbols are used to show this message’’   
4. umm   
5. Eric: look that guy is holding a bunch of scrolls   
6. in a suitcase   
7. the monk   
8. Sylvia: the the the   
9. Eric: the guy is like begging him   
10. and look he’s holding a briefcase   
11. full of scrolls   
12. Sylvia: ok ‘the monk is   
13. the monk is holding   
14. rolls of paper   
15. as the   
16. person’   
17. Elena: wait read read it again   
18. the monk is   
19. Sylvia: wait wait   
20. I’m trying to think of what to put   
21. ‘the monk is’   
22. ask him   
23. he got it   
24. what do we write?   
25. Eric: ‘the monk is holding a briefcase full of   
26. um   
27. indulgences to sell to the guy that’s begging’

Initially, Eric urged his groupmates to ‘‘look,’’ an indication that he was using the visual context of the political cartoon to get his message across (Lines 5–7). Eric’s use of the pronoun that (in ‘‘that guy’’) is also a reference that relies on access to the cartoon itself. Meanwhile, Eric’s use of the words guy and bunch gives the response an informal tone. In Line 7, Eric appeared to clarify that the ‘‘guy’’ he is referring to is ‘‘the monk,’’ but his juxtaposition of this qualification to the previous utterance without connecting it syntactically is also more consistent with oral as opposed to written-like means of communicating information (Brown & Yule, 1983; Chafe, 1982; Ochs, 1979). After Sylvia’s brief interruption in Line 8, Eric used features of informal oral communication in rephrasing his answer (Lines 9–11): the discourse marker like, the continued use of look, and the repetition of the informal guy.

By the end of the excerpt, however, Eric’s answer (‘‘the monk is holding a briefcase full of $/ \mathrm { u m } /$ indulgences to sell to the guy that’s begging,’’ Lines 25–27) no longer included pronouns requiring the visual context of the cartoon. Eric’s choice of words would probably also be considered more appropriate for ‘‘academic’’ audiences: e.g. monk, briefcase, indulgences. Along the way, Eric’s groupmate Sylvia is clearly more interested in constructing an official text of the answer than talking about ideas. In each of her turns after initially reading the question, she focused on answer as text: initiating the format of an answer (‘‘the, the, the,’’ Line 8); revising the form of Eric’s initial response (‘‘the monk is holding/rolls of paper,’’ Lines 14–15), and finally asking Eric, ‘‘what do we write?’’ (Line 21).

Sometimes, students also signaled that colloquial uses of language were not appropriate for their presentations. In the example below, one student suggested a change of wording in the introduction to her group’s skit depicting trade during the time of the Islamic Empire:

Excerpt 315

<html><body><table><tr><td>1.</td><td>Adam: and then</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>and then I&#x27;m going to say</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>cause and I&#x27;m gonna be like the narrator</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>and say um</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>&#x27;there were two dudes</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>that came from&#x27;.</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>where</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>where&#x27;d they come from?</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>France</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Rachel: no don&#x27;t say dudes</td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>okay?</td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>Manuel: I came from Chinese.</td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>Adam: people</td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>uh</td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>people from</td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>um</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>Rachel: don&#x27;t say dudes</td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>Manuel: I came from china.</td></tr><tr><td>19.</td><td>Adam: two people from um</td></tr><tr><td>20.</td><td>Rachel: from another land</td></tr><tr><td>21.</td><td>Adam: from from</td></tr><tr><td>22.</td><td>France</td></tr><tr><td>23.</td><td>and they wanted to trade their goods</td></tr></table></body></html>

The group changed ‘‘two dudes’’ (Line 5) to ‘‘two people from another land’’ (Lines 19–20), a revision that Rachel apparently felt was necessary for a presentation to the teacher and the class. This change resulted both in the avoidance of a term often stigmatized in academic settings and a more elaborated description.

In sum, I use the term language of ideas to refer to the language students used while proposing and discussing answers to their questions. I call the language of display the language students used while explicitly attending to the form their final answers would take for an outside audience.16 Challenging the dichotomy between ‘‘conversational’’ and ‘‘academic’’ language, I argue that both the language of ideas and the language of display were central aspects of the academic task at hand, representing two different academic uses of language.17 In addition to meeting the perceived audience expectations, attending to the language of display sometimes led students to be more precise, accurate, and comprehensive in their answer. But an obsessive focus on constructing a quick answer for display to an outside audience also sometimes hijacked the purposes of discussion questions, and it was while using the language of ideas, replete with features of ‘‘conversational’’ language, that students often seemed to be the most engaged with the core academic content and concepts of the unit.

# 6. Conclusion

I have described some aspects of the English used by students in classrooms designed to provide long-term language minority students with greater access to core school curriculum and more opportunities for language development than often afforded by either regular mainstream classes or separate ‘‘sheltered’’ classrooms. Students engaged in multiple kinds of transactions in order to complete their academic work, and they demonstrated their awareness that different audiences and purposes call for different sorts of language, even within academic settings. While not diminishing the importance of ongoing efforts to continue to understand what is uniquely different about language used in academic settings compared with language used elsewhere, this research complicates overly simplistic dichotomies contrasting ‘‘academic’’ and ‘‘conversational’’ language. A broader notion of ‘‘academic English’’ is necessary to understand the language demands of contemporary classrooms and how language minority students might best be prepared for and included in them.

This study suggests that, under the right instructional conditions, students described as being fluent in ‘‘conversational English’’ yet lacking in ‘‘academic English’’ can participate successfully in challenging academic work in English. While I did not focus on the performance of individual students, it is notable that the heterogeneous groups in these classrooms, in a setting where both language minority students and monolingual English speakers had the reputation for lacking ‘‘academic English,’’ were collectively able to manage the linguistically and academically challenging tasks embedded in the curriculum.

This does not imply that language minority students should be placed in mainstream classrooms immediately or even after one year of English instruction as mandated by recent ballot initiatives in the US (Guerrero, 2004). The curriculum, groupwork, and status treatments of these CI classrooms were not typical of the mainstream content classrooms available for most students. Furthermore, none of the students placed in the mainstream classrooms at Gerona were recent arrivals to the US; all had been designated at least ‘‘transitional’’ LEP by their school. As MacSwan and Rolstad (2003) point out, it is true that some language minority students may not yet be able to understand instruction and perform all tasks in grade-level classrooms using English alone, but this is because they have yet to develop the English language proficiency necessary to do so, not because they speak the wrong kind of English.

Focusing on the wide range of uses of English in classrooms can also highlight the interactional demands inherent in academic work, often downplayed by the ‘‘academic’’ vs. ‘‘conversational’’ distinction. Students who have had little access to opportunities outside of the classroom to use English in interactive settings, either in countries where English is not the societal language or in immigrant enclaves in English-dominant countries, may find these conversational aspects of classroom language more challenging than the presentational demands.

Given the wide range of ways in which language is used in academic settings, there are limits to what can be taught explicitly in separate language classrooms. Explicit focus on language is undoubtedly helpful, but as Gutierrez (1995) argues, ‘‘an abstract study of language’’ is no substitution for ‘‘actual use of and participation in’’ a community of academic discourse (p. 34). Meanwhile, in secondary settings where content instruction is available only in English, students do not have the luxury of ‘‘waiting’’ until their ‘‘academic English’’ meets an abstract standard before they engage in grade-level curriculum.

In order to promote both language learning and access to subject area content, therefore, continuing efforts are needed to envision classrooms in which students can be included in, rather than excluded from, opportunities to participate in as wide a range of English for academic purposes as possible. The CI classrooms described in this article, by increasing the linguistic and academic demands of instruction while providing support to language minority students, represent one attempt to provide such inclusion. Different approaches will be appropriate in different settings. What is essential is to envision and work toward providing more equitable access to the academic ‘‘goods’’ that schools are responsible for providing, and to continue to challenge ourselves to re-examine the role that conceptions of ‘‘academic English’’ play in that process.
