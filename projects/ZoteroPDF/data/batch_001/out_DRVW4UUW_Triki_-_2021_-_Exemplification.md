Examples are forms of code glosses similar to reformulations that help readers understand writers' intended meanings (Hyland, 2007) and contribute to the process of argumentation in texts (Triki, 2017). This paper investigates examples in research articles across the so-called soft and hard disciplines and aims to structurally and semantically explore the link between the building units of examples and how they could constrain the choices made across disciplines. To reach this end, the study investigates examples in a corpus of 80 research articles that cover four disciplines in the 'soft' sciences and four disciplines in the 'hard' sciences. Annotation was based on an automatic search of potential candidates then a manual annotation was performed using the UAM Corpus Tool (O'Donnell, 2008). Results suggest that (1) the structural features of exemplified units impose constraints on the choice of markers and exemplifying units (2) exemplifying clauses are more elaborative than exemplifying nominal groups and (3) the equivalence between the units exemplified and those exemplifying seems to be governed by the degree to which exemplifying units are expanding or compacting. The main conclusion is that the soft-hard distinction between academic disciplines is not always the major parameter triggering writers' choices.

# 1. Introduction

Exemplification is a discourse function equall useful i oral and written forms of language, in academic and non-academic settings and acros all languages. Its basic role is to facilitate comprehension of terms, concepts and statements or to support claims and ar guments. Together with other similar forms of text elaboration strategies like definitions and rewordings, exemplification plays a fundamental role in communicating speakers and writers' intended meanings. It, therefore, guarantee information transfer and interaction exchange as it facilitates the cognitive processing of utterances and claims (Sperber & Wilson, 1986; Blakemore, 1997)

Exemplification merits close investigation for several reasons. Siepmann (2005: 112) points to three significant ones. The first is that exemplification is complex discourse operation that has its place in almost any argued text. The second reason relates to its high frequency in academic texts. The third one is related to the serious dificulties it poses for L1 and L2 learners. Siepmann's study concludes that despite the expectation that writers at an advanced stag f language learning [.. experience no difficulty in forming and using exemplifiers, the evidence, however, clearly suggests otherwise (Siemann, 2005, p. 257). These three featres are indeed marking aspects of the research article genre in scientific and academic writing, where publishing conventions relate more to English as a Lingua Franca rather than English as a first or second language.

Exemplification has been studied in traditional grammar where it functions as asyntactic and semantic form of pposition (Quirk et al., 1985; Rodriguez-Abruneiras, 2015), in functional grammar where it serves elaboration and cohesion relations (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014) and in several types of hybrid discourse reated fied like metadiscourse studies where examples gain, in addition to their cohesive textual function, some interpersonal and pragmatic values (e.g. Hyland, 2005 and, 2007; Dafouz-Milne, 2008; Barotto, 2018). A more gneral view of exemplification within metadscourse studies indicates that very ittl is said about the specific use of exemplifcation in academic writing. It is ften considered a sub-function or a secondary and minor category within broader rhetorical functions and receives littleattention and space in the analysis and interpretation phases. Previous studies were more centered around the glosing nature of examples, their metadiscursive similarity with reformulations and their elaborative textual function (mainly Hyland, 2007), resulting, as such, i alimited understanding of the syntactic and functional drives behind the choices made at the level of the markers on the one hand, and the segments used to exemplify, on the other hand. These choices, obviously, would make sense only when they are scrutinized within their immediate linguistic co-text as well as their broader registerial or disciplinary context.

The discourse contexts are the research disciplines investigated in this reearch. Following Lenoir (1997), research disciplines are to be understood as the intitutional mechanisms for regulating the market relations between consumers and producers of knowledge" Lenoir (1997: 47). The market metaphor that Lenoir uses implies that knowledge production is mediated by academic brokers (like university staff journal and conference editors and reviewers and the more abstract discourse-oriented norms imposed by the aca demic text genres (such as lectures,conference presentations, research articles, PhD dissertations, book reviews et.). Very often, academic disciplines are grouped under umbrela terms like hard and soft (Nesi & Gardner, 2006; Hyland, 2015; Jiang & Hyland, 2017; Casal et al., 2021) or, sometimes located across a continum (Wu et al., 2020) where isciplines are "spread along a cline, with the hard knowledge' sciences and 'sofer humanities at opposite ends (Hyland, 2008, p. 549). Studying lexical, grammatical and pragmatic properties within and acrosstose disciplines could be fruitful to understand how these features are realized within academic texts and how the epistemological and methodological frames may construe authors' choices.

Given the value of exemplification in pedagogical and academic contexts, this paper aims to shed light on the use of this discourse function in a corpus of research articles belonging to eight different disciplines in the so-called soft and hard groups. The broad objectives of the study are to (1) describe the structural, semantic and metadiscursive properties of examples, with special focus on the nature of the units exemplified, the use of exemplifying marker, and the units used as exemplifying (2), explain the reasons behind opting for specific exemplification markers and exemplifying units, and (3) examine the extent to which the soft versus hard. variables could mark the use of examples. While trying to reach these objectives, some theoretical and methodological considerations need to be revisited and discussed. More specifically, the study will try to answer the following related questions:

. How do examples elaborate on specific text spans and how can they guide readers' understanding? . What favors the choice of markers and the choice of exemplifying units? . Do writers in different soft and hard disciplines exemplify in the same way?

The remainder of the paper is structured in two main parts. The irst provides the theoretical background for the study, namel. some initial reflections, the grammatical classfication and the metadiscursive properties of example. The second part is the empiric: one. It outlines the methods used to analyze the corpus, gives main results and discussion and ends with a conclusion.

# 2. Initial reflections on exemplification

Exemplification is an overarching feature of human interaction and a necessary rhetorical tool for clarity and persuasion. In teaching and leaning contexts, "exemplification is commonly used by science instructors for variet of pedagogical ends, including developing and clarifying important concepts, explaning natural phenomena, giving supportive details to general and abstract ideas, engaging learners, and persuading students' (Oliveira & Brown, 2016, p. 737). Examples are not necessarily expressed through linguistic means for example dropping anobject on the ground could ilustrate the meaning of the verb fl in English), but i they are. this could involve isting words that belong to the same classas the exemplifie item (example1), or llustrating situations in which a specific clam or statement i arguably real or possible (example 2). Exemplification typically requires the presence of three discourse units. The firstis the exmplified unit highlighte in itlics, the second is the exmplification marker (marked in bold) and th third is the exemplifying unit (underlined). Discourse units are discourse segments like those proposed by Mann and Thompson (1987) in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Thus, the term unit, here, refers to a logical unit of meaning rather than a linguistic form.

1. (fabricated example) Felines are animals like cats, jaguars, leopards, and pumas.   
2. (fabricated example) Felines could be dangerous. For example, they can scratch your skin and cause rabies

In the irst example, the speaker/writer uses some of the members of the set feline' which includes shared and concrete examples already familiar to the interlocutors. The example is used as an explanation for a superordinate clas (feline) the meaning of which could be les acessible to readers. The main point of inroducing the example is to elucidate the meaning of the noun felne and make the text more transparent. Instead of providing a whole definition for the term feline, one or more members of the set are given as illustration. The example's elaborative function i semanticlly restricted to the nominal groups and does not cover the whole clause. In example (2), owever, the exemplifying unit servesas asupport for clam made in a previous clause. ts objective is to give readers a possible or hypothetical situation that proves the truthfulnessof the clam made. Its range, therefore, covers the whole idea made in the clause. The writer could strengthen their evidence by providing more llustrative examples. Yet, as Blakemore (1997:13-14) notes such a link between the exemplified and exemplifying unit s understood as "evidence" and can only be inferential, and the process is made possible thanks to relations of relevance". Processig and understanding the example as a piece f evidence to a prio egment is inferential or implicit. The exemplifying unit itself could be explicitly marked via a discourse label or other connectors. If the proposition is true, there exists at least one corresponding example that could ilustrat it and there could be one counter-example that could refute it. Succession to its effects implicates acceptance of hypotheses and creation of new knowledge and or facts.

# 3. Syntactic classification of exemplification

Exemplification in grammar i almost always considered as a form of aposition, which for Quirk et al. (1985: 1308) falls under those types of least appositives that have n inclusive rather than equating (like definitions and reformulations) or atributig (namely, non-restrictive relative clauses) nature. Although exemplification does not necessrily require an explicit indicator, using one is \*the norm' to guarantee unambiguous meaning of exemplification (ibid: 1316). Meyer (1992: 5) extends this appositional nature of examples and argues that al units in apposition have syntactic, semantic and pragmatic characteristics. He also streses that examples in appositions "are joined by the obligatory markers of apposition such as, like, or for example" (ibid: 77) [bold added]. Apposition relations as syntactic categories are restricted to the intra-sentential scope, which means that they only enable the identification of examples within the sentence and not acrossentences. The exemplification function, however, can bring sentences and even longer stretches of texts together. Similaly, apposition does not it in the case where the exemplification relation holds between the subject and the predicate in asentence. It makes more sense, therefore, toconsider it as a logico-sematic elaborative function as in functional grammar theory.

From a Systemic Functional Grammar perspective (SFG), exemplification is considered as a form of elaboration where "one clause elaborates on the meaning of another by further specifying or describing it (Halliday & Matthessen, 2014, p. 461). Elaboration is a logico-semantic relation, a form of expansion where meaning is exemplified, restated or defined. Different forms of elaboration, including exemplification, could be realized at various grammatical ranks. Rank in SFG "refers to the diffrent sizes' of the gram matical units (layers of constituency) (Mathiesen & Halliday, 2009, p. 12). Meanings and experiences could be construed within the lower ranks, i.e, the group (eg, nominal group, verbal group) or phrase (prepositional phrases) rank. Being forms of contracted clauses (Hlliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 362-367), exemplifying prepositional phrases would enact situations rather than entitie. Above the group, logico-semantic relations could be located at the simple clause rank (simple sentence in traditional grammar) where examples will be the tie between the participant in the subject position and the one in the predicate. At the clause complex rank (compound or complex sentence in traditional grammar), exemplification brings together clauses in paratactic combinations. Finally, beyond clausal boundaries between sentences) meaning tretches over longer linguistic chunks where entences blend cohesively to form a text. These different types of exemplification will now be illustrated.

At the group level, spcificall, the nominal group, exmplification is sen as aform of Apposition Halliday & Marti, 1993, p. 255; Halliday & Mathiese, 2014, p. 560). It elaborates on the head noun and/or any of is pre and post modifier. Its scope is, therefore, restricted to the boundaries of the group as in example (3).

3. A few materials, such as germanium and silicon ...(example from Halliday & Martin, 1993, p. 254)

At the simple clause level, exemplification is the meaning that bonds the subject and the predicate in the whole structure. Very ofen, i is construed within reational clauses that include equative processes, mainly copular verbs, of being rather than doing, saying or thinking as in (4). The segment in the subject (the Token) and the one in the complement (the Value) are more or lessequivalent to one another (Harvey, 2001).

4. [Token] Frogs, toads, and salamanders [Process] are [Value] some amphibians we know today (Exampl from Halliday & Mat thiessen, 2014, p. 285).

Exemplification in (4) has an implicit nature because there is no clear and explicit signal for the discourse function intended. Although the quantifier some may help in identifying the link, the meaning of exemplification is understood as the relation holding the nominal group in the subject position to the one in the complement. The following counterparts (5 and 6) have very similar structures, except that the meaning of exemplification becomes more salient thanks to the use of the more explicit markers example of in (5) and exemplify in (6).

5. Examples of amphibians are frogs, toads and salamanders (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 290).   
6. Amphibians are exemplified by frogs, toads and salamanders. (ibid)

At the clause complex level (example 7), exemplification is construed as a paratactic clause serving elaboration purposes of the type Apposition. It i found within the secondary clause which \*develops the theis of the primary clause by becoming more pecific about it, often citing an actual example' (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 463).

7. Someone comes along with a great idea for an expedition - for example, I did a book called Sand Rivers, just before the Indian books, and it was a safari into a very remote part of Africa (Example from Halliday & Mathiessen, 2014, p. 463).

At the text level, and beyond clausal boundaries, exemplification is located within the system of cohesion as a form of Apposition together with expository forms (paraphrasing and restating element) (Halliday & Matthessen, 2014,p. 612). Exemplifying chunks provide "resources for marking logico-semantic relationships that obtain between text spans of varying extent, ranging from clauses within clause complexes to long spans of a paragraph or more' (ibid: 609).

Exemplification is thus considered to have one of those enabling functions of language (a textual function). Yet, it also serves clarification and expansion ends, that is, an interpersonal function (VandeKopple, 1985; Dafouz-Milne, 2008; Hyland & Tse, 2004; Hyland, 2005). The appositie nature of examples and their similarit with other forms of appositives, like restatements, might be one of the reasons why they tend to be regarded as serving the non-propositional function of discourse in some metadiscourse models

# 4. Exemplification as a metadiscourse function

Metadiscourse studies, specifically the ones adopting the broad model, have often prioritized macro level analysis of texts and corpora by looking at and comparing broad notions like interactive/interactional features and the sub-categories they include (e.g., Vande Kopple, 1985; Mauranen, 1993; Hyland & Tse, 2004; Hyland, 2005; Hyland, 2017). This observation finds roots in Hyland's (2017) study where results prove that the general tendencies and practices in metadiscourse studies are more focused on those broad notions. He states that \*academic genres in English, particularly reearch artices and astracts, are the primary areas of interest with attention given to interactional elements of the interpersonal model with stance, evaluation, engagement and persuasion prominent" (Hyland, 2017 p. 27). Research embracing a narrower understanding of metadiscourse, on the other hand, seems to provide a much deeper analysis of the studied phenomena (Adel & Mauranen, 2010, p. 3). By focusing on smaller metadiscourse units (for example (Adel's 2017 and 2018) study of personal pronouns), it becomes possible to scrutinize not only the quantitative findings, but, most importantly, to relate and explain form to function relations within authentic extracts and examples.

In earlier models of metadiscourse (Crismore & Farnsworth, 1990; Vande Kopple, 1985), various forms of code gloses including exemplification, are believed to serve the textual function of language. They are more related to the way discourse is organized in a text and how its different units can be cohesively interconnected. This ideis based on a Hallidayan view of language as serving three basic metafunctions, namely: ideational, interpersonal and textual. Thus, the earlier models clasify metadiscursive elements, which are distinguished from the propositional elements of texts, as serving either textual or interpersonal functions, but not the ideational one. Even in some more restrictive views of metadiscourse, the idea that the ideational metafunction is propositional while the interpersonal and textual ones are non-propositional sometimes exists. For example, Mauranen (2010: 14) who adopts a definition of metadiscourse s form of discourse eflexivity does not argue much about understanding metadiscourse as the non-propositional ide of language. She recognizes this as a fact, stipulating that \*the all-encompassing notion of metadiscourse i thenon-idational text matter'. This clasification is a bit problematic because it presupposes that ideational' equals propositional'. Halliday's ideational metafunction in clauses and texts, however, sems to include many of the expressions considered non-propositional in metadiscourse. In addition, the speech functions of clauses in SFG include not only propositions (enacted as statements and questions) but also proposals' (offers and commands). For these reasons, the propositional versus non-propositional dichotomy cannot be adequate in defining what examples are.

Exemplification is form of code glosing similar o paraphrasing in that it also helps readers grasp the writer's intended reasoning (Hyland, 2007). The elaborative aspect of examples puts them in a close relation to other discourse functions of elaboration, namely paraphrasing and defining \*that are triggered by writers' awarenes of readers' requirements for more specification, elaboration or simply for some oncrete and tangible llustrations (Triki 2019, p. 105). Although the three discourse functions (defining, rewording and exemplifying) seem to semanticlly and rhetoricall serve one ultimate goal elaboration), they have distinct lexico-grammatical realizations. Exemplification is \*rarely personalized' in English academic texts (Adel, 2006, p. 69), in the sense that it is rarely introduced via first person pronouns or reference to the author a i other forms of glossing and elaboration. Onthe other hand writers may use stctes like I define x asy, we rer to x as yt. in order to define aer or oncet, and i is possile to use eroal orms such as \*what I mean by x isy, or \*we mean in rewordings or paraphrases, As a form of discourse reflexivity where language i used to refer to and reflect language itself, exemplification is a kind of discourse reflexivity with a high degee f explicitness It is almost always explicitly introduced via easily distinguishable discourse labels like to ilustrate, an example of etc. (Mauranen, 1993).

Such an understanding of reflexivity, arguably, narrows down the meaning of reflex' and shrinks i to the marker. Adel argues that "a connector such as for example would count as a discourse label' on the basis that it explicitly signals the discourse act of exem plifying' Conversely, a connector such as therefore would not be considered metadiscursive simply by virtue of it connector status. n fact, th  m it ufficy  the f  witer, nr the , d thre it does not qualify as metadiscourse" (Adel, 2006, p. 23). This would necessarily mean that examples introduced by for example are considered metadiscursive whil others introduced by such as like, or as are not. The way metadiscourse is undersood in this study is much broader. Allforms of elaboration are metadiscoursal as they reresent language functions that echo, in one way or another, and with various degrees of explicitness,some precedent or susequent units of meaning. Consequently, reasoning and argumentation are pushed forward, from dark, obscure, and unclear instantiation to more eloquent, transparent and convincing forms of meaning.

More specifically, exemplification in academic writing, according to Hyland (2007: 279-280), works in three main ways:

1) by offering an instance of a general category   
2) by providing a parallel or similar case   
3) by giving a precept or a rule

A closer look at the examples Hyland give to llustrate on these meanings or uses of exemplification reveals a major problem of overlap that exists between cases 2 and 3:

Case 2: A tradition may be reflective and designed, like the deliberations of the Supreme Court, or unreflective and spontaneous, like sports fans rooting for their teams ... (Philosophy).

Case 3: In the experience of any change we may identify a particularly salient point, such as the moment  long-istance runner croses the finishing line. (Philosophy).

It is almost impossible to see the difference between the two illustrative examples. Thus, the example in case 2 could also be regarded as precept, and vice versa, the one in case 3 could e considered a possible case Differentiating similar cases becomes even harder in a large corpus ike Hyland's, and this perhaps explains the reason why he does not provide any exact frequencies for their occurrence and distribution within his corpus and across the disciplines.

Another controversial isue in metadiscourse studies is the boundarie of examples. Whereas some would suggest that the marker of exemplification is the one fulflling the metadiscourse function, I would argue that the exemplifying chunk should be included too. Hyland (2017: 17), for example, acknowledges that there is stil disagreement and divergent views "on where we should draw the boundary of metadiscourse or what rhetorical categorie it includes". Presumably, some metadiscourse functions could be captured by the signal itsef in which cae the marker is at the same time the carrier of the metaiscourse meaning. This could be true for categories like hedges or transtion marker. et for code gloses, it does not make much sense say that the signals mean, such as or in other words are the carriers of the meaning. The reformulation, definition or exemplification segments are rather situated before or afer these markers. Otherwise, there would be no ned to talk about two separate notions, one for the discourse function and another for its marker. Evidence for this could be found in several studies that investigate code glosses. For example, while exemplifying what is meant by code gloses in Vande Kopple's framework, Adel (2006: 169) italicizes both the marker and the gloss in the example He called these questions antinomies that is contradictions'. Another context is Hyland (2007) where the examples he gives include both the marker and the chunk carrying the reformulation or the example. This goes in line with the view of metadiscourse as a form of discoure elexivit in that the exmplfying units reflect the pe f lagage already intoduced in the exmplifid chunk and re, as such, governed by the logico-semantic featres introduced therein. This brief discussion confirms the necessty to study the three units of exemplification (exemplified units, exemplification markers and exemplifying units) and not exclude any of them.

# 5. Corpus and methods

The study investigates the use of examples in acorpus f 80 research articles of about 770 o00 words (Table 1). They were randomly compiled from electronic journals published online. The corpus covers 10 articles from four disciplines in the soft sciences, namely, Linguistics (LING), History (HIS), Marketing (MKT) and Economics (ECO), and four disciplines in the hard sciences: Computer Science (CS), Electrical Engineering (EE), Physics (PHY) and Materials cience (MS).All artice are written in English \*as lingua franca in international contexts such a sientific publishing (Oeil, 2018, p. 161) and the native versus non-native distinction is not applied in this paper.

The choice of the journals was primarily based on suggestions from specialists in the different fields on the basis that they are peerreviewed journals with high impact factors and good citation scores. Those specialists also served as informants to help with reading challenging parts of the corpus, specifically the sections involving complex technical terms, numerical data and mathematical equations, when these were vital for coding decisions. The articles were randomly selected based on their length (average text length $= 9 6 2 0$ words/article) from open aes numbers. Opting for texts with the same aroximate word count was necessary to guarantee a similar number of texts belonging to each discipline. This was also crucial because annotation relied on an automatic search for potential candidates (Table 2 includes a ist of 27 search items compiled from the literature) before a manual analysis of exemplifcation segments was performed using the UAM Corpus Tool software (O Donnell 2008). Obviously, the collcted corpus cannot fuly capture all the research and writing practices in all the sub-branches of these eight disciplines. Yet, this is a common practice in corpus-based studies where the linguisic feature exemplification in this study) tobe observed and investigated is a frequent one. For example, Hyland and Tse (2009) also analyze a sample of 10 texts i each of their four discipline, and Biber (1995: 131) maintains that with as few as 10 texts belonging to aspecific register it is possble to represent almost the totality of elements marking that register.

Once the corpus was compiled, all potential exemplification candidates were automatically extracted based on the items in the search list. The search list is probably not exhaustive but it definitely includes the most common and most frequent signals used in exemplification. Examples were not identified where no explicit marker was used, like in intensive identifying clauses explained in example (4), or where punctuation forms were used (such as brackets and colons). Manual checking then followed to eliminate any occurrence that did not indicate exemplification. For example, the search word namely was sometimes found to mean specify rather than exemplify (example 8), in which case the segment was eliminated.

8. Thankfull, an off-the-shelf implementation provided by Struc & Pavesic [49[50], namely INface Toolbox, grants us the opportunity to achieve our target efficiently and accurately. (Electrical Engineering)

All exemplifying instances were extracted with sufficient co-text to allow a better link between the different constituents and then they were exported to the UAM Corpus Tool for annotation. They were, then, segmented into the three building units introduced in section 2. Example (9)illustrate these units where (1) the exemplified unit is highlighte in italic, (2) the exemplification markers in bold and (3) the exemplifying units being underlined. These highlighting features apply to al examples used in the paper.

9. In particular, the younger Marxist New eft figres were sketicl of sociology, rardin it vision f socity s to sttic. tr orsley, for example, strongly criticised the facile optimism' of both Mass-Observation and the ICs. (History)

Exemplified and exemplifying units were then further analyzed in terms of their grammatica structure as being nominal groups (including nominalized forms) or clauses (single, sequences, paragraphs, sections). A second level of analysis argeted all exemplifying units, being, as it were, the carriers f the intended examples, in order to understand the essence of the illustration they provide (abstract versus concrete entities citation elements, real versus hypothetical situations, extracts and passages from other sources, mathematical equations and non-verbal elements in the form of table and figures). Such a classfication also help in identifying those types of examples that offer rather compact and opaque units (namely, figures, tables, mathematical equations, and reference to external published material) and those that are more straightforward and clearer (like abstract and concrete entities, and real and hypothetical situations).

# 6. Results and discussion

# 6.1. Exemplification across the soft and hard disciplines

Corpus annotation yielded a total number of 3012 instances of exemplification (Table 3), with an average of 37.65 instances per text. This hig frequency, indee, reflects the value of using examples in academic writing for a varity of rasons. As a metadiscursive tool, exemplification is found to be more frequent than other forms of code glossing like reformulation (Hyland, 2007, p. 271). When the soft/hard distinction is considered, results show that examples are $1 4 \%$ more frequent in the soft sciences with $5 7 \%$ of all occurrences versus $4 3 \%$ in the hard ones. This is a general tendency that seems to be confirmed by other studies (e.g., Hyland, 2007; Triki, 2014 and 2017) lthough the built-in tisical ool in the software used proves that this varition i not satisticaly signficant.

Table 3 Exemplification across the 'soft'/hard' continuum.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>EXEMPLIFICATION</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SOFT</td><td>1722</td><td>57%</td></tr><tr><td>HARD</td><td>1290</td><td>43%</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>3012</td><td>100%</td></tr></table></body></html>

These general results, however, do not reflect the divergences found within the various disciplines of the humanities and social sciences on the one hand and those of the hard ciences on the other hand. As Fig. 1illustrates, one of the oft disciplines, Marketing, ranks irt with more than a quarter of all the example found in the corpus, whil History, another soft discipline, ranks last with less than $7 \%$ of the total number of examples. Between these two extremities, other hard and soft disciplines use examples with differing degrees f frequency. For example, Materials Science uses far more examples than Economics. This suggests that disciplines cannot simply be categorized as 'soft' and hard'.

Disciplines and sub-disciplines of the same science reveal different practices and writers may opt for totally different strategies to explain and elaborate their wordings and claims. Such choices could be constrained either by disciplinary and genre practices, contextual exigencies or personal idiosyncrasies. As will be argued in section 6.3, the variation could also be linked to lexicogrammatical constraints. Hyland (2007: 284) argues that \*the sciences and engineering on one side and social sciences and humanities on the other draw on different linguistc resources in the creation of specialised knowledge'. Yet, it is with caution that such a generalization should be taken. Disciplines and sub-disciplines within the same scientific field are not always homogeneous. Major diffrence could be spotted in the lexico-grammatical and rhetorical structures they use, and in the functions these same structures are meant to serve.

The following ar illustrative examples (10 and 11) from the two dicipline lying atthe two extremitie. Mor llustrative examples and discussion of the specific exemplification instance will be given in the next sections.

10. The assimltion sub-modl depicts the co-cretion proposition f S-D logic with relizd lue eing  function f both the vendor's and the buyer's efort. For instance, implementation deficits and failure to attain the offering's full value potential could be due to internal buyer-attributed factors such as sub-optimal resource allocation [...]. (Marketing)   
11. In particular, a number of intellctuals, including Michael Young, were profoundly influenced by the solidaristic ethic' of wartime society. Stephen Brooke pinpoints the young academics and Labour MPs associated with the New Fabian Research Bureau in the 1930s, including Hugh Gaitskll, Evan Durbin, Douglas Jay, Barbara Wootton and James Meade [..]. (History)

In marketing, claims and arguments tend to be rather complex. As ilustrated by Skipper and Hyman (1987: 61-64), research articles in the marketing field fllow strict and rigid norms of demonstrations based on the principles of logic. Examples in marketing academic publications \*constitute much of the article" (ibid: 68) where they \*easily could be taken as attempts to prove a general clam. Examples can be used to clarify a meaning, to prove existence claims, to disprove a general claim, or to disprove any claim of the form f A then B" [italic in original. Yet, a deer analysis of the type of examples used within the Marketing sub-corpus (section6.4) will exhbit divergent practices in the texts analyzed. Most importantly, the high frequency of examples in the Marketing discipline does not necessarily reflecta complexity in elaboration or in argumentation but rather an unusull extensive use of lengthy sequences of references as exemplars. Historians, on the other hand, make connections between events, participants, dates and places in order to construct narratives about the past. While doing so, they position themselves and their tories in line with or in contrast to other narratives (Nokes & De La Paz, 2018, p. 558). This could explain the fact that most of the examples they cite either rfer to other authors, famous and influential people (example 11) or events and happenings in specific historical periods.

# 6.2. Exemplified units

In order to beter understand the reasons why academic writers use examples it i necessary to look at the unit f discourse that are being exemplified. As exemplification establishes a link between aterm, concept or statement and another segment that serves as the form of elaboration, exempliied units could be structurally construed in different forms. Analysis has shown (Fig 2) that they come in mainly two forms, either as nominal groups $( 5 4 . 7 1 \% )$ that generally refer to entities or as clauses. $( 4 5 . 2 9 \% )$ that represent statements. The choice of form varies across disciplines, however. Computer Science and Physics exemplify using clauses more than nominal groups, with percentages of $7 4 \%$ and $5 7 \%$ respectively. In the History texts exemplification using clauses occurs in less than $2 4 \%$ of cases. These findings willbe further discussed in section 6.4, where the structure of exemplified unit is shown to constrain the structural realization of exemplifying chunks.

12. LMOF-based chemosensors usually show solvatochromism or vaporchromism, [..] and hence provide a more direct and convenient method for sensing certain chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds, gases, ionic species or explosives. (Materials Science)   
13. We can divide the seller's offring attributes (operand resources) into two categories core operand resources, which fulfll basic customer expectations about a product (e.g., compliance with functional and technical requirements), and augmented operand resources, which help the seller to exceed customer expectations (e.g., installation, training, and support service). (Marketing)

The exemplified unit represents the triger for the entire act of exemplification. This unit, sometimes also referred to as the anchor (Meyer, 1992), i thought of as being \*syntactically more important than the appositive" (Rodriguez-Abruneiras, 2015: 34). In other words, the preence of the markersuch as in (12) and e.g in (13), together with the segments (underlined) directly fllowing them, are entirely motivated by the us of the italicized nominal groups. As the ultimate purpose of introducing an example isto elaborate on a prior text span, this implie that this text span is marked by a kind of ambiguity or lacks clarit. As such, the example is introduced to illustrat and guarantee precision and lucidit. When thosetext spans come in the form of nominal groups, the source of the ambiguity can be spotted within one or several constituents of the group. For example, in (12), the use of the adjective certain seems tobe the trigger. Such an adjective is similar to many types of emphasizers, limiters and quantifiers used in nominal groups like some, many, particular, specific, et. which all crry meanings of imprecision and vaguenes. The author, therefore, gives a number of examples to guide the reader to what they specifically mean.

14. In SFL, each genre is considered to ollow certain stages (Eggins, 2004). For example, a case study analysis has certain stages such as Orientation and Recommendation. (Linguistics)

15. In other terms, what we could prove i that quantum measurements are interpretable as universal measurements having a Hilbertian structure [...]. Just to give some simple examples, consider the two-dimensional $( \mathrm { N } = 2 )$ case, and the density operator $\underline { { \mathrm { D } } } = 1 \mathrm { I } ,$ where I is the identity operator. (Physics)

The need for elaboration in the case of clauses, however, is not solely motivated by one or two constituents within the clause but rather by the overall meaning generated by it. Accordingly, it is expected that the example (inroduced in the exemplifying unit) would cover not one or some parts of the meaning but rather ll the ideational load expressed in the exemplified unit. In example (14), the reader's expectation is constrained by at least three main ideas. The firt and perhaps, most important one, s that genres fllow stages, the second is that these stage are known, specific or limited, and third is that this whole dei found in the literature of SFL. The same argument aplies to example (15) where the exemplified unit includes a hypothesis in the form of a fact clause that quantum measurements . to be proved in th illustrative exemplifying examples. The exemplifying unit, acordingly, comes in line with these emergent ideas and illustrates how these various meanings are true or potentilly true and verifiable. The link between exemplified and exemplifying units is generall ased on hyponemic relations whereby lexical items refer to the same semantic repertoire. Lexical relations, apart from the fact that they guarantee cohesion in texts (Halliday & Hasan, 1976), also establish asymmetric equivalence links between the two units of the example. These exemplifying units draw from sources of shared or common knowledge; otherwise, the whole gist of elaboration and argumentation would be missed.

# 6.3. Discourse markers of exemplification

The different disciplines used a variety of exemplification markers elsewhere named discourse labels. Table 4 ilustrates the most frequent markers found in the corpus and their frequency and distribution cross disciplines. Overall thre markers (eg, such as and for example) account for more than $6 4 \%$ of all instances of exemplification in the whole corpus, a result that confirms Hyland's (2007) findings which indicate that three quarters of the examples studied in his corpus were introduced by these markers. Yet, some dif ferences concerning the frequencies of these markers are recorded in the present study. Although according to Rodriguez-Abruneiras (2015: 131) the use of e.g is not advisable in most text-types, and even in formal and scholarly texts", it ranks first with more than $2 6 \%$ , followed by such us $( 2 2 . 1 1 \% )$ and for example $( 1 5 . 2 1 \% )$ . Other less frequent markers are the nominal expression example(s) of, inude, is o inte nd lik ete ts sirt wth schs, thi, its aito inexml inth fof nmial groups, the marker like is more than five time esfrequent than such as in the corpus. This could be explained by stlstic preferences in written academic genres where like is avoided because of \*the general stigma' associating it to conversational genres and informal contexts (Meyer, 1992, p. 108).

In consistency with the previously recorded divergences, it seems that the use of these markers is also constrained by disciplinary practices or prefereces. Fr example, a ook at the use ofg acros discilines shows th i is mainy usd in the sot fieds. Chi quare test points to a variation of high significance between the soft and hard sciences. Yet, while e.g. accounts for more than $5 0 \%$ of all examples in Markting, it was not used at all in Hisory (which prefers the marker such as). This again raises questions about the validit of packing social sciences together within a, presumably, homogeneous group. The hard sciences are also marked with greater variation. The top-ranking marker in lctrical Eginering and Matrials Sciece is such as, while in Physics i is the nominalized form xample o, and in omutr Scince ranks firt. Inteestingly, Computer Sciece uses  far grter varity of markers, incudigles frequent markers such as say, as in, one such, and the use of headings (see examples 16 and 17).

16. In this section we show a gathering procedure for any configuration containing exactly one multiplicity, say at node v. (Computer Science)   
17. Example 6.1. Consider the configuration ${ \mathsf { C } } = ( { \mathsf { a } } , { \mathsf { a } } + 1$ , a $^ { - 1 }$ , a $+ 1$ , a $^ { - 1 }$ , a $+ 1$ , a) of 7 robots, for some a $^ { > 1 }$ (see Fig. 3). (Computer Science)

While the use of say in example 16 is generally imposed by the mathematical exigencies in computer science papers, where say enables the introduction of a hypothetical example used as a "supposition' or "a hypothesis (Rodriguez-Abruneiras, 2015: 149), the use of the heading in (17) adds an organizational function to this marker of exemplification.

One of the basic functions of these markers is to \*express certain semantic relationships between the appositives" (Quirk et al. 1985, p. 1307) and to create cohesion and coherence in discourse (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). This stands true when the primary goal of the analysisis to study the properties of texture' and coherence in texts. If their rle i restricted to the cohesion function this would mean that they only have textual function. Yet, these exemplifying markers also serve interpersonal ends because of their interactive function in helping readers grasp writers' intended meaning and convincing them about the validity of their claims. In this line of thought, Hyland and Tse (2004: 163) argue that like other features of 'textual metadiscourse', the transitions that conjunctions mark between clauses can be oriented either towards the experiential or the interactional, referring to either propositional or interpersonal meanings'. This argument can be expanded to other non-conjunctive forms that share the same exemplification purposes.

Most markers directl precede the exemplifying unit, constructing, as such, a solid composite segment that carres the meaning of exemplification intended. They have this frequent position because of their cohesive nature as conjunctive devices. Yet, some markers can have flexible positions or behave diffrently depending on the nature f the exemplifying unit (Rodriguez-Abruneiras, 2020: 41) In addition, the nominal marker example of reverses the direction of exemplification resulting in the pattern (Marker $^ +$ Exemplified + Exemplifying) rather than the more common one (Exemplified $^ +$ Marker $^ +$ Exemplifying).

Despite the various altenaties available to writers for the insertion of example, they seem to faor specific choices. These choices could be opted for randomly; however, quantitative results suggest that these choice constitute a pattern governed by practices in the disciplines on the one hand, and by syntactic constraints, on the other hand. Thus, i is unlikely for an exemplified unit in the form of a clause to eexmplified  mrke like uch s, like og. h marker itelf, whch is short for eempli gatia and fe ras as OR EXAMPLE, sems to be no longer interchangeable withit full extended form for example. It is therefore, impossible to encounter a sentence starting with eg, and at the same time it is very rarely posible to use for example in a parenthetical way to introduce exemplifying units in the form of nominal groups (not a single case found in the corpus).

# 6.4. Exemplifying units

Exemplifying units are the carrier of the act of exemplification It i within these units that concepts ae elucidated, and arguments are strengthened. They refer to the structures that directl follow the markers of exemplification and they together constitute the metadiscourse segment. A close look at these units shows that they could be structurally construed as nominal groups or as various types of clauses (Fig. 3). Such a structural distinction is vital to understand the link between the units being exemplified and those exemplifying.

The hard sciences use exemplifying clauses more than the soft ones (Fig. 3). Exemplifying clauses in the Physics (PHY) and Computer Science (CS) sections slightly exceed nominal groups. In contrast, nominal groups are dominantly used within disciplines like History (HIS), Marketing (MKT) and Economics (EcO) where they respectively represent roughly $7 9 \%$ $7 2 \%$ and $6 9 \%$ of all exemplifying units in these sections. What this major distinction indicates is the extent to which examples are used for explanation versus argumentation purposes. It has been previously argued that exemplifying clauses are used mainly to support claims and to strengthen the assumptions made in the exemplified unit, whereas nominal groups serve elucidation ends. With the exceptions of Materials Science and Lingustics, i could be said that soft sciences use examples to explain whereas hard ones use them for argumentation. This proves again that exemplification as a form of elaboration is not solely deployed for interpersonal and textual purposes, but it also boosts and supports argumentation.

Fig. 3. Exemplifying groups versus clauses across disciplines.

# 6.4.1. Exemplifying groups

Exemplifying nominal groups are found to represent several grammatical and semantic categories. They can be very simple, in which case they contain littl or no modification, or very complex with several levels of complexity and modification (Triki, 2014). They can refer to concrete and abstract entities, references to published works or to names of authors and people. Exemplifying nominal groups often represent abstract and concrete entities that help readers in grasping the intended meanings of the exemplified unit (Triki, 2017). For example, in (18), the two units have an abstract non-tangible nature because they both refer to linguistic phenomena. The writer judges that some specification is needed in order to guide readers towards what they mean by linguistic features. In (19), the usef concrete examples to elaborate on the abstract and rather general term entitie is vital for the whole clam. Citing the actual physical names f these ntities gives theargument astronger and morereliable dimension. It bosts the appearance of precision and scientific rigor.

18. A number of corpus based studies have identified lingusic features (e.g., relative clauses, subordination, verb tenses, prepositions, linking adverbials) that are ... (Linguistics)   
19. Then we must accept that entitie like electrons, protons, neutrons, and even more complex atomic stuctures [. pass most of their time in a non-spatial condition. (Physics)

Examples may also come in the form of nominalizations (examples 20 and 21) where processes are turned into nouns, creating, as such, different types of situations rather than entitie. Nominalized expressions allow reasoning to remain within this clause. They are very frequent in scientific academic writing (Halliday & Martin, 1993) because they are more economical than their clausal counterparts and because they have the summarizing value which is much needed in academic publishing. Their compacting aspect is, accordingly, more powerful as they somehow shrink and condense fuller forms of linguistic and cognitive representations. This compacting nature of exemplifying units can also be identified within the seres of references that writrs it to support their claims. Such forms of in text citation (example 22) use different referencing styles across disciplines (authors names $^ +$ (date) in the soft disciplines or simply numbers in quare brackets in some hard disciplines). Their compacting load resides in the way they contract long and elaborate ideas and arguments articulated in entities like articles and boos and reduce them to minimal forms of linguistic and numerical representation.

20. The hidden-measurement explanation is also a very natural one in the modelization of human cognitive processes [..]. A typical example is the checking of the pressure of an automobile tre, which is notoriously difficult to do without letting out some of the air in the process. (Physics)   
21. [..] many of the basic features of the foundational narrativ that had been in place since the early sixteenth century-such as the distinction between secular and spiritual history, the Flacian chronologies of rise and decline, the importance of religion in human history. (History)   
22. The topic has received considerable research attention under various headings: sustainable innovations orientation (e.g., Varadarajan 2015), eco-design practices (e.g., Sarkis et al., 2010), geen product inovation (e.g., Dangelico and Pujari 2010), green product development (e.g., Chen 2001). (Marketing)

It is interesting to note that exemplifying nominal groups impose specific choices of the exemplifying marker to be used. Basicall, they are signaled via such as, e.g and like but very rarely via for example and for instance, the markers that would be preferred for the introduction of exemplifying units in the form of clauses.

# 6.4.2. Exemplifying clauses

Elaborating clauses have more elaborative and expanding power than groups. They are more explicit in meaning and they have the potential tocarry heavy semantic and logical loads. These clauses can be short and simple or long and complex. They give writers more space to illustrate the concepts and claims introduced in the exemplified units (Triki, 2017). They also indicate that the units exemplified are very complex or fuzzy, thus, they need deep and precise elaboration. This, perhaps, explains why they are found more frequently in disciplines like Physic, Computer Scince and Electrical Engineering, disciplines that rely heavily on standardized forms of argumentation that necesstate staged logical procedures for the construction of mathematical reasoning. In such disciplines providing examples goes beyond mere metadiscursive interactional needs. Examples represent building blocks in the construction of mathematical definitions and theorems because \*if we want to understand how science embodies, advances, and conveys under standing, we need to acknowledge and account for the ineliminable role that exemplification plays inscience" (Elgin, 2011, p. 412)

Examples in the form of clauses have the potential to provide readers with wider and more elaborate ideational material compared to what nominal groups could offer. This i the case by virtue of their syntactic characteristics which render meaning construal more transparent (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014, p. 490). Furthermore, exemplifying clauses seem to serve the purposes of argumentatin more than llustration (Rodriguez-Abruneiras, 2020). They generall provide situations and scenarios that would boost a previously introduced claim by offering real contexts where those claims could be more visible, or hypothetical one (examples 23 and 24), where a scenario of authenticity could come to existence.

23. It is possble to consider different types of functions fi for the defintion of wi in equation (3). For instance, if the surface/solid is homogeneous and isotropic, which is the case of the face, we can choose a function fi defined as follows. (Electrical Engineering)

24. Before providing a formal definition of M, we illustrate the construction using a simple example. Assume that A contains the unary rule r q $( - 1 , + 3 )$ q and the binary rule r q q, q. M contains two agents. An inference with r followed by an inference with r2 is simulated using the transitions shown in Fig. 3 [...]. (Computer Science)

The hypothetical nature of these examples can be understood via the way writers frame them. In example (23), the use of con. ditional clauses $i f$ puts a condition for the realization of the exemplified clause (in italics). In (24), such a hypothesis is signaled via the verb assume. In the two cases, the given examples are imaginary scenarios that serve as basis for further proof and argument to be added in subsequent text.

Unlike hypothetical examples, real situations are construed as fact clauses generall used in the present simple tense (example 25) to give them a general and acceptable aspect. Real examples can also have the form of non-verbal elements, often in the shape of illustrative figures and tables as in (26).

25. Existence of the covert channels violates both secrecy and integrity propertie of trusted systems [2]. For example, in a multilevel trusted system, users with higher secret clearance are not allowed to send data to users with lower clearance. (Computer Science)   
26. An example of a configuration with two multiplicities is shown in Fig. 1. (Computer Science)

The exemplifying unit is not the nominal group Fig. 1. It is rather the non-verbal entity (the figure itself) that represents the example. Reading igures even silent/menta reding) ntails the use f dfferent types of clause to understand and relate them to the exemplified unit.

# 7. Conclusion

In this article, I have addressed the discourse function of exemplification in academic reearch articles across ifferent discilines. Findings point to the fact that the choice of exemplification markers is more significantly motivated by the structure of the exem plifying unit rather than by disciplinary practices. Examples have a crucial role in producing an engaging and trustworthy piece of research. Without examples, theories and results remain vague, authors, therefore, use examples to mitigate readers' doubts by anticipating their worries and satisfying their expectations. While trying to prove the validity of a given claim or hypothesis re. searchers often make sure that the example provided ilustrates at least one actual or possiblecase and does not allow for a counterexample, that the example is accessibl to the readers and their discilinary conventions, and that the example is not necessarily the most readily available piece of illustration but the most telling, representative and efficient one.

Other results indicate that despite the high probability of syntactic equivalence (nominal groups being exemplified by nominal groups and clauses by other clauses) the elaborating segment does not have an equal semantic satus to that of the elaborated one. Examples generally represet elements within the larger sets of the exemplified unit. In addition, there em to be various degrees of elaboration and compactness linking the three constituents of examples. On the one hand, abstract and concrete entities as well as exemplifying clauses expand and broaden the meaning of tet spans, rendering them more aesibl to readers (Elgin, 2011, p. 407) and making claims and arguments more persuasive. References, mathematical equations and non-verbal elements, on the other hand compact authors' reasoning and lead to more challenging and les transparent reading experiences. Compacting examples enables authors to condense huge amounts of data and arguments into restricted and minimal forms f representation, often construed in a symbolic and numerical way, necesstating, therefore, much greater initial cognitiveffort on the part of the reader to decompose and understand them, and then to figure out how they relate to the exemplified unit. This also entails that the metadiscursive interactive nature of exemplification varies in its degree of explicitness and form of elaboration.

Finally, some hard sciences used examples more frequently than some soft ones and vice versa, indicating that the soft-hard continuum does not properly fit as a dichotomy nor as a continuum, and that hasty over-generalizations need to be avoided. With research disciplines being more and more hybrid and interdisciplinary, that i, by adopting and integrating research tools and methods applied in other fields or by drawing from the practices in other research cultures (Davies & Devlin, 2010, pp. 12-13), the distinctions between soft and hard disciplines become blurred. The boundaries are fluid and overlapping, sometimes, also, due to national policies encouraging more collaboration in research between distinct research fields and sciences (se for example Holm and Liinason's (2005) report on the soft-hard disciplines and the emergent tendencies within some European universities). Despite the elegance and, sometimes, the convenience of dealing with disciplines as homogeneous groups, a closer look at the divergent practices within the same field suggests that these disciplines are quite heterogeneous, not only in terms of the content they discuss but also the methods and tool they deploy to reach their objectives. Some deep and rigorous lok at these disciplines from within is much needed to better understand their intrinsic specificities.
