# Abstract

Recently, e-learning in Taiwan’s higher education faces new challenges as the Ministry of Education begins to loosen its control over degree-awarding programs. Studies on stakeholder perceptions toward important e-learning issues become critical at this juncture for policy makers to make viable investment decisions toward e-learning programs. Although a typology of teacher perception with corresponding strategies in e-learning has been studied, the student perspective is missing in the teacher–student dynamics. To comprehend the teacher’s and student’s perceptions on institutional concerns toward e-learning issues, this study thus develops a student typology based on the methodology and questionnaire items used in a previous study on teachers. Two totally distinct groups of students, namely the skeptics and the optimists, are identified in the cluster analysis using four higher-level issue constructs emerging from a factor analysis of 30 variables. The findings on student typology and comparisons with teacher typology are then summarized along with strategies in the discussion and implications. This study should provide school policy makers a comprehensive insight on stakeholder perceptions for better e-learning decisions.

# 1. Introduction

Taiwan’s infrastructure of information and communication technology (ICT) is very competitive in the world based on the facts that it was ranked 15th in the world in terms of network readiness (Schwab, 2005), 1st (West, 2005) or 7th (Waseda University of e-Government, 2006) in e-government, and $2 2 \mathrm { n d }$ for promoting digital business and ICT services (Economist Intelligent Unit, 2005). However, the preparation of higher education institutes for e-learning is not quite sufficient due to the long history of constraining policy by Taiwan’s Ministry of Education (MOE). A recent regulation relaxed the graduation requirement from one third to one half of total credits for full-time students, and the limitation altogether on continuing education programs for K1–K12 teachers, management, and other domains related to Taiwan’s industrial development (Ministry of Education, 2005). Policy makers in higher education institutions are facing less unpredictable policy impacts on their leadership, which according to Irlbeck and Pucel (2000), is an important dimension of leadership. This presents a great opportunity for the development of e-learning in Taiwan’s higher education.

Meanwhile, the challenge of implementing e-learning for Taiwan’s higher education institutes has just begun. This is based on the fact that only five master programs from three universities (among 17 programs from 15 universities) were approved by the MOE for awarding degrees through online asynchronous education for the academic year 2006 (Ministry of Education, 2006). The approval rate is less than one third for those universities with confidence in e-learning preparation, not to mention the fact that there are over 160 higher education institutes in Taiwan, which means there are less than $10 \%$ of them who actually applied after the deregulation. These facts signify that policy makers of Taiwan’s higher education institutions are facing the dilemma of whether or not to implement e-learning, as well as the challenge of how to implement it if the decision is in the affirmative.

Despite the debate over the quality of Web-based education (Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1999), in particular, whether or not e-learning produces the same or even better learning outcomes than the traditional methods (LaBay & Comm, 2003; Miller, 2001; Russell, 1999), the Internet and the World-Wide-Web have become the predominant media for distance education offering degrees at bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate levels. (http://www.degree.net). With the increasing popularity of e-learning in distance education, many issues remain for practical implementation, such as the performance issue (Dellana, Collins, & West, 2000; LaBay & Comm, 2003; Mehlenbacher, Miller, Covington, & Larsen, 2000) student satisfaction issue (Stewart, Waight, Norwood, & Ezell, 2004; Vamosi, Pierce, & Slotkin, 2004) and dropout rate issues (Frankola, 2000; Moody, 2004; Xenos, Pierrakeas, & Pintelas, 2002). These issues reflect the importance of leadership in e-learning in the higher education sector as addressed by Shoemaker (1998). Irlbeck and Pucel (2000) identified five common elements requiring leadership, which include quality of education, planning, implementation, resources, and support, on which government policies and teachers have significant influences.

According to Berge, Muilenburg, and Haneghan (2002) teacher issues were the highest-ranking barriers to a successful e-learning program, a fact which is supported by other studies suggesting that teachers play an important role in the success of e-learning (Gibson, Tesone, Hodgetts, & Blackwell, 2001; Lin, Young, Chan, & Chen, 2005; Wiesner, 2000). Consequently, faculty issue becomes the next critical theme in the leadership elements for e-learning leaders (Irlbeck & Pucel, 2000). Blignaut and Trollip (2003) had developed a taxonomy of faculty participation in synchronous learning environments, while Howell, Saba, Lindsay, and Williams (2004) presented seven strategies for university administrators and faculty for deploying their own strategic plan to ensure program success. Meanwhile, targeting teachers in Information-related departments in Taiwan’s higher education institutes, Tao and Yeh (2006) developed a typology of teachers with correspondent analyses and strategies, which had also incorporated Howell et al.’s seven strategies and Blignaut and Trollip’s taxonomy of faculty participation in order for school leaders to deploy their e-learning programs.

Majority of existing literature on the effect of e-learning stressed the importance of adopting both teachers’ and students’ perspectives as being equally important to the implementation of e-learning (Ausserhofer, 1999; Fender, 2002; Hillesheim, 1998; Lao & Gonzales, 2005; Terry, 2001). However, majority of these studies did not actually look into the perceptions of students and teachers in terms of a typology for insightful analyses like that of Tao and Yeh (2006) from the perspectives of institutional concerns. This study believes that integrating available issues and solutions from experienced countries implementing e-learning in order to develop Taiwan’s student and teacher typologies toward e-learning issues is valuable to school policy makers when making their strategic decisions to invest in an e-learning program (Shea, Motiwalla, & Lewis, 2001). Therefore, the goal of this study is to extend the work of Tao and Yeh (2006) on teacher typology by developing a discernible typology of different student groups based on an analytical approach. These results will support Taiwan’s school policy makers in e-learning decisions to meet the new challenges brought forth by the deregulation of the MOE and the low application and approval rates of e-learning programs.

# 2. Background

In order to conduct a study on Taiwan’s student typology toward their perceptions of e-learning issues on an equal basis for complementing the study of teacher typology, Section 2.1 summarizes the study of Tao and Yeh’s teacher’s typology (2006) as background information. Related e-learning studies on students are also summarized in Section 2.2 in order to suggest appropriate strategies to the student typology.

# 2.1. Teacher typology

Based on the literature surveyed between 1997 and 2003, two categories of issues emerge from the literature, including the learning effect produced by e-learning, and the concerns related to the implementation and school administration of e-learning. Accordingly, from the policy-maker perspective, a 30-item questionnaire was designed to collect teachers’ perceptions of various e-learning issues as shown in Table 1.

The questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 400 teachers within the Information Management or Information Technology departments of 150 universities, institutes of technology, and junior colleges listed in the MOE in Taiwan. Seventy-seven questionnaires were used in the analysis, yielding a final response rate of $1 9 . 2 5 \%$ . By using factor analysis, 30 variables were reduced to five issue constructs named learning effect, customization, administrative challenges, geographic and resource integration, and instructional design challenges. As shown in Fig. 1, four groups of teachers, namely, the skeptics, the optimists, the mild-promising group, and the outlier, were identified using a cluster analysis of teachers’ perceptions on these five higher-level issue constructs.

a ‘‘Distance education’’ in Tao and Yeh (2006) was replaced by ‘‘e-learning’’ since these issues were predominantly e-learning issues.

Fig. 1. Segmentation of teachers’ perception on e-learning issues.

Implications emerging from Tao and Yeh’s study included a lack of competitive awareness, a high percentage of promising teachers, and a substantial percentage of skeptic teachers. Two possible remedies for the skeptics include increasing the percentage of teachers with course training in education and building dedicated support for teachers lacking experience or knowledge in e-learning. Tao and Yeh suggested those promising teachers to use Howell et al.’s (2004) strategies of (1) enabling colleges and departments to accept more responsibility for e-learning activities, (2) encouraging the faculty to incorporate technology into their traditional classrooms, (3) building a stronger e-learning faculty community, and (4) encouraging more e-learning scholarship and research. Similar strategies from Howell et al. (2004) including (1) providing the faculty more information about the e-learning programs and activities, (2) providing strong incentives for the faculty to participate in e-learning, and (3) improving training and instructional support for e-learning faculty, were also recommended to the skeptics, together with the taxonomy of faculty participation developed by Blignaut and Trollip (2003).

# 2.2. E-learning studies related to students

Why does a student choose an asynchronous online learning course instead of a face-to-face course? Mattews (1999) summarized the following benefits of online education: increased access to higher education, flexible location, individualized attention from the instructor, less travel, and increased time to respond to questions posted by the instructor.

Since the high student attrition rate in e-learning has raised great concern, students need to feel confident in an online education program (Moody, 2004). The main reasons cited for the high dropout rate of corporate e-learners (Frankola, 2000) were lack of time, frequent distraction by coworkers, Internet access at work only, lack of management oversight, lack of motivation, problem with technology, lack of student support, individual learning preferences, poorly designed course, and substandard/inexperienced instructors. Consequently, these e-learners had a wish list to compensate for the encountered difficulties, including college credit or a certificate, an active correspondence with an online facilitator who has frequent virtual electronic office hours, $2 4 / 7$ technical support, and the ability to start a course anytime (Frankola, 2000). A two-year survey on student dropouts in a Greek university (Xenos et al., 2002) indicated that the reasons why students dropped out were related to their profession $( 6 2 . 1 \% )$ , academics $( 4 6 . 2 \% )$ , family $( 1 7 . 8 \% )$ , health $( 9 . 5 \% )$ , and personal issues $( 8 . 9 \% )$ . In particular, some students’ problems were identified to be related to their tutors, including no assistance with materials, lack of support, communication problems, lack of knowledge, and an unsuccessful meeting. Moody (2004) summarized the problems with e-learning from the literature, which relate to the mode of delivery, the establishment of a learning community, loss of personal contact, cheating, assessment plagues distance delivered courses, and wrong perception of getting an easy ‘‘A.’’

Based on the attrition issues listed above, reviewing other student studies on e-learning issues only added a few differentiated elements. Typical examples of the negative aspects of e-learning for students are technical problem, lack of face-to-face interaction, and the perception of online courses requiring more time and work (Gibson et al., 2001). Most learners agreed that course design, learner motivation, time management, and comfortableness with online technologies have an impact on the success of an online learning experience. Participants indicated that technical problems, a perceived lack of sense of community, time constraints, and difficulty in understanding the objectives of the online courses as challenges (Song, Singleton, Hill, & Koh, 2004), in which adequate time was considered as the largest problem/issue for potential students. Therefore, the distance student’s needs must be considered when developing program policies and procedures (Fender, 2002). Table 2 summarizes the issues along with available solutions from the literature, which are quite adequate in sketching the overall picture of student issues based on the understanding of the literature reviewed. Since most of the issues and solutions in Table 2 are self-explanatory, only a few issues are worthy of further illustration.

Primarily, learner isolation has been revealed as a common problem in e-learning and is often perceived as a contributing factor in student attrition (Woodley, deLange, & Tanewski, 2001). Meyen and Lian (1997) addressed such issue by involving all students in discussions, which was supported by the results in Romanova and Nevgi’s (2006) study that Web-based learning seemed to be more effective when students were provided with specially designed learning tools, such as general discussion groups and special discussions about lectures. In Zhang, Perris, and Yeung’s (2005) study, nearly $80 \%$ of students agreed to be comfortable in using computers independently to complete course work, but their comfort level decreased when they used e-mail $( 7 2 \% )$ , followed by discussion boards $( 5 0 \% )$ , and chat rooms $( 3 2 \% )$ . It was because e-mail was mainly used to receive updates from the tutor or simply for clarification of the subject matter, while discussion boards and chat rooms were open fora where one’s ideas and identity may be fully disclosed, thus a likely cause for lower comfort levels.

Furthermore, students had a lukewarm reaction toward discussion boards with approximately $41 \%$ agreeing with their level of satisfaction in Zhang et al.’s (2005) study. Majority of the students claimed that they would benefit from greater online interaction and the necessary training to do so. One interesting finding was that students in Chinese-medium courses had a strong preference for using the telephone for support purposes versus e-mail or discussion boards. Low-level computer skills and the inability to type adequately in Chinese were obvious barriers to working online, especially if all course materials were in Chinese. Other problems included the fact that text-based chat rooms were often dominated by the fastest typists, and synchronous chat rooms caused limited time for reflection and articulation (Zhang et al., 2005). Different from Zhang et al.’s (2005) group statistics on Chinese students, Thompson and Ku (2005) conducted a study on seven Chinese graduate students in the USA, which echoed similar issues but with additional cultural issues between Western and Eastern countries.

Second, the total student experience should be considered for any online environment (McKey, 2000). Student support is particularly crucial for distance learners and should be addressed at the design stage (Quinn, 2000). The same goes for technical support in a technology-based e-learning environment (Frankola, 2000). Floyd and Casey-Powell (2004) specifically suggested a process model for student support services that measures the effectiveness of programs and services for all types of students. Their focus was on ensuring consistency with the institution’s commitment to offer online courses and degrees, which included incorporating professional development and in-service training for distance learners, as well as integrating distance learning support services into a college’s mainstream activities. These require an institution’s funding priorities to align with its commitment to the success of distance learning students.

Next, how to motivate students is a difficult challenge in e-learning. Based on Keller’s (1987) and Stipek’s (1993) models of motivation developed for traditional education, Beffa-Negrini, Cohen, and Miller (2002) suggested ways and presented ideas for planning instruction and using effective communication to foster motivation and help online students complete course tasks and hence learn. Their key instructional principles included challenge level (confidence strategy), variety (attention strategy), active problem solving (attention strategy), multidimensional tasks (attention strategy), personal control/relevance (relevance strategy), minimized anxiety (confidence strategy), use of effective evaluation (satisfaction strategy), and promotion of interaction (attention strategy). There are studies related to psychological motivation in either e-learning or simple general education that still need further research for their practical implications. On e-learning, Beyth-Marom et al.’s study (2003) indicated that an Internet-assisted distance learning group attributed higher importance to values that emphasized independence in thought and action, creativity, and curiosity, and lower importance to values that emphasized maintenance of the status quo, and preference of what is familiar and well-organized. On general education, Mills and Blankstein (2000) investigated intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation as strategies for learning, while McWhaw and Abrami (2001) explored student goal orientation and interest to their learning strategies.

Finally, one common impression about the target market of e-learning is that it usually includes working professionals pursuing their master’s-level postgraduate degrees (Preston, 2005) because of the time flexibility and mode of delivery involved. However, factors such as lack of time, Internet access, problem with technology, substandard or inexperienced instructors, and/or poorly designed courses are still inhibitors for these students (Frankola, 2000) which necessitates very substantial institutional investments to produce a course with complete academic integrity and the flexibility that students need (Preston, 2005). In particular, it is clear that student issues are often related to instructors. Consequently, the faculty must be sufficiently trained in pedagogy, technology, and communications so that they have the same comfort level with this method of instruction as they do for the more familiar classroom-type instruction/learning setting. Moreover, technical and instructional support personnel need to be readily available to work with the faculty and support course development (Fender, 2002). Only when faculty support is adequate that student problems with instructors can be decreased.

Solutions to the above issues may be appropriately guided by two studies. One is that of Moore (1989) in which three types of interaction were found necessary for a successful e-learning program: learner–content interaction, learner–instructor interaction, and leaner–learner interaction. Another is that of Gillespie (1996) in which a five-step approach was adopted for application in instructional technology: providing increased opportunities for interaction between and among students and instructors, making available a greater array of resources, enabling students to take an active role in learning, addressing and supporting variety of learning styles, and promoting and developing higher cognitive skills.

# 3. Methodology

Following Tao and Yeh’s (2006) methodology for generating teacher typology, this study took an exploratory approach to generate a typology of students on the $3 0 ~ \mathrm { e } .$ -learning issues as shown in Table 1. A survey questionnaire on these issues was used to collect data, and the questions were measured with a seven-point Likert type scale ranging from 1 (extremely disagree) to 7 (extremely agree). The demographic data of students such as degree pursuing, type of school affiliation, and gender were collected through the same questionnaire, as well as their willingness to accept and use e-learning as an instructional alternative. The questionnaire was pre-tested to five students and was slightly modified according to their feedback. The initial Cronbach’s $\mathscr { X }$ was 0.965 for the 30-item survey, which demonstrated a high reliability. The final version of the questionnaire took about $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to complete.

Data were collected from the target students of the same population of the teacher study of Tao and Yeh (2006). The questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 500 students in the Information Management or Information Technology department of the same 150 universities, institutes of technology, and junior colleges listed in the MOE in Taiwan. Statistical methods of factor analysis and cluster analysis were used to categorize the responding students on a set of issue dimensions derived from the data.

The findings from student typology were compared with teacher typology, and strategies for different student segments were mapped using previous student studies in e-learning as summarized in Section 2.2. At the end, comprehensive suggestions regarding students and teacher typologies to school policy makers were drawn.

# 4. Findings

The findings are briefly described in the order of student profile, factor analysis, and cluster analysis below.

# 4.1. Student profile

A total of 145 valid students responded to the survey, yielding a final response rate of $2 9 \%$ . Technically speaking, the case to variable ratio of 4.8:1 (145 cases versus 30 variables) was close to the recommended general rule of thumb of at least 5:1 for an adequate factor analysis as suggested in the book of Hair, Anderson, Tatham, and Black (1998).

The descriptive statistical data of student profiles were summarized in Table 3. Briefly speaking, nearly $70 \%$ of the responding students were male, $53 \%$ were taking up four-year college degrees, $3 3 \%$ were taking up master’s degrees, and a little over $50 \%$ of the respondents studied in private schools. Close to $70 \%$ of the respondents accepted the concept of e-learning, and $73 \%$ were willing to try e-learning as an alternative teaching method. In general, the characteristics of the respondents in terms of gender, degree, and school affiliation met the overall image of the target students in Taiwan. Similar to Tao and Yeh’s study (2006), the representativeness of the respondents was considered adequate, but caution is advised in generalizing the results of this study to all students in higher education institutes because the sample was limited to information-related majors.

# 4.2. Factor analysis

To examine the suitability of the selected variables for factor analysis, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test for sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s test for sphericity were used (Bryman, 1989). The KMO test resulted in a

a After discarding factor 5 with a low Cronbach’s Alpha.

0.924 value that was greater than the suggested minimum value of 0.5 for adequacy, and Bartlett’s test also demonstrated a very good sphericity $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 7 4 9 . 2 8 6$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 4 3 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 0$ ). These two tests validated that the 30 variables were indeed suitable for the following factor analysis.

Factor analysis was used to extract the principal components of students’ perception on the 30 variables, in which only those extracted factors with eigenvalues higher than one were selected. A total of five factors emerged, which together explained $6 1 . 1 8 \%$ of the total variance. Promax with Kaiser Normalization was applied to ensure that the extracted factors were distinct from each other. Table 4 shows the result of the factor analysis. Each factor was named to reflect a common higher-level construct of those questions that loaded on the same factor. Factor 1 included 10-question items with regard to issues on learning effect, which resulted in a high Cronbach’s alpha of 0.9091. Nine-question items in relation to administrative challenge issues made up the second factor, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.8836, while the third factor included six-question items concerning customization of e-learning, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.8489. Three questions with respect to the ability of geographic and content integration constituted the fourth factor, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.7204. The fifth factor had a Cronbach’s alpha value of only 0.1516 and was composed of two-question items regarding instructional design challenges. The overall Cronbach’s alpha remained high at 0.9487. Since the fifth factor had a low Cronbach’s alpha of 0.1516, it was discarded in later analysis. Hence, the overall Cronbach’s alpha of the 28-item questionnaire increased minimally to 0.9501.

# 4.3. Cluster analysis

K-mean cluster algorithm was applied to obtain two distinct segments for students, which were further named according to the final cluster center position on each of the four factors identified as shown in Table 5. As can be seen clearly in Fig. 2, the two segments for students were the skeptics for cluster 1 and the optimists for cluster 2.

Fig. 2. Segmentation of students’ perception on institutional e-learning issues.

(1) The skeptics: Students in this cluster had low regard for all four factors of e-learning issues, namely, learning effect, administration challenges, customization, and geographic and content integration. Eighty-one students or $5 0 . 9 \%$ of the total respondents belonged to this segment. Among them, $6 6 . 7 \%$ were male, $5 4 . 3 \%$ were in private schools, and half of them were in master’s degree programs, and the other half were in college programs. In this group, $5 9 . 3 \%$ of students were willing to try e-learning, and roughly the same percentage of them $( 5 6 . 8 \% )$ accepted the concept, which is high compared to their negative perception of e-learning.

(2) The optimists: These students were strong believers and supporters of e-learning. They agreed with all four factors. Seventy-eight students were in this group, representing $4 9 . 1 \%$ of the total respondents. Among them, $5 7 \%$ were male, and $5 6 . 4 \%$ were affiliated with private schools. Interestingly, for those who were willing to try out e-learning, only $2 4 . 3 6 \%$ were in master’s degree programs and $7 4 . 6 6 \%$ in college programs.

# 5. Discussions and implications

Two themes worthy of further discussion emerged from the analysis of students’ perceptions on e-learning issues in Taiwan. First, students perceived e-learning issue constructs either in black or white, with no grey area. Second, good administrative support is crucial to student’s acceptance of e-learning. In order to comprehend the comparative analyses of teachers and students, three themes which emerged from the analysis of teachers’ perceptions on e-learning issues (Tao & Yeh, 2006) were also briefly discussed.

# 5.1. A black-or-white student perception

Despite the fact that factor analysis produced similar results between student and teacher data, the student typology is very different from the teacher typology as can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2. The four teacher segments demonstrated different inclinations toward learning effect, customization, administrative challenges, integration, and design challenges, while the two distinct student segments showed very consistent scores across the four constructs of learning effect, customization, administrative challenges, and geographic and content integration.

This finding can be interpreted literally. For those optimistic students, they are true believers and can be easily converted into takers of e-learning with positive satisfaction and performance. Likewise, for those skeptic students, it is difficult to convince them to take e-learning courses, and even if they do, their satisfaction and performance may be low. The second interpretation is that there is a reason for these two student segments to be distinctly different. It may be reasonable to make the conjecture that the 30 questionnaire items were mainly drawn from the policy-maker point of view. While teachers may share some of the viewpoints of school policy makers, students usually care less than teachers on those issues not related to their personal interests in learning. Therefore, students tend to reflect their opinions on those four constructs based on their overall feelings about e-learning, such that it is either black or white.

# 5.2. Administrative support is crucial

After extending the study of teacher typology to student typology, it is clearly seen that school administration plays an important role, which Hailey, Keith, and Hult (2001) could not emphasize more, in the studentand teacher-centered e-learning for either operational or motivational support.

For operational support, student studies indicated many problems that were related to instructors and administration, and many of these instructor issues related to administrative support as well. For instance, course development is extremely expensive, and institutions wishing to offer e-learning need to provide technical support and faculty training (Boettcher, 1999). As shown in Dibiase and Rademacher’s (2005) study, faculty workload, such as course development and delivery, was related to student satisfaction, which in turn creates an impact on the scalability and sustainability of an e-learning program. Consequently, teacher and student support, as well as administrative support services need to be integrated into a college’s mainstream activities, such that institutions’ funding priorities must be aligned with their commitment to distance learning success (Floyd & Casey-Powell, 2004).

On motivational support, in addition to principles which instructors can apply in course design (BeffaNegrini et al., 2002), administration can also be a behind-the-scene player motivating potential students to accept and participate in any e-learning program. For example, virtual classrooms were meant to help discipline adult learners (Guernsey, 1998) and should help many adult learners balance the demand of work and family for pursuing additional education (Mariani, 2001). In other words, school policy makers need to develop an e-learning environment suitable for adult learners in administrative and academic affairs, such that the top three reasons involving profession, academics, and family for students dropping out of e-learning (Xenos et al., 2002) will no longer be the inhibitors. Once this has been achieved, full-time students can also benefit from the e-learning program with a comfortable environment.

# 5.3. A lack of competitive awareness

In the teacher typology, all the teacher segments just did not care enough about these competitive issues since they were not at the position to make school competitive decisions (Tao & Yeh, 2006). Unlike the teachers, while the skeptic student segment shared the same negative view, the optimist student segment did demonstrate a very positive view. That is, nearly half of the students either truly hold competitive awareness or thought so while being positive of the overall perception on e-learning. As summarized in the study of Tao and Yeh (2006) schools will be forced to build the appropriate ability for e-learning to promote their competitive position in the higher education market, since the returns or critical success factors of e-learning have never been favorable. This can be supported by the fact that five master’s programs from three universities were approved by the MOE for awarding degrees through Web-based e-learning for the academic year 2006 (Ministry of Education, 2006). On the other hand, the fact that 13 universities did not get approved at the same time also alarms school policy makers that competitive awareness among administrators, teachers, and students are all critical to the successful implementation of an e-learning program.

# 5.4. A high percentage of optimists

While the combined percentage of the promising and the optimist groups of teachers reached $72 \%$ of the total respondents, half of the students took an optimistic position on all four issue factors. Like those two teacher segments, the students in this optimist segment would be the easiest to convert into proponents of e-learning since they had expressed strong support. This also implies that school leaders have a good chance to rally enough support from teachers and students once implementation and promotion of an e-learning program start.

For those teacher groups who believed in the learning effect, Tao and Yeh (2006) suggested school leaders to consider the following strategies offered by Howell et al. (2004) to further enhance their support for e-learning: (1) enabling colleges and departments to accept more responsibility for e-learning activities, (2) encouraging faculty members to incorporate technology into the traditional classroom-type instruction, (3) building a stronger e-learning faculty community, and (4) encouraging greater e-learning scholarship and research.

For those belonging to the optimist student group, they do not lack confidence in learning effect, customization, administrative challenges, or geographic and content integration. However, strategies to enhance their positive perceptions through actions are needed to maintain such strong momentum. Strategies abstracted from tactics related to operational issues 7–17 in Table 2 for maintaining optimistic students’ perceptions can be useful once they are used in an e-learning program. Specifically, these strategies include better learner–content, learner–instructor, and leaner–learner interactions originating from Moore (1989), as well as good administrative support covering regular administrative, technical, student, and teacher support.

# 5.5. A substantial percentage of skeptics

More than a quarter of the teachers were skeptics who, according to Tao and Yeh (2006), ‘‘were not sure of the customization and administration challenges brought forth by implementing e-learning, nor did they care much about e-learning’s ability to integrate resources. Moreover, they questioned e-learning’s ability to produce quality education and learning outcomes.’’ It is even worse for the skeptic students who consisted of half of the student respondents and who questioned all four factors of issues toward e-learning. School policy makers should be aware that it might take a lot of effort to motivate the skeptic teachers and students on board the e-learning program. Two possible remedies for the skeptic teachers would be ‘‘increasing the percentage of teachers with course training in education’’ and ‘‘building dedicated support for teachers lacking experience or knowledge in e-learning’’ (Tao & Yeh, 2006). For the skeptic students, in addition to those strategies suggested for the optimistic students, they need to truly be motivated in order to convert their extremely negative perceptions on e-learning.

Strategies abstracting the tactics related to motivational issues 1–6 in Table 2 for stimulating skeptic students to be open to e-learning can be helpful. These strategies include increasing in-class student’s motivation (confidence, attention, and relevance strategies) by Beffa-Negrini et al. (2002), delivering a correct impression of e-learning workload (Frankola, 2000; Tinto, 1998), and promoting e-learning to potential students’ workplaces, communities, and families as abstracted from the studies of Fender (2002), Frankola (2000), Moody (2004), Preston (2005), Song et al. (2004), and Zhang et al. (2005). Compared with the strategies for operational issues, these motivational issues do seem to require more research and creative strategies not currently seen in the literature. On the other hand, if the operational issues can be significantly improved, the motivational issues may be benefited simultaneously since word of mouth on good e-learning mechanism and operational performance may just motivate those skeptic students.

# 6. Conclusion

Before any conclusion is made, the above discussion and implications should be used as reference in light of some limitations of this study. The first limitation is the generalizability of the current study which is limited to Information-related students due to the comparative study constrained by the teacher’s study counterpart of Tao and Yeh (2006). The results might have represented a more favorable view toward e-learning among all students. This implies that it may entail the additional effort and time of school leaders of higher education institutes than what the results of this study might have indicated to successfully convince students on the issues of e-learning. The second limitation is that the survey mainly targeted full-time students who, according to the MOE regulation, can take up to one half of required credits for graduation. Although half of the fulltime optimistic students should provide a very good starting momentum to implement e-learning, the same investment can be much more effectively utilized for targeting continuous-education students who are more attracted to e-learning without the constraint of up to one-half of the total graduation credits.

The current study makes three contributions. Generally speaking, by extending the teacher typology of Tao and Yeh (2006) to a student typology analysis, this study had successfully shown that a full understanding of e-learning for Taiwan’s school policy makers may be comprehended, especially with the implied administrative support. This provides a primary contribution to e-learning on the scope of focus for policy makers. The e-learning issues with the administrative perspective in this study provided a good foundation for attempting to resolve the implementation issues confusing the policy makers of Taiwan’s higher education institutes at this turning point. The second contribution, although less concerned with teachers or students, does differ from other studies that centered on teachers or students in the data collection stage. The last contribution is that the analytical framework of this study was data-driven (factor and cluster analyses for student typology) with experiential support (literature review). It encompasses what the potential participants perceived on the e-learning issues and what past experience had suggested in the literature. The student typology, though it only has two simple segments, can be easily understood and mapped to those available issues and remedies studied over the years by e-learning developed countries, which delivers some insights with a certain referential value.

Finally, Taiwan’s higher education institutes are facing new challenges on e-learning implementation with the conflicting results of the MOE’s deregulation and with the low approval rate of Taiwan’s higher education institutes by the MOE in the first year of implementation. This study is thus just an initial effort at providing insightful analyses to the policy makers of Taiwan’s higher education institutes. Additional studies are recommended to extend the research on both teachers’ and students’ perceptions to their overall attitude, such as willingness to use e-learning, their need for educational technology, as well as technical assistance and training support.
