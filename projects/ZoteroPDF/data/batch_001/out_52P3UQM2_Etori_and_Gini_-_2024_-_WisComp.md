# 1 Introduction

The increasing elderly population worldwide necessitates the development of intelligent systems capable of offering personalized assistance. This need is supported by data indicating a growing global aging population [40,50]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports a projected demographic shift, wherein the segment of the global population aged 60 years and older is expected to rise from $12 \%$ in 2015 to $22 \%$ by 2050, signifying a near doubling of this age group’s proportion in the overall population [2,25,35,51]. In an era where AI permeates various aspects of daily life, Conversational AI stands out for its potential to revolutionize personal assistance and support. Particularly in supporting older adults, these AI systems offer a unique blend of companionship, information accessibility, and cognitive stimulation.

Advancement of technology, particularly Conversational AI platforms, has paved the way for significant improvements in the quality of life among older adults, who often face challenges such as social isolation and cognitive decline [15]. Hence, there is a need to integrate the Socratic Method with advanced AI technologies. WisCompanion could provide a solution. It’s not just another Conversational AI tool; WisCompanion integrates the timeless technique of the Socratic Method with GPT4 [54]. Hence, it transforms AI’s clarity and user experience into a more dynamic, explainable, and engaging experience. The Socratic Method, a technique rooted in critical thinking and dialogue, enables WisCompanion to facilitate deeper comprehension and engagement among older users.

The Socratic method aligns well with the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT [43, 54] since it is known for its use in stimulating thought and uncovering assumptions through questioning [37]. ChatGPT, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model type, generate human-like text, making it an ideal tool for interactive learning and communication [5]. Combining these two elements in WisCompanion addresses a significant gap in current AI applications, where the needs and preferences of older adults are often overlooked [7]. WisCompanion aims to enhance the clarity and user experience of AI for older adults, which aligns with Explainable AI (XAI) principles that foster transparency in AI systems.

Prior research has widely utilized the Socratic method in various domains, such as in education [21,49], counseling [38,39], computing [53], dialogue simulation [11,48], moral enhancement [28]. Most research on the Socratic method has focused on its application in education and counseling. To our knowledge, few studies have contributed to the broader field of conversational AI, and this could be one of the pioneering efforts. This paper integrates the Socratic Method into ChatGPT-driven dialogues to improve ethical interactions and explainability and provide emotional support for older adults. We aim to explore the impacts of this integration and its significance in supporting older adults as we answer the following research questions:

1. How can the Socratic method be optimized in ChatGPT-based AI interactions to support older adults’ diverse cognitive abilities and emotional support?   
2. How can XAI and ethical strategies be integrated into the ChatGPT-based design to safeguard well-being and give feedback to older adults?   
3. How does integrating the Socratic method in ChatGPT-Based AI impact older adults’ cognitive and emotional well-being and facilitate depth of inquiry and selfreflection to users?

# 2 Background

# 2.1 Technology Adoption Concerns of Older Users

Critical concerns shaping their attitudes and willingness to engage with such systems often hinder technology adoption among older adults. Among these concerns, privacy and security are of paramount importance. Older users tend to express apprehension towards technologies that may compromise their privacy or seem to function as surveillance tools [30]. This apprehension is heightened by a lack of trust in data storage and utilization [14]. Furthermore, maintaining independence and dignity is another significant factor influencing older adults’ resistance to technology [20]. Older adults may reject technologies they perceive as undermining their autonomy or overly intrusive [55], even if they are intended for their safety and convenience [55]. This leads to a prevalent skepticism towards new technologies among older adults [8]. Therefore, it is crucial to consider this demographic’s potential physical and cognitive limitations while designing technology solutions [10]. In addition, intuitive, simple interfaces that provide clear feedback are more likely to be accepted [61]. The concept of age-inclusive design is increasingly recognized as essential in technology development [19].

# 2.2 The Socratic Method and AI Interaction

The Socratic Method, named after the classical Greek philosopher Socrates, is a cooperative argumentative dialogue that stimulates critical thinking and illuminates ideas. It involves asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions [6,41]. It is a well-established pedagogy technique, particularly effective in teaching critical thinking and problem-solving skills [42]. When applied to AI like ChatGPT, the Socratic Method can transform interactions from simple question-answering to a deeper, more engaged dialogue where the AI not only provides answers but also challenges the users to think and reflect on their questions [37] and the provided answers-integrating the Socratic Method into XAI. Its application in AI, particularly in chat-based systems, can significantly benefit elderly users. As highlighted by [37], the Socratic Method can be tailored to address the cognitive and emotional needs of the elderly. Engaging them in a dialogue that challenges their thinking while providing emotional validation enhances cognitive stimulation and emotional well-being [33]. Studies have shown conversational AI can positively affect user perception and mood [15].

# 2.3 Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) mark a transformative advancement in AI and machine learning (ML), revolutionizing our capacity to process and comprehend human language that mimics natural human communication [57]. Foundational models such as ELIZA [59], PARRY [9], and ALICE [16] laid the groundwork. LLMs utilize foundational technologies, such as tokenization methods [56], attention mechanisms [54], and distributed approaches [27], which collectively contribute to their robust capabilities [36]. The evolution of LLMs has seen rapid advancements, especially with transformer architectures like BERT and GPT, enhancing data handling [13]. Additionally, the emergence of multimodal models like CLIP and DALL-E, which combine text with other modalities like images or video, further enhances the robustness of LLMs [60]. LLMs primarily utilize the Transformer architecture, which employs a self-attention mechanism [54]. The increasing scalability and accessibility of LLMs, as demonstrated by models like ChatGPT [26], have broadened their reach and impact [34]. LLMs transform NLP, enhancing machine translation, Name entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and content creation. They enable context-rich dialogues [17], and benefit sectors like education [52], healthcare [18], and research [32]. Despite their capabilities, LLMs face challenges like perpetuating societal biases and raising ethical concerns [47]. LLMs’ high energy use poses environmental concerns [3], and their outputs risk inaccuracy from hallucinations [45].

# 3 Approach

The fusion of the Socratic Method with XAI in chatGPT-based systems offers a promising approach to enhancing the interaction experience of older adults. The technical aspect of developing a ChatGPT-based system involves several key components and processes.

# 3.1 Sensemaking Framework

We incorporate the sensible AI framework [22] into our Conversational AI design. Sensible AI is borrowed from sensemaking theory and integrates principles from Karl Weick’s sensemaking theory. Sensemaking is a term well-grounded in literature defined by Weick as simply the making of sense or developing a set of ideas with explanatory possibilities. Sensemaking theory describes a framework for the factors that influence human understanding, emphasizing the importance of understanding how people make sense of complex and sometimes conflicting information [58]. [22] further inspired our design and functioning of conversational AI to enhance the interpretability and explainability of AI responses, fostering a more intuitive and human-like interaction experience. Traditional approaches to interpretability and explainability focus on designing better explanations and improving an artifact and do not account for the nuances of human cognition. According to [22], the sensemaking perspective is a frame of mind about frames of mind. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a more holistic approach. Incorporating sensemaking principles into ChatGPT-based conversational AI is paramount. To ensure that WisCompanion effectively aids older adults, we draw inspiration from the seven distinguishing characteristics of sensemaking theory, aligning the Socratic approach with the natural cognitive patterns of our users. Table 1 below highlights fundamental sensemaking properties and how they inform the design of WisCompanion:

Grounded in Identity Construction: WisCompanion uniquely identifies user patterns and preferences, tailoring interactions to affirm and reinforce their identity. This personalization encompasses linguistic choices, cultural nuances, and personal narratives, going beyond content adaptation.

Retrospective: WisCompanion features a reflective inquiry mechanism based on the Socratic Method, prompting users to engage in metacognition by reflecting on their experiences and prior knowledge. This retrospective analysis integrates new information and strengthens their existing knowledge, enhancing comprehension and retention.

Enactive of Sensible Environments: WisCompanion promotes an interactive learning approach where the system responds meaningfully to user inputs. This dynamic interaction enables experiential learning, fostering a tangible and sensible learning experience.

Social: WisCompanion leverages socio-cultural databases to create contextually relevant dialogues that resonate with older users’ shared experiences and societal values.

Ongoing: WisCompanion can evolve with the user, learning from past interactions to continuously refine its understanding of their preferences, needs, and conversational style. This ongoing adaptation ensures that the AI remains a relevant and supportive companion.

Focused on and by Extracted Cues: WisCompanion responsiveness is finely tuned to user-provided cues. This focus allows WisCompanion to extract relevant information from user inputs and to use these cues to guide the conversation in a manner that is most pertinent to the user’s intentions and interests.

# 3.2 ChatGPT Architecture

In this work, we built a customized version of GPT tailored to function like ChatGPTmodel developed by OpenAI [1]. ChatGPT [54] is a sibling model of InstructGPT, which is trained to follow instructions in a prompt and provide a detailed response. Hence, it becomes a variant of the GPT model, fine-tuned for conversational AI. Training ChatGPT involves the vast dataset used for GPT and provides additional training to improve its performance in our dialogue-based tasks. It combines instructions, an extra specific knowledge base, and any combination of skills and tailors it to include the Socratic method. Based on the transformer architecture, it has been trained on massive data, allowing it to generate text and respond to various prompts with human-like precision and accuracy. ChatGPT is a neural network architecture for processing sequential data, such as text. The Transformer architecture is based on self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. ChatGPT is built upon mathematical principles mainly rooted in deep learning and NLP. Using matrix multiplication, the self-attention mechanism computes attention scores between tokens in a sequence. Given an input sequence represented as a matrix $X$ , the attention scores $A$ is calculated as a softmax operation over the scaled dot-product of query and fundamental matrices:

$$
A = \operatorname { s o f t m a x } \left( { \frac { X W _ { Q } ( X W _ { K } ) ^ { T } } { \sqrt { d _ { k } } } } \right)
$$

Where $W _ { Q }$ and $W _ { K }$ are learnable weight matrices for queries and keys, and $d _ { k }$ represents the dimension of critical vectors. This operation enables ChatGPT to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when generating responses.

In addition, ChatGPT incorporates feed-forward neural networks in each Transformer layer. These networks apply linear transformations followed by activation functions (ReLU) to the input data.

$$
\begin{array} { r } { F F N ( H ) = \mathrm { R e L U } ( H W _ { 1 } + b _ { 1 } ) W _ { 2 } + b _ { 2 } } \end{array}
$$

Where $H$ represents the output of the self-attention layer, and $W _ { 1 } , b _ { 1 } , W _ { 2 }$ , and $b _ { 2 }$ are weight matrices and bias terms. The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity, allowing the model to capture complex patterns in the data.

ChatGPT is then trained using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to predict the likelihood of the next token in a sequence. The loss function for this task is the negative log-likelihood:

$$
L _ { M L E } = - \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { T } \log ( P ( x _ { t } | x _ { < t } ) )
$$

Here, $x _ { t }$ represents the target token, and $x _ { < t }$ denotes the preceding tokens. MLE guides the model in understanding grammar, semantics, and world knowledge.

Finally, fine-tuning is a critical step in enhancing ChatGPT’s performance. It involves reinforcement learning using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. The objective is to maximize the expected reward, where the policy $\pi ( a _ { t } | s _ { t } )$ is optimized:

$$
L _ { P P O } = \mathbb { E } \left[ \frac { \pi ( a _ { t } | s _ { t } ) } { \pi _ { \mathrm { o l d } } ( a _ { t } | s _ { t } ) } \hat { A } _ { t } - \beta H ( \pi ( s _ { t } ) ) \right]
$$

This formulation helps ChatGPT adapt responses based on human feedback and rewards, leading to more contextually relevant and coherent conversations. As described by [57], the conceptual architecture of a GPT model is displayed in Fig. 1.

# 3.3 Socratic Questions for Emotion Elicitations

In this section, we elaborate on incorporating the Socratic questioning methodology into the development of WisCompanion. Originating from Plato’s dialogues, the Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue where strategic questioning is used to foster critical thinking and to clarify complex ideas. This approach is recognized for its intellectual rigor. It involves using carefully formulated questions to explore abstract concepts, encouraging deep reflection and critical examination of one’s beliefs and understanding. The essence of this method is its emphasis on the dynamic exchange of questions and answers, which aids in developing critical thinking skills and the derivation of insights about various concepts and their underlying assumptions. Such a methodological approach is crucial for maintaining alignment with life perspectives that support personal growth and emotional health, as explored in seminal works like Padesky’s study on Socratic dialogue [41]. Within WisCompanion, Socratic questioning is characterized by its structured and probing nature; this technique is essential for examining complex ideas, emotions, and thought processes. This method is central to facilitating meaningful dialogues and enhancing cognitive and emotional insight in WisCompanion. The application of this technique in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and emotional intelligence is well-documented [23,24,41], symbolizing a method that fosters deep introspection and self-discovery, assisting individuals in unraveling their deeply rooted beliefs and values. Its use as a therapeutic technique in treating depression [4]. This aligns perfectly with the aims of WisCompanion, enhancing emotional support to users to give them a deeper understanding of their thoughts and feelings. As depicted in Table 2, our GPT model powering WisCompanion was extensively trained using six different types of Socratic questions to grasp the discussed topics comprehensively.

![](img/5332bcf3c516d21eb2a233621abd3443e8404cf0bfb61f7ff939ba647e859e78.jpg)  
Fig. 1. ChatGPT Workflow Diagram: Illustrating the Process from User Input and Tokenization to Self-Attention, Neural Processing, and Generating Responses

Clarification Questions: These questions are fundamental to Socratic questioning since they aim to probe deeper into the subject matter. For WisCompanion, these questions help the GPT model to seek precise information or further explanation. Examples include “What do you mean by that?” or “Could you explain further?”.

Assumptions Probing: These questions challenge the assumptions underlying a user’s statement. In training the GPT model, such questions encourage consideration of the beliefs forming the basis of thoughts or opinions. For instance, asking, “What are we assuming here?” enables the model to identify and examine underlying assumptions.

Evidence and Reasons: This category focuses on the evidence supporting a claim or thought. Training the GPT model with questions like “Why do you think this is true?” or “What evidence supports your view?” helps it to understand the rationale behind beliefs and statements, promoting a logic-based approach to discussion.

Perspectives and Viewpoints: These questions encourage looking at situations from multiple perspectives. In the context of GPT model training, questions such as “What is an alternative viewpoint?” or “How might others view this situation?” foster a multidimensional understanding, crucial for empathetic and comprehensive responses.

Implications and Consequences: Questions in this category explore the consequences of a belief or action. They guide the GPT model to consider “What are the consequences of this assumption?” or “How does this affect other things?” Such questioning cultivates foresight and awareness of the broader impact of ideas and decisions.

Questions about the Question: This final type turns the focus back on the question itself, aiding the GPT model in understanding the intent and depth of the inquiry. Asking “Why do you think I asked this question?” or “What does this question mean?” helps the model grasp the purpose and underlying context of inquiries.

# 3.4 WisCompanion Design Implementation

As shown in Fig. 2, we elaborate on the intricate development process of the Wisdom Companion GPT model. This model, which represents a state-of-the-art iteration within the GPT4, is lauded for its advanced capabilities in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Generation (NLG). Its core functionality is predicated on generating text that closely mimics human responses, contingent on the input provided. We customized our model using a highly tailored dataset, explicitly crafted to modify and fine-tune it for its main functions: dispensing Socratic-based wisdom and facilitating companionship while rigorously adhering to AI ethical and explainability standards. We incorporated both prompts for response generation and a thorough specification of the model’s operational behavior and characteristics. We included a detailed task description, articulating the model’s desired performance benchmarks and behavioral attributes, explicitly focusing on nuances associated with wisdom and companionship.

Interestingly, the dataset outlines the model’s desirable and undesirable behavioral patterns. The customization process begins with a detailed definition of the model’s purpose through the GPT builder interface, followed by a fine-tuning phase to align the model’s capabilities with our specific objectives. We found it essential to clearly understand the model’s intended purpose and objectives at the outset of this process. A salient feature of WisCompanion is leveraging the Socratic method as the cornerstone of its interaction strategy to foster engaging, thought-provoking conversations that resonate with older adults’ unique experiences and perspectives.

Initially, the user can provide a textual input that goes directly to the NLU module, or they can give an audio input, which is handled by the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. The ASR’s role is to accurately transcribe the audio input into text before passing it on to the NLU. Once the NLU module receives input directly from the user or via the ASR, it processes this information to grasp the intended message or command. This understood input is then forwarded to GPT-4, which processes inputs and generates appropriate responses. GPT-4 may also interact with a database to retrieve or store information as part of its response generation process. Finally, the response crafted by GPT-4 is delivered in two formats: as text directly to the user’s mobile phone for display on the screen and as audio through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system, enabling the user to receive feedback visually and auditorily. This dual-output approach ensures the response is accessible and convenient for the user.

# 3.5 Datasets

We used different types of datasets to train Wisdom Companion. The first dataset is a comprehensive collection of Socratic questions categorized into distinct types. Each category is accompanied by examples illustrating the nature and application of the questions within that category. This dataset is essential for understanding the depth and range of Socratic questioning techniques in a conversational context, as shown in Table 2. The second dataset is tailored for older adults, focusing on ease of use, empathy, privacy, and security in a conversational agent. The third dataset is the sensemaking framework knowledge fed to the model. Using a sensemaking framework dataset to fine-tune a model can significantly enhance its ability to understand and interpret complex, ambiguous information.

# 4 Experimental Setup

We developed the WisCompanion user interface and datasets with a sophisticated prompt approach that enables sensemaking, provides clear instructions, and fosters meaningful conversations. The following dataset curation stage involves collecting, organizing, and managing all the datasets to ensure their quality, relevance, and accessibility for specific purposes, such as ethics, Socratic questions, etc., to train the WisCompanion model. We started with data cleaning, annotation, validation, and augmentation

![](img/4c13024b1b0c803adec184c48348451c7ba5a0cbff35a8ac48744835702187b7.jpg)  
Fig. 2. An overview of the Wisdom Companion User Interface, highlighting its empathetic app roach and user-friendly prompts.

Effective curation is crucial for developing WisCompanion, ensuring the data used for training aligns with our objective, user needs, and ethical standards.

# 4.1 User Personas and Journey Mapping

In testing WisCompanion, we used four detailed user personas and journey mapping. These personas were inspired by profiles obtained in previous experiments involving older adults, which have already undergone Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval. This approach is grounded in the principles of user-centered design. It aims to ensure the system is tailored to meet its intended user base’s specific needs and characteristics. The user personas were created to reflect diverse characteristics and needs typical of the older adult demographic. This diversity includes varying levels of technological proficiency, different types of living situations (such as living alone or in assisted living facilities), and a range of physical and cognitive abilities. The personas are based on empirical data from previous studies, ensuring they represent real-world users [40]. We utilies four personas

# 5 Results and Discussion

# RQ1: How the Socratic method can be optimized in ChatGPT-based conversational AI to offer emotional support to Older adults

Our study shows that the Socratic method is effectively utilized in WisCompanion through a mix of open-ended, reflective, clarifying, and leading questions. These questioning techniques encourage self-reflection and a rich, emotionally engaging dialogue. For instance, the conversation depicted in Table 3 provides a comprehensive view of the user’s relationship with their loved ones, highlighting the effectiveness of the Socratic method in exploring complex human emotions and memories.

Table 3. A sample conversation between User_1 and WisComp   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Speaker</td><td>Dialogue</td></tr><tr><td>User_1</td><td>Tell Me About Your Loved Ones. It sounds like you&#x27;re interested in discussing loved ones. This can be a</td></tr><tr><td>WisComp</td><td>very meaningful topic. If you&#x27;re comfortable, could you share a bit about the loved ones in your life? For instance, who are they, and what makes your relationship with them special? This can help us have a more personalized and engaging conversation. Remember, you only. need to share what you feel comfortable with</td></tr><tr><td>User_1</td><td>Well first of all, my name is Lucy.</td></tr><tr><td>WisComp</td><td>Hello Lucy, it&#x27;s great to meet you! If you&#x27;d like to share more about your loved ones, I&#x27;m here to listen. How do they enrich your life, and what are some of your favorite memories with them?.</td></tr><tr><td>User_1</td><td>I miss my daughter and my son today.</td></tr><tr><td>WisComp</td><td>I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you&#x27;re missing your daughter and son today, Lucy. It&#x27;s completely natural to feel this way, especially when we hold our. loved ones close to our hearts. If you&#x27;re open to it, could you tell me a bit more about them? What are some cherished moments or qualities that come to mind when you think of your daughter and son?.</td></tr></table></body></html>

The dialogue begins with the WisCompanion asking the user to “Tell me about your loved ones.” This question clarifies concepts and establishes a user-centric and explorative interaction. It empowers users to express their thoughts and emotions freely, facilitating a more profound and engaging interaction. Further probing, such as the WisCompanion response, “It is completely natural to feel this way, especially when we hold our loved ones close to our hearts,” goes beyond acknowledging the user’s sentiments. It goes deeper into the underlying emotions, validating and exploring them, creating an AI interaction environment where users feel understood and supported.

WisCompanion inquiry, such as “How do they enrich your life, and what are some of your favorite memories with them?” probes the rationale, reasons, and evidence behind the user’s feelings, enabling the AI to collect more in-depth data beyond superficial interactions. The question about cherished moments with a user’s children exemplifies how inquiring about viewpoints can unveil a range of thoughts and emotions, enabling empathetic and effective AI responses. Questions like “What do you enjoy doing together?” help understand the impact of shared experiences on emotions and relationships, enriching the context for AI interactions by exploring specific events and feelings. Additionally, question to question, “Is there anything, in particular, you enjoy doing to prepare or to make the time pass more enjoyably?” encourages self-reflection and awareness. This meta-cognitive approach deepens the conversation and enhances dialogue quality.

# RQ2: How XAI and ethical strategies be integrated into the ChatGPT-Based AI to safeguard emotional well-being and give feedback to older adults

The ChatGPT system has been developed with ethical guidelines to ensure its interactions are responsible, safe, and respectful. These ethical considerations have been incorporated into the system’s design and deployment to safeguard user privacy and prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content [12]. Ongoing challenges in conversational AI, such as the need to mitigate risks of bias and inappropriate outputs, are being addressed by developing a specialized dataset focusing on unique ethical concerns for model training [46]. Our specialized dataset addresses ethical concerns in model training, as discussed in Sect. 3.5. Insights from Table 3.

Similarly, the WisCompanion has demonstrated a keen awareness of its non-human nature by transparently communicating its capabilities and limitations to the user, upholding user autonomy, and enabling a more informed interaction. Its commitment to preventing emotional distress and promoting positive social interaction highlights its adaptability. It underscores the importance of incorporating XAI principles to ensure interactions are user-centered, ethically informed, and profoundly impactful. When users inquire about its decisions, WisCompanion explains its reasoning, acknowledging its AI nature and detailing the factors influencing its choices. Analyzing dialogues like one with a user in Table 3, we demonstrate how WisCompanion applies XAI principles, such as sentiment analysis in Fig. 4, to foster empathetic and personalized interactions.

RQ3: How integrating the Socratic method in ChatGPT-Based AI facilitates depth of Inquiry and self-reflection. Our conversation findings illustrate a substantial depth of inquiry, a key feature in AI-driven Socratic dialogues. WisCompanion not only initiates self-reflection but also assists Lucy in exploring her emotional depths, linking her past experiences with her present and future. This method aids in developing a personal narrative, offering a comprehensive perspective of her life and relationships. WisCompanion maintains a delicate balance between inquisitiveness and empathy, ensuring a supportive and understanding conversation while navigating complex emotional landscapes. This equilibrium is essential in AI interactions as it cultivates trust and openness, leading to more authentic and insightful exchanges.

# 6 Evaluation of WisCompanion

This section presents the evaluation methodologies applied to assess the performance of the WisCompanion. Without direct human evaluation, we utilized detailed user personas, as explained in Sect. 4.1. Our goal is to automatically evaluate how appropriate the proposed response is to the conversation [29]. We, therefore, leveraged various automated metrics.

Frequency-Based Lexical Analysis: Frequency-based lexical analysis, illustrated in Fig. 3, reveals key themes from the WisCompanion dialogue. The prominence of ‘like’ suggests an inquisitive or comparative dialogue style. Recurrent words- ‘time,’ ‘enjoy,’ ‘day,’ ‘feel’-highlight discussions around personal experiences and emotions. ‘Lucy,’ a frequent lexical item, points to personalized interactions, while ‘family’ and ‘memories’ emphasize the narrative’s familial focus. This analysis forms the foundation for a further semantic investigation into user sentiment.

N-gram Analysis: As shown in Table 5, We used bigrams and trigrams to show pairs and triples of words frequently appearing together in the dataset. Our analysis unveils a structured pattern of co-occurring word sequences, represented as bigrams and trigrams, within the conversational data. Notably, certain word combinations exhibit a frequency count of 1, indicating their presence in the dialogues. Specifically, bigrams like (‘like’, ‘way’) and (‘day’, ‘enjoy’) suggest thematic connections, potentially related to exploring preferences and emotional experiences. Similarly, identified trigrams, such as (‘like’, ‘way’, ‘time’) and (‘share’, ‘sounds’, ‘family’), hint at intricate narratives and discussions in the conversational context, suggesting deeper user engagement and meaningful interactions.

Sentiment and Emotion Analysis: Sentiment analysis greatly aided the understanding of WisCompanion’s emotional tone. For sentiment analysis, we utilized TextBlob [31], an NLP library for analysis. By using pre-trained models and lexical resources, TextBlob was able to accurately categorize text sentiment into three distinct categories: positive, negative, and neutral. This categorization was based on the polarity of the text, where positive polarity means positive sentiment, negative polarity means negative sentiment and neutral polarity suggests no sentiment or balance. expression. Our findings in Fig. 4 (b) confidently revealed that most conversations (52) conveyed a positive sentiment, with only four expressing negativity and one being neutral. Additionally, as presented in Fig. 4 (a), our findings reveal that ‘Joyful’ emotions were the most prevalent, followed by ‘Neutral’ sentiments, while ‘Positive’ emotions were notably less frequent. Combining emotion and sentiment analysis through a dual-modality approach gave us a more nuanced understanding of affective states, identifying specific emotions such as joy and sadness. Leveraging the T5-base model [44], our research expands beyond traditional sentiment analysis to provide a more comprehensive emotion analysis to allow a deeper understanding of the emotional nuances in language use.

Tone Matching with Sentiment Polarity Score: The primary objective is to assess whether WisCompanion’s responses align appropriately with the emotional tone conveyed in the user’s input, thus gauging sensitivity and appropriateness. Our analysis entails an evaluation of the emotional content within both the user input and WisCompanion responses to ascertain if WisCompanion is responding with a suitable emotional tone. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce two variables: $P _ { u }$ , representing the sentiment polarity of the user input, and $P _ { c }$ , signifying the sentiment polarity of the WisCompanion’s response. The degree of tone matching is quantified using a similarity measure that evaluates the absolute difference between these polarity scores and compares this to a predefined threshold $( T )$ . If the absolute difference $\left( \left| P _ { u } - P _ { c } \right| \right)$ is $\leq$ the threshold $T$ , we classify the tones as matching, denoted as Tone Match = True. Conversely, if the absolute difference exceeds $T$ , we conclude that the tones do not match, indicated as Tone $M a t c h = F a l s e$ . The formula for calculating the tone match based on sentiment polarity scores is:

$$
\mathrm { T o n e ~ M a t c h } = \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { \mathrm { T r u e } } & { \mathrm { i f ~ } | P _ { u } - P _ { c } | \leq T ( 0 . 5 ) , } \\ { \mathrm { F a l s e } } & { \mathrm { o t h e r w i s e } } \end{array} \right.
$$

where $P _ { u }$ is the sentiment polarity of the user input, $P _ { c }$ is the sentiment polarity of the WisCompanion response, and $T$ is a threshold value defining the maximum allowed difference between $P _ { u }$ and $P _ { c }$ for the tones to be considered matching. Our tone-matching formula with sentiment polarity scores utilizes the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis. The sentiment polarity is a float within the range [ 1.0, 1.0], where $- 1 . 0$ signifies a highly negative sentiment, 1.0 signifies a highly positive sentiment, and values around 0 represent neutral sentiment. We computed sentiment polarity scores for the user input and the WisCompanion response for each conversational exchange within our dataset. Polarity scores were derived through an extensive preprocessing pipeline involving lowercase conversion, punctuation and stopwords removal, and lemmatization. This rigorous preprocessing ensured text consistency, enhancing sentiment analysis accuracy and faithfully representing the emotional content. The tone-matching algorithm evaluates the absolute difference between the sentiment polarity scores of the user inputs and WisCompanion responses. A threshold of 0.5 was set to determine if the sentiment polarities were considered matching. In this context, a “match” suggests that the WisCompanion responded with an emotionally congruent statement relative to the user’s input. For example, a sympathetic WisCompanion response to a user’s sad input is considered a tone match. Using a regression line, Fig. 5 shows a scatter plot showing user sentiment against WisCompanion sentiment polarity. A bar plot complemented the scatter plot. Wiscompanion demonstrates effective emotional mirroring, as indicated by more tone matches than mismatches. This mirroring is vital for engaging older adults and fostering empathy, understanding, and trust-essential elements of the Socratic method. Additionally, the system’s capacity to align with users’ emotions encourages user engagement, thus promoting self-reflection and critical thinking.

Vector-Based Emotional Analysis: Emotions are complex and multi-dimensional; unlike simple sentiment polarity analysis, we needed an advanced approach to understanding a broader spectrum of emotions to provide a richer and more in-depth emotion assessment in dialogues. This advanced approach provides a richer and more in-depth emotion assessment in dialogues with greater precision. We employ a vector-based approach to capture the subtlety and variety of emotional expression. The process begins by tokenizing the input text T, resulting in a sequence of tokens $\mathbf { T } = [ t _ { 1 } , t _ { 2 } , \ldots , t _ { n } ]$ , where $n$ represents the total number of tokens. These tokens are then converted into tensors, denoted as inputs, which serve as the input for the T5ForConditionalGeneration model, i.e. inputs $=$ tokenizer.encode(T,return_tensors $=$ “pt”). The model processes tensors and generates an output sequence S that captures the emotional essence of the input, i.e. $\mathbf { S } = \mathrm { T } 5 ( i n p u t s )$ , where $\mathrm { T } 5 ( \cdot )$ denotes the function of the model. Subsequently, the output sequence S is decoded into a string, representing the predicted emotion label L. This decoding process is executed as $\mathbf { L } =$ tokenizer.decode(S,skip_special_tokens $=$ True).

Fig. 6. Emotion distribution of User Inputs and WisCompanion: WisCompanion often responds with more joy than users express. Emotions like sadness, love, fear, and surprise are less frequently expressed or mirrored by the system.

Finally, the corresponding emotion vector $E _ { L }$ is retrieved from a predefined dictionary that maps emotions to vectors. $E _ { L } =$ emotion_to_vector[L]. Figure 6 indicates that WisCompanion emphasizes positive emotions like joy and love while de-emphasizing negative emotions like anger, sadness, and disgust. It avoids matching users’ expressions of negative emotions like anger and disgust to maintain a constructive interaction. This is an intentional design; as an emotional support system, it aims to enhance positive feelings and reduce negative ones during user interactions.

# 7 Limitations

Custom GPT models, while powerful and versatile, come with certain limitations. Firstly, trying out the tool is impossible without a subscription; no free trials are available for experimentation before making a purchase, which may restrict potential users from assessing its suitability. Furthermore, the risk of data hallucination exists unless the model is trained using specific integration tools, making it challenging to monitor interactions when the bot is made public. Additionally, though Custom GPT can generate detailed content rapidly, users are concerned about potentially copying and pasting information from other sources, leading to questions about the originality and accuracy of the content produced. Moreover, while the tool allows for creating specific use cases, it has limitations in how these use cases can be effectively incorporated into various business scenarios. Finally, a unique challenge arises from the widespread availability and replicability of Custom GPT applications.

# 8 Conclusions

This study has highlighted the effectiveness of WisCompanion in supporting older adults through integrating the Socratic Method and ChatGPT. Our results indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, evidenced by the positive sentiments and emotions demonstrated. The Socratic method significantly improves critical thinking and iterative questioning, which can enhance older adults’ cognitive and emotional well-being. The user-friendly, ease-of-use design addresses the unique needs of this demographic, promoting accessibility and continuous intellectual engagement.

# 9 Future Work

Moving forward, we plan to extend this research by conducting human studies experiments to understand better the long-term impacts of Socratic questions on older adults’ cognitive and emotional health. Additionally, exploring platforms’ adaptability to different cultural and linguistic backgrounds and extensions, like integrating it with WhatsApp, could increase its global applicability. Despite the limitations, the automated evaluation provides a baseline understanding of the conversational agent’s performance using the Socratic method. The Socratic method demonstrates the potential of positively impacting conversational AI in processing information.
