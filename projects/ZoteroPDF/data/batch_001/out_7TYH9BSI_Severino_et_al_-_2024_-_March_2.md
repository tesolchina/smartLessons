Twenty-one EFL faculty and 104 students completed a questionnaire; the writing scores of 54 in-person students were compared with those of 52 online students. Instructors and students were positive about online writing instruction. Students who studied online outscored those who studied in person..

Arnawa, I. G. N. E. V., & Arafah, B. (2023). Students’ self-regulated strategies in approaching second language writing. Theory and Practice in Language Studies, 13 (3), 690–696..

This study examined EFL writers’ writing strategy use and their perceptions of how these strategies influence their writing. Results showed that writers reported low self-efficacy because they preferred non-self-regulated to self-regulated strategies due to their writing anxiety. Results imply the need for self-regulated strategy-based instruction in second language writing..

Arefsadr, S., & Babaii, E. (2023). Let their voices be heard: IELTS candidates’ problems with the IELTS academic writing test. TESL EJ, 26 (4), DOI: 10.55593/ej.26104a3..

To discover the reasons behind the consistently low scores of candidates who take the IELTS Academic Writing test, the authors interviewed 10 Iranian students who had taken the test to identify challenges they faced. Results indicated four challenges: insufficient time, difficult-to-understand task instructions, “distant” topics, and overvaluation of advanced vocabulary and grammar. Thus, de ficiencies in writing skills are not the only reason for low scores; features of the test itself are contributing factors..

Awada, G. M., & Diab, N. W. (2023). Effect of online peer review versus face-to-face peer review on argumentative-writing achievement of EFL learners. Computer Assisted Language Learning, 36 (1− 2), 238–256..

This study examined which mode of peer review, oral face-to-face or written online, was more effective in improving EFL argumentative writing. After being trained in their assigned mode, students wrote two drafts of an argumentative synthesis essay; the second draft was written after peer review. Findings show that the written online group outperformed the oral face-to-face group in their writing, since those group members provided more systematic feedback on strengths and weaknesses..

Bi, X. (2023). L1 transfer in Chinese EFL learners’ use of thematic progression in English argumentative writing. Theory and Practice in Language Studies, 13 (2), 362–369..

This study examined L1 transfer in Chinese EFL learners’ use of thematic progression in English argumentative writing. Statistical analyses from argumentative essays written by Chinese and American university students showed that the overuse of thematic pro gression patterns was influenced by Chinese EFL learners’ native language, both linguistically and conceptually. The study also explored the underlying causes of this L1 transfer..

Caplan, N. A., & Johns, A. M. (2022). Essential actions for academic writing: A genre-based approach. U of Michigan Press..

This writing textbook is geared towards “novice” students, who may be inexperienced writers in English, for example, interna tional, multilingual, and first-generation students. Therefore, these groups might need more scaffolding for their writing. The book focuses on helping these students with the essential operations common in academic assignments: explaining, summarizing, synthesizing, reporting/interpreting data, responding, and analyzing. An important feature of the book is its short lessons in grammar, vocabulary, and discourse..

This study examined how 81 advanced Vietnamese English majors perceived the usefulness of the Oxford Online Collocation Dictionary for their writing. Researchers used recording sheets to observe the writers as they wrote and used the dictionary. Partic ipants also completed questionnaires and participated in semi-structured interviews. Recording sheets showed that learners used the dictionary for adjective-noun and verb-noun collocations most frequently compared with a limited use for noun-noun and adverbadjective collocations. Participants viewed the dictionary positively..

Chau, T. C. (2023). The relationships between L1, writing quality, and complexity, accuracy, and fluency in L2 writing. (Publication No. 2847166727) [Doctoral Dissertation, University of South Florida]..

This study explored the relationship between L1, writing quality, and CALF (complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency) in L2 writing. Controlling for topic, the researcher classified 1683 standardized test responses by writers from 11 different L1 back grounds according to three score levels. Across score levels, significant differences were found between L1s in most CALF measures. Findings also indicated that several CALF measures can predict the writing quality of a linguistically diverse group of L2 writers..

Comer, W. J. (2023). Exploring the lexical profile of advanced L2 writers: Longitudinal data from the Russian Overseas Flagship program. Modern Language Journal, 107, 268–288..

This study used the lexical frequency profile and P-lex to investigate the increase of L2 Russian vocabulary sophistication. Results showed that at the 3000–5000-word frequency levels, lexical sophistication predicted reading proficiency but showed no correlation with writing proficiency. Qualitative analysis revealed that participants demonstrated an increased use of low-frequency words as they acquired more native Russian vocabulary and derivational morphology..

De Wilde, V. (2023). Lexical characteristics of young L2 English learners’ narrative writing at the start of formal instruction. Journal of Second Language Writing, 59, 100960..

This study examined lexical characteristics that predict the writing proficiency scores of 3168 young English learners at beginning and pre-intermediate levels in Belgian secondary schools. Lexical features were extracted from writing that learners generated with a picture narration task. Findings illuminated several predictors influencing writing scores: lexical diversity, word count, spelling errors, the percentage of English words used, as well as word frequency, frequency of trigrams (three-word sequences), age of acquisition, and imageability..

Eckstein, G., Schramm, W. K., & Matthews, K. (2023). The effects of teacher background on how teachers assess L1-like and L2-like grammar errors: An eye-tracking study. International Journal of Language Studies, 17 (1), 1–30..

This study used eye-tracking to determine whether composition and L2 writing teachers notice different errors when they rate writing. Three L1-like errors and three L2-like errors were placed in eight paragraphs. An eye tracker measured teachers’ eye movements while composition and L2 writing teachers rated the paragraphs. Results showed that L2 writing teachers gave higher scores to L2 students than the composition teachers did, possibly holding different views of error gravity..

Gallo, S., & Corral, M. A. (2023). Transborder literacies of (in)visibility. Journal of Literacy Research, 55 (1), 101–123..

The researchers used their ethnography of families of different socioeconomic status in Mexico to examine “transborder literacies of (in)visibility.” They studied the literacy practices of families when they applied for their children's U.S. passports from Mexico. They concluded that these literacies were not only combinations of the practices of two nations’ ways of reading and writing, but some practices required unique transborder literacies across mutually unintelligible systems for children to (re)access their rights..

Ghaedi, H. (2023). English as a Second Language undergraduate Chinese students’ perceptions of their English writing practices, char acteristics and goals in four different writing contexts of ESL courses, academic major classes, personal pleasure, and professional communication. (Publication No. 2819941808) [Doctoral Dissertation, University of Wisconsin]..

This study explored the text types written in English, writing experiences, and goals of Chinese ESL students in four different writing contexts in the U.S.: ESL classes, academic major classes, personal pleasure and communication, and professional commu nication. Participants reported that their writing practices and goals in ESL classes differed from those in academic major classes and communication contexts. Additionally, the language style in which participants chose to describe their English writing in each context aligned that context..

Ghahraman, V., Karlsson, M., Kazemi, A., Saeedi, S., & Elhami, A. (2023). On the functions of hedging in research articles (RAs): A study on RA discussions. International Journal of Language Studies, 17 (1), 165–187..

This study compared hedging in the discussion sections of research articles (RAs) by native-Persian-speaking and native-Englishspeaking researchers. The authors randomly selected 144 RA discussions from 2017 to 2022 from Persian-text Iranian academic journals and English text international academic journals. Functions of hedging devices were coded. Results indicated that Iranian authors used fewer hedging devices than their foreign counterparts, possibly because of their personality traits, inexperience with academic writing, or their cultural mindset..

Golparvar, S. E., & Azizsahra, M. (2023). The effect of graph complexity and planning on graph writing performance and descriptive strategies. Foreign Language Annals, 56, 117–143..

This study investigated how graph complexity and planning time influenced graph writing performance and graph description strategies. It examined 96 EFL learners’ performances in three different groups: pre-task planning, within-task planning, and no planning. Results showed that graph complexity had a negative influence on accuracy, and no variables influenced lexical sophistication in any group. Pre-task planning and graph complexity, however, positively influenced graph description strategies..

This volume presents two studies the authors conducted in a semester-long English-for Research-Publication-Purposes course to evaluate the effectiveness of, and writer engagement with automated written corrective feedback (AWCF), specifically, Grammarly. The results suggest that AWCF should occur after writers have revised on their own. Participants were engaged with Grammarly’s feedback to different degrees behaviorally, cognitively, and emotionally, but less socially. Researchers pointed out when Grammarly missed errors or mis-flagged them..

Hadidi, A. (2023). Comparing summative and dynamic assessments of L2 written argumentative discourse: Microgenetic validity evidence. Assessing Writing, 55, 100691..

This study examined the validity of dynamic assessment (DA) by comparing it with summative assessment (SA) in a case study of an L2 writer. Results revealed that DA could provide microgenetic information about the learner’s development that SA could not. Through mediation and dialogic and contingent DA interactions, the learner could identify and produce argumentative discourse features that SA had missed. Thus, DA complemented SA..

This study examined how person, task, rater, and the interactions among them influenced the variability and reliability of writing scores on a standardized Chinese writing proficiency assessment. Researchers analyzed 640 rater think-aloud protocols of scoring decision-making processes on 64 writing samples by 32 Chinese-as-a-Foreign-Language writers from 17 L1 backgrounds. Results showed that the existing single-task and two-rater holistic scoring scheme could not produce satisfactory generalizability and dependability coefficients; there were significant variations in scoring decision-making processes among raters..

Hu, X., I. A., Khan, A. (2023). Teaching mode of middle school English writing under the perspective of genre. Eurasian Journal of Applied Linguistics, 9 (1), 226–236..

This study investigated whether genre-based instruction would improve students’ engagement in English writing classrooms in Chinese middle schools. Results showed that genre-based instruction did improve the classroom engagement of 208 students. Improvement in engagement was found to be mediated by the value students perceive in developing English writing skills and was moderated by time spent on writing activities..

Hwang, H., & Kim, H. (2023). Automatic analysis of constructional diversity as a predictor of EFL students’ writing proficiency. Applied Linguistics, 44 (1), 127–147..

In accordance with the usage-based constructionist approach that language development involves using more diverse, more complex, and less frequent constructions, this study tested whether constructional diversity and complexity could predict L2 learners’ writing proficiency. Researchers analyzed the constructional diversity in 3284 essays of college EFL students. Results showed that constructional diversity predicted learner proficiency. Researchers also found that less frequent and more complex constructions more strongly predicted writing proficiency levels..

Jabeen, R. (2023). The culture behind writing: An inquiry into the challenges and cultural influences on second language writing in the Canadian academic context. (Publication No. 2812054727) [Doctoral dissertation, Queen’s University, Canada]..

This study explored written corrective feedback (WCF) in a WordReference language forum. The researcher examined the feedback-seeking of L2 English learners, the extent to which their behaviors differed, and the nature of the WCF that L1 Englishspeaking interlocutors provided. Findings show that learners made the kinds of clarification and confirmation requests reported in the feedback research literature. However, L1 interlocutors responded to these requests using WCF types not yet reported in the literature. The authors propose a new online feedback typology..

Khamboonruang, A. (2023). EFL Thai students’ rating performances in self- and peer-assessments of writing: A many-facets Rasch Analysis. LEARN Journal: Language Education and Acquisition Research Network, 16 (1), 221–245..

This quantitative study explored the validity and utility of students’ self- and peer- assessment in an undergraduate writing classroom. Findings indicated that peer-assessors’ severity levels in their critiques were far more homogeneous and closer to the teacher’s than self-assessors’ severity levels. Researchers also observed that in both types of ratings, students could distinguish various writing performance levels and score based on rubrics. Also, students’ rating performances varied depending on different student-led assessment practices and different levels of ability..

Kim, K. J., Pae, T.-I. (2023). The moderating effects of L2 proficiency on the relationship between reading and writing in L2 and across L1 and L2. Foreign Language Annals, 56, 75–101..

This study investigated the relationship between reading and writing, examining the influence of L2 proficiency on this relationship within groups of 8th and 11th-grade EFL students in South Korea. Findings revealed a two-way relationship between reading and writing, irrespective of grade levels; this relationship was observed across L1 and L2 (L1 reading $ \mathrm { L 2 }$ writing; L1 writing $ \mathrm { L 2 }$ reading). L2 proficiency level moderated the strength of reading-writing relationships..

Findings show that learner and contextual factors influence learners’ affective, cognitive, and behavioral engagement with WCF in complex ways..

Losey, K. & Shuck, G. (Eds). (2023). Plurilingual pedagogies for multilingual writing classrooms: Engaging the rich communicative rep ertoires of US students. Routledge..

The essays in this edited collection argue for valuing the multilingual and non-Standard English abilities of students over making Standard English writing a major goal of writing instruction. The authors suggest many ways for teachers to express themselves with their full repertoires of languages, registers, and dialects, including inviting students to use their first languages. The book contains two sections, focusing on the classroom and on larger structural contexts: “Classroom Teaching, Assessment Strategies and Course Curricula” and “Program and Institutional Landscapes.”.
