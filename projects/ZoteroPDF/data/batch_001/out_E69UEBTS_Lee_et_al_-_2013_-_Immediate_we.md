This article is an effort to add to computer-assisted language learning by extending a study on an essay critiquing system (ECs) feedback to secondary school language learners' writing. The study compared two groups of participants' performance, namely the treatment group which received both the system feedback and teacher feedback (i.e., blended learning mode), and the control group which received teacher feedback only. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Hong Kong in the form of an extra-curricular activity after school. Fifty-three students from the ages of 16 to 17 with different argumentative writing experience participated in a series of five writing workshops once a month voluntarily. The participants were assigned to a treatment and a control group based on the stratification approach. Their scores were compared and an interview with the treatment group was conducted. Analysing the total and content and organisation scores of the two groups, it was found that both groups demonstrated statistical significant gains. Nevertheless, the treatment group's gain appears to be more meaningful than the control group's in view of its group composition. The blended learning mode contributes to the encouraging results as revealed through the treatment group's scores, high rating and positive comments on both system and teacher feedback in the survey and interviews. The analysis also implies the need to improve the system feedback on paragraph coherence, workshop design and grading criteria.

# 1.Introduction

Writing is a demanding task for second language learners as it may generate cognitive, physiological or behavioural anxiety such as worrying about expressions and organisation of ideas under time constraints (Cheng, 2004). Similarly, giving feedback is a stressful task for language teachers who provide feedback on content, organisation and language for every student's draft, and conform to institutional policies and practices (Lee, 2008). To alleviate this learning and teaching barrier, a Web-based computer-supported feedback system called the Essay Critiquing System (ECS), which uses an automatic text analysis technique known as latent semantic analysis (LSA) to give the students immediate feedback for reflecting on the content and organisation of the students' ideas and revising the argumentative essay before submitting it to the teacher for grading was developed. ECS was developed by a group of computer science and English language researchers, and they have conducted some pilot and experimental studies to refine its design and accuracy (Wong et al., 2007). Following a pilot study design (Lee et al., 2009), the research team conducted a study to investigate the impact of helping learners of English improve their writing ability by means of immediate system feedback followed and reinforced by teacher feedback. The team conducted a series of five-essay writing workshops in a local English-medium school for one semester for a treatment and a control group. Both groups consisted of two years of senior high school second language students. The treatment group, which consisted of more first-year senior students than the control group, generated equivalent statistical significant gains in their writing scores. The former also showed positive attitudes and comments towards the system and teacher feedback. In this article, we present the writing environment, describe the workshop design and procedures, and discuss the findings and their impact on second language writing pedagogy.

# 2. Computer-supported feedback and second language writing: a brief review

Information communication technology (ICT) has been widely adopted as a teaching and learning tool in education because of its benefits: convenient information access, synchronous and asynchronous learning, effective communication, improved collaboration and co-operation (Sife, Lwoga, & Sanga, 2007). Computer-supported learning has been applied to various levels of education based on the belief that the new approach can lead to a meaningful and valuable outcome for all involved parties. Some research projects have demonstrated its positive impact on enriching classroom-based learning environments (e.g. Lee, Wong, Lee, & Cheung, 2009; Son, 2007). For instance, Son (2007) reported on the participants' positive comments on using the Web as a learning tool to complement classroombased activities. The Web could provide an extensive range of authentic materials and a more learner-centred medium of instruction.

In teaching second language writing, researchers are also developing educational software and studying the best ways to support, give feedback or assess student writing through computers (Allah, 2008; Chapelle & Hegelheimer, 2004; Foltz, Gilliam, & Kendall, 2000; Kintsch et al., 2000; Mideros, 2009) using synchronous and asynchronous networked tools such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), e-mails and writing software, such as MyAccess and the World Wide Web, inside or outside the classroom. Studies by Kintsch et al. (2o00), Lemaire and Dessus (2001), and Foltz et al. (2000) found that their educational software systems that use the LSA technique, such as Summary Sheet and Apex, which evaluated a student's essay content in comparison with the important source content of a subject stored in the system. Lee et al. (2009), who developed a Web-based ECS also concentrates feedback on content and organisation of ideas. The advent of ICT is thought to be more beneficial to students than writing in a pen-and-paper context due to ICT's "automation, flexibility and cognitive demands' (Pennington, 2003, p. 289). However, ICT does not always benefit students. Research on writing produced in the LAN context (Braine, 1997, 2001, 2004) found that final submissions were not of higher quality than those in traditional writing classes. Moreover, some learners may not welcome the use of computer in language learning. Keller and Cernerud (2002) found that the Japanese learners of English and Japanese in a university context have mixed opinions about learning a language through computers. Likewise, Ayres (2002) reported that some students favoured direct teaching and interactions between student and teacher though they appreciated the value of computer-assisted language learning in his study.

This brief review has shown the versatility of ICT in education and its constraints. Researchers usually investigate the impact of computers as a learning and teaching tool on learning alone. Few studies examine their impact when it is blended with other teaching and learning pedagogy. In the following part, we (1) describe a series of writing workshops in which an automatic computer-supported system feedback (known as the Essay Critiquing System - ECS) are combined with teacher feedback (i.e. the blended learning mode); (2) report on the results of the blended learning mode in comparison with a control group with teacher feedback mode only; (3) discuss some observations; and (4) make necessary pedagogical recommendations.

# 3. Computer-supported feedback for second language writing: system and method design

Given the importance of giving formative feedback to students to encourage writing during their writing process rather than merely giving a summative evaluation (i.e. a grade) to the end product (Hyland, 2003), a Web-based ECS that aims to provide immediate, continual and personalised computer-supported system feedback on essay content while writing was developed in 2006 and was refined after obtaining some promising results in pilot studies (Lee et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2007). ECS uses a text analysis technique known as LSA. LSA is a statistical technique for computing the semantic similarity between pieces of textual information (e.g. sentences, paragraphs or essays) with the help of a large corpus (Landauer & Psotka, 2000), and is commonly used to support learning. For instance, LSA has been used for writing summaries (Kintsch et al., 2000) and grading essays (Foltz et al., 2000; Lemaire & Dessus, 2001) automatically. It works out a matrix' showing the cooccurrence of terms? and texts, highlights the relevant writing ideas and their distribution in the essay, and suggests the missing ideas to learners so that they can improve organisation and language, based on its corpus. For the purpose of completeness, we briefly describe the ECS in this section. Details about the system design can be found in Cheung et al. (2007), Lee et al. (2009) or the ECS demonstration site at http://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/ $\sim$ EssayCritic.

The ECS contains teacher input, student input, a database that stores student answers and reference materials from external sources, text segmentation and a preprocessing engine, an LSA engine, and a semantic matcher for giving critical feedback to students. Generally speaking, the teacher decides on an essay topic for students, and collects some relevant background materials on the topic, such as articles from Internet resources or textbooks, to build a corpus. A list of possible subthemes that may be included in the essay is extracted from a set of sample essays, which can be good student essays of past years or model essays from books. Before the training data are fed into the LSA engine, the articles are first broken down into sentences and preprocessed using techniques like stop-word removal and stemming.

Then the LSA engine computes the word-sentence association matrix and the semantic similarity between all possible sentence pairs, one from the student essay and the other from the subtheme list. When this is completed, the subthemes on the list that are missing in the student essays can be identified. The final step is to determine the missing subthemes to report to students for their consideration when revising their essays. The system reports on content (i.e. covered and missing subthemes) and organisation of subthemes in two ways. First, the text in the student essays that matches one of the subthemes of the sample essays is shown in colour along with a sentence describing the subtheme. Second, the distribution of the subthemes in the text will be highlighted in three typefaces, representing varied degrees of relevance and elaboration: from high relevance and adequate elaboration (bold) to relevance and satisfactory elaboration (italic) to slight relevance and not enough elaboration (underline) (see Figure 1). Both the coloured phrases or sentences and the three typefaces can help students take a new look at the content and organisation of their essays. After students receive the system feedback, it is at the students' discretion to make subsequent modifications or reorganisation of rhetorical features such as coherence and cohesion. Figure 1 is a screenshot of the system and its feedback on content and organisation with illustrations. The covered subtheme - harmful effects on health (see Table 1) and the spread of ideas in the text were shown in colour. In addition, the system points out to the writer the extent of relevance or match between the word-sentence association matrix and the semantic similarity between all possible sentence pairs is not high. The degree of relevance or match is indicated through the underlined text. Based on the number of the covered subthemes (i.e. on content) and their degree of relevance and elaboration (i.e. on organisation), the student writer could decide on how to improve the essay.

Figure 2. Data collection methods and analysis.

A pilot study was conducted in 2007 to investigate (1) the impact of the ECS on the participants' writing compared with those who used computers as a writing tool only with no system feedback on content and organisation, and (2) the way in which the system was used by the participants in their study (Lee et al., 2009). The use of the ECS, however, does not generate impressive results as the difference between the experimental and the control groups in their final scores was not statistically significant at the confidence level of 0.05. Nevertheless, the writing patterns and corresponding revision strategies call for the need to coach students in the appropriate way to utilise the system feedback. Therefore, two pedagogic recommendations were made at the end of the paper, namely (1) providing the appropriate amount of input such as familiarising students with the system features, functions and operations, and introducing various possible writing strategies or approaches before using the system; and (2) studying the participants' drafts and providing feedback on content (e.g. number of subthemes) and organisation (e.g. examples to illustrate the development or revision of subthemes) in the subsequent lesson in class or in written comments on individual essays along the margin, as is usual. Taking into account the two pedagogic recommendations, the research team extended the study in an innovative way by providing both the immediate ECS feedback on content and organisation, and teacher feedback on generic writing techniques to young learners of English in a Hong Kong English medium secondary school. To facilitate a better understanding of the learning context, the following section describes the English teaching and learning situations in Hong Kong secondary schools briefly. It is this we next turn to.

# 4. Background: English teaching and learning in Hong Kong secondary schools

There are two main types of secondary schools in Hong Kong, namely English medium and Chinese medium schools, all of which offer two years of matriculation and five years of secondary education subsequent to six years of primary education. Hong Kong secondary students study a number of subjects, and English language is one of them. The five years of secondary education comprise three years of junior (i.e. from Form 1 to Form 3) and two years of senior secondary education (i.e. from Form 4 to Form 5).4 Secondary schools are encouraged to allocate seven to eight periods per week to the teaching of English language (Curriculum Development Council, 1999). The English periods are usually divided into different skill-based components - listening, grammar, composition, oral and so on. In English medium secondary schools, English is the medium of instruction for all subjects except Chinese Language and Chinese History. In Chinese medium secondary schools, English is used for the English periods only. English extra- and co-curricular activities are held after school.

A double English composition period of around 80 minutes is scheduled once every two weeks in many English medium and Chinese medium secondary schools. During the academic year, the students practice different writing genres (e.g. narrative, descriptive and argumentative essays) to prepare for the public examination, the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) (equivalent to the GCSE O level), which evaluates the students' performance at the end of their fifth year of secondary education. Before putting pen to paper, most English school teachers usually help students by brainstorming a few writing ideas or relevant vocabulary. When teachers mark or write comments on students' essay, they usually concentrate on language (fluency and accuracy), content and organisation (coherence and cohesion) (Lee, 2008).

# 5.The study

The study began with the following aim and premises:

# Aim

The aim is to explore the extent and the way in which the use of a blended learning mode (i.e. immediate ECS feedback $^ +$ teacher feedback) helps learners of English to write better essays with respect to content enrichment and organisation of ideas.

Figure 3. Writing workshops: logistics and arrangement.

# Premises

There are two premises:

(1) Immediate and personalised feedback to language learners can motivate and help them write essays with better content and organisation, and

(2) Immediate personalised feedback can be computed using automatic text analysis techniques in a just-in-time manner.

# 5.1.Data collection and analysis

To realise the aim of the study, the team organised a series of five English writing workshops for a group of learners of English from the ages of 16 to 17 at an English medium secondary school in Hong Kong and examined their performance in English essay writing in a blended learning environment: immediate ECS feedback to revise essays alongside receiving subsequent teacher feedback in the next workshop. All participants joined the workshops on a voluntary basis. They were divided into a treatment and a control group according to the stratification approach (see Section 5.2). The treatment group received both system and teacher feedback, whereas the control group received teacher feedback only. The essays were marked by the workshop teachers (refer to Section 6.2 for marking rubics) and their written comments were studied carefully. The t-test was adopted to analyse the statistical difference of the marked essay scores from workshops 2 to 5 as feedback were formally given from workshop 2 onwards (see Section 6.1 or Figure 3).

A feasibility evaluation included a questionnaire survey (Appendix A) and an indepth interview (Appendix B for the interview protocol) were conducted at the end of the fifth workshop. The purpose of the survey was to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of the blended learning mode. Therefore, questions about the number of ECS subthemes used, the ways in which the subthemes helped improve the essay structure and content, and the usefulness of teacher feedback were asked. The survey results were supplemented with the participants' detailed descriptions about their writing process, feelings about system and teacher inputs, and impact on writing habits in the interview. For instance, "What's the difference between using this system to write essay with your conventional writing approach?"' and "How did you use this system for essay writing?" were raised. A summary of the data collection methods and analysis tool is provided in Figure 2.

# 5.2. Participants and grouping

The study consisted of 53 students. They came from two groups of senior form students in an English medium secondary school. The two groups included 31 first-year senior students (i.e. Form 4) who had just completed their 3-year junior secondary education (i.e. Form 3); and 22 second-year senior students (i.e. Form 5) who were preparing for the local public examination. In the same way as other secondary schools in Hong Kong, the participating school had eight 40-minute English periods per week and it scheduled a double English composition period once every two weeks for its students to practice various writing genres. Since none of them had sat for any public examinations, their writing ability was gauged based on their English composition scores at school. The Form 4 group had an average of 65.05 marks while the Form 5 group had an average of 70.12 marks. The first group, undoubtedly, had less experience in writing argumentative essays compared to the second group who had been in the senior form for a year and were more familiar with argumentative skill as it is a writing genre tested in the writing paper of the local public examination.

In the light of students' overwhelming response, the unequal number of computers in the two computer rooms at school and the school's request to take more students for the blended learning mode, the 53 participants who came from two years of senior form students were divided into two groups using the stratification approach based on their English composition scores at school. As a result, the treatment group had 33 participants in which there were 22 Form 4 students and 11 Form 5 students. The control group had 20 only, with 9 Form 4 students and 11 Form 5 students. The average English writing scores of the treatment and the control groups were 67.17 marks and 67.51 marks, respectively.

# 5.3. Workshop teachers and role

School teachers did not participate as they were busy with their regular duties. In this light, two teachers were recruited to administer the workshops and grade participant essays for the study independently to ensure consistency in teaching and marking. The two teachers who were selected by the team have a master's degree in applied linguistics and have taught English at the secondary level for more than 10 years. They came to teach according to the agreed schedule and had no contact with the school or the participants before and after the workshops. After hiring the teachers, the research team briefed them about the workshop arrangement, writing topics and rubics (Appendix D), and teaching procedures (Appendix C). The teacher manual and the user manual of the $\mathrm { E C S } ^ { \overline { { 6 } } }$ were given to the treatment group's teacher so that the teacher understood what the system features were like and introduced them to the participants in the first workshop. In addition, the teachers were told not to give any writing ideas or comments on any essays while writing.

# 5.4. Database and subtheme list

The ECS database consists of a corpus of reading materials and subthemes of five writing topics. In addition to the writing topic that was adopted for the pilot study of the ECS in 2007 (i.e. fast-food eating habits and obesity), the research team selected four additional writing topics based on the essay topics written by the senior-form students of the participating school over the last two years, searched for reading articles from external sources and student essays, and finalised the subthemes of each topic. The five writing topics were related to family and social issues that are of a high degree of relevance to youth, namely fast-food eating habits and obesity, youth dating problems, school rules and discipline, preserving old buildings and young couples without children, all of which are popular and have been widely discussed in the region. With reference to the topics the research team had identified and databases the research team had developed, the following argumentative essay instructions and corresponding subthemes were prepared for the participants (Table 1).

# 6. Writing workshops

# 6.1. Logistics and arrangement

The study consisted of five-essay writing workshops on the last Saturday of each month upon the school's request, held in the school's two computer rooms for one semester. A week before the workshop began the teacher was given teacher notes for guidance (see Appendix C).

Following the composition teaching mode at the school, the participants were given 80 minutes to write a 300-word argumentative essay on a given topic, a genre that they will face in the local public examination for all secondary school graduates. Both teachers followed the procedures for their groups as described in Figure 3 from workshops 1 to 5. The treatment group was told to submit the first draft for system feedback after writing for 30 minutes. This strategy prevents the participants from over-relying on the system or under-utilising it for content enrichment, as these phenomena were identified and reported in a pilot study (Lee et al., 2009). While writing the essays, the teacher could answer the questions related to vocabulary and grammar only. The control group, on the other hand, wrote their essays on computers only. The teacher gave the essay topic in the first workshop and the participants started writing in 80 minutes. They could also ask the teacher for some help in grammar and vocabulary.

From the second to the fifth workshops, both teachers gave feedback on content, organisation and development of ideas based on their observation of student essays, with additional writing problems that they identified while marking the essays for about $2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Teacher feedback was followed by another writing practice. The teachers distributed the next writing topic. A summary of the arrangement is given below.

# 6.2. Scoring participants' essays

The participants' essays were graded by the teacher, following the writing rubics (Appendix D). The rubics consisted of two parts: (1) essay quality in terms of content, development and organisation; and (2) grammar. Both parts are essential grading criteria, and the first part, which had been used in Lee et al.' s (2009) pilot study and was adapted from the writing rubics practiced by the ESL teachers in the university, is in line with ECS, the aim of the study and the school's practice. Taking into account the participating school's grading system and the participants' concern over their performance, the team decided that each part carried a maximum of 10 points and they represented five levels of writing quality, ranging from poor (1-2 points) to very good (9-10 points). Therefore, if a learner scored 18-20 points, his essay was considered by the teacher as a very good essay. Before marking the essays of the first workshop, the teacher went through the descriptions and clarified the meaning of some key words such as "rich and relevant supporting evidence", "some supporting details', "brief and general supporting details" and "a variety of sentence structures"' with the research team.

# 7.Results

# 7.1. Writing performance of the control and the treatment groups

When the research team administered the survey and interview and compared the participants' scores, it applied the "at least $80 \%$ attendance" requirement as attendance rate fluctuated in view of voluntary participation throughout the semester, particularly the Form 4 students. As a result, 22 students in the treatment group (8 Form 5, and $1 4 \ \mathrm { F o r m } \ 4$ ) and 17 students in the control group (9 Form 5, and 8 Form 4) were eligible. The control group made improvement in the total and content scores between workshops 2 and 5. With the full grade being 20 marks, the control group's total mean score rose from 11.83 marks to 14.21 marks. The content and organisation scores increased from 5.89 marks to 7.53 marks out of 10. The t-test showed that the difference was statistically significant $( p = . 0 0 0 )$ at the confidence level of 0.05. Likewise, there was an increase in the treatment group's total scores, as well as the content and organisation scores from workshops 2 to 5. The participants' total mean scores jumped from 12.29 in workshop 2 to 14.31 marks in workshop 5. The difference was found significant $( p = . 0 1 6 )$ at the level of 0.05 in the t-test analysis. Similarly, the content and organisation score rose steadily from 6.101 to 7.327 marks and the increase was also significant $( p = . 0 1 1$

# 7.2. Feasibility evaluation of the blended learning mode by the treatment group

Applying the same attendance requirement, 27 participants (i.e. $84 \%$ ) fulfilled the criterion and completed the questionnaires. The results indicated that $8 5 \%$ of the participants found the suggested subthemes useful, and $71 \%$ used three or more suggested subthemes. Moreover, $89 \%$ of them felt that the system was very useful for content enrichment and had changed the way they wrote essays by giving more examples and explanations. An average of 4.04 on a five-point scale (5 for very great, 3 for moderate, and 1 for very little) was given by the subjects in this aspect. On the other hand, $74 \%$ of the participants felt that the system helped them develop an idea or argument in the essay. However, only $2 6 \%$ agreed that the system was very useful in helping them improve paragraph coherence. Regarding the 20-minute teacher follow-up feedback given at the beginning of each workshop, all participants found the feedback useful. The most useful part of the teacher's feedback was about the participants' misinterpretation of the question $( 7 9 \% )$ , the appropriate way to present and develop an idea or argument in a paragraph $( 7 1 \% )$ , the appropriate way to handle the question $( 6 7 \% )$ and the structure of an argumentative essay $( 5 8 \% )$

In the follow-up interviews, the participants stated that the system was easy to learn and use, provided many new ideas and stimulated thinking. Twenty participants felt that the system could motivate them to write and facilitate argumentative writing. Almost all would revise their essays based on the suggested uncovered subthemes. Eight participants noted that they would analyse the suggested uncovered subthemes or consider reorganisation before incorporating them into their essays, but a few were puzzled about the proper way to handle or reorganise the highlighted lines in the text. They would also like to receive additional assistance in accuracy from the system. Concerning the teacher's feedback, they were satisfied with the range and depth of the feedback. Some of their verbal comments are summarised below:

(1) The teacher did not simply write down "good' or "bad' essay as the students' English school teachers did. Rather, the teacher pointed out specifically how the essay could be improved such as how ideas can be organised.   
(2) The teacher pointed out the way to interpret the question in an appropriate way and requested the participants not rely on a few keywords.   
(3) The teacher suggested some missing ideas and the impact on the essay if the missing ideas were added.

The participants' gains reflected the effectiveness of the original plan of concentrating feedback on content, organisation and development of ideas. The teacher's written comments such as "provide more examples", "explain why" and "discuss//write more on ..." were found in essays, especially for the weak essays, followed by reinforcement in subsequent workshops.

# 7.3. Focus of teacher feedback for the control and the treatment groups

After marking the scripts, both groups of teachers gave verbal formative feedback to the participants in the next workshop. According to our observation of the marked scripts, the teachers paid attention to a range of writing skills, namely grammar and expressions, writing ideas, essay structure, adequate elaboration on the main ideas and coherence between arguments and paragraphs. They compared the identified writing problems from both groups and agreed on one type of feedback to be given in each workshop. For instance, they showed students the appropriate way to approach an argumentative statement and how to focus on the keywords in workshop 2. In workshop 3, they discussed how to support an idea with supporting details. The teacher of the treatment group highlighted the ways in which subthemes provided by the ECS could be more nicely integrated into the essay additionally. Both teachers had made an effort to control their feedback as much as possible. The treatment group instructor particularly juxtaposed the system's subthemes with the students' ideas so as to allow them to see the development of idea from the phrase to the text level. Their effort was appreciated by the participants.

# 8. Discussion

After analyzing all quantitative and qualitative data, two issues merit further discussion. The first issue is about the gains made by both the control and the treatment groups. The second one concerns the degree of usefulness of the subthemes.

# 8.1.  Comparison of gains between the treatment and the control groups

The statistical analysis shows that the difference in the scores of both groups between workshops 2 and 5 is significant (refer to Section 7.1). Although both groups have demonstrated significant gains, the treatment group made greater improvement in writing in the light of its group composition and less argumentative writing experience than the control group. Examining the composition of both groups closely, the treatment group consisted of more Form 4 students (see Section 5.2) than the control group in both workshops 2 and 5. Although the stratification approach had tried to strike a comparable English proficiency scores between the two groups for research purpose, the slightly lower average English scores and outnumbered Form 4 students in the treatment group due to overwhelming response and the school's request have placed it at a disadvantage implicitly. Therefore, the improvement of the treatment group appears to have more significant implications than that of the control group.

# 8.2. Usefulness of the subthemes

Given that both groups received a similar range and depth of teacher feedback, it seems feasible to state that system feedback has made some contribution to the improvement of performance. As commented by the participants of the treatment group, the system inputs contribute to content enrichment and stimulate them to analyse the distribution of the covered subthemes and suggested uncovered subthemes, reorganise the existing ideas and incorporate new subthemes into their texts (refer to Section 7.2).

Although the treatment group spoke highly of system inputs in the aspect of content enrichment, organisation and development of ideas, only $2 6 \%$ of the interviewed participants felt that the system helped them improve paragraph coherence (refer to Section 7.2) and they would like to seek assistance in accuracy. The participants attempted to reorganise but there is no guarantee that the reorganisation of ideas is coherent. Indeed, the ECS provides writing ideas and highlights the distribution of ideas for re-organisation only. Paragraph construction, linkage and accuracy are left to students. To address this weakness and students' concerns on organisation and grammar, the following section suggests some ways to better prepare the participants, address the concern of grammatical assistance and improve the marking criteria.

# 9. Pedagogical implications

# 9.1. Preparing participants in a pre-workshop

It was felt that the participants do not understand why some sentences are of higher relevance and some are of lower relevance, despite their typeface. The Form 4 students who lack experience in essay writing may feel more frustrated in face of the system feedback than the Form 5 counterparts. It would be useful if an adaptation period could be provided for the participants, particularly those who lack argumentative writing experience, to become acquainted with the system, integration of ideas, writing skills and teacher's grading criteria before the writing practice begins. Teacher can demonstrate to them how ideas could be logically developed and linked within and between paragraphs (see Sections 6.1 and 7.3). Therefore, a preworkshop is highly desirable. In the pre-workshop, the teacher can provide participants not only with revision strategies and examples but also practice on critiquing the suggested uncovered subthemes and essay development and organisation, assessing the possibility of incorporating new subthemes into their essays, and combining new thoughts and existing ideas within a paragraph or between paragraphs to make the stance clear and substantiate arguments with relevant and accurate examples whenever necessary. The teacher can reinforce the concepts and skills of idea development, paragraph coherence and construction through both verbal and written feedback. Careful delivery and management of the automatic critiques and feedback may help learners internalise some writing skills, control the progress and apply them on their own even before the first workshop.

# 9.2. Revising the marking criteria

As many participants stated that they had revised the essays based on the suggested uncovered subthemes in the interviews (see Section 7.2), additional points for the incorporation and development of subthemes provided by the system should be awarded in the marking criteria so as to reflect the unique function of ECS on writing quality. Alternatively, the category of content and organisation can be given more weight by increasing its percentage than grammatical accuracy. A new marking criterion of "effective integration and development of subthemes provided by the system'' can be added to the writing rubics for the treatment group. In that light, the revised grading system is able to capture and reflect the emphasis of both system and teacher feedback more effectively, indicating to learners that the teacher is not simply looking for writing ideas provided by the ECS per se; rather, the teacher appreciates logical development of ideas within and between paragraphs and good use of system feedback.

# 9.3.Addressing accuracy

Grammatical accuracy is the participants' concern (refer to Section 7.2). It is also a marking criterion of the writing rubics (see Appendix D). However, the design of ECS which is based on LSA analysis does not perform statistical analysis of grammatical accuracy and language errors are not highlighted in the text. To address the concern, teacher can encourage participants to make use of the installed grammar and spell check in their computers before submission. System developers can consider adding links to other grammar software on the student interface. It would also be interesting to find out how participants improve writing in content, organisation and grammatical accuracy in the blended learning mode. The revised grading system, though not perfect, continues to allow the learners to see their performance and improvement in different areas and conforms to the school's grading practice (see Section 4).

# 10. Conclusion

To conclude, the study has indicated some positive impact of the combined learning mode on language learners' essay writing performance based on the participants' scores, ratings and verbal comments. The analysis of the treatment group's performance seems to show that they are able to make greater improvement than that of the control group due to its group composition. The study merits repeated investigations with a different grouping method or in a different learning environment. If the same study design was replicated, the Form 4 and the Form 5 students should be in separate groups. A comparison of their gains will be more reliable. Further investigation on how to enhance automatic criticism of essay development organisation and paragraph coherence is of immediate need. Further research on how the blended learning mode assists content, organisation and even grammatical accuracy according to various group dynamics, age groups or proficiency levels is worth exploring. The impact of both immediate system and subsequent teacher feedback on an English-medium school could be compared with that of a Chinese-medium school; the result of a group which receives the system and teacher feedback could be compared with another group which receives no teacher feedback. Essay grading and workshop delivery could be performed by one teacher to increase the degree of objectivity in marking. Language learners' strategies in handling system feedback could be studied by means of verbal protocols. Finally, it is worth exploring the possibility of integrating the blended learning mode into regular composition lessons for senior form students.
