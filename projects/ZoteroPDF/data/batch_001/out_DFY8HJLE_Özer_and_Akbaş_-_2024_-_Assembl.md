The assembly of corpus-based discipline-specific word lists for pedagogical purposes has recently been on the rise (e.g., Arndt, 2022; Fraser, 2007; O’Flynn, 2019; Yang, 2015). In order to cater to the needs of learners in veterinary medicine (VM) and for field-specific academic literacy, this paper analyses a reiteration of the Veterinary Medicine Corpus (Özer and Akbas¸ , 2023; hereafter the VMC), assembling a specified list of academic words used in published research articles (RAs) in VM. So far, VM has remained largely unexplored with the exception of Durrant’s (2009) limited coverage of VM texts. The analysis was conducted using LancsBox 6.0, prompted to yield a list of PoS-tagged lemmas (Plemmas) sorted by frequency (Coxhead, 2000; Yang, 2015) and dispersion (Arndt, 2022). The most frequent 1,000 lemmas for each content word category were collated into a candidate list. We then manually eliminated proper nouns and GSL (West, 1953) words. The final list, the Veterinary Medicine Academic Word List (VMAWL), contains $8 3 5 ~ \mathrm { P o S - }$ tagged lemmas (P-lemmas), a reiteration of which was produced by adding the types in Bauer and Nation’s (1993) taxonomy at the second level to test coverage. The VMAWL was profiled and validated against the four parent categories independently on AntWordProfiler (Anthony, 2022a) with analysis showing the VMAWL comprises $1 3 . 7 5 \ \%$ of the VMC and diverges greatly from generic word lists like the AWL, NGSL, new-GSL, and AVL. The list can be used to develop teaching materials for EAP or ESP academic writing courses.

# 1. Introduction

To the best of our knowledge, veterinary medicine (VM) has received little attention as an academic subject area in lexicographical studies. Durrant’s (2009) work is the only one including texts from Veterinary Medicine and Science; however, its focus is on developing a collocation list rather than basic lexis. VM is just one of the 31 fields covered in his study, listed as part of the Life Sciences cluster (e.g., Medical and Surgical Sciences). Thus, Durrant’s corpus is also similar to other studies adopting a generic perspective. Unlike the overgeneralized lexical conclusions of earlier research, the present study provides a rather more detailed picture of academic veterinary vocabulary, with the sole focus being on VM as part of the much more comprehensive veterinary field that covers deontology, histology and embryology, and veterinary public health.

This study is highly context-driven and views the development of a specified academic vocabulary list as the first step of designing a discipline-specific EAP writing syllabus aiming to offer practical and to-the-point solutions for junior researchers in VM with a proficiency level of B1 and above (CEFR) in English. We chose B1 as the cutoff because it is a reliable indication of learners’ ability to produce meaningful language. We aim to equip them with the vocabulary widely used in RAs in the target domain so that they can comply with the disciplinary discourse. Drawing from Nation’s (2022) categorization of vocabulary to be learned for proficiency, we focus on academic words creating the discourse rather than technical words specific to VM. Unlike similar studies generating/evaluating word lists (e.g., Arndt, 2022; Chen and Ge, 2007; Fraser, 2007; Gardner and Davies, 2014; Liu and Han, 2015; O’Flynn, 2019; Yang, 2015), we discuss which unit of counting (e.g., word family, lemma, flemma) is more suitable for creating a word list for pedagogy. Furthermore, we test the limits and reliability of AntCorGen, a practical and time-efficient discipline-specific corpus generator to provide evidence on substantial weaknesses, discussing how these might be addressed through insider perspectives.

# 1.1. The impetus behind exploring academic vocabulary in VM

As part of a bigger project to develop an academic English syllabus for veterinary field, we seek to examine academic words in VM. Earlier research (e.g., Arndt, 2022; Benson and Coxhead, 2022; Fraser, 2007; Liu and Han, 2015; Minshall, 2013; Yang, 2015) showed that general academic word lists, such as the AWL (Coxhead, 2000), could contribute to the teaching of academic vocabulary and development of teaching materials for general EAP/ESP but might fail to represent prominent vocabulary in specific disciplines (i.e., medical anatomy as reported by Cobb and Horst, 2004).

Regarding pedagogy and linguistics, veterinary sciences seems to have received very little attention. Although much effort has been put into developing general academic word lists (e.g., Browne et al., 2013; Coxhead, 1998, 2000; Davies and Gardner, 2010; Gardner and Davies, 2014), only Durrant’s (2009) corpus-based study incorporates texts from veterinary sciences, making it an underresearched discipline. However, as Durrant’s study does not focus specifically on VM, we explore the lexis in this particular field regarding the specific needs of the target cohort of trainees, a group of clinical veterinary researchers who regularly study RAs. Therefore, drawing from Hyland’s (2008) discussion on lexical variation across disciplines as genres, we focus on veterinary academic English having compiled the VMC (Özer and Akbas¸ , 2023).

# 1.2. The necessity of specialized word lists

Following Martínez et al. (2009), developing discipline-specific academic word lists is highly significant as they cater to the needs of users in a particular field, especially L2 and novice ones, and extend their lexical knowledge. Earlier research suggests that not knowing enough words could hamper users’ overall reading comprehension and language production (Kremmel and Schmitt, 2016; Laufer, 2013). Similarly, one must be familiar with the disciplinary usages of certain lexis to ensure epistemological conformity with any target linguistic community (Hyland, 2015; Omidian et al., 2018). The literature also shows that one must know at least $9 5 \ \%$ of the words comprising a text to understand it (Hirsh and Nation, 1992; Hu and Nation, 2000; Kremmel and Schmitt, 2016; Laufer, 1992). Schmitt et al. (2011) suggest that $9 8 \ \%$ is a more reasonable coverage target for readers of academic texts. Since little is known about the extent of overlap between the academic language of VM and general academic lexis, we aim to establish a discipline-applicable word list and determine the extent of its divergence from other lists.

# 2. Literature review: challenges and opportunities in building academic word lists

General academic word lists could be criticized for being too general in scope (Moini and Islamizadeh, 2016) due to potential exclusion of vocabulary with disciplinary prominence (Xu and Nation, 1984). This has triggered a change of focus from academic to disciplinary vocabulary (e.g., Coxhead and Nation, 2001; Khani and Tazik, 2013; Lei and Liu, 2016; Liu and Han, 2015). Recognizing the limitations of generic academic word lists, several studies have emphasized the importance of creating disciplinary academic word lists. For example, Wang et al. (2008) address this by developing a subject-specific word list, the Medical Academic Word List (MAWL), demonstrating the significance of medical academic vocabulary in RAs. Focusing on the field of nursing, Yang (2015) developed the Nursing Academic Word List (NAWL) to enhance the academic reading and writing proficiency of non-native English learners in the nursing field. Lei and Liu (2016) combine methods from previous studies to create the new Medical Academic Vocabulary List (MAVL), which offers improved coverage of medical English. O’Flynn (2019) contributes to the field of economics by establishing the Economics Academic Word List (EAWL).

These studies highlight a growing recognition of the need for discipline-specific word lists, reflecting the diverse vocabulary requirements across domains. However, the academic language used in VM has remained relatively underexplored, especially when we consider the lack of a word list assembled for the field. Thus, we believe there is a compelling rationale for undertaking a comprehensive study to create the Veterinary Medicine Academic Word List and provide veterinary students and professionals with a specialized vocabulary resource. However, creating a specified word list from scratch is an arduous task, as discussed by Vongpumivitch et al. (2009), which might seem challenging to language teachers without corpora in mind.

2.1. In search of a vocabulary list to rely on: can a general academic list satisfy?

Prioritizing vocabulary teaching and looking deeper into the literature to find ready-made, reliable academic word lists, we found two major groups as potential resources for syllabus construction: general word lists like the GSL (West, 1953), NGSL (Browne, 2014; Browne et al., 2013), and new-GSL (Brezina and Gablasova, 2015); and generic academic word lists such as the AWL (Coxhead, 1998, 2000) or the AVL (Gardner and Davies, 2014). Although deemed ‘academic’, they only represent the lexical commonalities emergent in the corpora used, making them a fluid picture of a “core academic list” (Gardner and Davies, 2014, p. 310). This may neglect the specified lexis vital to particular disciplines. For example, the AWL (Coxhead, 1998, 2000), generated from a corpus of RAs from four main fields, accounted for 28 sub-disciplines ranging from Education to Physics, but did not feature any veterinary components, failing to address VM needs.

This issue of topic coverage is also pertinent to the academic sub-corpora (Coxhead, 2000). Although the AWL covers $1 0 \%$ of the Academic Corpus, the distribution of the 570 word families varies across sub-corpora (Hyland and Tse, 2007). Testing the AWL’s coverage in their sub-corpus of science articles, they found that the list coincides roughly with one word in five, accounting for $2 2 \%$ of the sub-corpus. Thus, academic generic word lists curated out of texts from various disciplines may not serve particular disciplines well despite satisfying the range criterion (Roesler, 2021). Moreover, teaching materials fueled by these lists may not go beyond offering a taste of academic English, which might also be found in panel discussions across an array of disciplines (e.g., medicine, geology, politics, economics, applied linguistics).

Table 1 Some studies benchmarking the AWL against disciplinary word lists.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Discipline</td><td>% coverage of the AWL</td></tr><tr><td>Chen and Ge (2007)</td><td>Medicine</td><td>10.07</td></tr><tr><td>Konstantakis (2007)</td><td>Business</td><td>11.51</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al. (2008)</td><td>Medicine</td><td>54.90</td></tr><tr><td>Vongpumivitch et al. (2009)</td><td>Applied linguistics</td><td>11.17</td></tr><tr><td>Li and Qian (2010)</td><td>Finance</td><td>10.46</td></tr><tr><td>Yang (2015)</td><td>Medicine</td><td>55.92</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note. Adapted from The Academic Word List 10 years on: research and teaching implications (Coxhead, 2011, p. 356).

Several studies have explored AWL coverage across disciplines and find varying degrees of lexical overlap (see Table 1). However, the AWL falls somehow short of mapping the lexis in certain disciplines, though it is a fairly comprehensive approximation of a universal academic vocabulary (Hyland and Tse, 2007) or the lexical common core (Stein, 2017), which requires a separate focus on the lexis in discrete disciplines. It usually remains unexplained why some studies include texts from some disciplines but not others in compiling corpora. Therefore, designing EAP/ESP syllabi using these generic lists does not guarantee a fuller literacy in a particular domain. It eventually comes down to a need for further editing and additional features, without which language learners, who would rather be taught the lexis in the texts they study, would not be satisfied (Roesler, 2021).

Apart from these general academic word lists, the literature is replete with studies investigating the specified lexis to build word lists for such neighboring domains as nursing (Yang, 2015), medicine (Lei and Liu, 2016; Wang et al., 2008), and environment (Liu and Han, 2015). However, earlier studies do not mention veterinary medicine, making it a linguistically uncharted area. Although these lists may entertain some common ground with veterinary medicine, it seems unclear whether they have any pedagogical value for veterinary-focused EAP/ESP pedagogy, either. Therefore, we attempt to map the distinctive nature of the lexis used in published veterinary articles to construct a syllabus dedicated to VM.

# 2.2. Which lexical unit: word family, lemma, or flemma?

Identifying the lexical unit to study is an issue that researchers face when mapping the linguistic territory for language pedagogy (Brown et al., 2022) since the way how corpus tools recognize lexical units may differ from ours. Lexical parameters fed into these tools dictate what should be listed as a lexical unit, and the three major definitions of what counts as a word stand out in the literature as word families, lemmas, and flemmas. However, there is apparently no consensus regarding which is more reliable. Below, we discuss the viability of the units of counting and suggest a new term, $P$ -Lemma, referring to a true lemma (Cobb and Laufer, 2021), attainable thanks to LancsBox (Brezina et al., 2020).

# 2.2.1. Word families

A word family is defined as a group of words that are orthographically related due to numerous derivations through affixation of a base form (Bauer and Nation, 1993; Nation, 2016); in other words a headword and all related types. The word family approach to teaching vocabulary is based on the idea that if learners know a base word, such as know, by employing their knowledge of affixes, they can figure out the meaning of its inflections and derivations (Bauer and Nation, 1993; Brown et al., 2022; Cobb and Laufer, 2021; Coxhead, 1998, 2000; Gardner and Davies, 2014), e.g., knowing, unknown, knowledge. Thus, knowing how affixes help make new meanings out of a base word is arguably a prerequisite for advanced reading comprehension.

Indicating the importance of knowing derivational forms, Schmitt et al. (2011) argue that comprehension of a given text increases by $2 . 3 0 \%$ for each $1 \%$ increase in vocabulary coverage. Similarly, Brown (2018) maintains that derivational forms might affect lexical coverage, thereby influencing overall reading comprehension. Accordingly, a deficiency in knowledge of derivational forms might turn seemingly easy texts into lexically demanding ones. Brown (2018) finds that derivational forms make up $1 3 . 4 0 \%$ of the first 1,000 word family bands. Assuming that the first 5,000 word families comprise $9 5 \%$ of a text, the known tokens would be $8 2 . 3 0 \%$ if a learner entirely lacks knowledge of derivational forms. Thus, word family is considered the most appropriate lexical unit of counting in word list generation.

Research on the effectiveness of the word family approach, which emphasizes learning base and derived forms together, has generated conflicting findings. While some studies support the family approach (Brown, 2018; Cobb and Laufer, 2021; Webb et al., 2017), others question its efficacy, particularly in the context of learners’ ability to infer the meaning of affixed forms. McLean’s (2018) study, involving Japanese learners of English, reveals that knowledge of base forms does not necessarily lead to a clear understanding of associated derivations, especially among those with lower language proficiency. Mochizuki and Aizawa (2000) find a correlation between learners’ knowledge of affixes and proficiency level, suggesting that explicit teaching of derived forms may not be essential. Sasao and Webb’s (2017) study and Ward and Chuenjundaeng’s (2009) findings with Taiwanese and Japanese learners further challenge the inclusion of derived forms in pedagogical word lists, emphasizing the difficulty learners face in reaching derivations. The argument against explicit inclusion of derivational forms gains support from Cobb and Laufer’s (2021) statistical analysis, showing that derived words constitute a minimal percentage of tokens in various genres.

From the discussions thus far, the explicit inclusion of derivational forms into a specified word list would not give much leverage to improving learners’ lexicons as the convergence of base and derived forms requires a certain level of proficiency in the target language (Corson, 1997). Therefore, we may argue that derived words do not occur frequently enough in texts to deserve special attention in specified word lists.

# 2.2.2. From lemma and flemma to P-lemma

Cobb and Laufer (2021) explain that the difference between a lemma and a flemma is that the latter is form-focused, and part-of-speech (PoS) information is not a parameter in the analysis. For example, a talk (a noun) and to talk (a verb) should be counted as one unit regardless of their syntactical role. A lemma, however, is a base word with all its inflections, and true lemmas take different PoS for the same word as separate lemmas (Cobb and Laufer, 2021; Francis and Ku-cera, 1982). In Cobb and Laufer’s (2021) words, “flemmas are typically preferred over true lemmas as the unit of counting because true lemmas require specialized software to identify them as different parts of speech and to be counted as such by coverage software” (p. 3).

Here, we suggest the term $P -$ -lemma for practical reference to PoS-tagged lemmas (i.e., true lemmas) yielded by advanced linguistic software, LancsBox 6.0 (Brezina et al., 2020), used in our study. To be more specific, a P-lemma is a lemma that is PoS-tagged, allowing for differentiation between identical spellings of a word serving as different parts of speech. In cases where the same word functions as multiple parts of speech, the P-lemma approach treats them as distinct entries. For example, document_n and document_v would be listed as separate lemmas, considering document as both a noun and a verb. Consequently, if both forms meet the criteria, the word document would appear twice in the list. To further illustrate, the lemma “design” meets both statistical criteria we adopted only as a noun within the VMC. However, there are occurrences of the same lemma as a verb as well. As the P-lemma design_v does not meet the dispersion criteria, it could not make its way into the VMAWL, whereas design_n is in our list.

Aside from the lemma and the flemma, the P-lemma has recently gained currency as the unit of counting in vocabulary list generation (Brezina and Gablasova, 2015; Browne, 2014; Browne et al., 2013; Cobb and Laufer, 2021; Dang and Webb, 2016). Brezina and Gablasova (2015) state that the lexical unit chosen affects the “usability of the word list” (p. 4), using the P-lemma to generate the new-GLS. Following an in-depth discussion of the word family approach’s drawbacks, they generate four lemmatized word lists in Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al., 2014), finally achieving the new-GSL, which contains 2,494 lemmas. However, they do not discuss PoS-tagging and the possible proliferation it could bring about, seemingly more interested in advanced parameters of frequency statistics. Although Brezina and Gablasova (2017) do not describe the difference choosing the P-lemma as the unit of counting would make, we chose to adopt the P-lemma for establishing the VMAWL.

In brief, our rational for choosing P-lemmas is that PoS information facilitates capturing semantic and syntactic relationships between words (Santos and Zadrozny, 2014). Because PoS-tags are “contextually appropriate descriptors” (Voutilainen, 2005, p. 219), learners can easily recognize where and how to use a base form when they are provided with PoS information, fostering syntactic mastery.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Research questions

Bearing in mind that generic academic word lists may not represent the veterinary usages of the English vocabulary, and that no previous study has investigated what makes VM different from other disciplines, we proposed the following research questions:

1. What lexis do researchers of veterinary medicine need to know other than the 2,000 most common English words?   
2. How does the VMAWL compare to mainstream word lists like the GSL, AWL, NGSL, AVL, or new-GSL?   
3. How much lexical coverage does the VMAWL provide in each VMC sub-corpus?

To answer these questions, we utilized three corpus tools: AntCorGen 1.1.2 (Anthony, 2019) for corpus compilation; LancsBox 6.0 (Brezina et al., 2020) for corpus analysis; and AntWordProfiler 2.0.1 (Anthony, 2022a) for list validation.

# 3.2. Reiterating the VMC

The VMC (Özer and Akbas¸ , 2023) is a machine-generated corpus featuring high-quality open-access RAs published between 2010 and 2022. It was initially compiled in March 2022 via AntCorGen, software reliant on the PLOS webpage application programming interface (API) to grab and curate full articles. The collection of articles accessed at one time may differ from those accessed later (Anthony, 2022b). The VMC contains structurally consistent articles with five main sections: abstract, introduction, materials and methodology, results and discussion, and conclusion, without metadata.

Initially, the system yielded a corpus of 1,488 veterinary medicine articles with 8,000,000 words. After following the procedures described below, it decreased to 1,449 articles. They were automatically named and sorted by DOIs, and the PLOS API used a machine-aided term-mapping algorithm to automatically offer categories for the published papers, known as the PLOS thesaurus (GitHub, 2022). However, the PLOS website could not produce an optimal categorization; thus, they ask for feedback from scholars visiting the PLOS website, as is the case with article PMID: 23093923 (PLOS, 2022).

The RAs were checked for any incompatibilities, and we realized that for 26 articles AntCorGen had only generated ab stract sections. To ameliorate this inconsistency, we found the missing sections in the full-text files, manually generated separate files for each section, and built sub-corpora designated by sub-sections and sub-disciplines.

During the compilation of these sub-corpora, the articles were tracked down from the PLOS website, revealing that five articles had been retracted due to scientific inconsistencies, unreliability of the results of the analyses, or possible academic dishonesty discovered after publication. These articles were unincorporated, reducing the total number of articles to 1,483 (Supplementary Material-C).

Table 2 Auto-generated categories and articles falling into each category without excluding the five retracted articles.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Machine-generated categories</td><td>Number of articles</td><td>Weight in the VMC</td></tr><tr><td>Livestock care</td><td>96</td><td>6.63 %</td></tr><tr><td>Small animal care</td><td>2</td><td>0.14 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinarians</td><td>33</td><td>2.28 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary diagnostics</td><td>197</td><td>13.60 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary diseases</td><td>861</td><td>59.42 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary epidemiology</td><td>43</td><td>2.97 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary hospitals</td><td>36</td><td>2.48 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary medicine</td><td>74</td><td>5.11 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary microbiology</td><td>4</td><td>0.28 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary parasitology</td><td> 65</td><td>4.49 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary pathology</td><td>16</td><td>1.10 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary science</td><td>1.</td><td>0.07 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary surgery</td><td>59</td><td>4.07 %</td></tr><tr><td>Veterinary virology</td><td>1</td><td>0.07 %</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 2 shows veterinary diseases as the dominant category in the corpus (861 articles). Since 116 articles span multiple categories, complicating dispersion statistics, we consulted three veterinary researchers to select the best category using the PLOS API for these articles, suggesting scientifically appropriate alternatives for the broader spectrum of veterinary research when possible. In this process, we discovered that 26 of the 116 articles were non-veterinary, and thus we concluded that the machine-aided term-mapping technology of the PLOS website might yield misleading suggestions. These non-veterinary articles were then unincorporated from the VMC, and the others were placed into new categories.

The PLOS thesaurus’ default categorization of the articles yielded an uneven, rather than flat, distribution across the categories, and the suggested categories (Table 2) were machine-generated and lexis-based rather than scientific. We ran a mock analysis with the existing categorization to see how the statistics would turn out. LancsBox yielded high dispersion values (by the coefficient of variation, CV) for frequent tokens, which seemed unreliable for developing a discipline-specific word list. Therefore, we decided to streamline the categorization using expert advice and were able to come up with four parent and 17 child categories, as shown in Table 3.

Next, we turned our attention to the remaining 745 articles labeled veterinary diseases to attain an empirically sound rationale based on stringent criteria and get a “wide and balanced range of topics” (Coxhead, 2000, p. 214). This was crucial for the internal reliability of the study because the representativeness of a corpus is affected by the consistency of sampling (i.e., categorization; Ballance, 2022). The consultants agreed that an etiological categorization would scientifically be more appropriate than a lexical one. Eight more articles were found to be non-veterinary, and the final reject pile included 39 articles $2 . 2 6 \%$ of the VMC), reducing the total to 1,449 (7,962,021 tokens). Unlike the 15 single-slot lexis-based categories yielded by the software, four main subject areas emerged covering 17 sub-disciplines (Table 3).

# 3.3. Analyzing the VMC and generating the VMAWL

We analyzed the VMC on LancsBox 6.0, prompting the software to yield a list of P-lemmas and taking only content words into consideration while function words were disregarded. A candidate list of 4,000 P-lemmas was collated from the most frequent 1,000 nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, which was then manually treated to combine duplicates (adopting American English for words with two different spellings; e.g., characterize, analyze) and remove proper nouns like Brazil, North, and Canada. Although Lei and Liu (2016) argue against the exclusion of high-frequency words, a deliberate decision was made to eliminate the GSL words proposed by West (1953), from our candidate list. This exclusion was driven by a dual objective: firstly, the presupposition that our target audience, possessing a proficiency level of CEFR B1, would already be acquainted with the most frequent 2,000 words in English found in the GSL. Secondly, our study did not seek to unearth technical vocabulary but rather sought to delineate the discipline-specific lexicon inherent in veterinary medicine. Additionally, via the omission of the GSL words, we aimed to prevent the over-saturation of commonplace terms, thereby precluding the adoption of a word family approach.

# 3.4. Criteria for the development of the VMAWL

We borrowed two main technical criteria: frequency from Yang (2015), and dispersion from Arndt (2022). Firstly, to assemble the Nursing Academic Word List (NAWL), Yang (2015) built a 1,006,934-word corpus of nursing RAs, approximately one-third the size of the academic corpus (Coxhead, 1998, 2000) – 3.5 million words. Proportionally, Yang’s frequency cut-off threshold is 33 as the AWL’s is 100. The VMC $\approx 8 \mathrm { m }$ words), however, is 2.28 times larger than the Coxhead corpus. Therefore, we required a token (P-lemma, content words only) to have occurred at least 228 times in the VMC before it could make it into our VMAWL.

Secondly, drawing from Arndt (2022), we determined lexical saliency by dispersion as Gries (2020) argues that dispersion statistics should be “strictly” required by reviewers “so that readers can more reliably infer what reported frequencies or association measures represent or whether they represent what they purport to represent” (p. 111). Studies by Davies and Gardner (2010), Gardner and Davies (2014), and Lei and Liu (2016) rely on Juilland’s $D$ as a measure of dispersion, but we calculated dispersion values by the coefficient of variation (CV) because, according to Gries (2008), Juilland’s $D$ comes with certain limitations.

Apart from frequency and dispersion, we previewed Brezina and Gablasova’s (2017) precepts for vocabulary list development:

1. Explicitly define the vocabulary construct.   
2. Operationalize the vocabulary construct using transparent and replicable criteria.   
3. If using corpora, take corpus evidence seriously and avoid cherry-picking.   
4. Use multiple sources of evidence to test the validity of the vocabulary construct.

5. Do not rely on your intuition/experience to determine what is useful for learners; collect evidence about learner needs to evaluate the usefulness of the list.   
6. Do not present learners with a decontextualized list of lexical items; use/create contextualized materials instead (Brezina and Gablasova, 2017, p. 4).

These constituents help establish some concrete rationale; however, we preferred not to rely totally on them and disregarded items one, three, and six to stay focused on lexis until we put the VMAWL into practice at a later stage. While we agree with criteria two and four, we decided to diverge from Brezina and Gablasova (2017) by only partially following criterion five because EAP practitioners of the target discipline and genre might benefit from hands-on corpus interaction (Yin, 2015). While testing whether a word has disciplinary value, exposure to ubiquitous content in a particular discipline might increase the chances of developing disciplinary intuitions, thus enriching their intellectual faculties. This may be a practical solution, especially in the absence of mentorship or collaboration offered by an insider.

# 4. Findings and discussion

The analysis following the procedures described above resulted in a preliminary list of 847 P-lemmas. Despite not having initially adopted the family approach, we did not abandon the rationale of grouping orthographically similar words into clusters as families (e.g., addition, additional, additionally). Out of the 847 P-lemmas forming the VMAWL emerged 611 lemma families, containing only tokens already in the preliminary list. We further refined the preliminary VMAWL by eliminating 12 P-lemmas, including:

1) an inflection of a lemma for a proper name (i.e., a corporate company) in a compound noun; e.g., \* technologies, \*   
laboratories   
2) a proper noun for a specific type of mathematical calculation; e.g., [standard] deviation, median, means   
3) a proper noun for a chemical; e.g., sodium   
4) words that appear in the sub-headings; e.g., text, author, background, conclusion.

The tentative final list contained 835 P-lemmas compressed and clustered into 605 lemma families. Orthographically identical words of the same stem but different PoS were counted as one unit, yielding a list of 831 nodes, which we believe represents the lexical priorities emerging from the machine-generated VMC. With the raw frequencies of all 835 P-lemmas added up, the VMAWL covers $1 1 . 9 2 \%$ of the VMC, aligning with some of the earlier studies (i.e., Khani and Tazik, 2013; Wang et al., 2008; Yang, 2015). We, therefore, believe that, coupled with the GSL or NGSL, the VMAWL could be essential to reading comprehension in veterinary medicine because, as discussed previously, knowledge of at least $9 5 \ \%$ (Laufer, 1992) of the words in a text may be essential for reading fluency. It may not be possible to achieve such large coverage without the saliency of the VMAWL, which can be a useful resource for better veterinary literacy.

# 4.1. Validating the VMAWL: issues in coverage statistics

Checking the extent of lexical coverage with a specified word list in and across corpora is common practice in word list studies and a sine qua non for reliability (Arndt, 2022; Coxhead, 2000; Hartshorn and Hart, 2016; Lei and Liu, 2016). We divided the list into 10 frequency bands, from most frequent to least, and the cumulative raw frequencies per band also equaled $1 1 . 9 2 \ \%$ (Table 4). Similar studies, however, show O’Flynn’s (2019) Economics Academic Word List (EAWL) covers $5 . 6 0 \%$ of their EcoCorpus, and Moini and Islamizadeh’s (2016) Linguistics Academic Word List (LAWL) covers only $5 . 7 0 \%$ of the Linguistics Research Articles Corpus (LRAC). Addressing a larger portion of their corpora, Khani and Tazik’s (2013) word list grants $1 1 . 4 0 \%$ coverage, whereas Lei and Liu’s (2016) MAVL goes as high as $1 9 . 4 4 \%$ and $2 0 . 1 8 \ \%$ in two similar corpora, MAEC and MTEC, respectively.

Although the VMAWL is a lemmatized list (inflections), rather than the familized one (derivations and inflections) found in earlier research, it covers more than one tenth of the VMC. One might argue that more coverage means less “learning effort required” (Lei and Liu, 2016, p. 47). Admittedly, a certain repertoire of general and academic vocabulary and affixation skills are expected for academic success whether one is born into the target language or not (Gardner and Davies, 2014), which the target audience of a disciplinary list should possess until they begin specializing in certain fields (Arndt, 2022; Dang, 2019) in the target language. From an EAP/ESP pedagogy standpoint, learners can be encouraged to self-study derivations and inflections of the lemmas in a specified list and other words the target list may not possess. Therefore, a lemmatized word list is a more robust sketch of disciplinary lexis ready for use in material development as well as corpus-informed syllabus design.

Table 4 Frequency bands.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Frequency bands (lemma count)</td><td>Frequency</td><td>Coverage of the VMC</td><td> Implicational scaling</td></tr><tr><td>Band 1 (83)</td><td>400,245</td><td>5.03 %</td><td>HIGH (totaling 7.00 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Band 2 (83)</td><td>156,911</td><td>1.97 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 3 (83)</td><td>101,899</td><td>1.28 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 4 (83)</td><td>75,091</td><td>0.94 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 5 (83)</td><td>57,448</td><td>0.72 %</td><td>MID (totaling 1.29 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Band 6 (83)</td><td>45,526</td><td>0.57 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 7 (83)</td><td>36,639</td><td>0.46 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 8 (83)</td><td>29,771</td><td>0.37 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Band 9 (83)</td><td>24,361</td><td>0.31 %</td><td>LOW (totaling 0.58 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Band 10 (88)</td><td>21,612</td><td>0.27 %</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>949,503</td><td>11.92 %</td><td>8.87 %</td></tr></table></body></html>

Nevertheless, the generic and disciplinary single-word lists may overlap, and taking different perspectives can be necessary to show either list’s superiority. Implicational scaling is a technique used by linguists building frequency-based lists, which helps redefine lists’ frequency borders because of the higher potential of overlap and transparency between corresponding bands in two comparable lists (i.e., academic to academic, or general to general; Hartshorn and Hart, 2016). In essence, this technique facilitates the documentation of divergence between two different lists, such as the AWL and AVL (Hartshorn and Hart, 2016). However, it also helps determine the range of words needing more effort to teach and learn, thereby providing guidelines for language pedagogy and time management (Hartshorn and Hart, 2016), which are more relevant to our study. This is where the PoS-tagging of lemmas comes in handy. While nouns and adjectives dominate the first two frequency bands, verbs and adverbs are less common (see Supplementary Material-D). Therefore, focusing heavily on high-frequency-range words (Table 5) might not represent the best use of a specified list to develop better literacy skills in disciplinary academic writing with a fuller repertoire of meaning blocks of disciplinary discourse. Instead, a balanced approach seems fruitful.

The VMAWL solely comprises nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that meet the set statistical criteria. Each frequency band holds members of these parts of speech at varying levels, with some concrete pedagogical guidelines. After implicational scaling, the PoS ratio in the high (bands 1–2), mid (bands 5–6), and low (bands 9–10) frequency ranges vary as illustrated in Table 5.

Table 5 PoS concentration in frequency ranges.   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Frequency rangee</td><td colspan="4">P-lemmas</td></tr><tr><td>Noun</td><td>Verb</td><td>Adjective</td><td>Adverb</td></tr><tr><td>HIGH (166 P-lemmas, Bands 1 &amp; 2)</td><td>94</td><td>31</td><td>33</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>MID (166 P-lemmas, Bands 5 &amp; 6)</td><td>73</td><td>29</td><td>45</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>LOW (171 P-lemmas, Bands 9 &amp; 10)</td><td>58</td><td>32</td><td>49</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>44.73 %</td><td>18.29 %</td><td>25.25 %</td><td>11.73 %</td></tr></table></body></html>

The three frequency ranges contain 503 P-lemmas and comprise $6 0 . 2 3 \ \%$ of the VMAWL. While nouns and adjectives dominate these ranges, verbs and adverbs are less common, carrying some pedagogical implications. The fluctuating pattern of PoS dispersion across frequency ranges simply explains that teaching should be gauged accordingly for an efficient use of class time. This planning can help foster learner autonomy if learners are prompted to work out the remaining $4 0 \%$ through effective planning. Practice materials and exercises for self-study might cover portions of the list, possibly leading to selfsustained engagement with lexis.

The VMAWL comprises statistically significant content words in veterinary medicine (VM), revealing a diverse array of topics, predominantly nouns $( 4 4 . 7 3 \ \% )$ and descriptors (adjectives, $2 5 . 2 4 \ \%$ . VM can be considered a topic-fronted field (Tables 5 and 6), with fewer actions (verbs, $1 8 . 2 9 \%$ ) and words qualifying verbs and adjectives. We propose prioritizing highfrequency words for foundational learning before exploring intermediate ranges (3, 4, 7, and 8) through guided concordancing to boost academic literacy in VM.

# 4.1.1. Comparing the VMAWL with four generic lists

To answer the second research question, we compared the VMAWL with four generic word lists (Table 7), two of which are lemmatized, while the other two adopt the word family as the unit of counting. Hence, the ones taking the word family as the lexical unit were compared with the 605 VMAWL lemma families while the lemmatized lists were compared with the $8 3 5 \mathrm { P } \mathrm { - }$ lemmas in the VMAWL for consistency and validity in benchmarking (Gardner and Davies, 2014). Benchmarks that vary in word count and types of lemmas in the VMAWL were not considered.

Table 7 Lexical overlap between four generic lists and the VMAWL.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Generic lists</td><td>Unit of countinge</td><td>No. of words</td><td>% of overlap with VMAWL</td></tr><tr><td>AWL (Coxhead, 1998, 2000)</td><td>Word familye</td><td>570</td><td>18.18</td></tr><tr><td>The new-GSL (Brezina and Gablasova, 2015)</td><td>Lemma</td><td>2,494</td><td>42.87</td></tr><tr><td>NGSL (Browne, 2014)</td><td>Word family</td><td>2,818</td><td>64.63</td></tr><tr><td>AVL (Gardner and Davies, 2014)</td><td>Lemma</td><td>3,015</td><td>55.93</td></tr></table></body></html>

As in Table 7, these generic word lists may neglect a large proportion of veterinary-medicine lexis as their source corpora feature no texts from this discipline. The partial overlap indicates that EAP/ESP writing courses can benefit from these lists and teaching materials based on them. However, relying solely on materials based on general academic word lists may fail to cater for lexis which gains prominence in the context of veterinary medicine. Therefore, explicit effort in familiarizing learners with the VMAWL words is a necessary practical step towards designing a well-endowed EAP/ESP syllabus.

The VMC does not address the whole spectrum of research areas in veterinary medicine. We relied solely on what AntCorGen yielded and did not incorporate additional texts to equalize the sub-corpora sizes to ensure methodological consistency. For this reason, some veterinary words (Table 8) were not statistically fit to be included in the VMAWL, being used either too infrequently (minimum frequency: 228 per million) or not equally frequently across the VMC (dispersion measured by $\mathrm { ~ C V ~ } 1 \leq )$ .

# 4.1.2. Profiling the VMAWL against the VMC

The expert-guided reiteration of the VMC returned a finer-grained categorization of the articles in four parent categories, as explained in 3.2. To check the VMAWL coverage, we used AntWordProfiler (AWP), a free word list profiling tool, and to comply with AWP, the corpus files for the 17 sub-categories were concatenated to generate sub-corpora for each parent category (Table 3) rather than the whole VMC.1

Furthermore, AWP works on word types rather than lemmas or P-lemmas. To tackle this incompatibility, we drew from Arndt (2022), who manually changed lemmas in the DSL (Arndt, 2022), MSVL for Science, SVL for Biology, SVL for Chemistry, and SVL for Physics (Greene and Coxhead, 2015) into word types to enhance comparability and make better use of AWP. These lists were converted into an AWP-friendly format to utilize AWP to profile them against the Digital Sciences Corpus (DSC), following “Bauer and Nation’s (1993) taxonomy for word families at level 2 by adding to the baseword several derivational affixes (e.g., -s for plural on nouns or verbs, -ed/-ing on verbs, -er/-est on adjectives, -th on numbers, and -en on irregular verbs)” (Arndt, 2022, p. 7).

Similarly, we added verb and noun inflections of the P-lemmas in the VAWML. The 605 lemma families were regrouped while groups of lemmas were separated and moved to a standalone position, where necessary. For instance, while lemmas align $( \nu . )$ and alignment (n.) formed one lemma family in the previous categorization, with the addition of inflections of the verb align, two separate entries were created, as with activate $( \nu . )$ and activation (n.). While doing this, we paid attention to the PoS of the lemmas, and did not add suffixes irrelevant to the PoS attributed to a lemma by LancsBox. For instance, beginning $( n . )$ did not get the inflected forms that begin $( \nu . )$ would get if it were in the VMAWL. Irregular plural forms of nouns, such as analyses (analysis in the plural), or criteria (criterion in the plural), were added too. However, this generated a handicap regarding similar spellings, e.g., the VMAWL includes the lemma benefit (v.). As AWP cannot distinguish between benefits (v. conjugated in the third person singular) and benefits (n., plural), any occurrences of the latter might skew the coverage statistics. The same issue arises when gerunds used as nouns are considered, as AWP will not discriminate between breeding $\mathsf { \bar { v } } .$ in a continuous tense) and breeding (a gerund used as an object). Unlike Arndt’s (2022) study, however, no changes occurred to the adjectives and adverbs in the VMAWL. This secondary VMAWL iteration features a total of 1,427 tokens (807 headwords and 620 members). Finally, we ignored British spellings, just as Arndt (2022) did.

The profiling showed that the average coverage by the second iteration of the VMAWL (word types added) in the VMC is satisfyingly high ( $1 3 . 7 5 \%$ on average) and fairly consistent across the four parent categories, with much higher coverage than the AWL ( $3 . 4 2 \%$ on average) across all four levels (Table 9). This convincing evidence indicates that the VMAWL holds the quintessential vocabulary necessary for better VM literacy.

4.1.3. Coverage in random excerpts from articles from parent categories

To further validate the VMAWL and address the fourth precept in Brezina and Gablasova (2017), we analyzed randomly selected excerpts from the four VMC sub-corpora. The first random text was taken from the pre-clinic sub-corpus, as in Figure 1. The excerpt contained 33 types/617 tokens. The VMAWL coverage $( 1 5 . 4 0 \% )$ was almost twice that of the AWL $( 7 . 9 0 \% )$ while the GSL totalled $6 1 . 4 0 \%$ . With all the lists included, the total coverage could reach $8 4 . 7 0 \%$ , leaving $1 5 . 2 0 \%$ of all the words out, some of which seem to be author names, numbers, or abbreviations. Among these words are such highly technical pre-clinic words as radiating, encoding, or organically, and authoritative/stylistic usages such as leveraging $( \nu . ) ,$ heuristic (adj.), or complexification (n.), which did not satisfy frequency and dispersion criteria.

Figure 1. Screenshot showing the analysis run on the pre-clinic excerpt.

In Figure 2, the internal medicine sub-corpus, with 243 types/499 tokens, had a total text coverage of $9 1 . 7 0 \%$ . While the AWL covered only $4 . 6 0 \%$ , the VMAWL covered $12 \%$ , slightly lower by $3 . 4 0 \ \%$ . Numerical expressions and non-list words constituted $8 . 2 0 \%$ , revealing a potential deficit in lexical coverage due to dispersion and frequency criteria. Two solutions are proposed: 1) balance sub-corpora size or 2) review low-frequency tokens with expert guidance. The latter was not feasible in this study due to the volume of tokens and workload. Also, we chose not to interfere with the architecture of our corpus, relying solely on what AntCorGen yielded. New technology-related vocabulary from the last couple of decades is not represented in either the GSL or AWL (e.g., Internet, smartphone, email, website), so more up-to-date lists might be a better option as defaults for lexical profiling.

In Figure 3, the zootechnics excerpt had a VMAWL coverage of $2 0 . 1 0 \%$ , higher than its $8 . 3 5 \%$ representation in the VMC (Table 3). Zootechnics, intersecting with all veterinary sub-disciplines, showed greater alignment with the VMAWL. Articles in this category featured fewer numerical expressions, influencing the higher coverage. While detailed sub-lists for each subcorpus are possible, practical considerations guided our approach.

Figure 4. Screenshot showing the analysis run on the veterinary diseases excerpt.

Lastly, an excerpt from the veterinary diseases sub-corpus (Figure 4) revealed that, despite its higher word count, VMAWL coverage was similar to at $1 4 . 5 0 \%$ . Cumulatively, the average lexical coverage of four randomly selected texts was $1 5 . 5 0 \%$ , closely aligning with $1 3 . 7 5 \ \%$ coverage of the VMC we achieved with the second iteration of the VMAWL. Considering the importance of academic vocabulary for overall academic literacy (Coxhead and Byrd, 2007), we argue that this validation of VMAWL reinforces its significance for VM academic literacy. Therefore, the familiarity with VMAWL, alongside basic/general lists, (e.g., GSL, NGSL, or AWL), is likely to facilitate veterinary readers/writers’ (especially novice ones’) cognitive engagement with veterinary academic texts regarding comprehension and production.

# 5. Conclusion and implications

Our attempt to establish an academic word list for VM based on high impact VM RAs began with compiling a corpus, the VMC (approximately 8,000,000 tokens), using the automatic corpus-generating tool, AntCorGen. To get a balanced and representative VMC iteration, we had to consult experts to re-categorize articles, unincorporating problematic and irrelevant ones where necessary, and create new categories unavailable in the machine-generated draft. This helped us tackle reliability issues and produce a justified list of P-lemmas significant for academic prose in VM.

Despite several attempts to create general and academic word lists, even discipline-specific ones (e.g., EAWL for economics, O’Flynn, 2019; MAWL for medicine Wang et al., 2008; NAWL for nursing, Yang, 2015), the veterinary field has not received sufficient attention. To the best of our knowledge, the VMAWL is the only justified academic word list for veterinary medicine. The analysis showed that the VMAWL includes 835 P-lemmas covering $1 1 . 9 2 \%$ (with raw P-lemma frequencies) of the VMC on its own and $1 3 . 7 5 \ \%$ on average when word types are added. Following the argument by Wingrove (2022), the VMAWL can be treated as a ‘ruler’ to measure the ‘table’, that is, the VMC. It can also function as a departure point for EAP/ESP practitioners, who are outsiders, to design syllabi and develop teaching materials. By frontloading the essential veterinary vocabulary from the VMAWL, EAP/ESP practitioners can engage learners with authentic language in VM with hands-on and autonomous data-driven learning (DDL) activities. As we do not expect the VMAWL to be used in EAP treatment with complete beginners, or sophomores, the existing lexicon of learners can function as a springboard for them when interacting with VMAWL-loaded VM texts. For this reason, theoretically, knowledge of GSL and AWL words along with VMAWL words can give a lexical coverage as high as $8 1 \ \%$ . Additionally, profiled against randomly selected excerpts from the corpus (i.e., Figure 3), we found that the VMAWL grants a significantly better coverage than generic lists. Thus, specified academic word lists can boost familiarity with lexis in a field more than a generic list with a multi-disciplinary vocabulary pool.

Considering frequency bands and implicational scaling, coverage by only Bands 1 and 2 are twice that by the AWL, indicating that targeting these bands for teaching veterinary literacy could be significant. Even with the low-frequency, narrowly distributed veterinary vocabulary items from lower bands (e.g., centrifugation, husbandry, gastrointestinal; Supplementary Material-D), users could have an opportunity to examine and practice specialized vocabulary unique in their field. We maintain that the VMAWL will substantially contribute to academic practices in VM with a sufficiently thorough account of essential veterinary vocabulary.

Often referred to by mainstream publishers, generic word lists like the AWL can form the foundation for academic literacy; however, our calculations show that a specified word list with discipline-specific frequency values mapping the lexical territory is necessary for veterinary EAP. We believe that the VMAWL not only provides veterinary practitioners and professionals (i.e., researchers, syllabus and material designers) with a chance to incorporate applicable academic words into academic reading or writing activities, but also greatly contributes to the teaching of discipline-specific vocabulary in different contexts (i.e., English for veterinary purposes–EVP).

EAP/ESP content and syllabus developers may find the VMAWL a useful resource for teaching specified vocabulary and developing teaching materials as a springboard for English for academic purposes. Elevating learners’ level of reading comprehension might eventually help them improve as academic authors and give them potential skills and literacy in the target genre. The list may also form the foundation for vocabulary practice through hands-on DDL, fostering self-directed autonomous learning.

# 6. Limitations and future research

We are aware of the fact that our analyses focused on two criteria, i.e., frequency and dispersion, but did not delve into the nuances of word usages leading to disciplinary variation with high-frequency words from the GSL. To avoid overcrowding in the VMAWL, we chose to disregard potentially familiar lexis to the target audience of the VMAWL by manually eliminating the GSL words and proper nouns. Therefore, one can argue that it could impact on the comprehensiveness of the VMAWL, owing to neglecting certain domain-specific words with disciplinary prominence that appear in the GSL.

Finally, we are aware that further effort is needed to attain a deeper understanding of the veterinary English vocabulary. Considering that the VMC may not encompass the whole spectrum of topics/areas in the field, a larger corpus containing other genres and registers representing veterinary language could help test and recheck the VMAWL coverage and validate its effectiveness. Further investigation might be crucial to document how VMAWL words collocate with other words or which formulaic language is present, since it is clear that knowing individual words does not guarantee mastering embedding them into lexical sequences, which could provide a broader lexical panorama of VM. Exploration of the VMC sub-corpora to generate sub-lists and gauging them against the VMC might offer deeper insights. With this in mind, the VMC sub-corpora could be explored from a sub-segmental and a sub-disciplinary perspective to gain newer knowledge on the veterinary English for pedagogical purposes.
