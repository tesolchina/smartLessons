Developing discursive competence in informational writing during K-12 education is an important preparation for academic writing in college and beyond. This study examines school children's use of nounsda powerful grammatical resource for making meaning in academic and disciplinary contextsdin informational writing. Approximately 200 students in third, fifth, seventh, and ninth grades were asked to write an informational text on a familiar topic of interest. The writing corpus was first coded for presence of nouns and for holistic quality. These nouns were then analyzed for their lexical, syntactic, and semantic complexities. Statistical analyses yielded the following results: (a) the children scored low on all measures of nominal complexities; (b) there was a clear developmental trend toward greater nominal complexities across grades; (c) older children scored higher on holistic rating and used a higher percentage of complex nouns than did younger children, although both relied heavily on nouns without any modification or nouns with only one premodifier; and (d) nominal complexity measures significantly predicted the holistic quality of informational writing. These results were interpreted in light of the research literature on language/literacy learning and the research context of the present study. Their implications for academic writing research and instruction were also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Informational writing is a type of nonfiction whose primary purpose is to present factual information on a topic (Duke, 2014). It is a macrogenre emphasized in the U.S. Common Core State Standards (NGA & CCSSO, 2010) and has received a considerable amount of attention in K-12 literacy education (e.g., Donovan & Smolkin, 2011; Maloch & Bomer, 2013). This interest was stimulated in part by the growing recognition that experience with and competence in informational writing are vital to academic writing success in college and beyond. Despite this interest, very little is known about how children’s competence in informational writing develops in K-12 contexts, for much of this research focused on one grade level at a time and was descriptive in nature (e.g., Avalos, Zisselsberger, Gort, & Secada, 2017; Seah, Clarke, & Hart, 2015; Wollman-Bonilla, 2000). Moreover, while this body of work has examined the lexical and grammatical resources that children use to instantiate the genre, few focused specifically on nominal expressions, i.e., nouns and noun phrases, arguably the most powerful grammatical resource for making meaning in academic and disciplinary contexts (Biber & Gray, 20016; Fang, 2021; Fang,

Schleppegrell, & Cox, 2006; Halliday & Martin, 1993). Our cross-sectional study was designed to fill these gaps by investigating the use of nominal resources in school children’s informational writing across four grade levels. Specifically, we examined the nominal expressions used by third, fifth, seventh, and ninth grade students in their informational writing. An understanding of how nominal complexity develops in school children’s informational writing can inform future efforts to promote language learning and support academic writing development among students in disciplinary contexts.

# 2. Theoretical and empirical perspectives

# 2.1. Nouns: structure and function

Nouns are often defined as words (except pronouns) that refer to people (e.g., Drew Brees, doctor), animals (e.g., alligators, crow), places (e.g., Boston, playground), things (e.g., grass, book), ideas (e.g., justice, policy), actions (e.g., distillation, swimming), or qualities (e.g., similarity, toughness). There are many different kinds of nouns, including concrete nouns (e.g., desk, fruits), proper nouns (e.g., Christmas, Prince Harry), technical nouns (trachea, polygon), abstract nouns (e.g., deforestation, frequency), and noun phrases (e.g., a long, hollow glass tube with lenses at both ends that make faraway objects appear larger and closer; the unprecedented global search conducted by scientists for an effective treatment targeting the novel coronavirus). A simple noun (e.g., tube, search) can be expanded into a noun phrase, also called a nominal group (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014), through addition of one or more modifiers that include.

demonstrative pronoun (e.g., that picture, these problems),   
 determiner (e.g., some trees, all people, their efforts),   
 possessive noun (e.g., people’s lives, caribou’s survival),   
numeral or ordinal (e.g., four trips, fourth trip),   
 attributive or participial (-ed/-ing) adjective (e.g., the unprecedented global search, a running shoe, a surprised look),   
noun (e.g., chicken hamburger, emergency calls, glass tube, migration routes, surface crack),   
 appositive (e.g., Lemmings, small rodents about the size of a fist, also go on journeys every year. The daughter of a successful grocer, Alice Hamilton chose medicine as a career.),   
restrictive relative clause (e.g., the same paths that earlier herds have taken in previous years),   
participle (-ed/-ing) clause (e.g., treatment targeting the novel coronavirus, the search conducted by scientists),   
 complement clause (e.g., the belief that the dead are powerless, the fact that our team won last night),   
 prepositional phrase (e.g., the grasslands of East Africa, females without offspring),   
 comparative clause (e.g., a larger mammal than most people think, very distinct features compared to other animals),   
infinitive (e.g., a task force to fight the pandemic crisis, the ability to survive the blizzard), and   
 adverb (e.g., a long time ago, a dozen feet high)

When a simple noun is expanded into a noun phrase, the original noun is called the “head” and other constituents within the noun phrase are called “modifiers”. Modifiers that come before the head are called premodifiers and those appearing after the head are called postmodifiers. A noun phrase can be short and simple, as in one tube and narrow tubes. It can also be long and complex, as the following example shows:

an immediate rescue measure that is worth at least \$538 billion. [determiner][adjective] [noun] [head] [restrictive relative clause] drawn up last week by the finance ministers from the European Union. [participle clause] [adverb] [prepositional phrase] [prepositional phrase] to prevent mass layoffs.   
[infinitive]

From a functional linguistics perspective (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014), nominal expressions are grammatical participants in a text, serving as actor, goal, senser, sayer, recipient, behaver, scope, range, phenomenon, circumstance, or other semantic roles. They present the content, or the experiential meaning, of the text, functioning as subject, object, or complement in a clause. They also convey authorial attitudes (e.g., affect, judgment, appreciation), presenting the interpersonal meaning of the text. Additionally, they construct the textual meaning, helping facilitate the discursive flow of the text. They contribute to building the texture of a text by referring to something in the situational context, summarizing previously presented information for further discussion, or foreshadowing the upcoming information. These three functionsdexperiential, interpersonal, and textualdcan be illustrated with a brief excerpt below from an informational text written by an award-winning children’s book author Gail Gibbons (1998, p. 2).

A bald eagle isn’t bald. Its name comes from balde, an old English word meaning “white.” With its gleaming white head and tail feathers, the bald eagle cannot be mistaken for any other bird. It belongs to the group of eagles called fish and sea eagles that lives near water and eats mostly fish and water birds.

In this example, nominal expressions of varying complexities (underlined) are used, some simple and others more complex. The noun phrase, a bald eagle, introduces the grammatical participant that becomes the topic of the discussion in the paragraph. The possessive in the noun phrase its name refers back to a bald eagle in the preceding sentence. The noun phrase an old English word meaning “white” is an appositive that provides more information about the noun (balde) before it. The appositive itself contains a head (word), which is modified by a determiner (an), an attributive adjective (old), a noun (English), and a participle clause (meaning “white”). The noun phrase its gleaming white head and tail feathers contains a participial adjective (gleaming) that presents a positive evaluation of the bald eagle’s head. The long noun phrase, the group of eagles called fish and sea eagles that lives near water and eats mostly fish and water birds, packs a heavy load of information about the bald eagle through the use of a participle clause (called fish and sea eagles) and a restrictive relative clause (that lives near water and eats mostly fish and water birds). Together, the nouns and noun phrases in the passage enable the author to present key pieces of information about the bald eagle.

# 2.2. Nouns and literacy learning

As the above example shows, in writing (i.e., developing a text), authors depend on nominal expressions to introduce participants, maintain reference to the participants, infuse judgment on the participants, pack information to elaborate on the participants, and distill what has been written for further discussion (Fang, 2021; Fang et al., 2006). At the same time, authors also use nominal expressions in different ways according to the purpose and context of writing (Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Fang & Schleppegrell, 2008; Jiang & Hyland, 2018; Unsworth, 1999). In other words, patterns of nominal expressions vary across different genres, registers, or contexts. For example, in narrative writing, simple nouns are often used to introduce and track participants. In informational writing, nominal expressions of varying complexitiesdparticularly technical nouns, abstract nouns, and complex noun phrases with pre/post-modificationsdare used to construe technicality, density, generalization, agency, abstraction, and stance. In history, nominal expressions are often used to refer to specific historical figures (e.g., Abraham Lincoln, Emmett Till), to create institutional abstractions (e.g., government, laws), to present interpretations that infuse judgment (e.g., the grisly open-casket photo of Emmett, a racist act, the Boston Massacre), and to bundle a sequence of historical events into an abstract entity (e.g., the Renaissance, the Cultural Revolution). In science, nominal expressions enable the author to, among other things, create technical taxonomies (e.g., mitosis, meiosis), expand information (e.g., a set of enzymes that attach to the cyclin, a malignant growth resulting from uncontrolled cell division), and develop a chain of logical reasoning (e.g., Cancer is a malignant growth resulting from uncontrolled cell division. This loss of control may be caused by environmental factors.). In mathematics, nominal expressions are used to construe mathematical concepts and processes (e.g., the sum of the squares of the lengths of legs a and b, the height and the volume of a regular hexagonal pyramid with lateral edges 10 ft and base edges 6 ft).

In academic and disciplinary contexts, nominal expressions take on particular functional loads, as they enable the author to create referential chains, distill concrete experiences, compact discrete pieces of information, and establish cohesive linkages within a text (Fang, 2021; Fang & Schleppegrell, 2008). According to Biber and Gray (2011), academic writing has developed, over the past 150 years, a grammatical style that relies heavily on nominal expressions and phrasal modifications. Specifically, in contrast to conversation and popular written registers (e.g., fiction), academic writing is “characterized by an extremely dense use of non-clausal phrases and extremely complex noun phrase structures, while there is comparatively little structural elaboration that involves embedded dependent clauses as clause constituents” (Biber & Gray, 2011, p. 226). As a result, modern academic writing is better described as ‘compressed’ rather than ‘elaborated’, characterized generally by the relative absence of verbs and clausal modification and by the high density of phrasal modifiers.

Five grammatical devices have been found to be especially important in the development of this compact discourse style. They are (1) nominalizations (e.g., treatment, condensation), (2) attributive and participial adjectives (e.g., the vast wooded area), (3) nouns as nominal premodifiers (e.g., witness protection programs), (4) prepositional phrases as nominal postmodifiers (e.g., a high degree of autonomy in the region), and (5) appositive noun phrases (e.g., Caribou, the same kind of animals that are pictured pulling Santa Claus’s Christmas sled, are wild reindeer.). These ‘written’ grammatical characteristics have all emerged in academic and informational writing. Their emergence is likely indicative of the communicative demands for tighter texture and greater economy of expression in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2011).

From these perspectives, then, learning to write in academic contexts entails learning to use nominal expressions in genrespecific, register-appropriate, and discipline-legitimated ways. Because nominal expressions are a major grammatical resource for making meaning in academic, especially informational, writing, proficiency in using them is of particular significance and consequence for success in disciplinary learning and academic communication. In fact, nominal expressions have been found to be “a viable diagnostic of developing syntax and of text construction abilities across genres and modalities” (Ravid & Berman, 2010, p. 21).

# 2.3. Research on noun use in school children’s writing

In light of the prominent role nominal expressions play in academic and informational writing, it is especially important to investigate students’ competence in using them. Despite their centrality, nominal expressions have rarely been a focus of research on students’ academic writing, particularly in K-12 contexts. Although there have been many corpus-based studies of academic writing that examined noun use, most of these studies focused on either metadiscursive nouns (e.g., fact, belief, mystery) or syntactic complexity, and they typically involved college students or disciplinary experts (e.g., Charles, 2003; Jiang & Hyland, 2018; Lu, 2011). We were able to locate only three empirical studies of student writing that made nominal expressions the exclusive focus of investigation, and only one of them involved K-12 pupils.

One of the three studies was conducted by Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) at the postgraduate level in New Zealand. The study compared the use of noun modifiers in 21 argumentative essays on nuclear energy written by 21 international students enrolled in a content-based English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program and in 16 reading responses to various applied linguistics topics written by 16 international students enrolled in an MA program (TESOL). Both pieces of writing were untimed and assigned as part of their regular coursework. Over a dozen of different noun modifiers were examined, including attributive and participial adjectives as premodifiers, possessive nouns as premodifiers, nouns as premodifiers, embedded clauses as postmodifiers, prepositional phrases as post-modifiers, non-finite clauses as postmodifiers, appositive phrases, infinitives as postmodifiers, and complement clauses. These modifiers were rankeddbased on Biber, Gray, & Poonpon (2011)din hypothesized, coarse-grained developmental stages according to their order of acquisition by native English speakers, with the later acquired features considered more complex or advanced than the earlier acquired features. The researchers found that (a) as a whole, the two groups of students (MA vs EAP) drew more heavily on simple noun modifiers (e.g., attributive adjectives) than on complex noun modifiers (e.g., nouns and participles as premodifiers, appositives), (b) the more language-proficient group (MA students) drew more heavily on complex nominal modifiers such as nouns as premodifiers and prepositional phrases as postmodifiers, and (c) the less proficient group (EAP students) drew more heavily on simple modifiers such as attributive adjectives as premodifiers and embedded clauses as postmodifiers.

Similarly, Ansarifar, Shahriari, and Pishghadam (2018) compared the modification features of noun phrases in over 300 abstracts written by master-level (MA) L1 Persian writers, doctoral-level (PhD) L1 Persian writers, and published writers from the field of applied linguistics. They found that (a) the use of phrasal nominal modifiers, particularly attributive adjectives and nouns as premodifiers and prepositional phrases as postmodifiers, is a common feature in the writing of all three groups; (b) the MA students used significantly fewer nouns as premodifiers, -ed participles as postmodifiers, adjective-noun sequences as premodifiers, and multiple prepositional phrases as postmodifiers than did expert writers; and (c) the PhD students used significantly fewer multiple prepositional phrases as noun postmodifiers than did expert writers. The researchers concluded that while their data showed a tendency towards greater use of phrasal constructions by more experienced writers, these data did not support the exact predicted sequence of development hypothesized by Biber et al. (2011). They further suggested that a re-consideration may be needed of the features (e.g., -ed/-ing participles) associated with different developmental stages.

Another study, by Ravid and Berman (2010), examined noun phrase (NP) complexity in the oral and written narratives and expositions produced by 96 monolingual, native speakers of Israeli Hebrew and of California English from well-educated backgrounds in four equal groups of 12 students each: fourth grade (aged 9e10), seventh grade (aged 12e13), eleventh grade (aged 16e17), and graduate school (ages 20e30). NP complexity was measured by (a) length in words, (b) semantic complexity of head, (c) quality and number of modifiers, (d) syntactic depth, and (e) syntactic variability. The students watched the same short video film without words depicting unresolved situations of conflict in a school setting. They were then asked to write and tell a story about an incident where they had been involved in a situation of ‘problems between people’ (i.e., spoken and written narratives) and to write a composition and give a talk discussing the ideas on the topic of ‘problems between people’ (i.e., spoken and written expositions). The researchers found a clear and consistent developmental increment in NP complexity across the age groups (particularly from age 16 onward) and greater use of syntactically more complex nominal structures in written expository texts than in other production modes across both languages. Specifically, there is “an across-the-board age-related increase in NP complexity along with a rise in clausal complexity, with both developments being most marked in late adolescence” (p. 17). This trend interacts with genre (narrative vs. expository) and modality (oral vs. written), with written expository texts being more syntactically complex than oral texts and narratives. It is also consistently more pronounced in Hebrew, which showed greater NP complexity than English.

Taken together, these studies suggest that as students advance in schooling or become more proficient in language, the nominal expressions they use become more complex. This finding must be interpreted with caution because the studies involved a small sample size and/or a relatively homogeneous (e.g., L2, adult) sample. There is clearly a need for more research on the use of nominal expressions by K-12 children, who are in the process of developing language and literacy proficiency to be college and career ready, where demands for academic and informational writing intensify. Our study built on and extended this very small body of work by examining nominal complexities in the informational texts composed by third, fifth, seventh, and ninth grade students. It addressed the following four research questions:

Q1: What nominal resources did the school children use in their informational writing? Q2: Were there significant differences in the complexity of these nominal resources among different grade levels?

 Q3: Were there significant differences in the holistic rating scores of informational writing among different grade levels? and Q4: What were the contributions of nominal complexity measures to the holistic rating scores of informational writing?

Answers to these questions can provide a developmental view of school children’s control over nominal resources for informational writing and inform future efforts to design curriculum and instruction that improve students’ literacy performance and prepare them for academic writing success in secondary and post-secondary contexts.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Setting and participants

The study was conducted in a K-12 public school located in a small southeastern U.S. city. The school had an enrollment of just over 1000 students, with roughly 350 in grades K-5, 330 in grades 6e8, and 500 in grades 9e12. The demographics of the overall student population at the school were as follows: gender $5 0 \%$ male, $5 0 \%$ female), race $5 5 \%$ White, $2 7 \%$ Black, $1 3 \%$ Hispanic/Latino, and $5 \%$ Others), and family income $31 \%$ on free/reduced price school lunch).

Literacy instruction for each grade level in the school was generally guided by a core commercial program that explicitly addressed pertinent state standards and claimed to be evidence-based, although teachers were also encouraged to supplement the program with additional resources that they found relevant and would improve their students’ preparedness for high-stakes state tests. In grades K-5, students focused on learning the foundational skills and strategies in reading and writing. In grades 6e8, students focused on young adult and classical literature combined with real world issues. In grades 9e12, students engaged with integrated curricular units that combined literary studies with social studies.

A total of 194 students from four grade levels (third, fifth, seventh, and ninth)dtwo intact classes per grade leveldparticipated in the study. These students were part of a larger sample that participated in a project that examined K-12 children’s language and literacy development. The demographic distribution of the current sample in terms of grade level, gender, race, and family income is presented in Table 1. Our choice of the four grade levels was intentional, as each grade level represents a significant transition point in students’ schooling experience. Third grade is generally considered the end of the basic literacy acquisition period that typically begins in Kindergarten. Fifth grade signals the last year of elementary schooling before students transition to middle school. Seventh grade represents the mid-point of middle school education, where the focus of learning is shifting to content areas and away from literacy. Ninth grade is the beginning of high school education, when students are required to read and write much more complex texts for disciplinary learning. Thus, a focus on these four grade levels allows us to gain a developmental perspective on children’s literacy progression across key moments of their school learning from mid-childhood to mid-adolescence, a period of schooling that has received relatively less attention in literacy research.

# 3.2. Data collection

Data were collected from 8 participating classes (2 per grade level) during one of their English Language Arts (ELA) class periods towards the end of the Fall semester. The order for collecting data was “counter-balanced” (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2006) across the four grade levels. Students were asked by their ELA teacher to assume the role of a scientist author and write an informational report about crocodilians (alligators or crocodiles) for their uninformed peers in another state. A picture book (Blake, 1996) was used as a stimulus for the writing task. The 24-page picture book presents factual information about crocodilians with respect to their origin, physical characteristics (e.g., alligators vs crocodiles), habitats, hunting habits, reproduction, and protection. All words in the bookdincluding title, author, table of contents, captions, and indexdhad been removed so that only pictures were left on each page of the book. The book was chosen because it dealt with a topic that was familiar and of interest to students, who lived in a city known for its abundance of alligators and had learned about the reptile in their school curriculum as well as in informal settings. The prompt-based writing task was not unfamiliar to students, as it resembled many other writing assignments they had become accustomed to doing in school in preparation for high stakes district or state writing assessments. All students responded to the same prompt and completed their writing within $4 5 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ .

# 3.3. Data analysis

Two types of analysis were conducted with the writing corpus: linguistic analysis and statistical analysis. For linguistic analysis, we first generated word count (i.e., number of running words per text) through Microsoft Word program to capture the amount of writing in each text. We then rated each text holistically for its overall quality in terms of content (1e6), organization (1e6), and fluency (1e6), with 1 being the lowest and 6 being the highest. This means each text scored a minimum of 3 points and a maximum of 18 points for its holistic quality. The rating scale was adapted from the 6-traits writing rubric, an instrument for evaluating student writing popular among K-12 teachers in the U.S.

Next, we constructed a multidimensional set of six measures to assess the lexical, semantic, and syntactic complexities of nominal expressions in each text. These measures were Length, Abstraction, Density, Quality, Variety, and Sophistication. Their development was guided primarily by prior work in functional linguistics (e.g., Fang, 2014; Fang, 2021; Fang et al., 2006; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Martin, 2010), but also took into consideration related work in psycholinguistics (e.g., Ravid & Berman, 2010) and corpus linguistics (e.g., Biber et al., 2011). Specifically, we found Biber’s discussion of different types of phrasal modifications and his hypothesized developmental stages of phrasal complexity instructive. This work, together with the work of child language researchers Ravid and Berman and our own prior work, helped us conceptualize and operationalize a new set of nominal complexity measures, which are described below. A total of 5475 nominal expressions (nouns and noun phrases) were analyzed in the study.

All linguistic analyses were conducted manually by a research team consisting of two advanced doctoral students and one senior faculty, all trained in systemic functional linguistics (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004) and specializing in language and literacy education. Each week, each member of the research team coded the same 20e25 texts independently and then met as a group to compare and discuss their codings. The overall interrater agreement rate was roughly $8 9 \%$ , ranging from a low of $8 2 \%$ for Abstraction and a high of $1 0 0 \%$ for Length. Disagreements were resolved through discussion in light of each textual context and relevant prior theoretical and empirical work. Notes were taken of key issues that arose during coding and final decisions rendered after discussion so as to ensure consistency throughout the scoring process.

Length. One measure of nominal complexity is Length, that is, the number of words per nominal expression (Fang, 2014; Halliday & Martin, 1993; Ravid & Berman, 2010). Each nominal expression was rated on a scale of 1e4. Nominal expressions with 1e3 words were considered short in length and thus given a score of 1. Those with 4e6 words were rated 2 (low medium), and those with 7e9 words were rated 3 (high medium). Nominal expressions with 10 or more words were considered long and rated 4. For example, one of the most interesting animals was rated 2 because it consists of 6 words, and some alligator farms where alligators are raised to be killed for food and their skin was given a score of 4 because it contains 15 words.

Abstraction. Another measure of nominal complexity is the degree of abstraction of the head of a nominal expression (Fang, 2020; Martin, 2010; Ravid & Berman, 2010). The head is the central part of a nominal expression to which other grammatical elements (i.e., modifiers) are added. It contains arguably the most important information in the expression. The head of each nominal expression was rated on a scale of 1e4, with 1 referring to everyday concrete things (e.g., apple, alligator, bottle, anvil), 2 to generic or semiotic abstractions (e.g., color, time, manner, type; fact, idea, notion), 3 to institutional or technical abstractions (e.g., regulation, policy, reptile, mitosis), and 4 to metaphoric abstractions (e.g., strength, bravery, collision, departure).

Density. Density measures the informational load in a nominal expression (Fang, 2014; Fang et al., 2006; Halliday & Martin, 1993). It was calculated by counting the number of content words per noun. Content words include nouns (e.g., alligator), most adjectives (e.g., large), verbs (e.g., breathe), numerals (e.g., three), ordinals (e.g., third), and most adverbs (e.g., frequently). Grammatical words were not counted; they include auxiliary verbs (e.g., can, be), some adjectives (e.g., many, most), some adverbs (e.g., really, very), prepositions (e.g., in, of), conjunctions (e.g., because, and), and pronouns (which, those). The Density scores for one of the most interesting animals and some alligator farms where alligators are raised to be killed for food and their skin are 3 and 7, respectively, because there are 3 content words (one, interesting, animals) in the first noun phrase and 7 content words (alligator, farms, alligators, raised, killed, food, skin) in the second.

Quality. This index measures the quality of content words within a nominal expression, including its head (Ravid & Berman, 2010). Each content word in the nominal expression was rated, and an average score across all content words was then computed. Specifically, content words were divided into three tiers based on the work of literacy scholars (e.g., Beck, McKeown, & Kucan, 2002), who determined the tier to which a word belongs based on its frequency of use, complexity, and meaning. Tier I words, rated 1, consist of basic vocabulary words that are used in children’s everyday lifeworld. Tier II words, rated 2, consist of general academic vocabulary. These are words that are utilized across a wide range of topics and in many curriculum content areas. Tier III words, rated 3, consist of vocabulary words that are highly specific to a particular discipline. They rarely occur outside of disciplinary contexts. The Quality score for the noun phrase some alligator farms where alligators are raised to be killed for food and their skin is $( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) / 7 = 1$ because the seven content words are all Tier I words.

Variety. Variety refers to the number of different pre- and postmodifiers used in a nominal expression (Biber & Gray, 2011; Fang et al., 2006; Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004; Ravid & Berman, 2010). Possible premodifiers include demonstrative, determiner (excluding a/an and the), possessive noun, numeral/ordinal, attributive adjective, participial adjective, noun, and appositive. Possible postmodifiers include restrictive relative clause, prepositional phrase, participle clause, comparative clause, appositive, infinitive, and adverb. Each modifier was awarded one point. For example, some alligator farms where alligators are raised to be killed for food and their skin contains two types of premodifier (i.e., determiner: some; noun: alligator) and three types of postmodifier (i.e., restrictive relative clause: where alligators are raised; infinitive: to be killed; prepositional phrase: for food and their skin). It was thus given a score of 5 for Variety.

Sophistication. Modifiers were also rated for their level of sophistication (Biber et al., 2011; Ravid & Berman, 2010). Modifiers with higher scores are more typical of academic prose and generally acquired later in language learning. Premodifiers such as determiner, demonstrative, possessive pronoun, numeral/ordinal, and attributive adjective were rated 1. Premodifiers such as participial adjective and possessive noun were rated 2. Noun as premodifier was rated 3, and appositive as premodifier was rated 4. For postmodifiers, restrictive relative clause and adverb were rated 1, prepositional phrase and participle clause were rated 2, infinitive and comparative clause were rated 3, and complement clause and appositive were rated 4. Each type of pre- or postmodifiers was rated and an average score was computed for all types of modifiers within the nominal expression. For example, the five types of modifier in some alligator farms where alligators are raised to be killed for food and their skin were rated 1 (determiner), 3 (noun), 1 (restrictive relative clause), 3 (infinitive), and 2 (prepositional phrase), resulting in a Sophistication score of 2, or $( 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 ) / 5$ , for the nominal expression.

Profile. A total score was calculated for each nominal expression by adding up the six indices above. This is the Profile score, which can be considered a summative measure of complexity for the nominal expression.

Finally, to answer the four research questions, we adopted a multipronged approach to statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were generated to answer Research Question $\# 1 .$ . To answer Research Question $\# 2$ , we first conducted multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on the seven nominal complexity measures (Length, Abstraction, Density, Quality, Variety, Sophistication, Profile). MANOVA was preferred over a series of analysis of variance (ANOVA) because (a) the dependent variables are significantly correlated, and (b) MANOVA reduces the likelihood of Type I error and is more robust to nonnormality of dependent variables. We also conducted multivariate analysis of co-variance (MANCOVA) on the same seven dependent measures to control for the effect of Word Count (i.e., amount of writing). Prior to performing MANOVA or MANCOVA, variables were transformed to eliminate outliers. For Research Question #3, we first conducted ANOVA to examine the effect of grade level on holistic rating scores. We also conducted ANCOVA to account for the effect of Word Count. For Research Question $\# 4$ , we first computed Pearson Product-Moment correlations between holistic rating scores and nominal complexity measures. Then, we conducted standard multiple regression to estimate the contributions of nominal complexity measures to holistic rating scores.

# 4. Results

Our cross-sectional study explored the lexical, semantic, and syntactic complexities of nominal expressions third, fifth, seventh, and ninth-grade children used in their informational writing. Because of the number of variables involved in this investigation, our analysis was deliberately confined to the internal structure and content of nominal expressions, without attention to their grammatical functions or semantic roles, which is part of our goals in the larger research project. The means and standard deviations of nominal complexity measures, holistic rating scores, and word count are presented in Table 2. As can be seen from the table, the children, regardless of grade level, scored between 1.0 and 2.0 on four nominal complexity measures (Length, Abstraction, Density, and Quality) and between 0 and 1.0 on the other two measures (Variety and Sophistication).

Table 3 lists the frequencies and percentages of different nominal structures in the corpus. As is clear from this table, nouns without any modification (NS1) constituted roughly half of all nominal expressions used by the children, ranging from a low of $4 1 . 4 0 \%$ in third grade to a high of $5 5 . 5 3 \%$ in fifth grade. About $3 0 \%$ of all nominal expressions used were those with only one premodifier (NS2). Nouns with two premodifiers (NS3) were used in more than $6 \%$ of nominal expressions, ranging from a low of less than $3 \%$ for seventh grade to a high of $1 6 \%$ for third grade. Third grade students also used a much higher percentage of nouns with three premodifiers (NS4) than did students in any of the other grades. On the other hand, children in higher grades used a higher percentage of nouns with one postmodifier (NS5), nouns with one premodifier and one postmodifier (NS8), nouns with one premodifier and two postmodifiers (NS9), and nouns with two premodifiers and one postmodifier (NS11). Other nominal structures were, regardless of grade level, few and far between, including NS7 (nouns with three postmodifiers), NS10 (nouns with one premodifier and three postmodifiers), NS12 (nouns with two premodifiers and two postmodifiers), NS13 (nouns with two premodifiers and three postmodifiers), NS14 (nouns with one premodifier and four postmodifiers), NS15 (nouns with four postmodifiers), and NS16 (nouns with three premodifiers and two postmodifiers).

Note: The frequencies in this table are raw frequency counts, and the percentages are the ratios of each nominal structure over the total nominal expressions used in the grade-level corpus. As such, these numbers say little about whether or not the children’s actual use of nominal expressions, or of particular nominal structures, increased over time relative to the total number of words produced.

As a whole, longer, more complex nominal expressions, especially those with postmodifiers or both pre- and posmodifiers, were more commonly found in the texts written by older children (notably seventh and ninth graders) than in the texts written by younger children (third and fifth graders), although nouns of varying complexities were observed in each of the four grade levels. Table 4 presents some examples of nominal expressions (NS1-NS16) to show the range of complexities in the nominal resources used by the children in our study. Table 5 presents four representative writing samples from the corpus to give a flavor of the sort of nominal expressions (italicized) commonly used by the children in each grade level.

As can be seen in Tables 4 and 5, the heads of the nominal expressions are predominantly concrete nouns (e.g., alligators, jaws, animals, coast, log), although there are also a fairly decent number of semiotic/generic abstractions (e.g., symbol, fact, pounds, colors, temperature, texture, size, time) and metaphoric abstractions (e.g., difference, ability, sight, tendency, descriptions, ease, conclusion) that serve as heads. Likewise, content words in the nominal expressions are mostly Tier I (everyday) vocabulary words (e.g., skin, water, clear, thick, nasty, lay, learn, live), although there are also many Tier II (general academic) vocabulary words (e.g., technique, tendency, characteristics, formation, intimidating, distinct, capable, territory, personality, unique, advantages) and some Tier III (specialist) terminology (e.g., reptiles, atmosphere, hides, reflexes, snouts, crocodilia, amphibious, carnivores, carcass, mechanism, cretaceous, paleontologists). As a whole, metaphoric abstractions, as well as Tier II and Tier III words, are more often observed in the texts written by students in seventh and ninth grades, although they are also present in some of the texts written by younger students (third and fifth graders).

A wide variety of modifiers were used by the children in the corpus. Premodifiers used include demonstrative pronouns (e.g., these reptiles, this awesome creature), determiners (e.g., their babies, some paleontologists), possessive nouns (e.g., America’s biggest reptile, a crocodile’s mouth, a turtle’s shell), numerals/ordinals (e.g., about 15 feet, 30 to 40 eggs, the first thing), attributive adjectives (e.g., very sharp teeth, a big ferocious lizard), participial adjectives (e.g., a hearing instrument, a stiffened log, threatened alligators, the same mothering technique, living examples of what ancient dinosaurs looked like), and nouns (e.g., a death roll, meat eaters, body temperature, captivity gators). For postmodifiers, the children used prepositional phrases (e.g., a hold on their prey, the destruction of the dinosaurs), adverbs (e.g., an alligator nearby, one of the most powerful animals on earth today), appositives (e.g., two species that we know of, the alligator and the crocodile), infinitives (e.g., the ability to eat many things, ferocious looking teeth to help chew up their meals), restrictive relative clauses (e.g., very powerful jaws that they used to clamp down on their prey), comparative clauses (e.g., a much longer and rounded off snout than the alligator does), participle clauses (e.g., the water pouring out of the pipe under the highway, a mascot for the team called the Florida Gators), and complement clauses (e.g., the proven fact that alligators can swim through the water at 21mph). It is important to note that (a) modifiers such as complement clause and appositive were used only sparingly; (b) some modifiers (e.g., infinitive, participle clause, possessive noun, participial adjective, comparative clause, adverb) were used much less frequently than were others (e.g., determiner, attributive adjective, prepositional phrase, and restrictive relative clause); and (c) the seldom or less commonly used modifying devices were more often found in the texts written by older students, most notably seventh and ninth graders.

Statistically significant results from grade-level comparisons are summarized in Table 6. More comprehensive results are reported below. Specifically, a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine grade-level differences in nominal complexity measures. MANOVA results revealed significant differences among the grades on the dependent variables [pillai’s trace $= 0 . 4 7 6$ , F (21, 558) ¼ 5.017, $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 5 9 ]$ . Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on each dependent variable as a follow-up test to MANOVA. Because seven single ANOVAs were performed, the significance level (0.05) was divided by 7, resulting in a new alpha of .007. Grade has a significant main effect on Length $[ \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 1 9 0 ) = 2 2 . 2 2 $ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 6 0 ]$ , Abstraction [F $( 3 , 1 9 0 ) = 1 1 . 4 2 0$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 5 3 ]$ , Density [F (3, $1 9 0 ) = 1 2 . 4 2 4$ , $ { \mathbf { p } } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 6 4 ]$ , Quality [ $\mathrm { F } \left( 3 , 1 9 0 \right) = 7 . 8 3 0$ , $ { \mathbf { p } } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 1 0 ]$ , Variety [ $\mathrm { F } \left( 3 , 1 9 0 \right) = 6 . 2 5 2$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 9 0 ]$ , and Profile [F $( 3 , 1 9 0 ) = 1 2 . 8 3 7$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 7 ]$ , but not Sophistication [F (3, $1 9 0 ) = 3 . 0 8 4 $ , ${ \bf p } = . 0 2 9$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 4 6 ]$ . The Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed (a) for Length, significant differences between third and fifth grades ${ \bf \tilde { p } } = . 0 3 6 )$ , between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between third and ninth grades $\left( \mathfrak { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between fifth and seventh grades $\mathbf { p } = . 0 2 1 $ ), and between fifth and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ ; (b) for Abstraction, significant differences between third and fifth grades $\mathbf { \rho } _ { \mathrm { { p } } } < . 0 0 1 )$ , between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , and between third and ninth grades $\mathbf { \vec { p } } = . 0 0 1 )$ ; (c) for Density, significant differences between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between third and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , and between fifth and ninth grades $\mathbf { \langle p = . 0 0 3 \rangle }$ ; (d) for Quality, significant differences between third and seventh grades ${ \bf \tilde { \Delta p } } = . 0 1 6 { \bf \Delta }$ , between third and ninth grades $\mathbf { \tilde { p } } = . 0 0 5 )$ , between fifth and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } = . 0 0 5 \right)$ , and between fifth and ninth grades $\mathbf { \vec { p } } = . 0 0 1$ ); (e) for Variety, significant differences between third and seventh grades ${ \bf \langle p = } . 0 1 4 { \bf \rangle }$ , and between third and ninth grades $\mathbf { \rho } _ { \mathrm { { p } } } < . 0 0 1 )$ ; (f) for Profile, significant differences between third and fifth grades ${ \bf \vec { p } } = . 0 2 9 )$ , between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between third and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , and between fifth and ninth grades $\left( \mathtt { p } = . 0 4 6 \right)$ .

Alligators have big large teeth. Crockidiles don&#x27;t have teeny teeth. Aligators carry their babies in their mouths.Alligators are related because they are both related to the crocodillians. Crocodillians are like ansisters to alligators and crocidilles. alligator has a very large mouth. Did you know that the egg the alligator lays is bigger than an egg fry. The white alligators are called albino.</td></tr><tr><td>Fifth Grade (Holistic Rating = 10)</td><td>Alligators can swim very fast and they live in lakes. Sometime alligators like to lok for food in the dark, they can also go on land. These are very sneaky and have very sharp teeth.Alligators liketo hide in the woods and they are also green. Alligators like to eat chickens, they can also be in groups. Alligators also eat big fish. They have very wide mouths to eat the fish with. They like to swim in a large groups and they like to lay down in the grass. lligators hatch from an egg and can walk over pile f stick. alligators also eat ittle lligators. Alligators get burried in the sand sometimes and can be 10 feet tall. Some alligator are killed for shoes and purses. Alligators like slimy water and can be different colors.</td></tr><tr><td>Seventh Grade (Holistic Rating = 13)</td><td>Aligators are really unique animals they have rough, bumpy skin. There body is wide and fat. There eyes look like marbles at night when you are hunting them. They have reall big teeth and a lot of them. The top ones hang over the bottom jaw. They lay on the banks to dry themselves. If they are in shawlow water and see pray they slowly move closer to the bank and snap there pray is gone in they matter of seconds. They eat mostly anything that they see, snakes, fish, birds, any kind of meat that is feed to them in a zoo. Aligators are hatched from eggs. When the mama alligator lays they eggs she gets a lot of dead grass rocks and twigs and covers them up. But also some are born in the water. When they babys are born and the mama needs to take them to the</td></tr><tr><td>Ninth Grade (Holistic Rating = 16)</td><td>water she carries the babies in her mouth. She has to be extra careful that she does not swallow one of them. Another thing that is cool is that they make purses, and any kind of thing that they could think of. Alligators are huge, monstorous animals with scaly bodies. Alligators have broad mouths and crocodiles have more narrow mouths. These creatures are very scaly and have really larg teeth. Alligators are creatures that can live on land or in the water. They&#x27;re teeth are like pointed daggers and can penetrate the flesh with ease. To begin with Alligators are fascinating and huge animals. Even when alligators are born they look intimidating and mean. An alligator&#x27;s eyes are on the side of they&#x27;re head and look really evil. The teeth of these ferocious creatures hangs over the cheek and it looks mean. They have jaws that can open really wide and swallow fish whole. These reptiles have rough leatherly skin with some bumps on their back. With their powerful legs and strong tail, these alligators are very powerful and can catch their prey easily.Alligators are very, very fast swimmers and can catch pretty much anything in the water, so I wouldn&#x27;t get caught in the water with an alligator. Lastly, Alligators and crocodiles are two different animals. Crocodiles have webbed feet and narrow mouths, alligators have wide, broad mouths and are fat. The bodies of these two are different. In conclusion, Alligators and crocodiles are very powerful, and intimidating creatures. If you look at them they can give you quite a scare. These guys have very fast swimming techniques and can catch their prey easily in the water.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note: ${ \bf G } =$ Grade Level.

Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was also performed to determine the effect of grade level on nominal complexity measures while controlling for word count (i.e., amount of writing). MANCOVA results revealed that the covariate (word count) significantly influenced the combined dependent variables [pillai’s trace $= 0 . 1 1$ , F $( 7 , 1 8 3 ) = 3 . 0 6 0$ , $\mathsf { p } = . 0 0 5$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 0 5 ]$ , and there were significant differences among the grades on the dependent variables after controlling for the effect of word count [pillai’s trace $= 0 . 3 3 5$ , F $( 2 1 , 5 5 5 ) = 3 . 3 2 2$ , $ { \mathbf { p } } < . 0 0 1$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 1 2 ]$ . Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted on each dependent variable as a follow-up test to MANCOVA. Because there were seven single ANCOVAs, the alpha level was set at $0 . 0 5 / 7 ,$ or 0.007. Grade has a significant main effect on Length [ $\operatorname { F } \left( 3 , 1 8 9 \right) = 7 . 8 4 4$ , $ { \mathbf { p } } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 1 1 ]$ , Abstraction [F $\dot { \cdot } ( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 6 . 4 0 4$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 9 2 ]$ , and Quality $\operatorname { \lceil F ( } 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 4 . 2 6 4$ , ${ \mathsf { p } } = . 0 0 6$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 6 3 ]$ , but not Density [F $( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 4 . 0 0 $ , $\mathfrak { p } = . 0 0 9$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 6 0 ]$ , Variety [F $( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 2 . 3 7 0 ,$ , $\mathbf { p } = . 0 7 2$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 3 6 ]$ ], Sophistication [F $( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 0 . 3 0 0$ , ${ \mathsf p } = . 8 2 6$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 5 ]$ , and Profile [F $( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 3 . 1 5 3$ , ${ \mathsf p } = . 0 2 6$ , partial $\qquad = \ . 0 4 9 $ after controlling for the effect of word count. The Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed (a) for Length, significant differences between third and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right.$ ), and between fifth and ninth grades $\mathbf { \tilde { p } } = . 0 2 3 \mathbf { \varepsilon }$ ); (b) for Abstraction, significant differences between third and fifth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } \ < \ . 0 0 1 \right)$ , and between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } = . 0 1 5 \right)$ ; and (c) for Quality, significant differences between third and ninth grades ${ \bf \dot { P } } = . 0 3 7 { \bf \dot { \Omega } } .$ ), between fifth and seventh grades $\mathbf { p } = . 0 3 7 ,$ , and between fifth and ninth grades ${ \bf \Phi } ( { \bf p } = . 0 0 8 )$ .

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the effect of grade level on the holistic rating scores of informational writing. ANOVA results revealed significant grade effect [F $( 3 , 1 9 0 ) = 4 7 . 9 3 9$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 3 1 ]$ o n holistic rating scores. The Bonferroni post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between third and seventh grades $( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 $ ), between third and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between fifth and seventh grades $\left( \mathtt { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , and between fifth and ninth grades $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . ANCOVA was also performed to control for the effect of word count. Results from the analysis revealed that the covariate significantly influenced the dependent variable $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } ( 1 , 1 8 9 ) = 1 3 0 . 8 6 4 , \mathrm { p } < . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 0 9 ]$ , and there was a significant grade main effect on holistic rating scores [F $( 3 , 1 8 9 ) = 5 . 4 0 5$ , $\mathbf { p } = . 0 0 1$ , partial $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 9 ]$ . The Bonferroni post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between third and seventh grades $\left( \mathbf { p } = . 0 0 1 \right)$ , between third and ninth grades $\mathbf { \tilde { p } } = . 0 3 7 )$ , and between fifth and seventh grades $( \mathbf { p } = . 0 0 5 )$ .

Finally, correlation analysis showed that nominal complexity measures were significantly correlated with holistic rating scores of informational writing, with $\Gamma = 0 . 3 6 2$ $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ for Length, ${ \Gamma } = 0 . 2 3 0$ for Abstraction $\mathbf { \vec { p } } = . 0 0 1 $ ), ${ \Gamma } = 0 . 2 9 8$ for Density $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , $\Gamma = 0 . 2 6 8$ for Quality $\mathbf { \rho } _ { \mathrm { { p } } < . 0 0 1 } \cdot$ ), ${ \Gamma } = 0 . 2 6 8$ for Variety $\mathbf { \rho } _ { \mathrm { { p } } < . 0 0 1 } )$ , $\Gamma = 0 . 2 1 3$ for Sophistication $\mathbf { p } = . 0 0 1 ,$ ), and $\Gamma = 0 . 3 2 4$ for Profile $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ . Additionally, the standard multiple regression was conducted to determine the accuracy of the six nominal complexity measures in predicting the holistic rating scores. Regression analysis results indicate that the overall model significantly predicts holistic rating $[ \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 6 3 , \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } \mathsf { a d j } = 0 . 1 3 6 , \mathsf { F } ( 6 , 1 8 7 ) = 6 . 0 8 , \mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1 ] .$ . This model accounts for $1 3 . 6 \%$ of the variance in holistic rating scores. A summary of regression coefficients indicates that only two variables, Length $[ B = 0 . 3 2 , \mathrm { t } \left( 1 8 7 \right) = 2 . 4 1 6 , \mathrm { p } = . 0$ and Quality $\begin{array} { r } { \left[ B = 0 . 1 7 , \right. } \end{array}$ , t $( 1 8 7 ) = 2 . 2 5 9$ , $\mathsf { p } = . 0 2 5 \mathrm { ] }$ ], significantly contributed to the model.

# 5. Discussion

Our study explored the structural and ideational complexities of nominal expressions in school children’s informational writing. Four themes emerged from our analysis. First, the children as a whole scored low on all measures of nominal complexity. In terms of Length, a mean score of between 1 and 2 indicates that each nominal expression averaged less than 6 words. With Abstraction, a mean score of between 1 and 2 indicates that the heads of nominal expressions referred primarily to concrete things in the material world, sometimes to abstract entities without perceptual correlates, and occasionally to metaphoric abstractions. For Density, a mean score of between 1 and 2 indicates that each nominal expression contained an average of less than two content words. A mean score of between 1 and 2 for Quality indicates that these content words were primarily Tier I vocabulary, i.e., everyday words with commonsense meanings. With respect to Variety, a mean score of between 0 and 1 indicates that the majority of the nominal expressions had no more than one modifier. A mean score of between 0 and 1 for Sophistication indicates that many nominal expressions did not have modifiers; and when modifiers were used, they were primarily either premodifiers such as demonstratives, attributive adjectives, and determiners, or postmodifiers such as restrictive relative clauses and prepositional phrases.

The finding that the students in our sample scored low on measures of nominal complexity should not be surprising. Prior research has suggested that children tend to rely heavily on everyday registers in their school writing, regardless of genre (Ravid & Berman, 2010; Schleppegrell, 1998). That is, they often draw on the more familiar lexicogrammatical resources of spoken language when writing for academic purposes. The nominal expressions in everyday registers are typically short and simple, with no or minimal modification (Biber et al., 2011). According to Halliday and Martin (1993), for example, there are typically 2e3 content words per clause for spontaneous speech and 4e6 content words for everyday writing. If each clause consists of an average of two nominal expressions (i.e., a subject and an object), then each nominal expression would have an average of one to three content words. This means there would be minimal modification for nominal expressions in writing that is more informal and interactive.

From a cognitive perspective, it is likely that the constraints of children’s working memory prevent them from constructing expanded noun phrases with multiple pre- and postmodifiers. This is evident in the finding that the vast majority (roughly $8 0 \%$ ) of the nominal expressions in the sample were either without any modifier (NS1) or with only one premodifier (NS2). Psychological experiments (e.g., Miller, 1969) have shown that on average the longest sequence a normal adult person can recall on the fly contains about 7 items. This limit, dubbed the ‘the magical number seven’, is the typical capacity of the adult brain’s working memory. If we consider clause as the basic unit of message (cf., Halliday & Matthiessen, 2004), with each clause consisting of a minimum of a subject, a verb, and an object, then it is conceivable that the subject or the object, typically instantiated in a nominal expression, would consist of no more than 3 content words. This may explain why the nominal expressions that the children in our study used averaged under 6 words in length, with generally no more than 2 content words. It may also explain why postmodifiers, which are generally longer and more complex, were used much less frequently, especially among younger children (e.g., third graders), than premodifiers, which are generally shorter and simpler.

The low scores on nominal complexity measures may also have to do with the task used in our study. Recall that the children were asked to compose a text about a reptile within a class period of 45e60 min. It is essentially a timed task in which the children likely did not plan or revise their writing, a factor that may have contributed to their writing being more spontaneous and fragmented. This is unlike in the academic writing done by experts, who generally go through the arduous process of planning, drafting, and multiple revisions before publishing their work. When writing is planned and revised, it becomes more refined. Polished writing tends to be more compact and is characterized by the use of nominal syntax; on the other hand, writing done without planning or revision tends to resemble spontaneous speech, which is characterized by chaining syntax and clausal modification (Biber & Gray, 2011; Schleppegrell, 2004). On the other hand, it is also possible that these low scores were an artifact of our analysis scheme, which is admittedly in need of refinement. Recall that most of our measures were scored on a three- or four-point scale. This range may have been too narrow and not sensitive enough to capture some of the true differences within and across grade levels. Had we used a more refined scale (e.g., 1e6) for some of the measures (e.g., Length, Abstraction, Quality, Sophistication), the results may have been somewhat different.

The second theme from our analysis is that there is a clear developmental trend toward greater nominal complexity across the four grade levels. Higher grades (seventh and ninth) consistently outperformed lower grades (third and fifth) on most measures of nominal complexity and on holistic rating. In other words, older students tended to produce writing that was simultaneously longer (in word counts), more complex (in nominal expressions), and of higher overall quality (in holistic rating). This suggests that early-to-mid adolescence is likely an important period in the development of nominal complexity in writing. Christie and Derewianka (2008) made a similar observation when they noted that children began to use more expanded nominal groups that involved increasing abstraction and pre- and postmodifications in their writing by the time they reached 12e15 years of age. Ravid and Berman (2010) also reported that children’s writing evidenced increasing nominal complexity from middle childhood to adolescence, with complex nominal expressions typically acquired later in language development because their use “requires recruitment of a constellation of linguistic and cognitive processing resources” (p. 21). On the other hand, it is important to note that not all aspects of nominal complexity uniformly developed across grades in our study, as their development likely depended on individual children’s maturation as well as the opportunity and support they had to interact with nominal expressions of varying complexities in academic and disciplinary texts.

The third theme from our analysis is that the children in the study were able to use not only the simple, more familiar nominal resources (e.g., determiner, attributive adjectives, prepositional phrase) but also the more complex ones that are associated with more advanced writing (e.g., noun as premodifier, participial adjective, participle clause, comparative clause, complement clause). In general, more complex nominal resources were more often found in older students’ writing, although they were not used with high enough frequency in any grade level to make a true difference. Older students tended to use a higher percentage of nominal expressions with multiple modifiers, especially postmodifiers, than did the children in lower grades. In part because of this, older students’ writing also tended to be longer (in word count) than that of younger students. Taken together, these findings support the general developmental framework proposed by Biber et al. (2011) and substantiated for the most part, albeit at a different level of writer and a different frequency, by empirical research (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014) regarding students’ use of nominal modifiers. Younger children appeared to rely almost entirely on nominal expressions with no modifier or 1e2 premodifiers (e.g., demonstrative, determiner, attributive adjective). Older children began to draw more frequently on postmodifiers in their writing while still being heavily reliant on nouns without modifier or with one premodifier. Prepositional phrases, infinitives, and restrictive relative clauses were the most common types of postmodifiers used by the children, regardless of grade level. Premodifiers such as nouns and participial adjectives were sometimes used, and appositives were rarely used. Postmodifiers such as participle clauses, appositives, and complement clauses were likewise seldom seen in the children’s writing. These more complex nominal modifiers are likely produced in the more specialized circumstances of writing, where authors have the opportunity to meticulously plan and repeatedly revise their composition. According to Biber et al. (2011), many types of complex phrasal embedding are not acquired naturally, and many native speakers of English rarely (or never) produce these types of language. They hypothesized that “these grammatical structures represent a considerably higher degree of production complexity” and do not typically occur until adulthood (p. 29). On the other hand, the fact that these more advanced modifying devices were present in the corpus suggest that they are not altogether out of reach for children as young as preadolescents. Prior experience with academic and disciplinary texts likely plays a role in developing control over these meaning-making resources.

Finally, our analysis shows that nominal complexity measures are significantly correlated with and significantly predict the holistic rating scores of children’s informational writing. This finding is largely consistent with what previous research has suggesteddnouns are a sensitive indicator of text quality. For example, Biber and Gray (2011) found that nominal complexity is what truly distinguishes academic writing from other varieties of language use. Working with a college ESL writing corpus, Lu (2011) reported that the use of complex nominal expressions is one of the best predictors of writing quality. In his more recent work on application letters and argumentative essays written by college-level Chinese EFL learners, Lu (Zhang & Lu, 2020) found the correlation between complex nominal groups and holistic essay scores to be around 0.35 for both types of essays, a number that is similar to our finding ${ \bf { r } } = 0 . 3 2$ between Profile and holistic rating).

On the other hand, it is worth noting that nominal complexity measures contributed to less than $1 4 \%$ of the variance in holistic rating scores in our study. This finding aligns with the results from other studies (e.g., Biber, Gray, & Staples, 2016; Zhang & Lu, 2020). For example, Zhang and Lu (2020) reported that complex nominal expressions accounted for less than $1 3 \%$ of the variance in holistic writing quality for application letters $( 1 2 . 2 \% )$ and argumentative essays $( 1 2 . 8 \% )$ . The lack of stronger predictive power of nominal complexity measures for holistic rating scores is not surprising because a text’s holistic quality depends on a multitude of factors (e.g., vocabulary, organization, syntax, coherence), with nominal resources being just one of many. In the case of our study, the finding may also have to do with the fact that the vast majority of the nominal expressions in the children’s writing were not overtly complex, with four-fifth of them being nouns without any modification or with only one premodifier. This is unlike in expert writing analyzed in corpus-based studies (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2011; Jiang & Hyland,

2018), where nouns of varying complexities, particularly abstract nouns and expanded noun phrases, are much more common.

# 6. Implications and limitations

The ability to write informational texts is highly valued in K-12 schooling, as it is critical to academic success in postsecondary education, where students are expected to regularly write to learn and to communicate what they have learned in disciplinary learning and socialization. Thus, it is important to examine, as our study did, how students employ one of the most powerful linguistic resourcesdnominal expressionsdin their construction of informational texts. Our study yielded important insights into one rarely explored dimension of children’s linguistic competence in academic writing. These insights can inform future efforts to support children’s language learning and academic writing development.

Importantly, our findings suggest that nominal resources are an area of language that deserves greater attention in K-12 literacy instruction. Traditionally, efforts to improve students’ academic writing has been given in the form of grammar instruction. The instruction typically focused on elaborated structuresdoften dependent clauses like relative clauses, adverbial clauses, and complement clausesdthrough tasks such as sentence combining or sentence completion, with little attention to nominal structures with multiple levels of phrasal modification and embedding. This practice likely reflects two common misconceptions about academic writing, that is, increased subordination is typical of academic writing and that phrasal modification is easier to master than clause embedding (Biber & Gray, 2011). It is clearly problematic in light of our findings and those from related studies (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Biber et al., 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Ravid & Berman, 2010). According to Biber and Gray (2011), literacy instruction should instead provide students with extensive opportunities to engage with texts rich in nominal structures of varying complexities and encourage them to use these grammatical resources in their academic writing.

A pedagogical heuristic that supports this sort of academic writing development work is the genre teaching-learning cycle (Fang, 2020), modeled after the Sydney School genre-based pedagogy (Rose & Martin, 2012). The cycle, pictured in Fig. 1, consists of 4 stages: building knowledge and context, analyzing model text(s), playing with language, and constructing text(s). During the first stage, students explore a question or an issue that is significant to their discipline in a unit of study through a variety of tasks and activities that are authentic to the discipline and meaningful to students. The exploration inevitably involves some interaction with academic and disciplinary texts. As students engage with these texts, they employ the strategies that experts in their discipline use (e.g., previewing, rereading, close reading, contextualizing, corroborating, sourcing, inferring, storying, drawing on prior knowledge, visualizing, monitoring, questioning, note-taking, evaluating, summarizing, paraphrasing) to help them make sense of these texts. Reading and discussing these texts helps students develop the content knowledge and language resources they need to write about the topic in whatever genre that has been determined to the focus of study. In the second stage, mentor texts in the target genre (e.g., literary response, scientific explanation, historical argument) are selected for close reading and detailed analysis. Specifically, the teacher engages students in in-depth discussion of the writing craft in these exemplar texts, paying close attention to how experts use language (e.g., nominal resources) to make meaning in ways that help accomplish the purpose of the genre. Next, the teacher designs language-based tasksdsuch as deconstructing and building noun trains, playing definition games, completing or combining sentences, and paraphrasing (Fang, 2020)dthat highlight key, unfamiliar, or challenging features (e.g., nominal resources) of the target genre. These tasks give students the opportunity to “play” with the specific language features used in the texts they have been reading for the unit, further cementing their understanding of the structure, logic, meaning, and function of these features and developing their facility in using them in academic writing. In the final stage, the teacher encourages students to use some of the key or unfamiliar language features (e.g., nominal resources) discussed earlier as they attempt to compose, collaboratively and/or independently, a new text in the target genre. Students are guided through the composing process of generating ideas, creating drafts, making revisions, and publishing their work, with an emphasis on revision, where special attention is given to the power of lexicogrammar (e.g., nominal resources) in shaping, clarifying, and manipulating meaning in ways that serve the writer’s purpose, interests, and needs.

All studies have limitations, and ours is no exception. In our study, only one sample of informational writing was elicited using a somewhat contrived, albeit not uncommon, task. It is also possible that the task does not elicit nouns of certain complexities. Moreover, our analysis scheme, although derived from prior theoretical and empirical work, may not have been sensitive enough to capture the true range of variation among the students. Future research can collect more authentic and varied samples of academic writing. Analysis of multiple samples of writing in different genres produced by demographically diverse students in natural contexts over an extended period of time will give us a more authentic and complete picture of school children’s developing competence in using nominal resources to construct and communicate meaning for academic purposes. In this connection, it is important to continue to fine tune the analysis scheme we have developed for nominal complexity measures, especially given the issues that have been raised about the validity and accuracy of Biber et al. (2011) hypothesized developmental sequence of nominal modification (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Yang, 2013). A more refined tool for measuring nominal complexity will yield more nuanced, precise understanding of students’ discursive competence with nominal resources.

An additional dimension worth examining in this research is the functions of nominal expressions. That is, future research can also investigate the effectiveness of children’s nominal expressions in establishing references, tracking grammatical participants, packing information, creating technical taxonomy, construing abstraction and generalization, facilitating discursive flow, and infusing authorial judgment. An equally important line of research is to investigate howdand under what conditionsdchildren’s proficiency with nominal expressions of varying complexities can best be fostered. These lines of research should generate valuable information that can be used to guide the vitally important work of developing students’ linguistic competence in academic writing.
