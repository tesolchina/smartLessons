In response to Crusan’s focus paper on the history, nuances, and implications of alternative assessment for second language writing and writers, I present an overview of multilingual student perceptions of contract grading across a University Writing Program. Both affordances and po tential challenges with this method of assessment are discussed.

Crusan’s (2024) focus piece on ungrading thoughtfully considers the history, nuances, and implications of alternative assessment for second language writing and writers. In my own practice, I have used a labor-based grading contract (Inoue, 2022) across a wide range of courses and modalities within the University of California, California State University, and California Community College systems as an Adjunct Assistant Professor or a Graduate Teaching Associate. That is, in the classes I teach, students’ final course grades are entirely determined by the number of assignments they complete that meet a mutually agreed-upon set of genre-specific minimum grading criteria. As Crusan addresses, issues of power are a significant factor that can restrict instructors’ ability to use alternative assessment practices, and I am fortunate that all of the departments in which I have taught are pro-contract grading, particularly given my role as a contingent faculty member. While contract grading is not without its flaws (see recent critiques by Carillo, 2021; Craig, 2021), it has offered me a set of concrete practices in which I can better align my pedagogical values with my classroom assessment decisions (see Modesto & Sullivan, forthcoming, 2025, for more on this). However, as I have argued elsewhere (Sims, 2023), scholarship on contract grading has yet to extend into sheltered multilingual writing contexts.

When considering the potential disadvantages of ungrading, Crusan specifically wonders about the implications of ungrading with international students, other English language learners, and students who are generally more accustomed to a more teacher-centered approach. This is a valid concern and one that I explored throughout my dissertation research at the University of California, Davis (UCD), in which I attend to student perceptions of contract grading with a particular focus on multilingual students. I surveyed 308 undergraduate students from classes across our University Writing Program Pathways that employed contract grading; 89 of these students were international students, and 124 were domestic multilingual students. I also conducted follow-up focus group interviews with 18 students, 7 of whom were international students and 6 of whom were domestic multilingual students, and collected relevant course artifacts.

The students in my dissertation study—and especially the multilingual students—did report some initial confusion surrounding their experiences with contract grading. Cora, a multilingual international student, shared that contract grading was, initially, a challenging concept for her to come to terms with, particularly when considering that everything about the American higher education system is so different from what she was accustomed to in her home country of Italy. Similar sentiments are illustrated in Table 1, which shows that the majority of students who participated in my dissertation study experienced some confusion about their course grading contract at the beginning of an academic term. However, the majority of these students reported that much of this confusion was ameliorated by the end of a 10-week academic term. As this method of assessment became more familiar to them, the multilingual students in my study were able to identify many benefits of contract grading, such as improved relationships with their instructor, classmates, and their writing class overall.

Specifically, my focus group participants shared that, because of their course grading contract, they no longer felt that there was secrecy and competition about grades and grading which, unfortunately, are common sentiments at a highly grade-motivated uni versity such as UCD. For example, Amy, a Latinx multilingual domestic student, expressed that the transparency brought forth by her course grading contract had an “equalizing” effect on her class, particularly for students who “come from different backgrounds and have different relationships to writing,” and that the transparency of the grading contract gives everyone a better chance at attaining their desired course grade (these sentiments were shared widely across all survey respondents, as well, as demonstrated by Table 2). The other three students in the same focus group, who were all multilingual international students, agreed with these sentiments and the effect contract grading had on each of their sections of first-year composition.

Crusan also identifies students’ desire for a course grade on individual assignments as a potential pitfall of ungrading. While this is not something that came up from the focus group participants in my dissertation research, others have expressed this concern about contract grading (Inman & Powell, 2018). Fortunately, there are a number of pedagogical strategies that instructors can employ to help students understand their progress toward meeting the terms of their course grading contract in the absence of a letter grade (see Laflen & Sims, 2021, for examples). While there remains much to be explored about ungrading and multilingual writers, I am optimistic that contract grading seems to be one such method of alternative assessment that offers many equitable benefits for the multilingual students who populate our writing classes.
