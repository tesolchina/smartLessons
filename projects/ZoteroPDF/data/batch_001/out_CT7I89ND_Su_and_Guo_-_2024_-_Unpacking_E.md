This study explored the manifestation of multifaceted emotions, sources of emotions, and emotion regulation strategies of college EFL learners participating in digital collaborative academic reading projects. Data were collected through a vignette-based survey that was comprised of 19 episodes of authentic emotion-inducing scenarios among 72 Chinese EFL learners, supplemented by semi-structured interviews with 16 participants. While the results showed a relatively balanced distribution of positive and negative emotions, anxiety, nervousness, and happiness were found to be the top three most commonly experienced emotions. The study identified three sources of positive emotions including topic interest, experiencing mastery and achievement, and recognition from other groups. The findings also revealed factors inducing negative emotions in digital collaborative academic reading: reading difficulties, challenges in interacting with group members, low-quality fedback from external groups, online learning environment and technology issues, and time pressure. Furthermore, the study extended the literature on emotion regulation by developing a comprehensive taxonomy of six categories of strategies (i.e., coregulation, cognitive change, response regulation, attention deployment, task-related regulation, and situation modification) tailored to the context of digital collaborative academic reading. These findings can offer practical guidance for enhancing social-emotional interactions in technology-enhanced collaborative academic reading.

# 1. Introduction

Collaborative reading has emerged as a promising approach to engaging EFL learners in constructing, discussing, and revising their understanding of an academic text (Jin et al., 2022; Zhang & Li, 2023. Collaborative academic reading groups were considered as learning communities that can bring about students' co-development of content knowledge and language sils through peer in. teractions (Li et al., 2021; Widodo, 2016). Past research has documented the benefits of collborative reading such as deepening reading comprehension (Liu et al., 2021), promoting higher-level cognitie ailities (Yang et al., 2013), and boosting motivation and engagement (Bowers-Campbell, 2011). Nowadays, the advent of convenient synchronous and asynchronous communication technologies has afforded unprecedented opportunities for students to collaborate and interact with each other. Therefore, language teachers worldwide have begun to move collaborative academic reading activities into the online space to promote eer collaboration and knowledge co-construction (Li & Li, 2022; Zhang & Li, 2023).

However, successul collaboration is not easy to achieve. Learners often encounter cognitive, socio-emotional, and motivational challnges that arise from numerous factors like divergent understandings among group members difficultie in comprehending academic texts, ifferences in working style, or scant interest in the collaborative learning activity (vry et a. 2020; riksson, 2023; Jarvenojat al., 2019 Van den Bossche et al., 006. These challenging siuations can potntilly aouse afftie rections, requiring learners to make adaptive emotional regulation (Manty et al., 2023; Naykki et al., 2014). Emotion regulation strategies are crucial for group members to achieve their individual emotional balance and maintain a favorable socio-emotional climate within the group (Jarvenoja et al., 2019). Neglecting negative emotions or failure in emotion regulation would provoke problems such as low engagement and social distancing from the group and the task (Nguyen et al., 2022). Learners' emotions in collaborative language learning can facilitate the development of individuals' cognitive functioning, knowledge co-construction and group task execution through interpersonal interaction among group members (Imai, 2010).

Despite the burgeoning research interest in emotions and emotion regulation in language learning, prior studies on language learning emotions have predominantly concentrated on non-collaborative face-to-face learning contexts (eg., Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020). Researchers argued that language learners' experience of emotions and their use of emotion regulation strategies during online collaborative learning remains under-researched (Nguyen et al., 2022; Yoshida, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021, 2022). Researchers have emphasized that the ways emotions unfold and develop are highly contextual and task-specific (Tormanen et al., 2021). Emotional processes in online collaborative learning become more complex as digital collaboration tools can pose additional challenges (Li et al., 2012), and each team member'saffective tate contributes to the group's socio-emotional atmosphere (Tormanen et al., 2021). While digital collaborative academic reading is increasingly prevalent in second language education (Jin et al., 2020, 2022),littleattention has been directed to learners emotions and emotion regulation strategies in such potentily challenging lerning contexts. To address the above research gaps, the current study aimed to unravel what emotions were manifested and how they were regulated when faced with challenges in online collaborative academic reading.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Digital collaborative academic reading

Collaborative academic reading is a pedagogical approach that views reading as a social practice, emphasizing dialogic interactions and collaborative meaning-making among leaners to collectively make sense of academic texts (Afdal et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021). In academic classooms, collaborative reading i operationalized through various learning activities. These activities include text-ased sharig and diussion (e., Jin et al., 2022), witing a group reading reort (, Seun, 2016), oral presenttions of readng reports (e.g., Widodo, 2016), per evaluation of presentations and reading reports (e.g., Xu, 2021), and collaborative reflction on both the achievements and shortcomings within the group proect (e.g., Li et al, 2021). By engaging in these collaborative activities, students are provided with valuable opportunities to draw on collective intelectual resources, which contribute to language socialization and knowledge transmission (Afdal et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021).

Due to the popularit of digital tools that support online discussion and interaction (e.g., Zoom, Perusall Wiki), researchers have sought innovative ways to promote collaborative reading in online setigs (Zhang & Li, 2023). For instance, Kosar's (2021) study with sophomore students indicated that using the web conferencing platorm Zom to implement small-group academic reading could significanly mprove students critical thinking sill. n anther study with collee stdents taking linguistics clases, Li and i 2022) utilized the social annotation tool Perusall to conduct collaborative reading and found that the tool enhanced students' reading motivation. More interestingly, some studies have successully integrated the affordances of Web 2.0 tools with the traditional "reading circles" activity (Hathaway, 2011). Li et al. (2021) applied wiki-based reading circles among Chinese college students and discovered students' co-regulation strategies acted as a predictor for students' learning outcomes. However, previous studies have been conducted primarily in L1 contexts, with limited exploration in L2 learning settings (Zhang & Li, 2023). Furthermore, while some studies have examined students learning strategies during collaborative reading (Liu et al., 2021), few attempts have been made to explore their emotion-regulation strategies.

# 2.2. Learners' emotions in digital collaborative language learning

Emotions are defined as complex and temporary reactions to significant stuations and have various interconnected psychological processes encompassing affctive, physiological, behavioral, and cognitive facets (Gross, 2015; Shuman & Scherer, 2015, pp. 526-533). Emotions are consistently present in digital collaborative learning environments (Yoshida, 2020). As evidenced by numerous studies, collaboration with others has the potential to fster positive emotions (e.g., happiness, interest, and pride) and enhance motivation (Liou & Chiang, 2023; Yoshida, 2020). Yet, it i also noted that collaborative learning situations can give rise to negative emotions (e.g., anger, sadnes, and boredom) and introduce new motivational challenges, particularly when student characterisics and goals conflict (Jarvenoja & Jarvela, 2009. Positive emotions are likely to promote active engagement and advanced interaction, while negative emotions have the otential to undermine motivation, leading to a decreased willingnessto communicate and collaborate with group members (Camacho-Morles et al., 2019).

Understanding the sources of emotions in digital collaborative learning i crucial Jarvenoja & Jarvela, 2009; Naykki et al., 2014)

The sources of emotions may originate from individual-level factors, such as lack of interest, limited language self-eficacy, or a low willingnes to communicate in the second language (Widodo, 2016; Xu, 2021). They can also arise from task characteristics like Iengthy texts and diffcult vocabulary, uneven task distribution, or negative interactions among group members (Jin et al., 2022, Manty et al., 2023). Notably, factors specific to digital learning environments can also serve as the source and context for individuals emotional responses (Muuro et al., 2014). While some studies revealed that computer-mediated collaboration can reduce language learners' anxiety because f its non-threatening nature compared to fac-to-face communication (e.g., Li & Li, 2022; Su et al, 2019), other studies indicated that negative emotions emerge due to challenges like low social presence from teachers and team members difficultie in empathizing with peers, or unexpected technological malfunctions (e.g., Muro et al., 2014). Previous studies in educational psychology indicated that challnges in collaborative learning provide an important lens for observing students emotional experiences (e.g., Mamberg et al., 2015; Manty et al., 2023). However, limited research has specificall investigated how challenges in collaborative learning provoke L2 learners emotional experiences. There is sill a significant gap in the research on emotions within online collborative language learning environments when compared to traditional face-to-face settings (Yoshida, 2020; Zhang et a., 2022). With the growing use of digitalcollaborative academic reading in language education, more investigations need to be conducted on L2 learners emotional experiences during challenging learning situations, so as to yield more insights into orchestrating learners' online collaboration processes.

The few studies that have explored L2 learners' emotions in digital collaborative learning have adopted an uni-component approach focusing on discrete emotions such as enjoyment (e.g., Zhang et al., 2021, 2022). Recent studies tend to take a multi-component perspective to gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of students diverse emotional experiences in language learning (e.g., Liou & Chiang, 2023; Shao et al., 2023). Several pioneering studies of L2 leaners emotions have utilized the "vignette methodology' to elicit a broader spectrum of both positive and negative language learning emotions. This method involves hypothetical cenarios that ffer a secure, open environment for participants to respond and reflect on their motional experiences.For instance, Liu and Yu (2022) developed 17 vignettes about supervisors' problematic feedback on academic writing and used them to explore Chinese master'sudents' emotional reactions. Their findings demonstrated that positive emotions such as gratitude, hope, and excitement were the most prevalent, while negative emotions such as contempt, boredom, and anger were the least reported. Similarly, Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) employed an instrument containing 10 vignetes to investigate the achievement motions of English majors a  Polish university and identified five positive motions enjoyment, interest, hope, grattude, pride) and five negative emotions (anxiet, anger, shame, sadness, boredom), with the later being more prominent. Given the privateness and face-threatening nature of emotions, researchers highlight that the vignette methodology isa promising approach that can be applied in other learning siuations for eliciting multiple contex-specific emotions and emotion-regulation strategies (Liu & Yu, 2022; Oxford 2017).

# 1.3. Learners' emotion regulation strategies in digital collaborative learning

Emotion regulation refers t the processes through which individuals influence theoccurrence, experience, and expression of thir emotions (Gross, 1998). The particular emotion regulation processes that involve consciousnes and goal-directedness can be conceptualized as emotion regulation strategies, in contrast to the more implicit ones (Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020; Nakamura, 2023). Gross (2015) widely used framework categorizes emotion regulation strategies into five domains: situation selection, situation modification, atentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. Situation selection is asociated with learners' actions to choose a certain situation arousing their desired emotions or preventing undesired emotions. Situation modification involves taking measures to change a situation so as to alter its emotional impact. Attentional deployment involves regulating emotions by diverting one's attention. Cognitive change means that individuals change their appraisal of an emotional situation. Response modulation occurs when individuals modify their experiential, behavioral, or physiological reactions to regulate emotions.

While emotion regulation was traditionally viewed as an intrapersonal and subjective process recent research has expanded on Gross's model to emphasiethe highly interpersonal and relational nature of emotion regulation, oten occurring with the support of others (Gkonou & Mille, 2023). This hift i particularly evident in collaborative learning contexts that emphasize student interaction and social communication (Chan, 2012; Hadwin et al., 2011; Hadwin & Oshige, 2011). Previous studies have extended Gross strategy family by labeling new stratgie at the interpersonal level uch as"sharing motions with others toseek for help (e, Donyei, 01) and seeking social support (e.g., Buric e l., 2016; Kraaij & Ganefski, 2019). Jarvenoja and her olleagues (2009; 2019) extended the concept of learning co-regulation to the co-regulation of emotions. In a recent study by Liu and Yu (2022) on emotion regulation strategies in academic writing among masters studentscollaborating with supervisors, they successully interated co-regulation into Gross (2015) established model of emotion regulation. They identified five specific co-regulation strategies, including talking to the supervisor, social sharing, expressing gratitude, seeking help, and comparing with peers. Therefore it i apropriat to integrate co-regulation with Gross's four strategy families.

Diverse interpretations of co-regulation are evident in the literature on collaborative learning. Some studies conceptualize co regulation as a comprehensive construct that portrays how students regulate emotions through interactions in collaborative learning contexts (Chan, 2012; Liu & Yu, 2022; Volet et l., 2009). Other studies distinguish co-regulation from shared regulation in collaborative learning groups (e.g., Grau & Whitebread, 2012; Hadwin & Oshige, 2011). According to the latter perspective, researchers argue for subtle distinctions between co-regulation and shared regulation. Co-regulation pertains to regulation processes aimed at influencing specific group members, while shared regulation involves regulation processes directed towards the collective learning efort of the entire group, with verbalizations addressed to everyone or no one in particular (Jarvela & Hadwin, 2013).

Analyzing real-time discussions and conversation data among students within the group is typically required to establish such dif ferentiation (e.g, Grau & Whitebread, 2012; Jarvela & Hadwin, 2013). Given the data characteristics and research objectives of ths study, we adopt the definition of co-regulation as a broad construct that illutrates how students regulate emotions through interactions with others i collaborative learning contexts (Chan, 2012; Liu & Yu, 2022; Volet et al., 2009). This defintion encompases two key elements: the sharing of negative emotions and seeking asstance, while also encompassing the provision of supportive behaviors such as encouraging group members experiencing distressing emotions (Liu & Yu, 2022).

Although much progress has been made on emotion regulation strategies in educational contexts, research into students' emotion regulation strategies in digital collaborative learning i rlatively a new area. Compared with whole-clas instruction or individual learning, emotion regulation in digital collaborative learning has unique contributions like promoting productive group functioning, shaping a positive group climate, and enhancing students' enjoyment of online collaboration (Hadwin et l., 2011; Jarvenoja et al. 2019). In a study conducted by Bakhtiar et al. (2018) that explored the relationship between regulation strategies and socio-emotional interactions in online collaborative learning, it was discovered that actively recognizing and supporting emotions in response to challenging situations plays a vital role in fostering positive group dynamics and cultivating a favorable soco-emotional climate within the groups. Similarly, Zhang et al.'s (2022) study on English language learners' emotion regulation stategies in digital ollaborative writing demonstrated the coexistence of self-regulation and co-regulation, highlighting that group members experience a sense of enjoyment through both receiving and providing emotional asstance. In another study by Zhang et al. (2021), it was found that emojis used in online discussions can function as a mediation technique for co-regulating emotions in the online environment, dis tinguishing it from traditional face-to-face collaborative learning practices.

Most of the previous explorations on emotions and emotion regulation in collaborative learning have bee situated in collaborative writing. Thee is scarce litature reporting language leners emotion regulation strategies in digital collaboratie reading, though collaborative reading has been widely advocated for use in today's teaching practice of academic English (Jin et al., 2022).Little is known about what contextual chllenges in collaboratie learning may shape students emotional state and their ollow-up regulation strategies. Therefore, this study manages to address the aforementioned research gaps by investigating the emotions and emotion regulation stratgies of college students when facing challenges in online collaborative academic reading activities. The three research questions guiding this study are presented as follows.

(1) What emotions do EFL learners experience in the face of challenges in digital collaborative academic reading? (2) What are the specific sources of EFL learners' emotions in digital collaborative academic reading? (3) What strategies do EFL learners employ to regulate their emotions in the face of challenges in digital cllaborative academic reading?

# 3.1. Participants and contexts

The participants were 72 s-year undergraduate students (46 males, 26 females, aged 19-22) from a university in Northern China. Table 1 shows the demographics of participants. The majority of them were pursuing degrees in Artificial Intelligence $( 4 0 . 3 \% )$ , Cyberspace Security $( 3 3 . 3 \% )$ , Automation $( 1 1 . 1 \% )$ , and Digital Media Arts $( 8 . 3 \% )$ . These students were involved in an English for Academic Purposes course that aimed to familiarize them with the conventions and features of academic texts. Due to the covID-19 pandemic, these students had adapted to online English learning, and they were required to engage in an online collaborative academic reading project in groups of four members. The students elformed their group and negotiated with team members to determine the roles each member would undertake in the reading circle activities. They have received at least seven years of formal English instruction. They demonstrated a proficiency level of between B2 and C1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages based on ther scores on the universit's English placement test and the fact that they have succesfull passed band 4f the College English Test (For more information about this test and its alignment with CEFR, see Peng et al., 2022). According to the feedback from the course intructor, the participants ecountered difficultie in academic reading as they had been primarily exposed to general English in the past.

# 3.2. Procedure of digital collaborative academic reading

In this study, online reading circes were used for colaborative academic reading. Informed by previous instructions on organizing online academic reading ircles (Li et al., 2021; Xu, 2021), four roles were designed for each group: summarizer, passage person, writing skill specialist, and word master. The summarizer employed toos like mind mapping to introduce the article's structure and retell is main content including research purpoe, methodology, and findings. The passage person selected well-witten paragraphs and analyed their tructures, writing logic, and rhetorical moves. The writing skill specalis illstrated the use of writig techniques such as hedging and cohesion with concrete examples from the article. The word master inroduced at least five useful expressions or sentences and provided examples t support peer learning. The reading circle activity was conducted on Feishu (https://www.feishu. $\mathrm { c n } / \mathrm { e n } / )$ , a widely used digital learning platform that empowers teams with essential collaboration tools, including cloud documents, messenger, video-conferencing, and peer assessment (see Fig. 1).

As shown in Fig. 2, collaborative reading was implemented with reference to the procedures designed by Jin et al. (2020) It included four stages: preparation, within-group collaboration, crossgroup collboration, and collaborative reflection. In the preparation phase, learners received training on the Feshu plaform's functions and the reading circles activity. Role alocation and paper selection were detrmined through group discussions. During within-group collaboration phase, learners fulfiled ther asigned role, co-reading and co-revising their work while monitoring group learning progress In the crossgroup collaboration phase, learners delivered presentations via video-conferencing and shared academic reading experiences with other groups. All the PowerPoint presentations were recorded and posted online for further discussion and per rview. Participants were assigned to provide feedback to at least two groups and were encouraged to review the works of more groups. Inthe collaborative reflection stage, group members discussed feedback received, reflected on lessons learned, fine-tuned their work, and submitted the final reading report to the instructor for evaluation.

# 3.3. Data collection and analysis methods

# 3.3.1. The vignette-based survey

Vignette methodology was used to elicit students emotions and emotion regulation strategies during digital collaborative aca demic reading. Vignettes refer to descriptive episodes simulating real events or problems, designed to provoke responses such as beliefs, emotions, and decision making among participants (Skilling & Stylianides, 2020). The increasing prominence of vignettes in research can be atributed to the limitation f traditional questionnaires in exploring perceptions and beliefs (Hughes & Huby, 2002). Vignettes are considered advantageous as they provide more concrete contexts that faclitate the elicitation of open-ended responses (Skilling & Styliandes, 2020). Vignte are articularl useul in tapping into participants inricat thoughts on potentily sensitive, embarrassing, or ethical issues like emotions (Poulou, 2001).

Fig. 2. The procedure of digital collaborative reading activity.

According to the vignete construction method established by prior research (Bradbury-Jones et al, 2014; Liu & Yu, 2022), rel-life experiences of participants from earlier pilot studies were utilized and transformed into vignettes for this study. Before writing the vignettes, a survey consisting of open questions was conducted among a cohort of students who had recently completed online collaborative academic reading circles. The students were asked to identify at least three emotion-inducing cenarios or challenges that they experienced during their collaborative reading. A total of 90 students responded to the survey, generating 187 scenarios that potentially affec students' emotional experiences. All the responses were categorized based on Malmberg et al.'s (2015) framework for potentilly challenging situations in online cllborative learning which includes 5 types: cognitive, social, motivational, time management, and environment and technology. Based on this categorization, we identified 19 scenarios that were frequently reported by the participants. These selected scenarios were then utilized as the basis for the vignettes in our study (for sample items, see Table 2). This use of real-life experiences as a foundation for vignettes largely ensures their plausibility and credibility (Skilling & Stylianides, 2020).

As Liu and Yu (2022) did in their study of language learners' emotional experiences, three questions were included in each vignette (see Appendix A). They are (a) What types of emotions would you experience in the particular situation? (b) What specific emotions (one or more) would you experince in this situation? and (c) What actions would you take to manage these emotions in this situation? In the first question, participants wre able to choose from positie, negative, or both emotions. In the second question, a lis f potential motions was provid happns, excitement, intrest, grattde, pride, relef, surprise, brm, axit, angr, elf-lame, adnes, contempt, confusion, and nervousness. The list of emotions was derived from three studies on language learners emotions: Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020), Liu and Yu (2022), and Jin et al. (2020). These studies have extensively explored the emotional experiences of language learners in various educational contexts including collaborative academic reading. Students were allowed to write other emotions that were not included in the list. The first question was designed to assessthe overallbalance of positive and negative emotions experienced by the students, while the second question aimed to reveal which specific emotions were experienced by the students. This i a common practice in research that utilizes the vignetes method to explore emotions (e.g., Liu & Yu, 2022), which to some extent enhances the reliability of the research design. The third question was open-ended and requested the participants to elaborate on the specific measures they would take to manage their emotions in the given scenario.

As suggested by Skilling and Stylianides (2020), validation was conducted through both expert judgment and pilot testing before the implementation of the vignette-based instrument. One experienced language teacher was invited to evaluate the events and discourse described in the vignettes. The instrument was also piloted among five college students to further check for authenticity and clarity of vignettes. Minor revisions were conducted for items that were unclear or confusing for the intended audience. The finalized vignette-based instrument was implemented through the widely used online survey platform Wenjuanxing, and 72 participants completed the survey.

The data obtained from the vignett-based questionnaire was analyzed by two coders through the deductive thematic analysis method. The coding scheme for emotion regulation strategies was adapted from two studies that employed vignette methods to explore language learners strategies for regulating emotions (Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020; Liu & Yu, 2022). Both studies based their classification of emotion regulation strategies on Gross's (2015) widely utilized model across disciplines. The coding procedure consisted of five main stes. irstly, the coders familiarized themselves with the raw data, examined students responses and identified keywords indicating emotion regulation strategies. Secondly, the coders integrated the coding framework from Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) and Liu and Yu (2022) to create a preliminary framework of emotion regulation strategies. This framework encompassed six categories of regulation strategies: task-related regulation, response modification, cognitive change, attention deployment, co-regulation, and situation modification. Consistent with Liu and Yu (2022), task-related strategies were treated as a separate category in our study. However, the codes under this category were revised to emphasize micro-level strategies closely linked to the specific tas of academic reading (e.g, using a dictionary, skimming/scanning, and searching for keywords). The third step involved pilot testing and refinement. The coders independently applied the coding scheme to the complete dataset collected from the scenarios within the cognitive dimension. The participants displayed a relatively larger quantity and greater diversity of answers in the cognitive dimension compared to other dimensions. By coding the entire dataset concerning the cognitive dimension, a thorough evaluation of the initial coding framework's feasibility was achieved, thereby faclitating subsequent adjustments. Following this, a standardization meeting was conducted to address any inconsistencies between the coders Minor revisions were made to refine the coding scheme, such as excluding codes like "wishful thinking" and \*excusing oneself' in Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) as these trateies were not rflected in the data. Additionally, codes such as "dty-diven decision were added to the conitive change strategy category. In the fourth step, the coders revisited and coded the data from the cognitive dimension using the revised coding scheme. This step was undertaken to ensure their consistent understanding of the coding framework and provided coders with an opportunity to re-read the updated coding framework and familiarize themselves with it, which is considered crucial in developing coding frameworks and training coders (schan et l., 2018). Another standardization meeting was held to addressany discrepancies between the coders. Finaly, after reaching a consensus on coding, one of the coders completed the coding for the remaining data, and the coding results were reviewed by the other coder. Discrepancies were discussed and negotiated until an agreement was reached.

In accordance with the method used by Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) and Liu and Yu (2022), we utilized statistical techniques, such as frequency counts and percentages, to quantify the emotions and emotion regulation strategies reported by the participants. These calculations allowed us to gain a quantitative understanding of students' emotional experiences within the online collaborative academic reading context.

# 3.3.2. Semi-structured interviews

Semi-structured interviews were employed in this study to gain a more nuanced understanding of the specificsituations that induced emotions in participants and the corresponding emotional experiences. The interview consisted of 16 individuals who will ingly agreed to participate from the intial group of 72 students taking the vignette-based survey. They were invited to recount critical events that elicited emotions and the asociated emotional responses. The interview questions (see Appendix ) included inquries such as: What emotional words would you use to describe your experience of the reading circles activity? What were the main challenges that you encountered while collborating with your team members? How did you manage your emotions when confronted with challenges during online collaborative reading? Each interview, conducted by the teaching asstants of the course, lasted approximately $^ { 1 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ To facilitate the participants' full expression, interviews were conducted in their first language (i.e., Chinese). All the interviews were video-recorded and transcribed for analysis. Through thematic analysis of the transcripts, leaners' emotional ex periences and the sources of emotions as well as the corresponding regulatory actions were identified and analyzed in detail. The incorporation of interviews in conjunction with vignetes served to enhance the information obtained from participants and provide additional evidence of reliability (Skilling & Stylianides, 2020).

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Quantitative findings on learners' emotions

Table 3 displays the frequency and percentage of positive emotions, negative emotions, and mixed emotions in response to the five categories in the vignette-based questionnaire. The results suggest a roughly balanced distribution of emotions among the three categories, with positive emotions $( 3 4 . 0 \% )$ reported slightly more frequently, followed by negative emotions $( 3 5 . 5 \% )$ and mixed emotions $( 3 0 . 6 \% )$ . Interestingly, after analyzing emotions in each type of scenario, it was found that negative emotions were more prevailing in motivation and time management scenarios (over $5 0 \%$ , indicating greater negative emotions in response to these challenges during collaborative academic reading project. Conversely, negative emotions accounted for the lowest percentage for the other three scenario types, with $2 8 . 5 \%$ in the cognitive scenarios, $2 6 . 4 \%$ in the social scenarios, and $2 0 . 8 \%$ in the environment and technology scenarios.

Table 4 presents the discrete emotions experienced by participants concerning the five scenario categories in the vignette-based instrument. Specifically, anxiety $( 1 5 . 0 \% )$ , nervousness $( 1 2 . 4 \% )$ , and happiness $( 9 . 7 \% )$ were the top three most commonly experienced emotions, while contempt $( 0 . 9 \% )$ , surprise $( 2 . 6 \% )$ , and pride $( 2 . 8 \% )$ were the least frequently reported emotions. A close examination of emotions in each scenario category revealed that anxiety was among the top two emotions for allcategories, namely, cognitive $( 1 7 . 5 \% )$ , social scenarios $( 9 . 9 \% )$ , motivational $( 1 2 . 2 \% )$ , time management $( 2 2 . 1 \% )$ , and environment and technology $( 1 3 . 0 \% )$ . Similarly, nervousness was also among the top three emotions for four scenario categories, including cognitive $( 1 1 . 0 \% )$ social $( 1 3 . 0 \% )$ , time management $( 1 6 . 7 \% )$ , and environment and technology $( 2 0 . 6 \% )$ . Among the participants who chose the "Other" option in the vignette urvey to write down their emotions, a signficant number of responses explictly indicated no emotions (129 instances). Aditionally, we calculated the frequency of specific emotions expressed by the participants that were not included in our predefined list of emotion markers. These additional emotions include annoyance (9 instances), feeing empathetic (6 instances) embarrasment (4 instances, and several other emotions that were reported only once, such as helplessness feeling energized, fulfillment, confidence, fatigue, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and fear.

# 4.2. Quantitative findings on learners' emotion regulation strategies

Through the thematic analysis of the open responses obtained from the vignettes, this study identified six distinct emotion. regulation families and 30 specific strategies utilized to regulate emotions (see Table 5). The most frequently reported regulation family was co-regulation $( 2 3 . 7 \% )$ , followed by cognitive change $( 1 9 . 6 \% )$ , response regulation $( 1 7 . 2 \% )$ , task-related regulation $( 1 2 . 4 \% )$ , situation modification $( 1 1 . 5 \% )$ , and attention deployment $( 1 1 . 3 \% )$

Co-regulation (352, $2 3 . 7 \%$ is the most popular strategy in the present study, which concerns how learners interact with others to regulate their own and group members' emotions in a collaborative learning setting. It includes seven specific strategies.

$\bullet$ Negotiation with peers (224, $1 5 . 1 \%$ involves exchanging ideas and perspectives with peers in the group in order to achieve a shared understanding regarding learning goals, content, and strategies.   
$\bullet$ Providing help (49, $3 . 3 \%$ denotes the act of offering help or giving suggestions to peers when they are faced with challenges.   
$\bullet$ Comparison with peers (35, $2 . 4 \%$ is learning from peers by comparing their own performance to that of their peers, which usually occurs during peer assessment activities.   
$\bullet$ Encouragement (14, $0 . 9 \%$ refers to learners' assistance in regulating peer's emotions by encouraging them.

$\bullet$ Seeking for help (17, $1 . 1 \%$ means asking the teacher or peers for help when getting in trouble.

$\bullet$ Thanking (9, $0 . 6 \% )$ involves expressing gratitude towards others who have supported them, as well as the associated feeling of gratefulness. $\bullet$ Social sharing (4, $0 . 3 \%$ pertains to how learners share their emotional states with people who are not involved in the class. For example, if someone feels anxious when performing a task, he may tel thedifficulties to his group membersto relieve her anxiety.

Cognitive change (291, $1 9 . 6 \%$ is the second most common strategy that addresses how learners reframe or reinterpret the emotionnducing situations. It is composed of four strategies.

$\bullet$ Acceptance (239, $1 6 . 1 \%$ ) corresponds to the process whereby learners, upon recognizing problems or receiving divergent opinions from other groups, reassesste situations and adopt a positive outlook. For instance, when faced with criticism in peer feedback, learners tend to view it positively and acknowledge its potential benefits for their growth.   
$\bullet$ Effort-oriented decision (36, $2 . 4 \%$ pertains to the proactive decision made by learners to increase their effort and devote more time and energy to the task. These decisions are usually based on personal interests, passions, and the pursuit of excellence.   
$\bullet$ Reassurance (15, $1 . 0 \% )$ is particularly related to self-efficacy, in which learners engage in self-talk, such as I believe I can succeed."   
$\bullet$ Duty-driven decision (1, $0 . 1 \% )$ is guided by a sense of responsibility, obligation, or moral duty. For example, someone initially does not do a task seriously and do not have much interest and passion for the task, but when he notices that group members are serious about the learning activity, he feels he should be responsible for taking it seriously as well.

Response modification (255, $1 7 . 2 \%$ is the least popular strategy which comprises the physical actions learners utilize to either reduce or intensify their emotions. It contains seven sub-strategies.

$\bullet$ Doing nothing (207, $1 3 . 9 \%$ shows that one will not take any actions to regulate his or her emotions. Following Liu and Yu (2022), the act of doing nothing is categorized as response regulation as it also suggests possble immediate responses. It should be noted that this strategy also occurs when one desires to sustain a desirable emotion.   
$\bullet$ Suppression (26, $1 . 7 \%$ refers to the conscious inhibition of emotional responses by learners, often allowing them to persist through challenging tasks.   
$\bullet$ Resting/relaxing (16, $1 . 1 \%$ includes learners' actions to rest their minds, typically by engaging in physical activity such as playing games, laying down, or sleeping.   
$\bullet$ Breathing (4, $0 . 3 \%$ concerns the practice of taking deep breaths by learners when faced with emotional challenges.   
$\bullet$ Meditation (1, $0 . 1 \% )$ is an uncommon strategy employed by only one participant and it involves sustained concentration on one's own mental state.   
$\bullet$ Food and drink (1, $0 . 1 \%$ means that learners regulate emotions by comfort eating and drinking.

Attention deployment (168, $1 1 . 3 \%$ involves two strategies regarding learners' conscious paying attention or shifting of attention away from emotion-inducing events to other activities that could help them manage their emotions.

$\bullet$ Task focus (144, $9 . 7 \%$ is characterized by how learners concentrate on the task itself rather than become preoccupied with emotional dilemmas.   
$\bullet$ Distraction (24, $1 . 6 \%$ refers to the act of learners diverting their attention towards something that demands less emotional engagement.

Task-related regulation (185, $1 2 . 4 \%$ involves the activities taken by learners in regard to their performance in the collaborative academic reading project. This includes eight specific strategies.

$\bullet$ Performance enhancement (58, $3 . 9 \%$ ) covers students' efforts to improve their performance. For example, students do more preparation via rehearsal practice to improve their performance and alleviate anxiety about oral presentations.   
$\bullet$ Analyzing problems (51, $3 . 4 \%$ concerns the process of analyzing problems that arise during the reading project and figuring out the solutions, or reflecting on areas where the students does not perform well in order to improve future performance.   
$\bullet$ Using a dictionary (28, $1 . 9 \% \big ]$ to look up the meaning of new words.   
$\bullet$ Addressing problems (23, $1 . 5 \%$ ) represents learners' active coping with the antecedents of emotions they encounter in each sce. nario by creating new or alternative solutions to address them.   
$\bullet$ Setting sub-tasks (15, $1 . 0 \% )$ refers to those measures taken by students to break down complex tasks into smaller and more manageable ones that can be completed individually.   
$\bullet$ Skimming/scanning (4, $0 . 3 \%$ are strategies used for improving reading comprehension and saving time.   
$\bullet$ Searching key words (3, $0 . 2 \%$ refers to the process of looking for relevant and useful information on a particular subject that will facilitate understanding the research paper.   
$\bullet$ Reading key points (3, $0 . 2 \%$ means reading the important sentences that effectively convey the main idea.

Situation modification (171, $1 1 . 5 \%$ ) involves three strategies used by learners to alter a situation so as to be free from its emotional impact.

$\bullet$ Task enactment (88, $5 . 9 \%$ involves taking actions that directly alter a learning situation in order to change its emotional impact (e. g., abandoning the previous decision on the selection of reading materials and choosing a more engaging article for the group to read and discuss). The difference between task enactment and task-related strategies is that the latter does not entail directly changing the learning situation or adjusting learning strategies.   
$\bullet$ Task management (80, $5 . 4 \%$ is associated with time management strategies, which may include adjusting the allocation of time or rescheduling tasks to ensure timely completion.   
$\bullet$ Task avoidance (3, $0 . 2 \%$ refers to learners' behaviors about avoiding challenging tasks in order to alleviate potential negative emotions.

Vague responses (64, $4 . 3 \%$ means that learners do not specify what emotion-regulation strategies they use to solve the problem. As Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) did in their study, such a category is only designed for statistical analysis and it does not represent any data regarding emotion-regulation strategies.

# 4.3. Qualitative interview analysis

Qualitative interview analysis was conducted to gain a contextualized understanding of the emotion-inducing factors and emotion regulation strategies of the students in online cllborative academic reading. Based on the thematic analysis of the interview transcripts of 16 participants, three prominent themes about sources of positive emotions and five themes regarding negative-emotioninducing factors were generated and presented below.

# 4.3.1. Sources of positive emotions

The majority of interviewees (around $9 0 \%$ ) expressed their satisfaction with the online collaborative reading activity and highlighted its usefulness They specifically emphasized the benefits of reading crcles in improving thir academic reading skills and fostering a cooperative and mutually supported learning environment. For instance, one participant mentioned, I used to read academic papers in the same way that I read ordinary articles. But this activity gave me a pathway to enhance my approach to reading academic papers" (9-1). Another participant stated, \*When we worked together to get this job done, it's like everyone coming together as a united force, we all contributed and collaborated towards a common goal, and it feels awesome" (S3).

Three sources of positive emotions were identified among the learners in this study: topic interest, experiencing mastery and achievement, and recognition from others. The learners expresed positive emotions such as enjoyment and interest when they were engaged in reading artices with interesting topics (e.g. S2). Another source of positive emotions emerged from the experience of mastery and achievement. Learners reported a sense of happiness i relation to the new language knowledge they had acquired while reading (e.g. S10-1). Additionall, the participants highlighted the significance of receiving recognition from others as a source of positive emotions during online collaborative reading. They shared instances where they felt acknowledged and valued through positive comments from other groups, leading to feelings of pride and happiness (e.g. S1-1).

At first, I was a lttle bored when I read the paper, but I flt surprised later because the topic f the paper matched my interests. (S2)

Inthis task, I came across some really cool words and wrote them down to add to my ocabulary. Such a proces made me fel enjoyable and interested. (S10-1)

If the comment given to me was a compliment, I would be proud. Because it's a result of our team's hard work. It's relly happy to be recognized and praised. (S1-1)

4.3.2. Sources of negative emotions and the corresponding regulation strategies

Reading dificulties. One of the most ited sources of negative emotions in the interview stemmed from the cognitive challenges caused by reading difficulties. Many interviewees $( 7 8 . 9 \% )$ reported that they experienced anxiety, stress, confusion, and fear when they encountered academic texts that were difficult to comprehend. These reading difficulties were often caused by unfamiliar technology, lengthy text and unfamiliar topics (e.g., S8-2; s1-2). Cognitie change was found to be a popular strategy adopted by the interviewees to regulate their negative emotions whil facing reading diffculties. Through cognitive change, some students changed the way they perceived reading dificulties and started to view them as valuable learning opportunitie (e.g., S8-2). To regulate the negative emotions induced by reading obstacles, students also engaged in soliciting group members help to solve problems in reading (\$9-2). This was consistent with the results of the quantitative analyses that showed a high percentage of cognitive change and co regulation strategies in response to cognitive scenarios. Additionall, the interviewees also adopted task-related strategies like using a dictionary, skimming and scanning, or setting sub-tasks to solve the problems (e.g. S1-2).

When  firs rd this lengty aper wth may techncl terms I deit fet  it anious bause  hd ther tsks to do, nd time was tight. [.] But later on, I realized that I shouldn't just se reading papers as a burden, but a good opportunity to learn. (S8-2)

I had two sentences that I was unsure about, so I posted them in the group chatroom. I asked the other members for their opinions and sugestions on how to properly paraphrase the sentences. They were quite active and provided me with some very helful advice. (9-2)

There were so many new words, this reall impeded my reading. It relly bothered and tortured me, but I found a cool online dictionary app called Eudic that helped me out. (S1-2)

Challenges in interacting with group members. Challenges encountered during group interactions were seen as a significant factor in shaping the students' negative emotions. Students reported feeing embarrassed and demotivated when their messages received no response or sugestions were not accepted (eg, S5-1). Some students also mentioned the problem of low willingness to communicate, particularly at the start of the collaborative reading project (e.g., S7).

I posted something, and nobody responded, which made me feel a little embarrassed and unmotivated. (S5-1)

Perhaps everyone felt little embarrassed to speak up, so we alltried to solve the problem ourselves. Initiall, there was very litle exchange of content within the group. (S7)

Interestingly, memes were found to play an important role in regulating negative emotions that emerged in group discussions. Students reported that memes promoted group communication, activated the working atmosphere, and relieved stress (e.g., S8-3). Some students also mentioned that having a proactive group leader could help alleviat embarrssment in the group's chatting room, enhance their willingness to communicate, and promote the progress of collaborative reading (e.g., S6).

My group members who like to post funy memes relly helped me out, especially when I was struggling. lso, I was more confident about the sub-tasks that they were doing. (S8-3)

When one ntke th iativoush fdth sk, ns rese is gal ive. nthis st, w stllfel tt t s pe to continue with the task. It gives us a sense that things will get smoother as we move forward. (S6).

Low-qualit feedback from other groups. Some students expressed disappointment in receiving superficial comments that lacked constructive feedback (e.g. S9-3). The interview findings revealed that the students tended to provide more positive feedback, but struggled to give negative feedack that directly pointed out the problems. As one student noted, \*When I wrote comments, I felt very embarrased to tellhim what's nt ood  strggled alot whe I trie toffer constructive feedback. Howeve, tudents reported that they were eager to receive feedback that included specific and constructive sugestions, as they believed this was the most effective way to foster growth (e.g. S7).

I was a bit dsappoined whenrdhe comments bause they ddnt reall impres me. WhileI appreciated the paise, sugstions were just as important. (S9-3)

I think sharp comments can be beneficial because if you only hear positive comments, they won't help you improve. Sometimes, criticism from stranger can leave a deeper impression on you and help you make ter changes in the futre. If you only hear a unch of poitive comments, you won't learn much from them. ( S7 )

Online learning environment and technology issues. More than half the interviewees encountered various environmental and technological problems that contributed to negative emotional experiences. Online communication can potentially cause unexpected circumstances and thus elit undesired emotions. The learners pointed out some problems such as message delay in communication, lack of eye contact, and low social presence (e.g, S1-3, s10-2). Likewise, learners experienced technological issues that led to unpleasant emotions. For example, S11 expressed her guilt in an unexpected situation where a technological malfunction with her computer camera resulted in the entire group waiting for her for over an hour. Nevertheless learners exhibited adaptive behaviors such as employing positive self-talk to maintain a positive mental state.

I couldn't requre everyone to turn on the camera. There was no eye contact among us, only messge exchange. This was ufavorable but I gave myself positive psychological cues and tried to motivate my peers. (S1-3)

Sometimes I wanted tocontact a group member, but t happened that he was not there, there was such a message delay in communication. And the atmosphere of online discussion was not as good as face-to-face learning. (S10-2)

I didn't know why the computer camera couldn't work and it took me more than an hour to fix it. My team members kept waiting for me and I felt quite guilty. (S11)

Time pressure. Time stress resulting from procrastination or the increased workload at the end of the semester, was cited by over two-thirds of interviewees as a predominant issue that evoked negative emotions. The inclination to delay the assigned task until the deadine could induce anxiety among leaners. Nevertheles the learners tended to adapt themselves to ensure the task was completed on schedule, often driven by a sense of responsibility or motivated by enthusiastic group members (e.g. 5-2, S4).

Frankly speaking, I did not perform well in time management because of my procrastination. I let  lot of sub-tasks until the end. But in group work, I felt that I had a kind of responsibility, so I tried to be active. (S5-2)

They all finished their parts seriously, on time, in good quality and quantit. So I pushed myself to keep pace with them. (S4)

# 5. Discussion

This study revealed a relatively balanced distribution of positive and negative emotions among EFL learners during digital collaborative academic reading activities, which contradicts the findings of Bielak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) who identified negative emotions as ominant among college Eglish language learners in Poland. Our finding is also different from that of Liu and Yu (2021) who found positive emotions to be the most reported emotional state among Chinese master's students during supervisory writing feedback situations. These contradictory findings may be explained by the context-specific nature of emotions (Linnen brink-Garcia et al., 2011). Unlike prior studies that focused on non-collaborative learning situations (e.g., Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak; Liu & Yu, 2021), this study specifically examined online cllaborative academic reading contexts, which were known to be enjoyable and wellreceived by students (Li et al. 2021), while at the same time posing various challenges that may trigger negative emotions (Jin et al., 2022). This study sheds light on the emotional experiences of students in this particular context, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex nature of emotions in collaborative language learning.

This study contributes additional empirical evidence for the multifaceted positive emotions and their sources among the students engaged in digital collaborative academic reading. The findings indicated a diverse array of frequently reported positive emotions, incuding happiness inerest, rlie, ecitment, gratitde, and pride. Thi i in accordance with Li and Li's (2022) finding tha college English language leaners generally hold favorable feelings toward collaborative reading. The result also confirmed the significanceof positive emotions as crucial elements in language learning (Shao et al., 2019), underscoring the necessty for a comprehensive examination of both positive and negative emotions, as supported by researchers applying the burgeoning theory of positie psychology in language education (MacIntyre et al., 2016). The interview analysis further uncovered three istinct sources of positive emotions: interest in the topic, experiencing mastery and achievement, and recognition from other groups. This suggests that positive emotions are not solely reliant on individual perceptions of task interest and students' appraisals of their own mastery and progress Pekrun 2006), but ae also socially constructed and shaped by the recognition and positive feedback received from peers (Nakamura, 2023) Language teachers implementing collaborative academic reading are therefore advised to offer engaging reading materials to better facilitate knowledge acquisition, whilealso promoting positive fedback that signals progress among students (Fresacher, 2016; Ibrahim, 2016).

This study also enhances our understanding of language learners' emotion regulation in online collaborative academic reading by establishing a comprehensive and nuanced taxonomy of strategies with an inovative vignette-based survey. Altogether 30 specific strategies and six emotion-regulation families were identified: task-related regulation, response modification, cognitive change, attention deployment, corlation, and sitation modfication. hese trateg fales are diffent fromthe taxonmy f Biak and Mystkowska-Wiertelak (2020) as two additional dimensions were added: co-regulation and task-related regulation. The inclusion of these two categories in our framework not only enhances the congruence with the challenges inherent in academic reading but also enables acomprehensive examination of students' regulation strategies within collaborative learning contexts (Jarvenoja & Jarvela, 2009).

In particular, the findings highlighted the critical role of co-regulation as it was reported as the most popular emotion-regulation strategy. This type of regulation strategy is an extension of Gross (2015) classfication of emotion regulation strategies, and it is consistent with the socio-interactive and dialogical characterisics of collaborative leaning (Linnenbrink-Garcia et al., 2011). Inthis study, co-regulation often occurs when students engage in discussing the problems encountered in collaboration, scaffolding peers academic reading comprehension, or negotiating how to deliver the reading report. Such proceses can build an emotional dimension of the zone of proximal development, in which students become sources of prs emotional scafflding in the language learning process (Liu &Yu, 2021). Interestingly, compared with conventional face-to-face collaborative learning, online collaboration was found to be advantageous in that memes aforded by online discussion tool play an important role in co-regulating negative emotions within groups. This is in line with previous studies in that memes function as a mediation technique to co-regulate emotions and maintain a positive socio-emotional climate in online collaborative learning (Zhang et al., 2021).

The findings also underscored the significance of cognitive change as an effective strategy for alleiating negative emotions experienced by students during digital collaborative academic reading. This aligns with previous research that has identified conitive change as a commonly employed strategy among college English language learners (Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020; Geng & Yu, 2022). Cognitive change involves modifying learners' perception of emotional situations. Our participants reported that, when confronted with demotivation during collborative reading, they tended to adjust their perception of the activity to reinforce their positive appreciation of the task's value in faclitating their own skill development. Previous studies have identified social-culural barriers (eg, teacher-centered pedagogy, grammar-oriented exams) that hindered students' preference for and participation in collaborative learning, particularly in Chinese or other Eastern societies (Lin, 2017; Xu, 2023). Hence, it is crucial for teachers to emphasize the relevance and value of collaborative reading tasks to foster positive cognitive change and task involvement. Addi tionall, our study introduced a new sub-strategy termed \*duty-driven decision' within the cognitive change category. Some participants demonstrated a sense of responsibility towards group members striving to successfullyaccomplish group tass despite experiencing negative emotions induced by various lerning challenges. It would be intriguing for future research to examine whether such an emotion regulation strategy is present in other language learning contexts.

Finally, the qualitative analysis results yielded a contextualized understanding of the major antecedents for negative emotions, highlighting the need to consider them when implementing online collborative academic reading activities.First, other-oriented antecedents (e.g, challenges in interacting with group members; low-quality feedback from external groups) played a more important role in arousing negative emotions such as embarrassment and disappointment. This was inconsistent with Jiang and Dewaele (2019) who reported that negative emotions in foreign language learning were primarily influenced by leaners self-oriented variables. This difference can be attributed to the distinction betwee individual and collaborative learning context as social interactional factors can easily trigger negative activating emotions in learning groups (Linnenbrink -Garcia et al. 2011; Jarvenoja et al., 2019) Secondly, th issue of reading difficulties must be taken into account during the transitin from general Englis to academic English. This often leads to anxiety among students due to a lack of control over academic reading tasks. Consistent with the control-value theory (Pekrun, 2006), our study proposes that teachers can increase students control by offering reading materials that match their language proficiency level, promoting autonomy in paper selection, and providing training in academic reading strategies. Thirdly, the findings echoed the those of Yang et al. (2021), which demonstrated that the online cllaboration environment may have unique antecedents for negative emotions (e.g., internet connection problems, limited eye contact, and low social presence). Addtionally, time pressure stemming from procrastination and heavy external workloads deserves specialattention, as it was a prevailing factor igniting negative emotions, confirming that time management is a critical dimension of self-regulation in digital collaborative English learning projects (Li et al., 2021).

# 6. Conclusions, pedagogical implications and future studies

Language learners' emotions and emotion regulation strategies have been underresearched in online collaborative learning settings (Zhang et al., 2021). Using an integrated method of vignette-based survey and semi-structred interviews, this study eriched previous research by providing initial insight into EFL learners' multifaceted emotions and emotion-regulation strategies in the context of collaborative academic reading. By identifying the sources of positive and negative emotions, the study could also shed light on how EFL teaching practitioners could organize online collaborative academic reading in a way conducive to collaboration and learning. More importantly, building upon previous clssifications of emotion reulation strategies (e.g., Bielak & Mystkowska-Wiertelak, 2020; Gross, 2015), the study developed a new representative taxonomy of emotion regulation strategies talored to digital collaborative academic reading setings. In addition, the vignett framework serves as a practical guide for investigating emotions and emotion regulation strategies in technology-enhanced collaborative learning, highlighting key factors that evoke emotions during online collaboration.

This study offers several pedagogical implications. Firstly, a range of positive emotions was observed among students engaged in collaborative academic reading circes, and previous studies showed that positive emotions are associated with increased motivation and achievement (e.g., Camacho-Morles et al., 2019; Yoshida, 2020). Therefore, we encourage teachers to utilize various digital platforms, such as social anotation tool, forums, and collaborative editing tools to facilitate academic reding within the frmework of reading circles. Secondly, our study identified significant sources of negative emotions, including reading dificultie, low-quality feedback from external groups, and technology-related chllenges. To address these isues, teachers should empower students by providing reading materials aligned with their language proficiency level, familiarizing them with technology tools, and offering training to enhance their awareness and abilit to provide constructive feedack during collaborative reading. Thirdly, our findings underscored the importance of employing cognitive change strategies and fostering a sense of responsibility to enhance students well-being during collaborative reading. We recommend that teachers organize orientation activities to highlight the benefits of collaborative learning, introduce the concept of accountability, and encourage students with negative attitudes to reframe their mindset and proactively address potential collaboration challenges. Fourthl, given the pivotal role of co-regulation in managing negative emotions during collborative reading, we propose that teachers adopt a structured approach in activity design, encompassing planning, monitoring, and evaluation staes, and then provide reulation guidance ach stage to learning groups to facilitate students' collaboration and emotional regulation. Finally, our study reveals the importance of emoji-based co-regulation behaviors in maintaining and enhancing the social-emotional climate within the group. Consequently, we recommend that teachers encourage students to leverage emojis during communication with their group members as a means of regulating emotions and fostering positive social-emotional interactions.

Several issues could be explored in future studies. Firstly, although the affordances of using the vignette method for exploring value-laden constructs such as students' emotions have ben well acknowledged, this method has limitations in depicting the complete storyline of emotions' emergence and evolution. To provide a comprehensive account of the dynamic development of emotions and emotion reulation strategies over time, futurestdie could use narrative inqury techniques within an interpretive resarch paradigm (Liu & Yu, 2022). Secondly, the specific roles each student played in the reading circles activity might impact their emotion and participation. Future rearch can investigate the impact of roles in collaborative academic reading on students emotions and emotion regulation strategies. Thirdy, due to the limitations in data sources, this study did not distinguish co-regulation from socially shared regulation of students' emotions (Jarvenoja & Jarvela, 2009). Future research could overcome this limitation by collecting dialogue data from group interactions and conducting a more nuanced analysis of emotion regulation processes by further distinguishing co-regulation and shared regulation. Furthermore, relevant regulation guidance can be formulated and implemented based on the positive and negative emotional sources identified in this study to better facilitate and support the social and emotional interactions among the students engaging in online collaborative academic reading groups.
