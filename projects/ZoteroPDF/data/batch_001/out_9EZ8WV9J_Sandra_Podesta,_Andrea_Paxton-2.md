# Introduction

Since the first and second editions of our book were published, the world has changed in dramatic ways, many of which have affected the job market and the job search process. The greatest change in the job hunt is that it now takes place almost entirely online. Thanks to the Internet, you can identify your preferred geographic location, industry, organization, and position without leaving your desk. You can network, apply, and even interview online.

In many profound ways, the Internet makes the search far easier. It’s equally easy, however, to be lulled into a false complacency that can significantly extend the length of your search and compromise your success. For example, the incredible simplicity of applying for jobs online means that many people apply for jobs they are unqualified to fill, which can swell an applicant pool to an unwieldy size. As a result, truly qualified applicants can be overlooked. To get noticed, to make a genuine impact, the serious candidate has to work harder and smarter, networking more effectively and making contact more strategically and more frequently than ever before.

Do you hate to write? Most people do. But this book makes it easy! And here’s why your cover letters are so vital to your success: employers don’t want to hire a list of jobs, job responsibilities, dates, degrees, coursework, and affiliations. They want to hire a person—a living, breathing human being. Someone with a personality. A humorous coworker or a serious one. A team player or a self-starter. An intuitive thinker or someone who takes direction well. Sure, they want to hire a candidate with the appropriate skills, but they’ve got to like that person (you), too.

After all, they’ll be working with you on a daily basis—and the better everyone gets along, the more productive the work will be.

What this means is that you must project your personality, or some aspect of it, from the very first ad you respond to and in the very first letter you write. The reason is that, to make a hiring decision, your next employer is looking for the answers to four vital questions:

1. Do you have the skills that this job requires?   
2. Will you be compatible with my team?   
3. Are you honest and willing to work, and do you have the right   
attitude?   
4. Are you a good fit for my organization?

Your resume will answer the first question. Your letters or e-mails, interviews, and references will answer the other three questions. Thus, your jobhunting letters are an essential opportunity to make yourself stand out as a unique and interesting person, someone who an employer would like to meet, interview, hire, and work beside.

To get an edge over your competition, you should not only write, but write often. Why? Most job applicants—your competition—never follow up after an interview. Of those who do, many write letters that are so inadequate that they actually impair what might have been a perfectly acceptable candidacy. Furthermore, most job search letters are forgotten after a quick review. What this means is that writing your potential employer at all can put you ahead of other candidates. Writing a strong, impressive letter can put you miles ahead. And writing frequently can give you what advertisers call “top-of-mind awareness”: it can keep you on your next employer’s “radar” no matter how long the hiring decision takes.

Don’t despair, there is good news! Writing effectively is not as hard as you think. You don’t have to be a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist. You don’t have to use eight four-syllable words per paragraph. You don’t have to make your correspondence any longer than it needs to be; writing voluminous letters won’t guarantee that you’ll get hired. You only have to make yourself understood. You need to know what you want to say, and you need to say it clearly, accurately, and concisely.

And that is precisely what this book will help you achieve. With this book, and the downloadable content that accompanies it, you hold in your hands a powerful advantage. Because the vast majority of jobhunters will choose not to write cover letters or e-mails, when you do, you will stand out from your competition in an important way. Suddenly, you will get noticed as the one who is thorough, takes the extra step, is not lazy, and strives for what he or she wants. In short, you will be the person who appeals to your next employer as being precisely the representative who will contribute to the success of his or her organization. And that is what it takes to land the job you want.

This book is the product of our successful jobhunting seminar, and of years of work in recruiting, writing resumes, branding, and marketing communications. Our clients use our techniques and achieve results. They are selected for interviews more often and offered the positions they are after. Frequently, we hear that a major benefit our seminar delivered was the simple encouragement to try something different in a letter. Openings that intrigue. Body copy that boasts. Formats that fascinate. We’re delighted! We hope this book will do the same for you.

# How to Use This Book

and the Accompanying Downloadable Content

201 Killer Cover Letters is for any job seeker who finds it difficult to write the perfect cover letter—and that’s almost all of us! This book tells you how to write every type of job search letter you’ll ever need and puts at your fingertips a library of letters that will get noticed and get results.

Please note that throughout this book, the word letter refers to any and all types of written communication, including e-mail, handwritten notes, and even typed letters sent via “snail mail.”

The special bonus downloadable content contains all 201 killer cover letters featured in the book. You don’t even have to retype them—just change the specifics to suit your circumstances, and they’re ready to send!

Before using the downloadable content, peruse the book. If you’re pressed for time, at least read Chapters 1 and 2, which provide information on jobhunting online, as well as the basic dos and don’ts for writing effective job search letters. Chapter 3 helps you identify and position your strengths. Take a few minutes to complete Worksheets 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 in this chapter. Doing so will furnish you with several powerful sentences that you can use immediately in the body copy of your letters.

Then you can move on to the specific chapters that focus on the particular type of letter you’re writing; in each chapter, you’ll find sample letters, as well as a choice of sample openings and closings. (Every letter is numbered; Letter 5-12, for example, refers to Chapter 5, Letter 12.) The title of each letter gives the industry or the specific position that is of interest to the job seeker, and in some cases mentions issues that are addressed in the letter. For example, a heading that includes “Job Loss” indicates that the letter contains a reference to downsizing, layoffs, a job being eliminated, a merger or acquisition, the challenging economy, or another such scenario that affects either the writer or the reader. “Workforce Return” demonstrates that the letter is from someone who is returning to the job market after time away. “Salary” indicates a salary discussion that may provide ideas for you to use. “Confidentiality” refers to a request for discretion in contacting the jobhunter at his or her present place of employment, and so on. For quick reference, turn to the Index of Letters by Industry and Job Title and the Index of Letters That Address Specific Issues at the end of the book.

In using the model letters provided, it’s important that you personalize them so that they don’t sound too generic. Remember to pay attention to visual appearance, as well. All of the text provided here can be used in letter or e-mail form, but you’ll need to do some simple reformatting, cutting, and pasting in order to be certain that its appearance is appropriate for the medium you choose.

In addition to all the cover letters in the book, the downloadable content also includes Worksheets 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 from Chapter 3 for those who prefer to complete these worksheets on the computer. What’s more, you’ll find expert tips, templates, and samples to help you create your own killer resume!

# Downloadable Templates and Samples for Creating Killer Resumes

If you don’t already have a resume to use in your job search, you can use the templates and samples included here to create your own. If you have one that uses a skills-based, achievement-based, or combination resume format, you should still prepare a resume in the chronological format. Not only is it generally required by most recruiters, human resource personnel and employers, but it also makes it easier to upload (by cutting and pasting) your job history and information to online job applications. The templates included here are general enough to work in a variety of settings; use them to guide you as you create a strong, focused, easy-toread resume—one that will prove essential to networking, responding to job postings and ads, presenting in personal meetings and at interviews.

Included in the downloadable content, you will find:

■ A template for a one-page Chronological Resume ■ A sample resume using the one-page format ■ A template for a two-page Chronological Resume ■ A sample resume using the two-page format

# Insider Tips to Guide You as You Create Your Own Killer Resume!

Like the killer cover letter, an effective resume gets read, gets remembered, and gets results. To do so, it should include the best of your talents, strengths, and accomplishments…exclude anything that distracts from these…and present you in the most positive, professional way. Here you’ll find expert guidance and real-world examples to help you accomplish these objectives by focusing on the three elements integral to a killer resume: Profile, Content, and Format.

# Jobhunting in Today’s New World

Our world is driven by technology and its ability to connect us. Virtually everything we do involves the Internet, especially our interactions with others. We talk, text, tweet, e-mail, message, conference, send videos, and video chat via phones, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even built-in car phone systems. Rapidly evolving, ever-improving technology touches every aspect of our lives—and the revolution is still in its infancy. Naturally, the job search is no exception.

For jobhunters, the place to be is online. You can use the Internet to search for openings, build networks, create a personal brand and digital footprint, upload resumes, complete applications, and even interview. Most start-ups, entrepreneurs, and multinational corporations maintain active career centers on their websites, as do academic, political, government, and nonprofit organizations. Recruiters source, contact, and track candidates using systems and software that streamline the process, refine searches, and increase placement percentages. And of course, given the economic implosion that began in 2008, a vast number of search-related websites are generating substantial revenue from all this electronic activity, and new sites continue to be launched.

While so much has changed, some constants remain. Chief among them is the direct and indisputable link between the jobhunter’s effort and the success of his or her search. Those who devote more time and energy to the process are the ones who are securing interviews and landing jobs, often more quickly. However, what is equally important is that, despite all the resources and capabilities that the Internet affords, sitting at the computer all day, every day rarely results in a job offer. Successful jobhunters wisely capitalize on virtual online communities to forge promising connections, then initiate actual conversations, attend actual networking events, and schedule actual face-to-face meetings. The fact is, networking is still the number one vehicle that drives jobhunting success—and you are in the driver’s seat.

Today, you can count on technology to introduce access and opportunity to a process that most people find daunting, disheartening, and difficult. You can thank recruiters and hiring managers for maintaining a focus on the human side, the person at the core of the “search.” What’s up to you, then, is to tap the resources that are available to you, create optimal connections to people to whom you present the unique combination of strengths, talents, experience, and achievements that you, and you alone, have to offer. This book will help you accomplish just that.

The amount of information and the number of resources that are available to you online are quite simply staggering. It’s genuinely impossible to calculate how many websites cater to those who are in the market for a job. This is partly because there are too many to count. And it’s also because underutilized or underfunded sites shut down, successful ones are acquired by larger competitors, and new ones are launched every day. The bottom line is this: there is no excuse for not tapping this valuable source of information. So if you’re not already familiar with using the Internet, search engines, social media, and e-mail, get serious about it. Take courses. Ask friends or family members, especially children and grandchildren. Read books (yes, there are books that can help, such as the “for Dummies” series that includes The Internet for Dummies, JobHunting and Career Change All-in-One for Dummies, Job Searching with Social Media for Dummies, Job Search Online for Dummies, Job Interviews for Dummies, and more).

# Career and Job Search Advice

If you’re not sure what type of job you want, or if you are considering a career change, start exploring online. Search possible job titles or industry names to get a general understanding of them. Search specific companies, organizations, and professional associations to discover how certain jobs fit into the organization’s operations and bottom line. Visit job boards (described later in this chapter) to discover what a specific job entails, what you would be responsible for in that position, and what qualifications you’ll need to have in order to be eligible for consideration.

You can also search online for professional career coaches who can assist you in determining an appealing and appropriate career path to pursue. Thanks to the Internet, you are not limited to those in your city, town, or region; geographic borders disappear online.

# How to Find Job Openings Online: Job Boards and More

To uncover jobs in your area, specialty, or industry or at specific organizations that interest you, visit online job boards like Monster.com, CareerBuilder, and TheLadders. These are just three of the hundreds of sites from which to choose; some of them list all jobs, while others target specific niches such as administrative staff, nursing, financial services, or nonprofits.

For example, general job boards include jobs of all types in all locations, industries, and sectors. Composite or aggregate job boards feature a sampling of job postings collected from other sites. Niche sites focus on jobs in particular industries, sectors, locations, affiliations, or other specific categories. Some of these are listed here; you’ll find direct links to these and many others in the downloadable content that accompanies your purchase of this book.

With so many choices, it’s easy to search by job title or by industry, state, region, city, or even salary level—and because most job boards include salaries, they are indispensable in determining realistic salaries or salary ranges for the positions you are seeking.

Job boards are not the only source of job listings online. Many companies devote space on their corporate websites to presenting career opportunities and job postings. The same is true for nonprofit organizations. You may also check the career centers on the sites of the high school, college, university, and graduate schools you attended and those of professional associations of which you are a member.

# How to Connect to People Who Can Help: Professional Networking Sites

Professional networking sites like LinkedIn are proving increasingly productive. Not only are more jobhunters forging connections that are leading them to openings, referrals, and contacts, but many people now expect to be tapped for help, making it more comfortable for you to ask. So by all means, use these sites to build your own professional network.

Spend some time creating a strong professional profile, which, as a bonus, allows recruiters to find you when they search online for candidates with skills like yours, even if you were not actively looking at the position they are seeking to fill. Then forge connections with anyone who can:

Provide information on a career or job that you are considering. Connect you to someone who works in an industry or at a company that interests you.   
Recommend you to fill a specific job opening.

Once you’ve developed a solid network, you might post an item of interest every few weeks, such as a recent accomplishment, a recommendation, or a link to an article or blog that presents a new or fresh insight on some aspect of your industry—always positive and upbeat rather than a complaint about the job market. The Internet makes it easy and fun to create this network. It also makes it easy for you to feel productive when you’re sitting at your computer without necessarily being productive; keep in mind that it’s not about counting how many connections you have. Ultimately, your objective is to propel your search from the faceless world of online jobhunting to the real world, where you meet real people face to face and secure advice, additional connections, leads, interviews, and offers. That is what will make you, and your search, productive.

# How (and Whether) to Use Social Media and Blogging Sites

Social media can be useful—but only if you are disciplined in your approach to them. As with professional networking, your goal is to make connections that will lead to an interview. If you are active on social media and blogging sites, and if you are connected to people who can help you on a professional level, these resources may help advance your search. If this is the case, you’ll want to make sure that your posts and updates are never too personal, potentially embarrassing, or unprofessional. However, if your connections and posts are predominantly casual and unrelated to business, you are better off using professional networking sites for your search.

# How to Create and Maintain Your Online Presence

Using the Internet for your job search requires you to create and main tain an online presence. Creating it is easy: visit the social media and networking sites on which you wish to be accessible to others, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. These sites will guide you through the simple (though sometimes maddening) process of adding, writing, and uploading information, which typically includes your name, education, work experience, optional photo, recommendations, and preferences. Once you’ve created a profile, you can search for people you know who you can connect with in order to establish a networking base. Include appropriate friends, family members, current professional colleagues, and those you’ve worked with in the past. These connections will link you to others, and before long, you will have built a network that you can tap to identify potential employers, uncover openings before and after they are listed, and actively promote yourself in the search. (See Chapter 4 for specific guidance on networking.)

Maintaining your online presence, however, is entirely different. Enter your own name in a search engine like Google. You’ll be surprised—and possibly shocked—by all that appears. You’ll find links to the profiles you’ve created on social and professional networking sites along with comments you’ve posted on sites such as YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest. You’ll find links to photographs in which you were tagged online or named in a caption in print, such as newspaper articles, alumni magazines, or even church bulletins. If you’ve written blogs, articles, or books or appeared on television, you’ll find links to these. Expect to see your name listed on the sites of boards, clubs, and associations of which you are a member. Your contact information appears on sites like WhitePages, with more links that for a fee reveal your background, police records, and other such information. You may see the stores at which you’ve created online accounts, references to yourself in newspaper articles that appeared decades ago, and possibly even the obituary of someone with the same name as yours! Combined, all this information serves as your “digital footprint,” and it’s of paramount importance in your search. It’s what recruiters, your networking connections, and your next employer can—and probably will—use to form an impression of you based on where, how, and how often you appear online.

If what you find is not what you want others to see, the first step is to clean it up. Tailor, prune, and delete anything that creates a less than professional image. Remove, unpin, and untag yourself from any photos that may compromise your integrity. Delete posts containing questionable language.

E-mail addresses are part of your profile, too. You may have many, but the one you choose for your job search activity must sound professional. If you’re using “iguanasaremylife@xxx.com,” it’s time to open an account with one of the major providers using your name. MaryBrown@zmail .com not only is more professional, but also helps hiring managers find you more easily when they conduct their own searches. When you have a strong professional profile, recruiters searching for someone with your skill set can find you!

Technology and the Internet have changed how and how often you conduct a job search, but not what makes that search effective. Your personal process remains the same: prepare yourself with a strong, achieve ment-oriented resume, killer jobhunting letters, a networking plan, and the determination to stay on track until you reach your goal. Let the search begin!

# Guidelines to Speed Your Search

In addition to capitalizing on the opportunities afforded to you by technology and the Internet, here are additional guidelines to help speed your search.

# Develop a 12-Month Plan

In today’s challenging job market, many jobhunters are finding that the search is taking significantly longer than it did in the past. Regardless of what expectations you may have or may hear, assume a time frame of at least 12 months for your search. Then, set consistent and realistic daily objectives—ones that you can sustain throughout that period. Chances are, you’ll find that your job search is less like a sprint and more like a marathon. Don’t expect to reach the finish line in a day. Instead, expect to reach for and achieve daily goals, such as networking with 5 contacts per day or 10 new contacts per week. Without this attitude, you’ll view every day as a laborious burden that does not produce results. You’ll risk losing focus, motivation, and direction. You’ll neither write nor interview well, and your search may take even longer.

# Accept Help

Should your previous employer offer you the benefit of outplacement services, seize this valuable opportunity. Explore the resources of federal and local labor departments, the public library, and any associations, unions, or industry groups of which you are a member. Many organizations offer free training programs for which you may be eligible. Investigate every resource that’s offered to you, and then decide which ones may suit your needs.

# Assess Your Skills

Identifying your unique skills, strengths, and traits can be difficult. This is true not because you don’t possess any, but because we so often take our own capabilities for granted. So spend some time considering your skills—or ask a friend or colleague to help you. Jot them down, from the most simple (“I can use both a PC and a Mac”) to the more complex (“I am an expert in Microsoft Office, social media, and website design”) to the truly astonishing (“I brought in $\$ 25$ million in new business as a direct result of developing a Facebook page to attract and engage consumers”). Be sure to use the worksheets in Chapter 3 to help you—you can complete them electronically by using this link: http://www.mhprofessional.com/mediacenter. Once you’ve listed your skills, you can then decide which ones are relevant to the various positions for which you may apply. This becomes especially important if you’re transferring skills to a new job or industry. In every case, identifying what you can do and what sets you apart from other candidates is essential.

# Network, Network, Network

You can’t start soon enough or do too much networking. You’re planning your future, after all, so take charge! Begin by listing all the people to whom you can talk. Don’t limit this to those who may have the job you want. Anyone and everyone can spread the word that you are—or will be—searching for a new position. Whether it’s passing along your resume, providing a referral, connecting you to others on LinkedIn, or simply keeping you in mind should an opportunity arise to mention your name, there’s something for everyone to do. As soon as you know you’ll be looking, draft your list. Begin with the names of friends and family members. To that, add current work contacts, previous employers, coworkers, fellow alumni, and so on. Use your smartphone or tablet to record names, phone numbers, and

# Recruiter’s Tip

# How to Ride the Age Wave

Whether you’re 25 or 75, age may play a role in your job search, despite the fact that the law prohibits age discrimination. If you’re working with a recruiter on a particular position, seek advice on how to handle age issues. Your youth may account for your desirable technological proficiency, your understanding of social media and industry innovations, or the ability to connect with prospects in your age group. Your maturity may suggest more in-depth knowledge or mastery, a historical perspective on your industry or specialty, or experience in managing people and change. Plus, energy, enthusiasm, and adaptability are ageless. So don’t shortchange yourself—get comfortable with your strengths!

e-mail addresses of those who are willing to offer assistance—you never know whom you’ll meet, so be prepared. Develop an “elevator speech,” and practice it out loud with someone you trust. It should explain—in a minute or less—your unique talents and experience, what you are seeking and why, and what benefits you can deliver to your next employer. Print up “business cards” to distribute at opportune moments; these should provide your name, e-mail address, address, phone number(s), and public profile address on LinkedIn and/or similarly appropriate professional networking sites, along with a very brief description of the type of position you are seeking. Seize every opportunity to network—including holidays, conventions, weddings, and reunions, when you’re likely to encounter people you don’t see regularly.

# Follow Up Rigorously

In any jobhunting environment—but especially in a tough one—following up after an interview is imperative. It’s a safe bet that most people don’t write after an interview, and that if they do, they dash off predictable, trite e-mails or letters that do nothing to remind the interviewer of how singularly qualified they are for the positions they desire. So you must never fail to write a strong, well-planned follow-up message. You must also follow through with thank you notes to anyone who offered help and referrals or who served as a reference. In a tough market, the number of interviews you have may be limited. That means you’ll have more time between them, and that deprives you of any excuse for not writing! Once your search is over (and it will be), be certain to inform and thank all those who offered encouragement, contacts, or support, and even those who were willing to help but didn’t, for whatever reason. You never know when your next job search may begin.

# Expect to Be Checked

Be sure to read Chapter 2, “The Top 10 Rules for Writing Killer Cover Letters.” Every rule is vital to an effective job search. Recent events illustrate just how vital. Take the following rule, for example: “tell the truth or pay the consequences.” This rule is crucial in light of today’s corporate scandals, a by-product of which is the fact that background checks are now conducted with greater regularity and greater scrutiny—and the Internet makes it exceedingly easy to confirm everything in your background, as well as to accept jokes or rumors that may appear about you on social media sites as fact. Therefore, if there is anything questionable in your past or anything that might be misconstrued, don’t hope that it won’t be discovered. State it yourself—it’s the only way you can control how this information is presented! Telling your next employer up front what she will discover anyway can only make you appear honest and trustworthy. If you’re lucky, you’ll find that your next boss is someone who believes that everyone deserves a second chance.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Money Makes the World Go ’Round . . . and Your Head Spin

Conventional wisdom says that the person who mentions the first figure will ultimately lose in salary negotiation. So what do you do when an ad warns that “serious candidates will provide current salary and requirements”? Do some digging. Use the Internet to research salaries for similar positions in your area. Include the monetary value of benefits and bonuses in your calculation of current or past salaries to increase them. Or provide a salary range to avoid overpricing yourself. The Issue Index lists letters in this book with sample language that you can use.

# Take Advantage of Technology

As we have just explained at length, the Internet offers unlimited and valuable resources for jobhunters. So be sure to take advantage of them. Peruse the sites that can help you define the type of job for which your skills are a match. Explore those that list jobs in your industry or your locale, those of specific companies, and those that provide salary ranges, which can prove helpful if you are relocating or switching industries. If you’re not certain where to start, visit any search engine and enter the word jobs or career to find links that will connect you to thousands of valuable resources, or begin with the links that we provided in the downloadable content in this book. When you see jobs posted for which you are qualified, post your resume and cover letter in response. For sites that limit space, be prepared with a shorter version of your cover letter and resume. If a job posting reveals the name of the hiring organization, visit its website and apply directly on its career tab. While you are there, you may gain insight into the corporate culture that you can use in your interviews. Even better, you may find a direct contact and his or her e-mail address. Use it! If it’s posted, it’s available for you. Also look for websites hosted by associations within your industry or specialty, or your alma mater; such sites frequently maintain a job bank and a referral network or offer training. The Internet is an amazing source of information, career advice and assistance, company websites, job postings, and sometimes total confusion. If you haven’t already, master this vital tool and use it to your benefit.

# Manage Your Online Profile

Like all business, today’s job search process takes place online. Most, if not all, openings are posted and filled online. Recruiters source, contact, and keep track of candidates using online searches and tracking systems. Used correctly, the online search offers numerous advantages. Of paramount importance is your online presence, your “profile.” Your next employer can easily form an impression of you based on where, how, and how often you appear online. Research yourself just as he will; search your name, nickname, photos, and social media sites. If warranted, clean up what your find. Pay particular attention to the pictures you post and the language you use to be certain that they convey the image you want. When you have a strong professional profile, recruiters searching for someone with your skill set can find you!

# Learn How to Use E-mail Effectively

Obviously, if you don’t already know how to use e-mail, do whatever you need to do to learn. Not only has it become ubiquitous in the workplace, but e-mail delivers advantages that can prove pivotal for your job search. For starters, making cold calls or attempting to secure face-to-face meetings with busy executives is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, given ever-tightening corporate security. With e-mail, networking has become far, far easier. Use e-mail to stay in touch, check in periodically, send articles or relevant news items, and even gently prod someone to take action on your behalf. Every few weeks, you can e-mail those in your network base to remind them that you’re still looking and what your areas of interest are. Should you change or narrow your focus, you can quickly update your career “fan club” about this important information.

When surfing the Internet’s many job search websites, you’ll find plenty of advice on using e-mail effectively in the job search. Here are a few key points and potential pitfalls relating to jobhunting letters of which you’ll want to be aware.

Option 1: Letters as Attachments You may send your cover letter as an attachment, rather than, or in addition to, inserting it into the body of the e-mail. Saving it as a .pdf, Word, or Google document increases the likelihood that your recipient will receive your letter exactly as you’ve created it. All the letters and e-mails in this book can be downloaded, customized, saved in your own word processing program, attached, and sent successfully. If you plan to include your letter in the body of your e-mail, you should avoid using line breaks, multiple fonts, and other formatting that may alter your letter’s appearance if it is opened in a different program or window size. These are precisely the types of changes that can result in a letter that makes you appear sloppy and unprofessional.

Option 2: Letters Within E-mail Messages The fact that e-mail is the preferred method of communicating presents both a challenge and an opportunity.

A primary challenge is that readers are busy and may not take the time to read a long letter. Another is that they may not even open it! For these reasons, your subject line is key—it must be strong, appealing, descriptive, appropriate, or all of these, and you’ll want to write a short, concise note. Although short is the standard in e-mail, short doesn’t mean dry, boring, jargon-filled, or devoid of content. You still need to follow all the advice you’ll find in Chapter 5 about promoting your skills, accomplishments, strengths, and personality. To create effective and professional e-mail cover letters, familiarize yourself with this list of formatting tips and the sample e-mail letter that follows. (See Letter 1-1.)

Use the subject line to refer to the position you are seeking.   
Use a consistent font size (10 to 12 points).   
■ Do not use bold, italic, underlining, columns, long dashes, or other unusual characters.   
Use an asterisk $^ { ( * ) }$ or a plus sign $\left( + \right)$ instead of bullets.   
Use the spacebar to indent, rather than the tab key.   
Avoid hard-to-read and trendy fonts; instead, select the more common Cambria, Calibri, Times New Roman, or Arial.   
Add the recipient to your electronic address book in such a way that his or her name appears—not his or her e-mail address.

# The Top 10 Rules for Writing Killer Cover Letters

As tempting as it may be, sending only your resume in response to a job ad or posting is not as effective as sending a cover letter or e-mail as well. The good news for you is that many people succumb to this temptation—some of them out of laziness, and some because they don’t trust their writing abilities. The bottom line is: these days, a resume isn’t enough.

In today’s job market, a resume doubles as a sign that indicates, “I need a job . . . like so many others . . . thousands of others.” In this environment, your resume alone cannot possibly accomplish as much as you need to accomplish. Although it reveals vital statistics, your resume supplies only 20 percent of the information on which most hiring decisions are based. It reveals whether you meet the minimum requirements for the current opening (appropriate education, computer skills, or relevant experience, for example). It also suggests to your next boss the level of loyalty and continuity that can be expected of you, as demonstrated by the length of time you’ve held previous positions. Finally—and especially in a tough economy, resulting in an overflowing inbox—your prospective employer may attempt to reduce the list of candidates to a manageable level. In this case, your resume may actually work against you by providing a single fact or date that serves to eliminate you as a potential employee.

Furthermore, regardless of how exceptional your resume may be, it generally reveals none of the remaining 80 percent of the information upon which the hiring decision is based. It says nothing about your personality, creativity, or work style. It rarely describes any unusual traits you possess that might make you a sterling candidate or interesting interview material. A letter, on the other hand, can reveal all of this—and more.

Throughout this book, the word letter refers to any and all types of written communication, including e-mail, handwritten notes, and even typed letters sent via “snail mail.”

For all of these reasons, the letters you send as part of your job search may be some of the most important letters you’ll ever write. To help you create a winning letter, let’s begin with the basics. Let’s take a look at a typical employment advertisement and the typical response it generates.

# Sample Employment Ad or Job Posting

# At t e n t i on S e l f - S tar t e rs !

This is your opportunity to build success from the ground up. Enjoy the full training and technical support that only a major financial services firm such as ours can offer as you help businesses and individuals plan sound financial futures. Write Terry Muldour at tmuldour@recruiter.com.

In today’s economy, an ad like the one shown here may receive more than 1,000 responses! From this pool, as few as fifteen candidates may make it through the first screening to a personal meeting. Of these, a mere six people will probably be called for a second interview. Two or three will be selected as finalists. One will be hired.

Who will that person be? Certainly not the one who sends in a resume with Letter 2-1.

# Letter 2-1 Resume Cover Letter Sent in Response to Advertisement (Poor)

Ms. Muldour:

In response to your job posting online, I have attached my resume for your consideration. It is my objective to obtain a position in the economic area of your company. I recently received my MBA after completing a BS in Economics with a Business minor. I have an extensive background and strong working experience.

I would be very interested in working for your company due to the fact that it would permit me to utilize my business and economic background. In my six years of study, I have developed my knowledge of econometric analysis, price analysis, financial management, strategic marketing, branding, and business management. I am currently developing a paper on the treatment of global trade tariffs that uses a dynamic process and a flexible functional form to determine the variables affecting treatment differences between developing and developed countries. Working in a financial firm for several years enabled me to become a more committed leader, a team player, a detail-oriented worker, and better communicator who is not afraid to devise and implement effective strategic management theories. My responsibilities included researching the backgrounds of individuals and companies wishing to open sizeable credit accounts overseas. In addition, I have much additional working experience, including being a management trainer and busboy at a major dining establishment in New York City. I am a hard worker and a team player, as you will see when you interview me. My resume highlights my educational and business background.

Attached is a copy of my resume for your consideration. Please don’t hesitate to contact me at any time for an interview. I am certain that you’ll find it of great interest to meet me due to my natural leadership qualities, vision, and solid experience in your area of business.

# Sincerely,

Philip Tucker

Because the majority of the people responding to this ad will not send a cover letter at all, simply sending this gives Mr. Tucker an advantage over the competition. The advantage is all but wasted, however, by sending a letter that’s as weak and unappealing as this one.

As you read Letter 2-2, the stronger version of the same letter, you’ll see the differences—and the improvements they make in the effective ness of the letter.

# Letter 2-2 Resume Cover Letter Sent in Response to Advertisement (Better)

Greetings, Terry Muldour:

You’re looking for a self-starter to work in the financial field—I’m a self-starter with financial expertise and experience!

My resume, which is attached, details my background; let me provide you with the highlights:

Thorough educational background: I recently received my MBA after completing a BS in Economics with a Business minor.

Firm grasp of finance: In my six years of study, I developed expertise in econometric and price analysis as well as marketing, branding, and financial and business management.

A proven self-starter: I am currently writing a postgraduate paper on global trade tariffs, for which I created my own unique research methods and models.

Financial work experience: By investigating individuals and companies wishing to open sizable credit accounts overseas, I became a dedicated leader, a detail-oriented worker, and a highly effective communicator.

I am a hard worker and a team player. I have the knowledge, skill, and desire to enhance the success of today’s financial company. If you will contact me at (555) $4 5 6 \mathrm { - } 7 8 9 0$ during the day or evening, I will make myself available at your convenience for an interview.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely, Philip Tucker

PTucker@zmail.com (555) 456-7890

If you’ve hired someone yourself, you may recognize the weaknesses of the first, poorly presented letter—and the strengths of the second, stronger one. If you haven’t hired anyone, approach the letter as you might a solicitation for a charitable contribution, a type of letter that attempts to be equally convincing. Which of the two letters would you be more likely to read through to the end? Which makes a better impression? Which candidate would you be more likely to interview?

# 10 Basic Dos and Don’ts for Writing Killer Cover Letters

The two preceding letters provide concrete, visual examples of the 10 basic dos and don’ts to follow in all your jobhunting correspondence.

# 1. Dress (Your Letters) for Success

Do Send Professional Letters; Don’t Send Form Letters

Do make every e-mail and letter you send clean and professional looking. Even the smallest typo is an insult to the reader. It implies that he or she is not worth the time it would take to spell-check or to correct the error. It suggests that you are a sloppy person who doesn’t value order, either personally or in the workplace. Recruiters spend a good deal of time advising jobhunters on how to dress for an interview because employers demand clean, orderly staff members with professional demeanors. Your letter should reflect these characteristics.

Do not allow any letter to appear to be a form letter. Your reader should not feel as though you are sending the same letter to hundreds of employers—even if you are! Instead, create the impression that you are sending a letter to a specific person for a specific reason: because you believe that there is an ideal match between you and your prospective employer. Standard lines such as “I want to work for your company” are meaningless to an employer, particularly if you haven’t mentioned the name of the company—and they are worse when included in a letter to a recruiter—a mistake made by the writer such as in Letter 2-1. If you really want to work for a specific firm, you must have a reason. State it.

# 2. Zoom, Don’t Resume

# Do Make Your Letter Different from Your Resume

If your resume is strong, it will provide the information your interviewer will need. (If it’s not, there are plenty of books, software programs, and professional resume writers out there to help you strengthen it— including the downloadable Resume Kit that comes with this book!) So don’t just regurgitate your resume in letter form. “Zoom in” on the most salient points of your resume. Even better, consolidate the facts in your resume into an overview statement. Summarize a benefit that you offer such as “solid employment record,” “extensive industry experience,” or “impressive record of achievement.” Guide your reader in forming an appropriate impression of you even before you meet. Letter 2-2 illustrates this principle. Best of all, turn this summary statement into one that suggests an advantage that your next employer may gain by hiring you instead of someone else.

Describe any special qualities you have that may set you apart from other candidates. Use language that creates a feeling of what kind of person you are. If you have a sense of humor, don’t be afraid to show it in a professional way. You’ll find examples in the sample letters throughout this book.

# 3. “In Response to Your Ad” . . . Not!

# Don’t Use Standard Openings

Many people think that only one type of letter is acceptable in the business world: one that follows a standard outline. In truth, the only type of letter that’s acceptable in the business world is an effective one. An effective letter accomplishes your objective, which in the case of jobhunting letters means standing out from your competition. With this goal in mind, why send a letter that’s likely to mirror the letters of those against whom you’re competing?

Letter 2-1 opens with a standard line: “In response to your job posting online, I have attached my resume for your consideration.” What’s wrong with this opening? It’s standard. To stand out from the competition, your letter should be anything but standard. In Letter 2-2, Mr. Tucker grabs the reader’s attention immediately with a different, stronger opening. Furthermore, he successfully weaves information from the job posting into the opening to suggest that the letter was written in response to a specific ad and is not a form letter.

Do not open your letter with a standard, predictable statement. Spend a few minutes analyzing what is important to the person to whom you’re writing. Peruse the sample openings provided throughout this book. There’s no need to be foolish, outlandish, or shocking. With thought and practice, you can create unique, informative letter openings that will grab attention and deliver a meaningful message.

# 4. “Kiss” Your Letters (Keep It Simply Stated)

Do Write a Person, Not a Letter

There are also many people who believe that making a letter sound businesslike means using stuffy, stilted language that’s full of clichés and jargon. Certainly, your letter should be professional. However, it must also be interesting, be appealing, and reflect your personality.

To create a letter that’s appropriate to the business world, include relevant facts and succinct language. Ensure correct spelling and proper presentation. To make your letter appealing, use the same tone of voice you would use during the interview—when you don’t have time to consult a thesaurus and replace the words you’d normally use with multisyllabic synonyms. Write with the attitude that you’re writing to a person. That person may be your interviewer, your next boss, a human resources executive, or a recruiter—but it’s a person. Before you write, try to picture that person. Try saying out loud the points you wish to make as if you were sitting face to face in an interview, and then jot them down. Flesh out these ideas into full sentences that reflect the way you speak. After all, your interviewer will want to meet the person to whom she was introduced in your letter, and it had better be you!

For a clear example, look back to Letters 2-1 and 2-2 by Philip Tucker. Letter 2-1 is replete with foggy jargon, leaving you without a single clear opinion of the candidate—except that he is likely to be boring. Letter 2-2 has introduced you to a person who has studied and is currently writing a research paper, an individual with personality traits that sound appealing—someone you might not mind interviewing, which is, after all, the purpose of the letter.

You’ll find words and phrases to avoid using in your letter writing listed in Chapter 10.

# 5. Elim-Me-Nate

Do Focus on the Needs of Your Prospective Employer

What do you talk about in your resume? Me. Me. Me. Me. What do you talk about in your interview? Me. Me. Me. Me.

So use your letter to address the needs of your next employer. Focus your thoughts on the needs of your next boss. After all, your prospective employer expects you to meet his needs on a daily basis. Why should he care what your employment objective is or what you’re looking for in a job? He will hire you and pay you for the specific contribution you will make to increasing profits, improving performance, or enhancing productivity. In the letter, tell him how you’ll accomplish this.

Successful jobhunters create letters that link their strengths and talents to the benefits they will bring to the firm, department, team, or supervisor with whom they’ll be working. Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to illustrating how to achieve this crucial goal.

# 6. Appealing Is Revealing

# Do Make Your Letter Easy to Read

The visual appearance of a letter is as vital as its content, maybe even more so—because if you’re lucky, your reader will devote 30 seconds to your letter before turning to the next one in the pile or inbox. Make it easy to skim. Note that Letter 2-1 is boring in appearance. Its italic print and fully justified margins make it difficult to read. On the other hand, Letter 2-2 is visually appealing. Its content actually appears to be interesting, and the letter can be scanned by the eye in seconds. The reader who spends 30 seconds on Letter 2-2 will form an instant, positive impression of the candidate.

How do you make a letter appeal to its recipient before he or she even reads it? Formatting. To illustrate its power, compare Letters 2-3 and 2-4.

# Letter 2-3 Resume Cover Letter (Poor Format)

Dear Chief Financial Officer:

To maintain continued growth, a company must have financial and management professionals who are capable of identifying and seizing market opportunities before the competition does.

My marketing savvy and management expertise can help you do just that. I possess a powerful commitment to task, a drive for excellence, and the ability to respond to customer needs. For example, in my current position, I increased sales $74 \%$ by upgrading service efficiency, resulting in a $2 5 \%$ annual increase in profitability. I streamlined a branch outlet from its inception, coordinating every aspect from recruitment to organizing and redefining office functions, thus achieving substantial cost reductions, greater efficiency, and increased market share. I reduced receivables from 115 days to 33 days, thereby improving cash flow $21 \%$ . This released enough working capital to enable the firm to expand into other markets. Because I am currently seeking to broaden my horizons, I eagerly await your reply so that we can arrange a personal meeting. Then we can discuss in greater detail how my particular blend of capabilities, experience, and managerial strengths can help your firm capture lucrative business opportunities.

Sincerely,

# Letter 2-4 Resume Cover Letter (Strong Format)

Dear Chief Financial Officer:

To maintain continued growth, a company must have financial and management professionals who are capable of identifying and seizing market opportunities before the competition does.

The difference between Letters 2-3 and 2-4 is not in the wording. The content of both letters is identical. The difference is in the formatting. Letter 2-4 employs many of the same techniques that marketing and branding experts use to get millions of consumers to notice, absorb, and act on promotional messages. You can use the same tricks in your letters, which are equally promotional. Here are just a few of the more powerful options available to you.

■ Don’t use long paragraphs; they are overwhelming to the eye. (This will help you write more succinctly, too.)   
■ Indent sections with key ideas by using bullets, dashes, or asterisks to set them off (like these indented tips). For important ideas, use bold, underlining, and UPPERCASE LETTERS. ■ For short sentences, try centering.   
■ Use numerals (20) rather than spelling out numbers (twenty) when describing your accomplishments, to attract more attention. (Exception: Always spell out numbers that begin a sentence.)   
■ Italics are hard to read; use them sparingly, if at all.   
■ In printed letters, adjust your margins so that the reader never has to read more than five inches from left to right across a page. Never justify your right margin. (Always justify left margins.) If your letter must run to two pages in length, end the first page in the middle of a sentence to encourage the reader to read on to the second page.

If these techniques seem too pushy to you, remember that marketers have been using them for decades because they work!

# 7. Until It’s a No, It’s a Go!

# Do Write Frequently

Your competition hates to write as much as you do. Chances are that most of the people who are vying for your next job will find numerous excuses to avoid writing jobhunting letters. Don’t make the same mistake. You should write these letters often. Always send a thank you letter for a referral, and a follow-up letter after a meeting or an interview. If your candidacy seems to have stalled, write again to make something happen—don’t allow yourself to be forgotten. You might send your prospective employer an additional reference or a recent newspaper article supporting an issue that you discussed during your interview. As far as you should be concerned, until you get a definite rejection, you’re still in the running. In many cases, this perseverance and follow-through are essential requirements for the job you want.

# 8. Tell the Truth or Pay the Consequences

Don’t Be Dishonest

Do not exaggerate, mislead, or lie in your letters. Even if you get hired, dishonesty is grounds for immediate dismissal. Don’t risk it.

# 9. Check, Recheck, and Triple-Check

Do Triple-Check Your Letters for Proper Presentation

If you’re new to the jobhunting process, you will find the following reminders helpful.

Do direct your letter to the reader. Remember Terry Muldour from the sample employment ad earlier in this chapter? It was impossible to discern from the ad whether Terry Muldour was male or female. In fact, some recruiters purposely make an ad vague to test the resourcefulness of the jobhunter, a ploy that Terry Muldour may have used. If you are faced with this ambiguity, don’t rely on the standard “To Whom It May Concern” salutation, because it’s standard. Try to contact the company in question or visit its website to obtain the information you need. If that fails, use the entire name (as did the writer of Letter 2-2) or the person’s title (as did the writer of Letter 2-4).

Do check your spelling before you hit Send. Poor spelling creates a sloppy, negative impression quickly. Always spell-check. Ask a friend to proofread your letter. Proofreading backward from the end to the beginning will help you catch errors that you might overlook when reading forward.

Do be sure to use the same heading (or “masthead”) on your resume and on the letters you attach to e-mails or upload to websites—one that includes your name, address, e-mail address, and the telephone number(s) at which you can be reached. You may also include the online addresses of your profiles on professional networking sites.

Do check to be sure you’ve included keywords in your letters as well as your resume and your application when responding to online job postings.

The job search is not the time for accidental mishaps that can jeopardize your success. Chapter 10 contains a checklist to help you avoid such mishaps and to ensure that your letter is strong, direct, and properly presented.

# 10. If It Ain’t Working . . . Fix It!

# Don’t Keep Using a Letter That’s Not Working

You’ve composed a resume cover letter, sent it in response to 10 postings and ads, and haven’t heard a thing. Not a single person has called; not one interview has been scheduled. Is it you? Is it your resume? It could be either. Or it could be that you’re perfectly qualified, but your cover letter isn’t making the impact you want. Worse, it might be hurting you.

Don’t despair. Writing about yourself is never easy, and (until you’ve read this book) you’ve never been taught how to write self-promotional letters. Jobhunting letters may be some of the most difficult letters you’ll ever create.

So if the letter you’re using isn’t working, try another approach. You can try a more unusual subject line or first line, or try adopting a bolder tone of voice or a more conservative one. You can also summarize your strengths more succinctly, or provide a bit more detail. The key is to try something different. Rewrite portions of your letter, and then send this new letter to a limited number of people to gauge its effectiveness. If you don’t get the results you want, try changing something else. It may take a while, but don’t allow yourself to get discouraged.

By doing such things, you’re employing the same tested marketing techniques that advertisers have used for ages. How many approaches and slogans has McDonald’s used? Or Ford? Or Verizon? These companies and their advertising agencies continually alter their strategic positioning to keep their profits up, their objectives met, and their goals achieved. Why shouldn’t you do the same?

# How to Identify and Sell Your Strengths

Whatever industry you represent, whatever field you’re in, or whatever expertise you possess, when you’re looking for a job, you’re in sales and marketing.

■ You’re selling a product: you. You identify the target market: potential employers. You price the product: a realistic salary range. You position the product: draft a resume and cover letter. You test your positioning with the target market: respond to several job postings. If your efforts result in interviews, you’ve probably done some decent marketing. If not, you’ll need to reassess your product, market, pricing, or positioning and try again.

This is precisely the process that marketing executives follow to sell laundry detergent, pickup trucks, gourmet cat food, club memberships, and retractable swimming pool covers.

Thus, the majority of the letters you’ll write in the course of finding your next job will contain self-promotion. In your Ad Response and Resume Cover Letters, you will trumpet your talents. After an interview, a Follow-Up Letter will once again reaffirm your excellent qualifications. If the hiring process seems to be idling, you’ll rev that engine with a reminder of your unique talents. And undoubtedly, if you attempt to negotiate your salary in writing, your special skills will be of vital importance.

Since self-promotion is an area in which recruiters have found most people to be either underwhelming or overwhelming, it pays to learn how to boast. It is possible to be modest, yet effective. The trick is to avoid speaking solely of your own merits in every line. Instead, link your talents to the concerns of the recruiter, employer, or firm. Think of your qualifications not as merely a feature of your candidacy, but as a benefit to your next boss. The worksheets that follow will help you accomplish this.

Take the time to complete Worksheets 3-1 and 3-2 right now. The ideas you jot down here will prove extremely useful later on, when you are creating your own letters—whether you follow the guidelines offered in the chapters to come, or whether you simply adapt the sample letters that are included throughout the book. Completing these worksheets will also help you crystallize your thoughts in preparation for an interview.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# God Preferred . . . Others May Apply

Don’t be afraid to answer ads and respond to job postings if you have most, but not all, of the qualifications required. Recruiters often describe the “ideal” candidate in employment ads to see whether anyone can attain this perfection.

Your skills—and your experience in applying them—may be the best combination that companies and recruiters can find. Let them decide.

# Worksheet 3-1: I Am . . . Because I  . . .

In the left-hand column of the worksheet, list your skills, strengths, unusual abilities, unique traits, areas of expertise or specialization, and relevant personality traits. Try to limit your entries to one or two words each.

In the right-hand column, jot down your support points. Rather than repeating the facts on your resume, expand on them while relating something new, different, or additional. Consolidate your facts by adding

together years in the field, jobs within an industry, or similar positions you’ve held at different firms. Summarize your career, education, experience, or personality. Follow the examples set by the three sample entries.

# Worksheet 3-1

# Because I

I Am   
(Your skill, unusual ability, unique trait,   
or area of expertise)

(How you acquired this particular strength)

I am a skilled worker because I worked at your leading competitor for over 15 years.

I am well versed in process improvement because I participated in Lean Six Sigma methodologies training.

I am experienced in heavy equipment sales because I was the number two biller at John Deere for 3 years and a top biller at General Motors for 10.

I am because I

I am because I

I am because I

I am because I

# Worksheet 3-2: So You ...

With that done, you’re now ready to seize a powerful advantage over your competition.

In their letters, those whom you’re competing against are certain to include the type of facts you’ve written in Worksheet 3-1—facts like “I

am a skilled worker” and “I am well versed in process improvement methodologies.” Although these statements may be true, if they are standing alone, they require recruiters and employers to do all the work, that is, to interpret what they will mean to the company and discern why they are beneficial.

Go directly to Worksheet $3 - 3$ , or complete this and the other two worksheets contained in this chapter electronically by using this link: http://www.mhprofessional.com/ mediacenter. You’ll find instructions for using the link to download valuable resources at the back of this book.

You, however, can easily handle this for your reader. Simply ask yourself, “What does this mean to my potential employer?” Instead of just stating that you are a skilled worker, translate this fact into a benefit, such as, “so you won’t have to train me.” To the statement “I am well versed in process improvement methodologies,” you might add, “so you save training time and money because I can begin being productive for you from day one.” If you have chosen to cite the fact that you rarely take sick days, translate this into “Because I rarely take sick days, you can count on adding a highly reliable worker to your support staff.”

Therefore, to complete Worksheet 3-2, think about the benefits you can offer your next employer based on the statements that you made in Worksheet 3-1. For each “I am” and “because I” that you included in the preceding worksheet, add a corresponding, “And what this means for you is” in Worksheet 3-2. As a guide, relate these benefits to the areas that are of greatest concern to employers: profits, productivity, and performance.

Once you’ve completed Worksheets 3-1 and 3-2, you’ve identified your strengths and the facts that support them. More important, you’ve linked them directly to benefits that you can offer your next employer. Now you have successfully created unique ideas that you can introduce

# Worksheet 3-2

. . And What This Means for You Is   
(What benefits your skills, special traits, or background offer your next employer; what   
positive difference or improvements you can make)

. . so you will save time and money, since you won’t have to train me.

# Sample Benefit Statements

The following sentences have been composed from the three sample entries in Worksheets 3-1 and 3-2. Each sample uses one of the constructions outlined in Worksheet 3-3. For easy reference, these samples use the options in the same order in which they appear in Worksheet 3-3.

■ I am a skilled worker because I worked at your leading competitor for more than 15 years. What this means for you is that you will save time and money, since you won’t have to train me.   
■ Because I worked at your leading competitor for more than 15 years, I am a skilled worker. What this means for you is that you will save time and money, since you won’t have to train me.

■ Because I am experienced in heavy equipment sales, I achieved superior results at John Deere and General Motors. As a result, you get a sales representative who can hit the ground running.

# Sample Benefit Statements Adapted for Different Industries

The preceding samples illustrate how three different people might build a variety of sentences from their completed Worksheets 3-1 and 3-2. Now take a look at how these same sentence construction options might be adapted for use in other industries. Although your field may not be one of those represented here, perusing these examples will demonstrate how you can adapt them to your own field.

Engineer: I am a skilled electronics engineer because I worked in General Electric’s Consumer Division for four years. What this means for you is that you will save time and money, since you won’t have to train me.

Arts: Because I worked at the Smithsonian Institute for more than 12 years, I am a highly experienced curator. What this means for you is that you will not need to be understaffed for weeks while training a novice to assume full curatorial responsibilities.

Sales: Because I worked at your leading competitor for more than 15 years, I am experienced in all aspects of selling telecommunications to growing businesses, so you can expect more immediate revenue growth from your sales team.

Sales: You get a sales representative who can hit the ground running, thanks to my experience in retail promotion, which I developed as a top account executive for Procter & Gamble.

Beautician: You will have a worker who is productive from day one because I studied at the Avalon Beauty Academy, and I am knowledgeable in all aspects of hair styling and coloring.

Sports: Because I was the senior ski instructor at Aspen Ski Resort for seven years, I have become proficient in dealing with the public, and that means that you get a representative who can significantly enhance customer relations.

Technician: Because I am well versed in maintaining vertical trans portation equipment, I achieved superior ratings at Otis Elevator.

As a result, you acquire a technician who can minimize unproductive downtime for your high-profile corporate clients.

Use Worksheets 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 and the preceding examples to create your own self-promotional sentences. Write one for each quality you will be promoting in your job search. Then, link these sentences together.

Voila! You have just written a paragraph (or two) that will constitute the body of many jobhunting letters.

# Sample Letters/E-mails

By completing the worksheets, you have taken an essential step toward writing killer cover letters. As you incorporate the paragraphs you have just written into your letters, you are fulfilling the second rule from Chapter 2’s “10 Basic Dos and Don’ts for Writing Killer Cover Letters”: “Zoom, Don’t Resume.” This rule requires that you focus on your potential employer’s needs rather than simply repeating the information listed in your resume. This advice holds true regardless of your industry, and the following sample letters illustrate this key point.

Take a few minutes to read these sample letters. You’ll discover that they are very similar to one another. Each has been written in response to a job posting or employment advertisement in a different industry. Each is from an applicant in a different situation. They are presented here to illustrate that such details become immaterial when a letter “sells” a candidate, and how that candidate’s skills might benefit a potential employer. Cover letters like these grab and keep a reader’s attention. They stand a far better chance of resulting in an interview than the traditional, standard cover letters that most people send.

Most of the sample letters included throughout this book illustrate this key principle. As you review them, you may be surprised at how little industry-specific or job-specific information is included. Therefore, be sure you don’t overlook letters that seem to be outside your field— virtually every letter in this book contains an idea you can use.

# The Networking Letter

In any economic environment—especially a challenging one—networking is indispensable. It is the most effective way to uncover opportunities, secure interviews, and land jobs. Thankfully, online professional networking communities make it easier than ever for you to identify and connect with those who can help with your search. Once you do connect, following up with a strong and persuasive networking letter is critically important.

# How to Use E-mail to Identify (or Create!) Job Opportunities

To appreciate the edge that the Networking Letter affords you, consider the marketing principle of action versus reaction. Translated to the search process, this principle characterizes people who react as those who wait for job openings to be announced and advertised, then apply and wait again to be called in for an interview. Most jobhunters fall into this group, and they are your competition.

Conversely, those who act create their own opportunities. They hunt down potential and existing job openings and go after them with vigor, often identifying such openings well before they are advertised. Becoming someone who acts rather than reacts places you in an important minority: that of confident, proactive networkers. This is exactly where you want to be to enjoy a vital advantage in today’s tough job market. As a proactive networker, you have priceless tools at your disposal in the networking letter. Use these tools wisely and frequently. Use them

# Recruiter’s Tip

# A Whole New World

The Internet has changed everything for jobhunters. Enter “job search” in your browser, and in less than a second, you’ll be presented with more than three billion links! Instantly, you can find openings, advice, guidance, professional resources, support communities and forums, recruiters, resume services, and much more. Take advantage of all the benefits this new world has to offer. No matter what age you are, what industry you are in, or what your level of experience or education may be, your search will take place online. Don’t be overwhelmed—it’s become easier than ever.

Fact: Only 25 percent of the people who landed full-time jobs learned of the openings through employment ads. The remaining 75 percent secured employment through active networking.

Networking is work . . . but it’s work that works.

to introduce yourself and to ask for advice, contacts, or a referral to an associate or colleague. Use them to identify openings before they are advertised, such as when colleagues switch jobs, companies move to a new location, or businesses expand. Even a company that is downsizing may hold promise if it is consolidating positions. Two specialized workers, for instance, may be replaced with one who can handle multiple responsibilities. You can use these letters to uncover this strategic information and more.

If a friend suggests that you write to an acquaintance for assistance, accept. If a blog or a newspaper or magazine article reports that a company is expanding into new markets or relocating to your area, write and

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Go! Get Set! Get Ready!

Getting ready to get ready can be very costly in the jobhunting process. Start networking as soon as you know that you want to make a move or suspect that you may need to.

Make a list of people you can contact immediately, and then do so. Search online for more connections. If your resume is out of date, a scheduled interview is all the motivation you’ll need to get your resume in order.

No resume, no research, no excuses!

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Why Do I Contact Thee? Let Me Count the Ways

Use your networking letters to:

1. Introduce yourself.   
2. Seek advice.   
3. Make contacts.   
4. Secure a referral through an associate or colleague.   
5. Identify openings before they are advertised.   
6. Follow up on hiring leads gleaned from blogs or from newspaper or magazine articles.   
7. Learn more about a field you’d like to enter.

And much more!

ask to be considered. Ask friends and family members about openings where they work—many organizations offer financial bonuses for referring candidates who are hired. What’s more, sites such as EmployeeBuddy.com and Jobs2Web.com connect jobhunters with employees at companies that offer such compensation—truly a win-win for all! Don’t avoid creating and capitalizing on such opportunities because you don’t want to write a networking letter. Use the letters and e-mails provided here as a guide to presenting yourself as a qualified, motivated candidate who searches for ways to make things happen. In almost every case, these qualities are highly sought after in the job market.

Whatever your reason for writing it, your networking letter is fundamentally an appeal for help. Your primary goal—in fact, your only goal— is to get your reader to comply with a reasonable request for assistance. You might ask for an introduction, a recommendation, advice, or ideas. To comply, your readers must give of their time, share knowledge, and put their names or reputations on the line by making referrals—all precious commodities. To achieve your goal, you’ve got to convince your readers that you’re worth this effort.

Use the steps that follow to guide you in creating effective networking letters. If you choose to use sections of the letters provided in this book, you can use these steps to adapt the samples for your own use.

# Step 1: Create a Connection

To enhance the speed and effectiveness of your networking, you should send the networking letter to numerous people simultaneously. The trick, of course, is to make each letter sound as though it is being sent only to the person receiving it—your letters should never look or sound like form letters.

In your effort to personalize each letter, capitalize on any connection you may have with the reader. You may share an area of expertise. You may belong to a common professional association, online community, or civic, sports, religious, or charitable organization. You may have originated from the same area of the country or have attended the same educational institution. Now is the time to reaffirm these connections. Mention a mutual friend or a recent telephone conversation you had with your reader. If you met at a party or business event, remind her of the encounter.

Use this information to open your letter. Identifying a meaningful link between yourself and your reader helps establish a personal connection. Because this suggests to the reader that only he can help you, he will feel more compelled to focus on and reply to your request.

# Step 2: Inform

To accomplish your primary goal, which is to elicit help, you must convince your reader that what you are offering is meaningful. If you’re asking for a referral, you must be worth referring. If you’re asking whether there might be an opening for someone with your skills, those skills must be relevant to the firm, the division, or the person to whom you’re writing. Keep in mind that recommending an unqualified candidate reflects poorly on the person referring you. Don’t put anyone in this awkward position.

Therefore, in the body of your letter, provide the information your reader needs to have in order to make the decision to act on your behalf. Describe your talents, your background, and your skills. Explain why they are meaningful to your prospective employer, whether it’s the person you’re writing to or the person to whom you’d like to be introduced. And remember not to repeat what’s on your resume word for word, particularly if you’ll be attaching or enclosing it.

How much space should you devote to this information? Supply as much data as it takes to make your point convincingly, and no more. If the person to whom you’re writing is not the one who will be making the hiring decision, keep your letters short and to the point. To secure a referral, for example, your reader needs to be assured in a general sense that you will not turn out to be unqualified and, therefore, an embarrassment to her. Paint an overview of yourself that demonstrates that you have the necessary experience to be a serious candidate. When describing your background, generalize. When discussing your accomplishments, summarize.

However, if you’re introducing yourself to someone who does have the direct authority to hire you, you may wish to offer more detail. In this case, be specific about what you can bring to the corporation, the team, or your supervisor. Where relevant, use facts and figures to make your case—ones that you can honestly support in an interview. Instead of listing your skills in a vacuum, link them to concrete benefits that they offer your next employer. You may wish to refer back to the worksheets in Chapter 3 for pointers on how to do this.

In the samples that follow, you’ll see examples of networking letters that are both brief and lengthy. As you read them, try to discern the reason each writer may have had for contacting each recipient. Apply this to your own circumstances, and you’ll create a more effective letter.

# Step 3: Request Action

You’ve established a personal connection. You’ve convinced the reader that you rate the time and energy required to comply with your request. Now, forge a bargain with the reader: “I’ll do the work, if you’re ready with what I need.”

If you haven’t already asked for whatever it is that you want, now is the time to do so. State straight out exactly what you need, and how the reader can help you. Don’t annoy your reader by beating around the bush. You should be polite, but also direct. Your reader should not have to spend time deciphering puzzling innuendoes. If you’re writing to introduce yourself, say so. If you’re writing to ask for a referral, say so. Above all, don’t ask for something that’s inappropriate.

Then, tell the reader what to do, and be specific. If you’ve asked him to contact you, provide him with your address, e-mail address, and telephone number, along with a time that is best to reach you. If you require confidentiality, say so. Make it as easy as possible for your reader to reach you. If you’re asking that something be sent to you, include your e-mail address.

Or, if you are the one who will take action, tell the reader what to expect. State exactly what you will do to facilitate a response. If you plan to contact your reader, say when, how, and why. If you’re visiting from out of town and would like to meet with your reader, state when you’ll be in town and when you’ll be available. If possible, offer several alternative dates and times.

# Optional Step 4: Close Warmly

It’s highly advisable to end your networking letters with a professional, yet friendly sign-off. Closing warmly—by thanking the reader in advance for complying with your request—frequently enhances the likelihood of your getting the response you seek. You’ll find examples of such closings in the sample letters that follow.

# Letter 4-2 Networking—Economist

As a 10-year member of the Economic Forecasting Association, I am writing with the hope that our organization might assist me in my job search.

I am an experienced agricultural economist, with a specialty in soy and soy by-products, seeking employment in either the private or the public sector. I realize, of course, that I am not alone in my quest. However, as a prolific author, I can offer my employer a very high level of positive visibility within the industry.

I would appreciate any advice you can offer. Does EFA, for example, maintain a job bank? Do you run a referral service? Perhaps you or an associate know of someone with whom I might speak for additional advice.

I would welcome any suggestions you can offer. I have attached my resume and a list of my published works for your information. To make matters even easier for you, I will plan to call you next week.

Make it easy for the reader to comply.

For your interest and assistance, I am deeply grateful.

# Letter 4-3 Networking—Branding

# Subject: Thank You for Your Encouragement

Congratulations on the favorable publicity you received in yesterday’s City Times. I’m sure I’m not alone in finding encouragement in the description of your journey to senior management in the technology industry, an industry of which I am proud to be a part—although I haven’t achieved the success you have.

Yet.

As a hard-working, highly skilled, and dedicated Associate Account Executive for a boutique branding firm, I am anxious to expand my capabilities by assuming greater responsibility. I would greatly appreciate it if you could spare a few minutes of your time to discuss with me the direction that our dynamic industry will take over the next few years and what someone with my interests could contribute.

I’ve attached my resume to demonstrate my commitment to hard work. I will take the liberty of contacting your office within the next few days to see if there might be a convenient time for us to meet. Thank you in advance for being willing to assist someone who would be proud to follow in your footsteps!

# Letter 4-4 Networking—Sales—Career Change

A mutual acquaintance, Shirley Louis, recommended that I contact you for advice. I am currently exploring the possibility of switching from computer to medical equipment sales. With your expertise and recent experience entering this field, you have insight that could prove extremely valuable to me.

I’ve attached my resume, which details my skills and background, along with a list of my accomplishments. I expect that several of my strengths will be quite transferable, such as attention to detail and the ability to work with complex technology. I would welcome your views on this observation, as well.

Knowing how busy you are, I would be most grateful if you could spare a few moments of your day for me. I will call your office shortly to arrange a meeting at a time that is convenient for you.

I am writing at the suggestion of Francis Myers, a maternity nurse on your staff and a close friend of mine. Francis thought that your needs and my talents would fit ideally, and that we should meet.

By way of introduction, let me explain that I am returning to nursing after a three-year absence. During this time, I had a son and relocated to the Boston area. Now that I have made arrangements for daycare, I am seeking to put my skills back to work where they are needed: in a burn unit. My solid training and in-depth experience have both focused on the care of burn victims, and I would like to return to my nursing specialty as soon as possible.

I will take the liberty of calling you next week to see if we might meet. If you would be kind enough to leave word with your assistant, I will schedule a meeting at your convenience. In the meantime, I thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,

What a small world! Ten years ago, you and I both worked at Morgan Stanley, and now our paths have crossed again. It was great seeing you at the broker-dealer luncheon last week; I appreciate your offer to pass my name along to your ETF team.

To this end, I’ve attached my resume. As you’ll see, it details the considerable experience I’ve enjoyed on the sell side, including my key role in the launch of funds transfer systems for two major investment banks.

As you no doubt recognize, this kind of hands-on expertise can prove immensely valuable for your firm. It means that I am equipped not only to forecast the challenges that lie ahead as our industry continues to evolve, but also to create the innovative solutions demanded of those institutions that will succeed in the years to come.

I am making plans to visit your area from the 5th through the 10th of next month and would be grateful for some of your time. I will call your office shortly to set up a meeting.

Thanks again, Bill, for your support.

# Letter 4-7 Networking—Arts—Student—Career Change

Because you graciously added your name to State University’s Alumni Career Network, I am writing with the hope that you might spare a few minutes to advise a fellow alumnus.

I earned my BS in Accounting at State, and I have since enjoyed a successful career in the sales and marketing of consumer electronics and telecommunications. Now, I would like to bring the strengths that this solid background offers to a new field. Your role in the arts community could provide a perspective on this transition that would be of great value to me.

Because I would appreciate the opportunity to gain the benefit of your insight, I will take the liberty of calling you next week to see if we might meet or simply speak on the phone. In the meantime, I have attached my resume to provide details.

I am grateful for your willingness to help fellow State graduates. I thank you in advance for helping me, in particular.

Most sincerely,

This is actually a combination networking and “make something happen” letter; notice the writer’s clever suggestion to overcome the interviewer’s hiring objection.

# Letter 4-8 Networking—Arts—Career Change—Job Loss

Meeting you was a real pleasure. Thank you for spending so much time with me, particularly on a Friday evening. I truly appreciate the advice you gave me and the contacts you offered.

Since our meeting, I have reworked my resume according to your recommendations; a copy is attached. I am thrilled with the new emphasis and have forwarded it to Maestro Richard Allen at City Orchestra, as you suggested. I will let you know the results of these efforts.

I am dismayed that you are not currently able to hire an assistant. Not only would it be a pleasure to work with you, but I am certain that my corporate background could open new doors for the Symphony. Should my experience produce the level of additional funding I anticipate, the position of assistant would certainly pay for itself!

Ever the optimist, I will keep in touch with you in the event that the Symphony’s financial status improves.

Thank you again for your kind assistance.

With best regards,

When last we met, we spent some time discussing the Dodd-Frank Act. Lo and behold, shortly thereafter, our legislators enacted the Volcker Rule, reinstating some of the provisions of Glass-Steagall!

Therefore, I thought you’d be interested in seeing the attached article, featured in the Economist’s current issue, which analyzes the new legislation’s impact in the hedge fund space. Obviously, now is the time for devising proactive strategies to keep this profitable market from further eroding, and the article highlights the actions that several investment firms have already taken.

I thought of you immediately upon reading this article because I found our discussion so enlightening. I also appreciate the interest you expressed at that time in my attempts to further my career. I am continuing my search and will keep you informed. In the meantime, should your firm’s hiring freeze be lifted, I hope you will think of me. Your organization has been at the top of my wish list for years, and after meeting you, I am certain that our association would be immensely productive for us both.

Thank you again for your interest.

All the best,

It was a pleasure meeting you at last week’s retirement seminar. The amount of work that went into preparing such an informative program was evident and well spent, I can assure you. Your presenters held the interest of each participant, and clearly described the products and services that your firm offers.

Given my background and my interest in this area of financial services, I believe that I may be able to offer your firm something of value in return. As the enclosed resume demonstrates, my track record with prospective customers is a proven one; over the last 16 months, I have increased our company’s sales of retirement planning services by 22%!

This is the growth potential I would like to offer a leading firm such as yours. If you have any advice or recommendation to offer, I would be most grateful. I will take the liberty of calling you shortly to see to whom I should address my credentials at your organization.

Again, my thanks for a most enjoyable seminar and for any assistance you can provide.

With appreciation,

This letter may produce freelance work, a referral, or an interview. Any of these could lead ultimately to a job. That’s effective networking.

# Letter 4-11 Networking—Public Relations—Social Media— Job Loss

It was with great alarm that I read in today’s Wall Street Journal that you are forced to curtail your promotional capabilities. Undoubtedly, today’s economy wreaks havoc without regard for individuals, families, or profits. Despite this unfortunate situation, may I offer a glimmer of hope?

With reduced staff and financial resources, it becomes even more essential to generate free publicity, and to do so requires an expert.

I can deliver this critical service without an office at your headquarters, without an administrative assistant on your payroll, and without costly healthcare benefits. For a modest per-project fee, I am available to identify newsworthy developments, and to draft press releases, blog articles, and social media posts and place them with appropriate media representatives for maximum, free exposure.

Mr. Dupree, in today’s challenging economy, the need for publicity is more vital than ever. Don’t let your firm drop from sight—or worse, receive only the negative attention that results from a story such as today’s Journal piece. I will call shortly to follow up.

Sincerely,

This writer obviously knows her reader well, so a familiar tone of voice is an appropriate choice.

# Letter 4-12 Networking—Website Design—Social Media— Career Change

It is hard to believe how long it has been since we have been able to sit down and talk. How about scheduling lunch (on me) before another day passes? Here’s my ulterior motive right up front: I have a thought on which I’d like to get your advice.

Since we started working together over a decade ago, things have changed dramatically. Technology, people, places, and things seem to be in a constant state of flux. (I suppose this is what makes life interesting.) Through this flux, my firm has remained alive and well, continuing to break new ground in the world of website design, content, and user engagement. Nevertheless, I have been giving some thought to relinquishing the security of a staff position for the freedom of self-employment.

Perhaps, in your travels through the winding roads of corporate America, you may have heard what firms are outsourcing design work, if any. Are companies likely to rely on freelancers for design projects, or will they acquire staff members with an eye toward cutting costs? These are the questions I’ll need to answer before making my decision. I know your viewpoint will be beneficial.

I’ll call you early next week to set up a lunch date. Can’t wait to see you.

Best,

# Letter 4-13 Networking—Telemarketing

You may recall that last May I had the pleasure of working with you when you were at AmeriBrands for several weeks. I was delighted to hear from our mutual friend, Mark Miller, that you might be looking to hire a telemarketing sales supervisor.

No one can dispute your firm’s supremacy in its field. I believe, as I am sure you do, that superior telemarketing is an integral part of J. J. Budd’s continued success. After four very successful years at AmeriBrands, I am now looking for new challenges in the telemarketing industry. I would like a chance to be part of your telemarketing sales team—and to achieve for J. J. Budd the impressive results that I have attained for AmeriBrands.

As my resume indicates, during my four years as a sales manager with AmeriBrands, I consistently earned a place on the list of Top 10 Sales Managers. I also trained and ran the farm data TSR team that achieved the lowest cost per order among three competing vendors.

For a number of months, I have worked with Mark Miller. Mark can vouch for my abilities to motivate TSRs and achieve high sales at a low cost. Please feel free to talk with him. (Mark’s number at work is 800-555-7654, extension 123.)

I will give you a call in the next day or two to see if there is a convenient time we can meet to discuss how my accomplishments might benefit you and your organization.

Very truly yours,

# Letter 4-14 Networking—General

Thank you for your warm response to my cold call! It is gratifying to know that there are, indeed, executives who remember their own early career struggles.

As promised, I’ve attached my resume and a list of my accomplishments. Any advice you can offer on the presentation of both would be most appreciated—as is your kind offer to introduce me to your colleagues.

Together, my education and experience equip me to grasp quickly the intricacies of the business world. My talents allow me to apply this knowledge to the ways in which I can most directly contribute to your profitability and performance.

I will follow up shortly to discuss your reaction to the enclosed materials. Thank you again for your consideration.

Sincerely,

This extremely enterprising student has set her sights on the firm she wishes to join after graduation and the executive she believes will usher her in the door. She’s certainly not afraid of working hard to get what she wants, as this letter demonstrates.

Redfield Industries’ striking profit margins have captured the attention of everyone in the business world—and I am no exception. Congratulations!

Although the story behind this tremendous growth has been told over and over by the media, no one has focused on your contributions, Ms. Seifert.

As staff writer for State University’s respected daily newspaper, I would like to focus on your perspective as a female executive, and the unique way in which you have contributed to Redfield’s success. Rest assured, I will not waste your time. Not only have I done my research on the company’s track record, but I am also an Environmental Sciences major with a special interest in the groundbreaking innovations that Redfield Industries has introduced in alternative energy, in which you played a key role.

I would be honored if you could spare some time from your busy schedule to speak with me. I will call you shortly to see when we might meet.

When I heard through the grapevine that you had joined FronTech, I was thrilled for you! I know that you’ve been anxious to find the ideal position, and I truly hope that this is it.

Although FronTech has a sterling reputation, I know that you’ll find some way to improve its standing. After what you achieved for MVRS, I can only say that the competition had better look out!

And, since I currently work for one of those very competitors, I thought this might be the perfect time for us to be on the same team. (After all, if I can’t beat you, I might as well join you.) If you are or will be in a position to add to your staff, I hope you’ll keep me in mind. As you know, my track record is exceptional, my achievements legendary, and my motivation as strong as ever. (OK, so my modesty needs work.)

Before you get ensconced in management meetings, let me buy you lunch. We’ll celebrate your new job and explore what the future may bring. My treat.

I’ll call you next week.

Subject: Hello and help!

Hello. I hope this note finds you well and happy with your life, work, and play. I’m writing to let you know that today’s tough economy has claimed another job . . . mine! I had the honor of being selected to join a talented pool of employees who will get the axe at the end of the month, and so I am currently in the market for a new position. From what I hear, though, companies are beginning to hire again—and I’m pleased to say that I have an entire resume’s worth of skills and accomplishments that would make me an asset to many organizations. (And now that I’ve attached it to this note, you have it, too!)

Should you know anyone in the industry, I would truly appreciate it if you could pass along my name and resume. Or let me know names and numbers, and I’ll take over, using your name or not, as you prefer. As I keep my chin up (and my expenses down), I thank you in advance for any assistance you can offer.

Enjoy your day!!!

I am writing you at the suggestion of my father, Jon Omura, with whom you are a member of the Winchester Club. My father has spoken highly of your firm’s internship program, and as a result, I would like to explore this unusual opportunity further.

For a Business major like me, such a program would offer valuable hands-on experience in the real world. More important, the chance to learn from experts such as those you employ is the chance of a lifetime.

Mr. Smith, would it be possible for you or one of your colleagues to spare some time to speak with me about your unique summer program? I have attached my resume to assure you of my strong qualifications.

I will take the liberty of contacting your assistant next Tuesday morning to see whether I might set up an appointment.

I thank you in advance and send my dad’s greetings.

# Letter 4-19 Networking—Training

What a thrill it was to participate in your productivity seminar last week. My congratulations on a highly informative and very entertaining presentation. I am quite certain that if my department placed as much emphasis on our clients’ perceptions as you do on presentation materials, we would be far more productive!

This is exactly what leads me to write to you. Observing you in action reminded me of my past life in training. Through repeated promotions, I have been elevated away from my real loves: instructing, identifying, mentoring, and developing potential among bright, eager minds. I guess the more I crunch numbers, the more I lose sight of the people producing them, and it’s been long enough.

Before I leap, I should make sure there’s water in the pool, so to speak. Here’s the deal: I buy you lunch; you endow me with your view of the training game. I would be really grateful to hear your views. I’ll give you a call next week to see whether you can make the time for me.

And thanks again for a stirring presentation.

It’s been a while since we’ve seen one another. I hope all is well with you, Linda, and your two spunky boys!

You may have heard that I recently married and now have a baby on the way—and this is why I’m writing. Now that I am a family man myself, I am searching for a position in the restaurant/hospitality business that is more career-oriented, one that offers benefits and security.

As part of my search, I am writing to my colleagues and friends to see whether anyone might be aware of hiring activity, either current or planned. If so, I would be grateful if you could pass along my name— or let me know whom to contact.

After working in this business for seven years, you know my broadbased experience and the skills I offer. (My resume is attached.) I am an industrious worker who takes interest in my work and pride in my performance.

Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

# The Ad Response and Resume Cover Letter

Ad Response and Resume Cover Letters serve a critically important purpose: they create the context in which your resume will be read.

Imagine, for example, your next boss reading through the many facts, figures, dates, and descriptions on your resume. In a busy work environment with regular interruptions, the risk is great that he will overlook or misinterpret information and hastily relegate your resume to the “do not interview” pile. Disaster.

Now imagine that, rather than leaving it up to him to pay attention, process the information correctly, and decide that you are worth interviewing, you lead him to this conclusion yourself right from the start. That’s precisely what a well-written cover letter does! Its presentation of your qualifications, credentials, and accomplishments enables the reader to recognize the value that they offer him quickly and easily. Reading your resume after that, he interprets the details as proof of the conclusion you drew for him in your letter.

# How to Create a Letter That Sets You Apart from Your Competition

For this reason, it is imperative that you spend time creating a killer cover letter. Use the samples in this chapter as is or as guidelines for writing your own letter or e-mail. To make your reader want to meet you and to interview you, help her make a connection between your talents and the needs of her organization. The worksheets in Chapter 3 demonstrate how to link your specific skills with the needs of the hiring firm.

Since you use a more personal, conversational tone in your cover letters or e-mails than you do on your resume, they can bring you to life as a three-dimensional person who is interesting and unique. Referring to your background or current interests creates an impression not of a collection of facts and dates, but of a person who is worth meeting—you!

As you peruse the samples included here, you’ll discover that virtually every one of them features an opening line that you may think of as somewhat unorthodox. Think again.

# Step 1: Get Attention

Your ad response or resume cover letter arrives in your prospective employer’s inbox in one of two ways: either it arrives unsolicited, such as when you send your resume after hearing about an opening or through a referral, or it arrives with hundreds of other resumes from your competition, such as when you answer an ad or a job posting.

Once it does arrive, it’s fighting for attention against all those other resumes and letters, plus the usual reports, memos, solicitations, newsletters, and spam. The person to whom you are writing may give your note only 5 or 10 seconds for a quick scan before hitting “delete.” As a result, you’ve got to win that reader’s concentration immediately. There are no second chances.

Forget the standard openings you used to use—you know, the ones that are used by the vast majority of jobhunters, such as, “My name is Joe Smith, and I am applying for the sales position listed online,” or, “In response to your ad in the Daily Times, I am submitting my resume for your consideration.” While these openings may be appropriate for use with some highly formal firms and industries, or when writing to foreign organizations, they are wasted opportunities for most people who are jobhunting in a competitive economy.

Instead, begin your letter with a strong opening line that suggests to the reader, “Hey, read me!” Or, even better, “Don’t hire anyone until we’ve met, and I’ll tell you why.”

The first line of your letter or e-mail should accomplish one of three objectives. The first is to promise a benefit to the reader. Tell your next employer what advantages you’ll bring to him, such as any unique skills you possess, a rare perspective you offer, or a proven record of accomplishment. If your fluency in a second language is pertinent, mention it. If you are familiar with new platforms, systems, software, or equipment, include it. Just be certain that what you offer is meaningful to the firm and to the position you seek—and that you can really deliver what you promise.

A second way to open your letter is to identify a need that your reader has. For example, your reader may be searching for someone with mastery of a specific application, medical procedure, production process, or piece of equip ment. Perhaps the need is for someone who is already familiar with the ins and outs of the business, the industry, the competition, or rel

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Re: The Re:

Recruiters often post more than one job opening at a time. Rather than sacrificing a strong opening line to refer to the ad you’re answering and where it appeared, incorporate this information into your e-mail or letter. (See Letter 5-1.) Simply add “RE:” at the top of your letter or use the subject line of your e-mail like this:

RE: Your Monster Posting for an Office Manager

evant government regulations. If you’re writing to an accountant looking for an assistant, for example, you might open your letter with: “As a CPA, you know the importance of keeping abreast of changing government regulations. In my position with the New Jersey legislature, I managed such information on a daily basis.”

A third objective for your opening is to be timely. Use your opening to relate news or new information. Refer to a recent event or issue of concern. Tie the end of the old year or the beginning of the new to the opportunity you offer for a fresh approach. Where appropriate, mention a new law, trend, report, or article or the current economic climate.

# Killer Openings

The following sample openings illustrate each of these three objectives.

# Promise a benefit.

■ In the last 12 months, I’ve generated $\$ 70 K$ in new business for my employer, and now I’d like to do the same for you. ■ As a designer skilled in creating visually appealing, easily navigable, and engaging websites, I can provide the support your staff needs to bring in new business while saving you money on outside consultants.

■ Integrity. Motivation. People Power. That’s what it takes to be a successful manager. And that’s what you get when you hire me. ■ Your ad for a translator caught my attention immediately. Pourquoi? Perche? Porque yo soy la persona perfecta para la posición. They say there’s no rest for the weary. So if you’re weary from overwork, forget the rest of the candidates. Hire a proven professional, like me, who can relieve you of your overwhelming workload and help you get the rest you deserve.

Identify a need.

■ For the opening in your production department, why not consider an expert who has spent the last three years mastering state-of-theart film equipment at MTV?   
You’re seeking a hard worker . . . I am one. You need retail experience . . . I’ve been in the business for 15 years! You ask for references . . . I’ve got plenty.   
■ If you’re looking for a top-notch dental assistant, look no further.   
■ The match between your needs and my talents is ideal. Why? Because . . .

# Be timely.

■ No one has money to burn in a tough economy—which is why adding one exceptional research pro to your staff can actually reduce your overhead. Allow me to explain.   
■ If the federal government approves the revision of PL-1442 next month, you’ll require the skills of a collections agent who has dealt with hazardous waste—a rare expertise that I’d be pleased to offer you.   
■ Congratulations on your recent promotion! With the additional responsibilities this entails, you may need an assistant with the special expertise I can offer you.   
■ In today’s economy, there’s no time to waste on workers who need continual training, motivation, and fires lit under them. Why not hire an experienced self-starter like me?

# Step 2: Inform

Devote the main part of your letter or e-mail to supporting the promise you made in your opening. Explain why the person or company should consider, interview, and hire you. If you have completed the worksheets in Chapter 3, you already have several strong concepts to use. If you haven’t completed these worksheets, take a few minutes to do so now, or follow the guidelines given here.

First, detail any specific skills, talents, or knowledge that you have and the difference that this will make to the firm—without repeating point by point what’s on your resume. If your abilities might help your immediate superior reach his goals, say so. If you’re switching fields, explain the benefits that this offers your prospective employer, such as a new perspective or the opportunity to expand into new areas.

Then, describe how you will deliver the benefits you’ve promised or how you acquired the special skills you possess. State what experience has taught you and how you learned. If you accomplished relevant goals in previous jobs, use this to support your claim; where appropriate, use dollar amounts and percentages of growth or increase. (And be sure you can substantiate them if you’re asked to do so during the interview.) Relate your work experience to the skills you acquired, not to your job responsibilities. Relate your school experience to the skills or knowledge that you acquired, not to specific coursework. If you’re switching fields, note similarities between your current or previous job and the job you seek.

# Step 3: Instruct

You’ve grabbed the reader’s attention. You’ve detailed your support points. Now tell your reader how to take advantage of the offer you’ve made or the advantages you’ve promised. After all, if you’re going to participate in the hiring process, you’ve got to tell your reader how to reach you.

Generally, this can be handled quickly and simply. This is not to suggest, however, that this part of your letter is unimportant. On the contrary, instructing is all too often overlooked or rushed through by jobhunters . . . and it’s a shame. This step is as important as your opening. Why? Because the likelihood that your correspondence will achieve the response you desire increases with each additional line that your reader reads. So if your reader is still with you at this point in your letter, chances are she’s interested in you. Therefore, you want to get to her while her interest level is high. What’s more, the simpler it is for her to take the next step, the greater the chance is that she will take the step. Therefore, you want to make your instructions easy to understand, and even easier to follow.

To get the reader to respond to your letter, you’ve got to tell the reader what to do, and be specific. Provide appropriate and complete contact information so that the reader can select a preferred method of communicating. Indicate your work, home, and/or mobile phone numbers and give your e-mail address, then state which of these is best for reaching you and when. If confidentiality is an issue, ask your reader to maintain it when calling.

If the next step is going to be yours, you’ve got to tell the reader what to expect. Be equally specific about what you will do. Say when you’ll follow up. Say how you’ll follow up: by phone or by e-mail. Tell the reader what information you’ve attached, if any. If you’ll be sending additional material, say when it will arrive.

Finally, the hiring process will stop dead in its tracks if you don’t follow up the way you promised. So do it.

You’ll find examples of this vital step in virtually every sample letter in this book. Here are just a few.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Don’t Play Hard to Get!

A strong letter can make your reader want to contact you immediately. Don’t miss this opportunity! Always position your phone number(s) and e-mail address so that the reader can’t miss them. Place them:

Prominently at the top of each page of your resume.   
As part of the masthead of your resume and the matching letterhead on your cover letter if you attach it as a .pdf.   
In the body of your letter or e-mail.   
Under your name and signature.

# Samples of instructing.

■ Please feel free to call me evenings at my home or to leave a voice message. My home number is (555) 456-7890. (My present employer is unaware of my job search.) I’ll contact your office shortly to see when we might meet.   
I’ll call your assistant on Wednesday of next week to set up a meeting.   
■ I’ll be in town throughout the month of December, and will contact you to schedule an appointment.   
I’ll give you a call on the 18th of this month to set up a meeting. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me at (555) 765-4321.   
■ I will send my references first thing tomorrow morning. If there is anything else you need, please let me know. You can reach me or leave a message on my cell phone: (555) 765-4321.

# Optional Step 4: Close Warmly

Unless your correspondence is extremely strong and hard-hitting, you should generally add a final line at the end. You might thank the reader for taking the time to read your letter or for considering you as a candidate.

The following sample closings will help you out in a variety of jobhunting situations, as will the many examples contained in the sample letters throughout this book.

Sample closings.

I look forward to hearing from you.   
■ I look forward to meeting with you at your earliest convenience.   
■ I thank you for your consideration.   
■ Thank you for your interest.   
■ I would welcome the opportunity to work with you.   
■ I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills to your organization/firm/team, and look forward to speaking with you soon.   
I’d like to put my expertise to work for you.   
■ I’d be pleased to demonstrate my abilities firsthand.

# How to Respond to Salary Queries

Ads and job postings often ask for information about your current salary or salary history. Should you reveal it? What you should not do is ignore the question. Prospective employers may assume that your salary requirements are either too high to be realistic or too low to admit. They may assume that you feel above answering their queries, or that you are less than thorough in your efforts. If they assume any one of these things, you’re out of luck. Some online applications may not even allow you to submit without completing this field.

How should you handle this challenging issue? When you must include a figure, use the Internet to research salary ranges. Some sites provide average salaries for specific countries, regions, U.S. states, and even cities. Use this information as a baseline, then adjust it up or down to reflect your age, education, experience level, and other factors that may be relevant to your situation. If appropriate, include the dollar equivalent of benefits and/or job perks, such as a company car or an expense account.

When a definite figure is not demanded, another strategy is that used by the author of Letter 5-1, written in response to an ad in a trade publication that read, “Serious candidates will provide salary history.”

This writer knew that the ad would generate a great deal of interest and produce a multitude of responses. He also realized that the employer would be looking for ways to reduce the number of candidates to a reasonable size, such as rejecting those who ignored the request for a dollar figure, rejecting those whose salary history was too low to indicate a sufficient degree of authority in past jobs, or rejecting those whose salary expectations were too high. He believed that stating a specific figure could eliminate him from consideration immediately. Furthermore, his primary goal in writing this cover letter was to secure an interview, during which he would have the opportunity to discuss benefits, perks, and other issues affecting salary. As you’ll see in the final paragraph of his letter, he effectively shapes a deal with his reader: if you give me what I want (an interview), I’ll give you what you want (a salary discussion). In this way, he has not avoided the question of salary. Instead, he has used it to his advantage. In fact, he was selected to be interviewed.

There are other options as well. You may simply state that salary is a negotiable issue for you, one that you will be happy to explore in an interview. If you feel compelled to include a dollar figure, you may prefer to give a broad salary range or state an amount that reflects your total compensation (some combination of salary, bonus, anticipated raise, incentives, benefits, and perks such as a car, expense accounts, and club memberships). Your industry may dictate the way in which you will calculate such a figure. For instance, someone who works only three days each week might calculate what her salary would be if she worked five days. A teacher might calculate what his annual salary would be if he earned it for 12 months rather than the 9 he actually teaches. Whatever you decide, be sure you can substantiate it during the interview.

I am applying for the position of Marketing Communications Supervisor because your ad said these three things to me:

•	 Your eloquent description of how the position fulfills the corporate mission set it apart from all the other ads on the staffUP website and “beat the clutter,” the dream of all retailers.   
•	 Your description of the ideal candidate reflects my skills, my strengths, and my experience.   
•	 You are a substantive company offering a product of superior quality.

My resume, which is attached, speaks of my experience and expertise in retailing, and most recently in the marketing of organic specialty foods. I am assertive, diligent, driven, and hardworking. I am a seeker of end results—and I achieve them, as the many accomplishments listed on my resume prove. I thrive and deliver in a demanding and fast-paced environment. I am willing to tackle any project. My management style is open, humorous, example-driven, and loyal.

I believe that we can be successful partners. I want the chance to meet with you and would consider an interview a wonderful opportunity. I’ll make myself available at your convenience so that we may discuss salary in detail, and I can provide references.

I look forward to hearing from you.

# Samples

The following pages contain samples of well-written Ad Response and Resume Cover Letters. Peruse these samples to find ideas that appeal to you or inspire you as you create your own “killer” letters. As you do, keep in mind the following important points:

Summarize. Generalize. Customize. The letters included here represent a variety of industries and positions. Nevertheless, you’ll discover that our writers have summarized, generalized, and customized so effectively that many letters would work equally well in other fields. Don’t be surprised that you don’t find endless details, facts, and dates—all that is resume material! These letters focus less on listing specific experiences and more on providing an overview of those experiences and an interpretation of the benefits that such experiences offer a potential employer. Your letters should do the same.

You Can’t Argue With Success. Past achievements can indicate future success, so be sure to include examples of your most impressive accomplishments. Use bullets or numbers instead of embedding them in the middle of a paragraph so that they won’t be overlooked even by those who skim.

Copy, customize, and send these letters and e-mails . . . it’s perfectly legal! When you bought this book, you purchased the right to copy and adapt the letters in it. By all means, use the samples provided here, although you may wish to adapt them in case your interviewer or your competition uses the same letter. This link will connect you to all the letters online: http://www.mh professional.com/mediacenter.

This and the next few letters are ideal for those who like to get right to the point.

# Letter 5-2 Ad Response Letter—General

I urge you not to hire anyone until we’ve met. That’s because I possess every one of the seven qualifications you list in your ad—and more— as the attached resume reveals.

The sooner we meet, the sooner I can begin producing results for you, your team, and your company. Why not give me a call at (555) $4 5 6 \mathrm { - } 7 8 9 0$ during the day or evening? I will be pleased to meet with you at your convenience.

Let’s get together!

# Letter 5-3 Ad Response Letter—General

The hiring process is tough enough without interviewing countless candidates who responded to your listing despite being underqualified or overqualified. I can save you from this onerous, time-consuming task.

As my resume indicates, I possess every one of the qualifications you seek, and I am available to meet with you at once and begin working right away.

Why not give me a call and streamline what might otherwise be a lengthy interview process? I look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 5-4 Ad Response Letter—General

With responsibilities and deadlines that won’t wait, why spend valuable time interviewing unqualified candidates?

As you’ll see from the enclosed resume, I have the educational background, professional experience, and track record for which you are searching. In addition, I am motivated and enthusiastic, and would appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your firm’s success.

I can promise that meeting with me will not be a waste of your time— and I will make myself available at your convenience, during or outside of normal business hours.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-5 Ad Response Letter—General

Dear Mr. Hiring:

An innovative company like yours thrives because it hires innovative thinkers like me!

Over the years, I have developed a reputation for introducing fresh approaches to solve the challenges faced in today’s competitive business world. Because this is a personality trait—not a learned skill—it is something that I can offer your firm with confidence. It is who I am. It has defined the contributions I have made in every position I have held.

My resume, which is attached, begins to tell my story. A personal meeting with you will supply vivid details. The references I’ll provide will support them.

Please call me at (555) 456-7890 to schedule an interview. I promise you won’t be disappointed.

# Letter 5-6 Ad Response Letter—General

The educational background, experience, and skills listed in your advertisement are only the beginning of what I can bring to your firm.

As you’ll see in the outline of accomplishments I’ve included with this letter, I have a solid history of producing results within a limited budget. I have built and successfully managed a staff of 20, and I deal effectively with customers, executives, and stockholders on a regular basis. All of these achievements are critical to firms such as yours that must compete in today’s difficult economy.

My resume is attached as proof that I meet all the criteria listed in your ad. An interview would give me the chance to further prove my unique strengths.

I hope to hear from you shortly.

# Letter 5-7 Ad Response Letter—General

In today’s challenging economic climate, many people will respond to your advertisement. Few will be interviewed. One will be hired.

# However . .

Of the many who will respond, few will be as qualified as I am, since I have 12 years of in-depth, bona fide industry experience. No one else will bring my track record and the expertise I can offer—expertise that equips me to start delivering results for you immediately. With minimal training. With minimal disruption. With maximum positive effect on your bottom line.

I will make myself available to meet with you at your convenience.   
Thank you for your consideration.

This is a gutsy approach, balanced by the tactful reference to “unavoidable cost cutting” and supported by solid, relevant experience.

# Letter 5-8 Ad Response Letter—General—Job Loss

Dear Ms. Ovett:

Because I have long admired your achievement in building a successful company, I was dismayed to learn of your recent layoffs. In today’s economy, such a situation presents the vexing conundrum: how to maximize opportunities for growth with diminished human resources?

Optimizing the resources you can employ is, of course, a viable solution—one that I can offer if you will grant me the chance to meet with you.

Opening identifies a need.

When we meet, you’ll find me to be a person with a positive outlook who enjoys identifying ways to make something work rather than looking for reasons not to try. This perspective is invaluable in setting an example for employees who are called upon to assume numerous responsibilities—of particular merit in this era of unavoidable downsizing and cost cutting.

In addition, my resume illustrates that I possess the background and experience that our industry demands and your success deserves.

Ms. Ovett, if I have taken great liberty in writing to you, it is because I firmly believe that I can contribute to your firm’s continued expan sion. I will call you early next week to see whether we might get together.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-9 Ad Response—General—Student

Good opening when the ad does not provide a name.

To the Director of Human Resources:

After four years in college, what have I learned? Plenty! Plenty that I can apply directly to the entry-level position listed on your website’s Career Center.

The drive to focus and achieve. Your firm’s success depends upon the ability of your staff to grasp a problem, evaluate the best way to solve it, and then work until the solution is in hand. This is precisely the process I followed during all four years to graduate with a 3.80 average.

Flexibility and creativity. A business gets stale when it recycles the same ideas time and time again. When you hire me, you get someone who thinks for himself, and who is not afraid to suggest new ways to approach a task, as I did as the Student Representative responsible for researching and updating State University’s ethical standards to reflect the difficult issues facing today’s students and faculty.

The ability to work with a diverse population. Having been raised in a multiethnic environment and educated in a multicultural institution, and with a degree in psychology, I am well equipped to interact productively with customers and staff from a variety of backgrounds and with a range of priorities, from intern to senior leadership.

An interview would give me the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities. I will call you soon to see if we might meet. Or you can reach me at the number listed below.

Thank you in advance for considering me.

# Letter 5-10 General—Language Skills

To the Placement Experts at Idiom International:

With my fluency in Mandarin, English, and Spanish, I can help businesses operating in today’s global marketplace acquire a broader customer base as they enhance their international brand.

With my in-depth experience in the travel and entertainment industry (as detailed on the attached resume), I can offer these firms the opportunity to serve more customers, from more cultures, more personally, and more appropriately than ever before.

With your strength in worldwide placement, you can help us both profit by successfully matching my rare qualifications with the needs of a growing firm.

I will call you Monday to see if we might schedule an appointment. I look forward to meeting you personally.

Until then,

Great line when responding to a P.O. box.

# Letter 5-11 General—Jobhopper—Salary

Turns a negative into a positive.

I appreciate your willingness to assist in my job search. As promised, I have attached my resume to provide background on my professional experience. To bring my resume to life for you, allow me to tell you more about myself and what sets me apart from other candidates.

Over the years, I have performed in a variety of environments. As a result, I have been exposed to diverse people, work styles, standards of measurement, corporate cultures, and demands. What has remained consistent throughout is my ability to produce results in a range of business climates.

Enhances credibility.

I have contributed to the success of management teams and worked on my own without supervision. I have mastered the ability to deal with frustrated customers, management under pressure, and companies operating in the midst of labor negotiations and layoffs. Throughout, I have received consistently high praise from superiors and coworkers, many of whom are ready to serve as references, should you wish to contact them.

To an employer, I present a positive, results-oriented work ethic, and a professional, pleasant demeanor. To you, I present a strong, solid candidate with a willingness to remain flexible in terms of salary requirements.

I will contact you next week to continue our discussion and to solicit any advice you may offer in my search. I thank you again for any help you can provide.

How should you respond when an entry-level position is barely described or the company is not named? This letter and the ones that follow provide some answers.

# Letter 5-12 Entry Level—Student

To the Director of Human Resources:

Your ad for an entry-level position caught my attention as I prepare to begin my professional career upon graduation this spring from State University.

I write “professional” career because I have worked steadily throughout college, gaining valuable experience that equips me to present your firm with advantages others may not offer.

For example, as a Resident Assistant for a 250-person coed dormitory, I acquired strong leadership and interpersonal skills. I am now able to think quickly on my feet in emergency situations, and in those requiring quick assessment of many factors in order to make appropriate decisions. Dealing with the diverse concerns of students, parents, and faculty, I have become adept at operating with the proper mix of authority, diplomacy, and tact.

While working in this demanding position, I achieved a 3.75 cumulative grade point average. My double major, Communications and Political Science, provided me with a thorough foundation in principles that affect businesses every day.

I would welcome the chance to discuss openings at your firm. If you will contact me at (555) 456-7890, we can schedule a meeting.

Thank you for your consideration.

Translates life experience to employers’ needs.

# Letter 5-13 Entry Level—Student

To the Director of Human Resources:

Attached to this note is my resume, which details my education, work experience, and technical proficiency—all important criteria in your search to fill the entry-level position advertised.

Allow me to introduce the person with whom you and your colleagues will work, should you choose to interview and hire me.

I possess strong moral and ethical principles, which led me to put in long, hard hours at school and part-time jobs in order to succeed in a challenging educational environment. These values also motivate me to perform diligently and loyally to contribute to my employer’s profitability. Unlike others, I do not expect to begin as a vice president. I know that it takes commitment, dedication, and intelligence to rise within a firm, all of which I offer you.

As one of six children, I also have an active sense of humor, which has been useful in defusing difficult situations. I have the patience to see an assignment through to completion. I am comfortable delivering presentations to a group, working as part of a team, and helping others succeed.

It would be an honor to meet with you personally to discover more about the opening at your firm and how I can assist your organization in its growth. Please contact me at the address or phone number listed above. I will make myself available at your convenience.

Thank you.

# Letter 5-14 Entry Level—Student

To the Director of Human Resources:

For the entry-level opening at your firm, why not consider someone like me with a strong academic background and real-world business experience? As you’ll see on the enclosed resume, I have recently completed my undergraduate studies at State University. My perseverance and consistent effort enabled me to maintain my Dean’s List status while working on a part-time basis.

Rather than work at a mindless job that might pay the bills but would teach me little of practical value, I chose to open and operate my own painting company. I selected and trained crew members, developed an advertising program, borrowed the money to cover start-up costs (which was repaid in full after just six months), and handled scheduling, payroll, and tax reporting. Over the four years I’ve been running my business, I have served more than 80 different customers, 54 of whom have called back to schedule additional jobs.

My experience has prepared me to meet the demands of the business world, and I am anxious to apply my strengths and talents in the corporate environment. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to explore this possibility.

Thank you for considering me.

# Letter 5-15 Entry Level—Student—Sales

The background and experience I can offer in reply to your posting for an entry-level sales position may prove ideal for your needs. Allow me to introduce myself and my qualifications.

This June, I will receive my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from State University. In addition to my rigorous course study, I participated in extracurricular activities that provided me with the hands-on experience that is so vital to being a successful sales representative.

As Rush Chairman for my fraternity, I planned and directed a major program to introduce the strengths that our product delivered and promote them in a market that was rife with competition. Through these efforts, we have enjoyed an increase in membership of $20 \%$ over the past three years. I further developed and managed a program to raise funds for our nonaffiliated charity, the Brothers of Hope. Targeting fraternity members, students at large, faculty, and the community, program contributions exceeded previous years’ totals by 77%.

To achieve these goals, I combined an ability to plan, to visualize solutions creatively, and to implement them successfully with my talent in dealing with people. These are the same characteristics I would bring to your organization.

Please consider me a serious candidate for your sales position. I will be happy to visit your offices for an interview. I can be reached at the telephone numbers printed below.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-16 Entry Level—Student

To the Director of Human Resources:

When my mother and father sent me from our village in China to America, I was fortunate to live with relatives who encouraged me to excel—and I have. I quickly mastered English and a new culture, and I achieved and maintained a 3.50 average at State University.

When I was granted a full scholarship, I was fortunate to have the time to devote to volunteer work in addition to my studies. I served for four years on the university’s Community Relations Board as a liaison between the school, neighboring politicians, residents, and businesses. This valuable experience prepared me to deal effectively with consumers, business clients, shareholders, coworkers, and executives at every level of management.

When I graduate this May, I will be fortunate once again if I have secured employment with a firm such as yours. My ability to work productively with others, my drive to excel, and my unique cultural perspective equip me to become a valuable member of your organization.

I hope you will contact me to arrange an interview so that I can provide you with additional information to supplement what appears on my resume. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-17 Entry Level—Student

This past May, I graduated from State University magna cum laude with a 3.80 average, having financed $100 \%$ of my college education myself. As you can see, I am not afraid of hard work and would welcome the chance to discuss with you the entry-level opening at your firm.

My resume describes my academic background and professional experience. As you’ll see, my four years of solid work experience exposed me to substantial interaction with consumers. I consider myself skilled in dealing with the public, and I would prove a positive representative for your firm.

Working summers on the alumni newsletter, I learned to coordinate an inordinate number of facts, figures, dates, and details—under deadline pressure!

These skills, combined with the drive to work through difficulty toward the successful completion of a project, will make me a productive addition to your organization. I look forward to the opportunity to meet.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-18 Training Program—Student—Referral Letter

Your associate, Amy Levin, advised me that she had forwarded my resume to you for consideration as a 20XX participant in Morgan Stanley’s training program. I have attached another copy for your convenience.

On May 25, I will graduate from State University with a major in Economics, a minor in Business Administration, and a concentration in Mathematics. I am planning a career in investment banking, for which my education has ideally prepared me.

Ms. Levin and others have spoken highly of your firm’s training program. It is precisely the type of challenge I am seeking. In return, I offer Morgan Stanley a loyal and hardworking employee who already possesses a solid foundation of relevant knowledge. Unlike other applicants, who may have had more general studies, my education would allow me to be a highly productive member of your training program. As an investment banker, I would be able to put this supplemental training to profitable use more quickly for the institution.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you. I can be in New York any Friday this semester, or any day after graduation.

I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration.

# Letter 5-19 Customer Representative—Student

Appropriate salutation when the ad bears no name.

To the Vice President:

As a State University senior who will be graduating in May of 20XX, I am submitting this application because I believe I can offer your firm an unusual mix of abilities, talents, and enthusiasm.

For instance:

•	 My double major (Economics/English Literature) demonstrates my willingness to assume more than the typical level of responsibility and to achieve in a challenging environment. •	 Through my coursework, I acquired in-depth technical proficiency and a profound belief in the importance of effective communication for today’s growing entrepreneurial endeavor. •	 To finance my education, I planned, launched, and operated a highly successful catering business. I gained hands-on experience in properly managing revenues, time, and employees.

As you can see, I am goal-oriented, driven, and not afraid of hard work—qualifications that are vital for anyone who will be a productive staff member for your firm, as I would like to be.

I look forward to hearing from you so that we may schedule an interview.

# Letter 5-20 Entry-Level Paralegal—Career Change

What a wonderful service you provide! Placing qualified professionals within the legal profession serves the needs of many, particularly someone like myself who is entering the field with so much to offer.

As I near completion of the ABA-approved Paralegal Program at State College, I am preparing to offer my skills to Los Angeles County law firms. In addition to my superior, straight-A record in this program, I have a background in the business world that arms me with a valuable perspective that others may not have.

For 20 years, I was an integral member of Digital Electronics’ product innovation team. In this capacity, I worked closely with federal regulators and patent attorneys, and I can bring this experience to bear on behalf of your clients.

Also, I am trained in automated legal research programs (LexisNexis and Westlaw), and maintain my student password.

I would welcome the chance to pursue any openings for which you feel I may be qualified.

# Letter 5-21 Entry-Level Paralegal—Part-Time/Full-Time

# RE: Entry-Level Paralegal Position

An entry-level position is not de facto fillable only by the inexperienced. On the contrary, in me you have a talented professional who is available for full- or part-time work.

Having performed in a range of capacities in law firms both large and small, as the attached resume reveals, I can offer you a wealth of legal capabilities, including:

•	 Contract preparation, negotiation, and administration in support of legal counsel.   
•	 Ability to serve as an independent contract paralegal and investigator, as I have for many different attorneys and firms in the metropolitan area.   
•	 Comprehensive paralegal skills, obtained through practical experience as well as in study leading to Paralegal Certification at State College.

I would appreciate the opportunity to interview with you and can make myself available at your convenience.

I thank you in advance for your consideration.

# Letter 5-22 Paralegal—Relocation

Dear Ms. Moore:

This August I will be relocating to Atlanta, where I hope to continue serving as a paralegal. My work with first-rate attorneys equips me to offer you an exceptional mix of training, knowledge, experience, and professionalism.

As you’ll see on the enclosed resume, I have worked for several law firms in the Philadelphia area. I am proficient in many areas of criminal and civil trials, with an additional concentration in contracts and titles. As a result, I can offer you an unusual level of expertise in researching complaints and discovery requests as well as responses to counterclaims, motions for discovery sanctions, motions for summary judgments, and motions to dismiss.

The attorneys with whom I work have provided me with superior recommendations to aid me in my search. I would appreciate the opportunity to present these to you, and to introduce myself as a candidate for the position at your firm.

Supports candidacy.

I will be in Atlanta at the end of this month. If you will contact me at (555) 765-4321 during the day or evening, we can schedule an appointment.

Thank you.

# Letter 5-23 Administrative Assistant—Language Skills

Voilà! You’ve found the administrative assistant you’re looking for in me.

I have all the qualifications listed in your ad . . . and more! My experience is relevant and extensive, as described in the attached resume. My typing has been called “lightning quick,” and I am fluent in both PC and Mac office programs.

What my resume cannot illustrate is what sets me apart from other candidates—namely, my penchant for organization, my eye for detail, my positive and personable nature, and my ability to perform, even in the pressure-cooker environment of a fast-paced, fast-growing global firm.

Furthermore, I am fluent in Spanish and have fair skill in Arabic, having been raised in a multicultural family. These language abilities will help you in dealing with international customers and prospects, as will my familiarity with foreign customs and protocol.

I would be pleased to come in for a personal meeting. I will call you shortly to set up an appointment.

Gracias,

RE: Your posting on Monster.com for an Assistant to the President

Dear Ms. Lockhart:

Impeccable interpersonal skills. Organizational and supervisory abilities. Attention to detail. Your ad describes my strengths precisely!

People Power. As a teacher in the public school system for three years, I am adept at dealing with people—from “by the book” career administrators to the high school bully, from irate parents to the shy underachiever, from goal-oriented department heads to aggressive textbook and technology sales reps.

Management Skills. As a homemaker raising two children, I mastered the ability to spearhead three projects simultaneously while supervising two distinct groups of youngsters, maintaining my patience and my good temper all the while.

Accuracy. As a volunteer for a local hospital, I coordinated the ever-changing schedules of 50 unpaid workers for five years with nary a “mix-up.”

Handling these responsibilities provided me with a different kind of experience: the kind the corporate world just doesn’t offer—and the kind that proves invaluable once you enter this world, as I’d like to do now.

I hope you’ll consider me a serious candidate for the position of Assistant to the President. I certainly would take the job very seriously, proving an asset to the president and to the company.

Sincerely,

While maintaining her professionalism, this candidate allows her sense of humor to shine through—a refreshing change from the many other letters the ad produced.

# Letter 5-25 Executive Secretary

Dear Ms. Hilman:

Thank you for advertising for an Executive Secretary to work with your top partners. Until I saw your advertisement, I thought no one would appreciate the unusual combination of skills I can offer!

My resume is attached; allow me to present the highlights here:

Superior PC and Mac abilities, including skills in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher, as well as . .

. . social media, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and more through . . .

. . . four years at Disney and three years at a Miami-based law firm specializing in medical malpractice, which accounts for my .

. . . professionalism in dealing with the public, attorneys, physicians, emotional clients, and the media . .

. . as well as my experience in making travel arrangements for overworked lawyers who wish to escape all this!

As an administrative assistant at a smaller firm, I am anxious to assume the additional responsibilities described in your job posting. I hope you will contact me for an interview; my contact information appears below. Thank you in advance.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-26 Office Administrator—Salary—Language

To meet the extensive qualifications listed on your website’s Careers page, a candidate must be a true professional with in-depth experience at a major corporation who is looking for an exciting new challenge, as I am.

For example, your ad requests:

Experience screening telephone calls, responding, and routing accordingly

and I deliver:

Two years as a receptionist for General American Products

Ability to order, maintain, and distribute office supply inventory

Seven years as Office Manager for IBN Executive Offices

Skill in scheduling and coordinating training, events, conferences, meetings, and on-site demos

Seven years doing the same, in addition to coordinating travel arrangements for 15 IBN executives

In addition, I possess a degree in Business Administration, exceptional interpersonal and written communication skills, and easy fluency in Spanish. I would be pleased to demonstrate my technical abilities when we meet and to also detail my salary history and requirements for you.

These qualifications, combined with my substantial experience, would make me a productive, effective Office Administrator from my first day on the job. I hope you’ll contact me at my home number below; I look forward to meeting you.

# Letter 5-27 Consulting Associate—Recent MBA—Career Change

I am writing to explore the possibility of pursuing an associate’s position at Doniger-Davis. Currently, I am a Relationship Officer at American First Bancorporation, where I handle the financial accounts of high-net-worth individuals. In May of 20XX, I will earn my MBA in Finance from State University.

My interest in management consulting has been piqued by specific and fascinating classes that are part of the MBA program. Business Policy, Strategic Implementation, and Managing Human Systems, in particular, demonstrated to me that my education, interpersonal talents, and practical experience would prove immensely productive in a consulting environment.

With five years in the financial services industry, I can offer your firm a specialty with broad application. My involvement with interviewing and assessing prospective employees and with quality-improvement projects may free you from the in-depth training that would be required for a less-experienced candidate.

I’ve attached a copy of my resume for your information. I will call next week to see when we might get together. In the meantime, I thank you for your consideration. I look forward to meeting you.

# Letter 5-28 Consulting

I enjoyed speaking with you on the phone this afternoon and appreciate your interest.

As promised, I have enclosed my resume, which details my unusually thorough background in public relations, business communications, and human resources development. What my resume does not describe is my character. I am a conceptual thinker, a generator of creative ideas, and a self-starter.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate these qualities in person and look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

# Letter 5-29 Events Planner

Your advertisement for an Events Planner was of particular interest to me because I encounter so few organizations that recognize the unique value of special events. By relegating this function to already overworked marketing departments, where planning withers and presentation suffocates, most firms waste this vital opportunity.

Since SYTEX is not like most firms, and I am not like most Events Planners, perhaps we should meet.

I would like to discover more about your events schedule. And I would like to describe my experience designing, planning, preparing, promoting, and running annual meetings, companywide divisional meetings, regional breakfast meetings, trade shows, seminars, and webinars. I have planned and run many events that generated important new business potential while enhancing the firm’s corporate image.

This past year, I also orchestrated a tour of the Greek islands for an elite client group that solidified key relationships.

Attached you’ll find my resume, along with a description of programs I have designed and the results they have produced. It would be an honor to meet you in person and to be considered as a member of the SYTEX staff.

# Letter 5-30 Media Buyer—Social Media—Student

Thank you for taking the time to address us at State University’s Media Day. Your energizing talk has piqued my interest in the Assistant Buyer position at BBDO Worldwide. I would not write to you without a firm conviction concerning the match between your needs and my analytical, communication, and organizational skills and my enthusiasm.

Allow me to highlight my qualifications for this position:

•	 Firsthand experience thinking on my feet and reacting quickly and responsibly. As an intern at Burson Marsteller, I single-handedly ran the student portion of a PR conference, including a last-minute improv when a speaker didn’t show up! •	 Forged-in-the-fire communication skills, honed through working events and sweepstakes at Fallon Worldwide. In this role, I mastered the dreaded “cold call,” persuading organizers to let my clients attend these tightly controlled events. •	 Tried and tested planning and organizing abilities, developed by managing experimental events for diverse clients. I learned the ropes quickly, took control, got organized, and stayed that way throughout each project. Although it was a challenge, I enjoyed the fast-paced environment and the responsibility.

I believe that these skills are vital to the successful BBDO Worldwide Assistant Buyer. What’s more, I would welcome involvement in digital media buying, including interactive display and video and social, mobile, and other rich media.

I’d be thrilled to have the opportunity to interview with you in person or connect by phone to discuss future opportunities with BBDO Worldwide. Please feel free to reach me by phone at (123) $4 5 6 \mathrm { - } 7 8 9 0$ or via e-mail. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

# Letter 5-31 Art Director

Having researched your agency and the exceptional results your teams produce, I know your firm values creative talent and hard work—both of which I can deliver.

From among the hundreds of resumes you receive from people seeking a position with your agency, I urge you to consider mine because my skill set differs from those of other graphic designers. For example:

•	 As a seasoned Art Director/Graphic Designer, I possess extensive corporate experience, having worked with many of today’s leading firms: Yahoo!, Verizon, Bank of America, Apple, and FedEx, among others.   
•	 With more than $9 ^ { + }$ years of digital advertising experience, I stay resolutely up to date on the latest technologies, currently Photoshop, Illustrator, ImageReady, and Flash 9. I have also worked directly with code and possess a thorough grasp of front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   
•	 I partner effectively with creative, content, and account teams, as well as with developers, clients, and management, and I thrive in a deadline-driven, cross-functional team environment.

With my unique combination of qualifications, you can welcome to your agency a genuine creative talent and true professional—just as I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you.

# GOOD NEWS!

There is a copywriter only a phone call away who knows the difference between a CDO, an LBO, and EFTs . . . one who can express complex details clearly and convincingly to consumers, investors, and shareholders.

I am an experienced advertising copywriter with a strong financial services orientation—and the time to put this expertise to work for UniFirst!

With me, you’ll add an exceptional member to your marketing team; I’ve created pitchbooks and proposals, website content, print ads, banners and exhibit booths, newsletters, blog posts, and corporate identity pieces. And unlike most writers, my background includes staff positions with both advertising agencies and banks. What this means for you is that you’ll save hours negotiating with legal counsel, thanks to my in-depth knowledge of government regulations such as DoddFrank, the Volcker Rule, and restrictions on financial advertising.

# Letter 5-39 Marketing/Branding—Product Management

# RE: Opportunities in Product Management

Dear Ms. Crain:

Good opening in letter to recruiter.

Your work and reputation within the branding/advertising/marketing industry suggest that you continually search for highly qualified executives to fill positions on both the agency and the client side.

For this reason, I am writing to introduce myself: a marketer who has spent the last 10 years promoting consumer and B2B initiatives. My work at Holmes & Richards equipped me with skills essential to the successful product manager: the ability to master complex product details and competitive positioning quickly, and the perspective to create, align, and communicate brand messages to cultivate trust among distinct, diverse market sectors.

These qualities are integral to the product manager who can build sales and profits for her agency and its client. In your clients’ searches for managers to champion their companies’ products, why not recommend a proven marketing expert, as $\mathrm { ~ I ~ a m ? ~ I ~ }$ would welcome the opportunity to meet you.

Because I’ve worked in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore (my hometown), I can offer DeMario & Williams an intimate perspective on the region’s culture, persona, key players, and community leaders.

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate my strengths and talents in person and look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 5-41 Senior Marketing Associate

To the Director of Human Resources:

Happy New Year! Throughout my eight years in marketing, the start of a new year invariably produced fresh ideas and renewed excitement for launching marketing initiatives—and now I can offer your firm a new perspective, as well.

The unprecedented volatility of the financial services industry has exposed me to a range of promotional challenges previously unknown in banking. I mastered the ability to identify and quantify objectives, refine them in response to market research, and develop detailed plans and budgets. I learned to think in entirely new ways, to motivate creative talent and produce campaigns, promotions, and individual sales pieces that added significantly to my employer’s bottom line.

These are the skills that define the successful Senior Marketing Associate in any industry. I offer them to your firm—along with my in-depth experience in strategic planning for retail, commercial, and B2B advertising.

I look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 5-42 Senior National Sales Consultant—IT—Salary

As the current top biller for a leading information technology company, I am writing to you because I am eager to expand from a regional sales territory to the national level—and can deliver several advantages that my peers may not offer you.

If you would kindly contact me by phone at (555) 456-7890 or e-mail, I will make myself available at your convenience.

Promises benefits right up front.

# Letter 5-43 Director—Corporate Marketing

With the financial services industry under pressure as never before, there is no time to waste in your search for a Director of Corporate Marketing. So I won’t waste yours.

I am a Strategic Marketing Planning/Program Manager with $^ { 2 0 + }$ years’ experience, most recently in the telecom industry, and prior to that, in international transportation.

As head of Verizon’s Marketing Services, I function as an internal Marketing Consultant to the organization’s strategic business units, managing a staff of 14 marketing professionals and a $\$ 45 M$ annual marketing budget, coordinating all advertising, research, branding, and public relations initiatives.

Marketing program improvements that I introduced doubled organizational visibility while slashing marketing expenses by $30 \%$ .

The success of my marketing programs during the last dozen years is directly attributable to several unique talents I can offer Boston First, including my abilities to:

•	 Leverage strategic planning skills to convert management’s business plans into achievable, measureable marketing initiatives.   
•	 Maximize my financial-controls experience to ensure that those same marketing programs are firmly grounded in economic reality.   
•	 Creatively empower team members with increasing management responsibilities.   
•	 Guarantee, through dedicated adherence to a TQM process, that all marketing programs are completed on time, within budget, to the satisfaction of senior leadership.

These are the proven achievements and talents I can bring to Boston First. Let’s get together to discuss this opportunity in greater detail. I can be reached at (555) 456-7890.

# Letter 5-44 Director of Development (Fund-Raising)—Career Change

$\$ 500$ million is not the most—it’s the average amount of money my fund-raising programs have generated for hospitals, private secondary schools, government programs, colleges, and universities.

This figure, attained through 22 years of intense fund-raising experience, equips me to assume the Director of Development responsibilities as rapidly and effectively as your needs demand.

I have attached summaries of my background and those projects that are most germane to your circumstances and setting. As you’ll see, I have regularly built coalitions of citizens, alumni, and business and community leaders with the power to make significant contributions and to attract major funding from others.

My success at the Broderick Group has been enormously gratifying. However, I am eager to sacrifice the rigors of city life for the pleasures of the country and academia, an environment that I enjoyed years ago as a professor of economics.

Rather than let my credentials speak for themselves, I would enjoy meeting with you in person. Business frequently brings me to your area, so I will call you shortly to schedule an appointment.

With best regards,

# Letter 5-45 Telemarketing Sales

My first reaction was to call in response to your ad for a telemarketing rep so that you could experience my professional yet positive demeanor at once.

Instead, I am attaching my resume as your ad requested, providing you with in-depth information on the three years I have spent successfully resolving customer claims and accurately recording complex product orders with consistent praise from my supervisors.

Most important, I have enhanced my firm’s reputation, keeping existing customers satisfied and transforming first-time buyers into loyal repeat purchasers.

I would welcome the chance to do the same for your organization and to speak with you directly.

Sincerely,

Here’s an effective way to turn a negative into a positive. This jobhunter has held a string of jobs, but discusses this openly, presenting it as a benefit to the reader.

# Letter 5-46 Sales—Jobhopper—Job Loss

To the Yellow Pages Sales Manager:

Very few candidates possess a background such as mine—one that I’d like to put to work on your behalf.

As you’ll see on my resume, the depth of my experience in sales offers you the opportunity to hire a genuine pro who needs little or no training and who is comfortable with and successful at cold calling.

Having worked as a Sales Rep in a variety of industries, I am skilled at developing sales pitches that are meaningful to the variety of businesses that advertise in the Yellow Pages . . . to turn interest into revenue for you. It is only due to the recent economic volatility (resulting in downsizing, layoffs, mergers, and business failures) that I have held positions at numerous companies. However, it is this fact that allows me to offer you such an unusual breadth of experience.

A personal interview would allow me to demonstrate my talents. I look forward to hearing from you so that we might schedule a meeting.

A focused, well-written letter such as this can put those of more experienced candidates to shame.

# Letter 5-47 Retail Sales—Workforce Return

In presenting myself as a candidate for the position of Sales Consultant at your bridal boutique, I present you with a valuable opportunity:

To hire an experienced expert who can simultaneously handle demanding, often stressed clientele with kid gloves.

Having planned weddings for my own daughters, I am adept at dealing with the stress of the wedding gown selection and fitting process. Patiently, I assessed the virtues of lace, organza, tulle, and silk—the covered or off-the-shoulder design—knee, calf, or floor lengths. Gracefully, I balanced my daughters’ concerns with those of their friends, husbands-to-be, and even mothers-in-law. Delicately, I increased our maximum budget as warranted to include all essential accessories. Conscientiously, I maintained our selection and fitting schedule. Unbelievably, I enjoyed it immensely—all three times!

Through it all, I was amazed to discover that my hands-on experience proved consistently more effective than that of our sales representatives, which is why I offer myself as a candidate.

After some time at home, I am now rejoining the workforce. I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you. If you will contact me via e-mail or phone (555-456-7890), I would be delighted to schedule an appointment to meet.

Sincerely,

In your search for a Distribution Manager, I hope you will consider me a serious candidate. When we meet, I will be pleased to provide information on my salary history as well as recommendations from previous employers.

I look forward to hearing from you.

My experience as a DEA Special Agent and Inspector General for the city’s Housing Department is unique among my peers. These jobs have equipped me to handle a variety of investigations, including surveillance of employee time abuse, malfeasance, bribery, theft, improper reporting of sick leave, drinking violations, and others.

court-qualified expert in deciphering narcotics ledgers •	 Coordination of complex interagency investigations •	 Evidence handling and testimony   
•	 Asset forfeiture investigations at state and federal level •	 Adherence to policy and procedure   
•	 National jurisdiction for drug-related offenses

# Letter 5-65 Building Superintendent—Job Loss—Language

# Letter 5-76 Internet Sales Representative—Salary

This is valuable knowledge that I can bring to your organization from day one to enhance your marketing efforts and help achieve your sales goals.

With great excitement, I am responding to your ad for a Kindergarten Teacher. The opportunity to teach in the school system that fostered my interest in education is a thrilling one.

Because I have recently switched from the business world to teaching, my resume may not provide the information you require (it is attached, nonetheless). Instead, allow me to excerpt from a recommendation provided by my advisor, Lynn Karyli:

“Lauren never seems to choose the easy way; she takes the most demanding courses, opts to work in the most challenging teaching situations, attempts the most innovative and difficult teaching approaches, and volunteers time and energy to extracurricular activities. And, in all her endeavors, she is successful. . .

“It should be noted that in the short period of a year and a half, Lauren won the praise and admiration of her professors and her peers. She was selected as research assistant for a project on children’s response to the arts. She is a highly respected member of her peer group, valued both for her leadership capabilities and for her constructive feedback and support of the efforts of others. .

“Thus, Lauren is a model for all who are associated with her, and to all she brings enthusiasm and energy, sensitivity, thoughtfulness, and thoroughness, and above all, a love of children and of life.”

As a teacher of English at the Forsyth Satellite Academy in New York City, I will soon complete the Master’s Program in English Education at New York University, where I have the honor of having been selected as the Graduate Valedictory Speaker. This summer, I will receive six postgraduate credits as a participant in the New York City Writing Project at the City University of New York. Before entering the field of education, I enjoyed eight years in accounting—a field I left voluntarily in January of 20XX to pursue a long-felt desire to teach, motivate, and guide students in their use of the language and appreciation of literature. I am thrilled with my decision to switch careers!

With these unique strengths, I write because I am moving to Cape Cod in August, and I seek a position as a teacher of English in the Provincetown School District.

I recognize that there may be a shortage of openings. While my primary goal is to secure a full-time position teaching English, I would like to offer my services in any capacity for which you might find my background suitable. I will gladly work on a part-time basis or as a substitute. I have attached a resume of my business and educational experience along with my most recent evaluation, made by my practicum supervisor.

# Letter 5-91 Child-Care Worker—Workforce Return

Seton Day Care, its children, and their parents deserve the very best child-care worker you can find. May I offer myself as a candidate who can meet this tough standard?

My experience working with children is as extensive as it is diverse. As a mother of two, I have performed the numerous and continual duties that caring for every newborn demands. As a volunteer in both the nursery school and first-grade classroom environments, I have dealt effectively with children at an age when your every breath and action contributes to the shaping of their personalities, demeanor, and morals. I have also cared for older children in my home, both for pay and as a courtesy to other mothers, so I am well aware of the challenges and rewards of this vital responsibility.

Supporting my practical experience is a thorough educational background and hands-on work in the field. In earning my degree in Family and Consumer Studies, my relevant studies included courses in Child Psychology, Child Development, Sociology of the Family, and Family Relationships. In addition, I completed fieldwork in an urban day care facility.

Personally, I offer you the following strengths: I possess a calm attitude and a superb understanding of children’s needs. Many people are surprised by how comfortable their children feel with me. As a mother, I empathize with other parents and find it easy to build a productive rapport.

Although I am in the process of updating my resume, I am extremely interested in pursuing this opportunity, and I did not want to delay contacting you. At your convenience, I would like to meet with you to explore the opportunity of working together. If you will contact me at (555) 456-7890 (day or evening), we can schedule a meeting, at which I will present you with my completed resume.

# Letter 5-92 Social Worker—Geriatric

I am writing to explore the exciting possibility of joining your team at Winterhaven, building on my success as a social worker in the respiratory and medical intensive care units at Saint Helen’s Medical Center.

With master’s degrees in both ethics and social work, I am particularly interested in end-of-life issues that surface within the geriatric population and, in particular, the role of social workers in developing and supporting a sense of pride and place in the lives of the elderly.

While in my social work internship during graduate school, I sought to develop this sense of pride by helping my patients create ethical wills, in which they articulated, proudly and with purpose, the accomplishments they had made throughout their lifetimes and the values they held dear and now wanted to pass on to future generations. I hope to continue fostering this kind of purpose in the lives of the elderly— whether through ethical wills, psychosocial counseling, bereavement support, or other vehicles of service—as a member of your social work team.

Please find attached my resume for your review. I would very much appreciate having the opportunity to speak in person and will make myself available at your convenience.

If you were hiring, it’s likely that you’d find it tough to turn down an interview with someone so skilled and dedicated. Despite being out of the workforce for years, this jobhunter knows how to get results!

Your ad for a social worker caught my attention, since I would like to rejoin the profession after several years as a homemaker and mother. With my education, experience, and commitment to human services, I possess all the qualifications you seek.

I have a BS in Learning Disabilities, an MSW degree, and a state social work license. For five years, I worked at a facility providing subacute care and rehabilitation services to children with a variety of special health needs and their families, receiving regular praise from my superiors for my clinical and interpersonal skills. More recently, I performed more than 10,000 hours of volunteer work with substance abusers while raising three children.

Through my efforts over the years, I have remained abreast of new issues and ideas in human services. I would be surprised if you were able to find a more dedicated employee than I will be, or one who is more ready to contribute once again by performing first-class assessments, treatments, consultation, and training.

Attached you will find my resume, a copy of my state license, and a list of references. If there is anything else I can provide, please let me know. I am anxious to meet with you.

# Letter 5-94 Speech Pathologist—Student

If your Speech Pathology Department has room for a skilled, enthusiastic, and committed speech therapist, I hope you will consider me.

This June, I will receive my BS from State University’s School of Speech. I have already begun supplementing my formal training in speech and language pathology with several practicums and internships, all of which inspire me to continue contributing to this valuable profession while preparing for my master’s and certification.

Through my work with stroke patients, stutterers, and those with cleft palate and articulation disorders, I have acquired hands-on experience that may enhance the success and reputation that your department already enjoys. My grades and evaluations have been consistently superior, validating my skill as well as my ability to work harmoniously with coworkers.

Of greatest value to you, however, is my commitment to each and every patient with whom I work. My objective is to improve their lives by improving their abilities to communicate and their self-esteem.

If these are the qualities you seek, I hope you will contact me. I will be happy to visit your office for an interview, at your convenience.

# Letter 5-95 Registered Nurse—Workforce Return

RE: Your msnhealth.com posting for a Registered Nurse

Given the reputation for excellence that you maintain at the Sacred Heart Academy, you hold equally rigorous standards in your search for a Registered Nurse to care for your students and faculty.

Excellence is exactly what I can deliver, along with an unusually strong background in healthcare.

My resume, which is attached, details the depth of my experience with newborns, grade-level children, adolescents, and young adults. As you’ll see, I have worked as a Student Health Nurse, Camp Nurse, Family Camp Coordinator, hospital Staff Nurse in labor and delivery, and Nursing Care Coordinator. These assignments, along with my work as a Nurse Coordinator for a Perinatal HIV Transmission study, honed my ability to deal with children and their parents with understanding, warmth, and humor.

During the past several years, I reduced my workload outside the home while raising two sons. I am now ready and eager to return to nursing, and to continue combining exceptional medical care with compassionate patient care.

The opportunity to pursue these objectives as a member of Sacred Heart’s highly respected staff is an important one. I do hope that you’ll allow me to present my qualifications to you in person.

# Letter 5-99 Personal Trainer—Job Loss

# RE: Monster.com ad for a Personal Trainer

In our industry, turnover is high among training staff, and this often adversely affects customers’ perceptions of a health club or fitness center. I can help your organization avoid this problem.

I have been in my current position for nine years, and am seeking alternative employment because our owner has decided to retire and close the facility. Not only do I have the experience to bring to your club, but I have also built a loyal base of “one-on-ones,” many of whom are likely to follow me within reasonable geographic limits.

I am well versed in a complete range of equipment, such as aerobic (StairMaster, treadmills, running machines, cross-country skiing, bicycles, Lifecycle, and VersaClimber), free weights, Universal, Eagle, and Nautilus. I have designed personal fitness programs for clients from ages 18 to 80, even working successfully with individuals required by their doctors to lose 100 pounds or more. My skill, rapport, and results have led many of my existing clients to introduce me to their friends, whom I have brought into the facility as new clients.

If you’re looking to add long-lasting muscle to your training program, please contact me at (555) 456-7890, and we can schedule a time to get together.

# RE: Indeed.com post for an Esthetician

When working with clients, my goals are to pamper the mind and body . . . soothe muscle tension . . . relieve stress . . . eliminate fatigue due to overwork. .

. . The very same benefits you’ll enjoy when you add a professional, experienced esthetician to your staff. And few are as accomplished as I am.

Naturally, I am skilled at blending concentrated therapeutic oils for aromatherapy massage to create the optimal ambience for effective beauty treatments. But I am also well versed in a complete range of revitalizing regimens, including facial and body skin care, body scrub and polishing, tissue toning, hydrotherapy, seaweed body mask, and detoxification.

The result is that by hiring me, you acquire a range of additional services to offer your clients for the price of a single expert esthetician. Plus, I can bring with me an established, affluent base of regular clientele.

I firmly believe in the importance of massage and esthetic treatments to combat stress and prevent illness, and would appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities firsthand.

If you would be kind enough to contact me at my home number, I will be pleased to schedule an appointment to discuss how my varied skills can relieve the pressure for you and your staff.

After 12 years as a dental hygienist, I know all there is to know about routine oral hygiene, orthodontic hygiene, and pediatric hygiene.

However, my experience extends further than this ... and further than that of other hygienists.

I have performed in a frenetically busy multipractitioner environment as well as in a teaching facility. As a result, I am expertly capable of managing the demands of overworked dentists, nervous adults, and hyperactive children. I can instantly develop a comforting rapport with patients of any age.

Now, I would like to apply my expertise to the needs of a small, local practice. From the sound of your HealthCallings.com job posting, my skills would be a perfect match for your setting. Although I am looking for a full-time position, I would willingly accept the challenge described in your ad: that successful performance could lead to regular part-time or full-time employment.

If you will contact me at either my home or cell phone number, I will be delighted to set up a meeting at your convenience. I would greatly appreciate your understanding in refraining from contacting my present employer at the moment.

Thank you for your consideration.

# Letter 5-103 Editorial Assistant

# RE: Your posting for an Editorial Assistant

The value of your delightful AspenGlow mysteries, which I avidly consumed as a child, remains unmatched in my life.

From this series, I acquired the ability to persevere in the search for a more effective method . . . skepticism when faced with a too-obvious solution . . . the curiosity to discover what more a person can offer. Each of these traits was inspired by AspenGlow. All are qualifications that the successful editor must possess.

The older I get, the more I appreciate what Frick Publishing and AspenGlow brought to my life. And as I am still far from retirement, I am able to bring these talents back to you. I have attached my resume to demonstrate that my experience is as relevant as my enthusiasm.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet in person so that you may consider me as a serious candidate for the position of editorial assistant.

# Letter 5-104 Employee Benefits Manager

# RE: Monster.com ad for an Employee Benefits Manager

Employee benefits are as vital to your organization as they are to your staff. However, the details inherent in most benefits plans can make administering them cumbersome and time-consuming—which is why you are now seeking an experienced professional. In me, you have found one.

As you’ll see on the attached resume, I have managed all aspects of a comprehensive benefits program, including complex healthcare programs, COBRA, and the new Affordable Care Act regulations. Of special value to you, given your pending acquisition of U.S. Consumer Goods, is my expertise in managing all types of qualified retirement plans and nonqualified executive programs, meeting the combined needs of both the company and the employee.

In uniting U.S. Consumer Goods’ plan with yours, my unique experience is essential to ensuring proper fiduciary compliance and accurate tax reporting in a regulatory environment as volatile as ours is today. I am adept at plan design, administration, and recordkeeping. I have worked closely with providers to enhance investment management and significantly improve cash flow and fund returns.

I’d like to discuss these and other ways in which I can bring you genuine effectiveness in your employee benefits program, and genuine cost-effectiveness to your bottom line.

Sincerely,

In this letter to a recruiter, the writer describes his experience clearly and convincingly. He also brings himself to life by including personality traits that suggest that he would be an interesting person to interview, which is not always the case and therefore can serve as an important advantage over other candidates.

# Letter 5-107 Management and Quality Training

RE: SimplyHired ad for Director, Management and Quality Training

To move forward powerfully, effectively, and rapidly, today’s employees must align themselves with common goals and with common ways to achieve these goals.

Invariably, in promoting the concept of goal-oriented performance management, the organizations with which I have worked were pleased to discover that what’s missing in many other quality initiatives is precisely what I have learned in more than 16 years of building high-performance teams. I have combined my methodology with the tools of quality and process management to create a synergy that is far superior to either approach standing alone.

As Director of your Management and Quality Training program, I will successfully lead your staff members to challenge the traditional “not my job” orientation. Instead, they will:

•	 Adopt a broad view, questioning and looking beyond existing methods of operating, in order to invest in the future. •	 Raise the overall level of their commitment (despite setbacks, lack of support, and the passage of time) through the creation and nourishment of a vision of quality.

The rewards are profound. The process is painless when you have the proper training and commitment at the helm. Let’s get together so that we can discuss this in person.

# Letter 5-109 Director, Human Resources and Administration— Career Change

# RE: Director of Human Resources and Administrative Services

The position described in your ad seems to have been written for me. I have the precise qualifications you seek, and have been searching for just this opportunity to apply my business background to academic life.

Allow me to elaborate on the attached resume to demonstrate the strengths I can bring to your institution.

Human Resources Expertise. My employee relations responsibilities have made me skilled at conflict resolution, staffing, development, and personal counseling. For administrative hiring and staff recruiting, I develop position profiles, supervise onboarding/training and benefits administration, direct and provide input for employee evaluations and compensation, ensure legal compliance, and advance policy.

Administrative Expertise. Acting as the de facto Director of Administration, I supervise office and facilities services, marketing administration, and the research library. Because I have successfully directed projects involving the structuring and implementation of an online library “catalogue,” office redesign, equipment planning and acquisition, marketing database design, and planning an e-newsletter, I can spearhead these and other initiatives on your behalf.

Exceptional Written Communication Skills. My ongoing work creating policy statements, project summaries, and e-newsletter and website content as well as presentations for myself and the company’s senior management provides you with a valuable on-staff resource.

Throughout my successful career, I have maintained my connection to academia through my graduate studies in the sociology of education. The university environment is one in which I am well versed, challenged, and entirely comfortable.

I would welcome the opportunity to apply my skills and expertise in an academic setting such as yours. I offer you, in return, a colleague with the focus and ability to perform effectively under pressure— talents refined through 12 years in a fast-paced corporate setting.

# Letter 5-110 Director, Quality Management

The fact that you have advertised for a Quality Management Director demonstrates your commitment to realigning the corporate culture. It is this same commitment that has defined my career.

Indeed, over the past 25 years in corporate training and human resource development, my focus has been on supporting innovation and leadership—on actively designing rather than adapting to the future.

I am certain that my past achievements augur similar productivity improvements for Americana. For example, I have led corporate management teams to:

•	 Commit themselves entirely to the goal of superior quality in every aspect of service and performance.   
•	 Drive this commitment into every level of the organization’s culture and operations so that it becomes the everyday way of working.   
•	 Free managers from their traditional focus on authority and control so that they can embrace critical leadership ideals.   
•	 Build these transformations into an existing infrastructure, thus avoiding costly and time-consuming changes that erode success.

Undoubtedly, these are the objectives you seek to realize at Americana—and I would consider it a privilege to explore them further with you. I feel certain that my background and expertise (described in detail on the attached resume) would be a singular asset to your organization.

# The Follow-Up Letter

# How Follow-Up Letters Differ from Thank You Letters

Before you read any further, it’s imperative that you understand the distinction between the Follow-Up Letter, which is covered in this chapter, and the Thank You Letter, which is covered in the following chapter. In a Thank You Letter, your sole purpose for writing is to express appreciation. In the Follow-Up Letter, your “thank you” is only an excuse for writing to someone who has the power either to hire you or to influence the hiring decision in your favor.

In this chapter, we focus on the follow-up letter, the letter or e-mail that you send after being interviewed for a position that you are interested in attaining. Although you may begin your follow-up letter by thanking your reader for a meeting, advice, a referral, or consideration, your primary goal is to continue promoting yourself and your candidacy. You accomplish this by achieving your secondary goal, which is to strengthen the connection with your reader that you established during an interview, meeting, or other prior contact.

When should you send a follow-up letter after interviewing for a position in which you are interested? Always. When should you send the same person another follow-up letter after interviewing a second time for a position in which you are interested? Always. When should you send a follow-up letter after receiving help from someone who can influence the hiring decision? Always.

You’ll find follow-up letters easy to draft if you follow these steps.

# Step 1: Reestablish the Connection

Open your letter or e-mail by mentioning something that will identify you to your reader, such as the time or place of the meeting. Because it’s likely that your prospective employer has met with numerous candidates, it’s vital that she remembers you. If your meeting occurred early in the hiring process, it’s even more critical that your interviewer remembers you. And it’s vital that her memory of you is a positive one.

Therefore, in your opening, refer to a common link that was revealed during your meeting. You may have discovered, for example, that you and your interviewer both worked at the same company in the past, or that you share an alma mater, professional association, or business philosophy. Such a connection subtly suggests that you and your prospective employer are similar in some way, and that you will find common ground on which to build a rapport. (Unless you’re planning to work for Scrooge himself, it’s a sure bet that your next boss will be searching for someone with whom he or she can get along on a daily basis.)

If there is no apparent connection of this type, refer to an unusual topic you discussed with your interviewer, or something you believe may be of interest or importance to whomever you’re writing.

# Sample Openings

■ I enjoyed our lunch at the River Club, and I thank you for your interest in me.   
■ It was a pleasure meeting you on Monday, and I appreciate the time you spent with me.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# An Interview to Remember

Interviewing in the office of your prospective employer affords you an unbeatable opportunity. Scan the room for photographs, trophies, awards, or diplomas. If it’s on display, it probably represents something positive to its owner. Use this as a point of discussion that you can refer to later on in your follow-up. It will help you establish a personal connection that your competition may not share—and make you more memorable to your interviewer.

■ Our meeting last week was very valuable for me, and I appreciate your willingness to fit me into your busy schedule.   
■ It was a pleasure meeting you again yesterday to discuss the opening in your media department. I especially appreciate your willingness to meet me so early in the morning.   
■ Thank you for your time last Friday. It was a pleasure discussing the plans you’ve conceived for your sales team, and I would welcome the opportunity to develop new business for your division.   
■ Meeting with you Tuesday morning was invaluable to me. It was rewarding to discover that a fellow U.S. Iron veteran has penetrated the upper echelons of our industry. Working with you would be a privilege. Thank you for your time at our breakfast on the 14th. I enjoyed meeting you, and swapping mountain bike trail secrets. Perhaps our paths will cross on Mt. Boulder; I certainly hope they will cross in business.   
■ I appreciate the time you spent with me on the 26th and the information you provided on Data International’s growth strategies. It was heartening to learn that we share the same excitement regarding the future of our industry, a future in which I hope to play an important role.   
■ Thank you for your time this past Wednesday morning. I enjoyed meeting with you again and comparing HydroMat stories. Our combined experiences certainly represent the good, the bad, and the ugly!

# Recruiter’s Tip

# To Be . . . or Not to Be: Manager or Recruiter?

Few of the people with whom you’ll meet will be trained recruiters or skilled interviewers. They are simply managers with a position to fill. A strong follow-up letter can help them accomplish the following:

Narrow their choices.   
Match your skills to their needs.   
Let them know that you’re still available.

And get back to work!

■ I am grateful to you for introducing me to your colleagues. Meeting Mr. Simon and Ms. Weiss has only enhanced my desire to put my strengths to work on your behalf. I would be thrilled to join the impressive legal team you’ve built.   
■ Thank you for introducing me to Jim Williams. As you predicted, he offered me a wealth of advice. I’m grateful for his perspective and for your interest.

# Step 2: Inform

You may notice that this step is the same as Step 2 in your resume cover letters. That’s because in both situations, your letter is dedicated to promoting your candidacy. To do so, you must sell both your strengths and the benefits they will bring your next employer.

In the body of your letter, remind your reader of the skills or knowledge you have that make you perfectly suited to fill the open position. But don’t stop with that—as your competition will.

Link these qualities to the meaningful advantages that they offer your next boss and her company. To do this, think of your unique attributes as falling into four categories: profits, productivity, performance, and personal satisfaction. Ask yourself how you can contribute to the success of the organization or firm, a specific division, a team of people, or your immediate supervisor. Will your skills help to enhance productivity? Will your past achievements equip you to help increase future profits? Will you add to or improve performance metrics? Will your personal satisfaction contribute in some way, such as boosting morale, setting an example, or introducing new ideas or a new perspective? You’ll find that the most important benefits you can deliver will involve one or more of these areas.

In the body of your follow-up letter, you might also supply additional references or more detailed information on your skills. You might clarify or strengthen comments made during an interview.

If you are attempting to overcome a problem that was raised in your interview, provide a clear explanation with valid support points—not excuses! A good illustration is provided in Follow-Up Letter 6-1. In this case, the writer had traveled to Denver to interview for a position in which she was very interested. Later, thinking back on the meeting, she became discouraged. Although she was more than willing to relocate for the job, she worried that her interviewer may have regarded the fact that she was from out of town as a drawback—a problem that she did not perceive or address at the time. Instead of giving up, however, she responded with significant assurances that she could relocate successfully, building contacts and business relationships as she has done before.

# Letter 6-1 Follow-Up Letter—Insurance Sales—Relocation

Thank you for spending so much time with me during my visit to your headquarters on Monday.

Seeing the respect that was evident between you and your colleagues was completely refreshing for me—as was discovering the innovative sales strategies that you’ve introduced. I am eager to join forces with you.

You can count on me to quickly become a familiar face to prospects, clients, and business leaders in and around Denver. Through previous moves, I have become adept at forging contacts and friendships through my personal interest in the arts as well as my participation in the activities of local business groups (such as the Lifers Club, United Way, Police Athletic League, Financial Marketing Association, Advertising Club, and the Red Cross in Atlanta). Turning these connections into sales is integral to my status as the top biller at my agency for four years running.

I will forward additional information to you shortly to support what my record has already proven: that I will produce nothing less than outstanding results for you and Long Life.

Sincerely,

# Step 3: Instruct

It can be beneficial to include a reference to what will happen next in the hiring process—even if it’s simply that you will wait to be contacted. Clarifying this can help avoid misunderstandings about who will take the next step.

If the next step will be his or hers, describe your understanding of what the reader will do. Be sure to provide a complete address, e-mail address, and telephone number at which you can be reached, stating whether the number is for work, home, or a mobile phone. As you did in your Resume Cover Letter, let your reader know if you prefer to be called during certain hours and if confidentiality is an issue.

If you will be the one to take the next step, tell the reader what to expect. You may make a general reference, such as, “I’ll call you shortly.” Or you may be specific about what, when, and how you’ll follow up: by phone, e-mail, Skype, or some other avenue or action. If you know that the hiring process has just begun, inform the reader that you’ll call to follow up in two weeks, ten days, or whenever you feel it’s appropriate.

Attaching supplemental material to your follow-up letter or e-mail always requires an explanation. Describe what is in the attachment: an updated resume, a list of accomplishments, references, a link to your website, or other information.

If you will be sending something to the reader, such as a letter of reference, explain what it is and when and how it should arrive.

# Optional Step 4: Close Warmly

A strong, yet warm closing line leaves your reader with a positive impression.

When appropriate, lighthearted, friendly, and even personal sign-offs are also acceptable and advisable. You might make a personal reference or mention something about the reader that suggests that he is not receiving a form letter, but rather getting a letter that was written specifically to him. If you are on a first-name basis with your reader, you might add the reader’s name to your closing. A warm ending to your message makes you seem friendly and approachable, and indicates that you are the kind of person with whom most of us would prefer to work.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Thorough Follow-Through

After an interview, follow-through on your part is critical. The person to whom you’re writing may not scrutinize every word in your follow-up letter, but he or she will surely notice that you’ve sent one—and be impressed that you did!

Plus, a good recruiter will expect to hear from you on the precise day you promised to follow up—so do so. Without fail.

How do you gauge the right tone? Generally, the degree of warmth you add should correspond with the number of times you’ve met your reader—without ever crossing the line by getting too personal or being rude. Use your judgment; do what you feel comfortable with—but by all means, don’t choose not to close your letter because you don’t feel like writing a closing line.

Here are some sample closings for the follow-up letter that may inspire you!

# Sample Closings

■ Thank you for your time and consideration.   
■ I appreciate your assistance.

■ Bill, I would consider it a privilege to join forces with you and hope to hear from you shortly.   
■ I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your firm, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

# Letter 6-2 Follow-Up Letter—Bank Operations Manager

Thank you for allowing me to present myself as a candidate for Operations Manager, a prospect about which I am very excited. It was a pleasure meeting you on Wednesday—and discovering our mutual midwestern roots!

Given my background, I can understand the need for a manager who can attend to detail without compromising the division’s overall profitability. Throughout my tenure with Fidelity, I have worked to achieve these demanding goals. During the past 10 years, I personally led the division to cut costs by $36 \%$ while improving our overall accuracy rate to $9 8 \%$ .

Informs by providing a benefit that is meaningful to the employer.

What this means for you is that as Constitution’s Operations Manager, I can bring the same skill, insight, and experience to motivate your staff to improve accuracy, streamline costs, and increase the effectiveness of the “back room,” bringing operations to the forefront of the bank’s profit centers.

Instructs how the next step will occur.

I will contact you shortly to see when we might meet again to expand upon this vital goal.

When her interview was unexpectedly cut short, this candidate arranged to complete it the next day via Skype. She used this unusual situation to remind the reader of their meeting and then continued with an upbeat tone.

# Letter 6-3 Follow-Up Letter—Attorney

I’m so pleased we were able to continue our discussions via Skype, and I thank you for your time.

As you can tell, I am very excited about the opportunity to work with you and the top-notch team you’ve developed at Gencliffe, Ackerman, and Hahn. I am particularly inspired by your belief in the value of promoting from within, which seems to be a rare insight these days. For this reason, and to provide further proof of the unique talents I can bring to your team, I have enclosed a summary of my recent case findings.

I am eager to prove my abilities to you on a firsthand basis. I will keep in touch to see when we might meet again, and if there is any other information I can provide you in the meantime.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

# Letter 6-4 Follow-Up Letter—Medical Research and Design

Thank you for your time during our luncheon last week. My journey from Conshohocken to Reading was a breeze, just as you predicted!

VisionQuest’s innovations are legendary, and it was fascinating to discover the efforts that went into your unique achievements. Those who benefit from your firm’s breakthrough technologies in nonsurgical visual impairment treatments cannot imagine the dedication and training required of your teams.

I would welcome the opportunity to join a team such as yours and have, therefore, attached a summary of my own accomplishments in research and design. Because my procedures and standards of measurement are so similar to those employed by VisionQuest, my assimilation with your team’s methodology would be quite smooth—a breeze, in fact, like my trip to Reading!

Please let me know what additional information I can provide to help sway your hiring decision in my direction. I thank you again for your time.

Another example of ingenuity following an interrupted interview. Enclosing a photo is unusual . . . exactly why it will attract attention!

# Letter 6-5 Follow-Up Letter—Sales/Marketing

It was a pleasure meeting you during my visit to Albany, and I look forward to the opportunity to continue our discussion.

After a delightful and very informative lunch with Susan Camelitto, I am tremendously excited by the prospect of working in the challenging and highly creative environment you’ve established. In return, I will bring you my proven strengths in research and new business development.

As our meeting was cut short, I have taken the liberty of enclosing my picture so that I’m clearly in your mind until we meet again, and I can convince you that I’m the ideal addition to your team.

Sincerely,

# Letter 6-6 Follow-Up Letter—IT—Sales

Thank you for your time on Wednesday. Our discussion left me even more excited about your sales team—and convinced that I’d be a perfect fit.

As you know, I have dedicated the last 10 years of my career to systems engineering and administration. Now I’m eager to make that same commitment to a promising start-up—as Manning Technologies is.

Hire me, and you’ll get a loyal employee who works hard and smart, thrives in a high-energy, fast-paced environment, and understands how to deliver end-to-end business solutions for the enterprise and middle-market sectors. You’ll get someone with an established, solid reputation who will add to your image and your bottom line.

Arthur, I look forward to building big things together.

# Letter 6-7 Follow-Up Letter—Supply Chain Management

I enjoyed our meeting last week and appreciate your time and candor. As another ex-Hewlett-Packard employee, your perspective was especially meaningful to me.

My decade of experience in supply chain management has made me a planner, a promoter, and a problem solver—and it is a real pleasure to meet someone who values these qualities. Joining a division that recognizes and depends upon these strengths provides precisely the environment and challenge that I seek.

In return, I offer you my proven record of improving efficiency and reducing costs, exceeding revenue goals and meeting budget objectives, improving forecast accuracy, strengthening working capital, and ensuring raw materials and manpower availability—all of which my superiors will verify as my references!

I’d welcome the opportunity to work with you and will be in contact to see how we can make this happen.

The Case of the Poor Interviewer: although this candidate could tell that the employer was impressed with her qualifications, she also surmised that he didn’t know how best to make use of her skills. So she gives him several ideas.

# Letter 6-8 Follow-Up Letter—General

Thank you for the time you so generously spent with me this afternoon.

Now that I know so much more about NetworCorp’s varied activities, I am even more eager to be a part of the company’s future. Certainly, your firm and I both thrive on creativity, innovation, and the energy of the entrepreneur and the deal maker.

For this reason, as I mentioned during our meeting, I hope that you will think of me should an opportunity arise. Whether it is sales or marketing, dealing with the largest advertisers or new business development, or working abroad or as your right-hand man, I would welcome the chance to work with you.

I thank you again for your time and consideration.

# Letter 6-9 Follow-Up Letter—General

Meeting you today was a real pleasure. I enjoyed touring your facility and seeing a staff that collaborates so seamlessly to achieve impressive productivity. Quite a departure from the typical corporate environment!

As we discussed, the position is an exciting one for which I am superbly qualified, and it would be an honor to join your team. The range of skills I can bring to your organization would allow your managers to devote more time to joint fieldwork, and ultimately increase your bottom-line profits.

I will call on Friday as you suggested to see whether Roger Transwood has returned and is available to meet with me.

Thank you again for your time. I look forward to seeing you again very soon.

# Letter 6-10 Follow-Up Letter—Security

It was a pleasure speaking with you recently about your plans to expand into Asia’s corporate market.

I am anxious to pursue our discussion of the exciting profit potential that such a program can offer your firm—a potential of which I am well aware, having built Wytech Security’s South American program from the ground up to its current status as a major profit center for the company.

As a springboard for this discussion, I have attached my updated resume, as my responsibilities have recently increased. I now lead the planning and implementation of one of the company’s major strategic initiatives: promoting multisite security systems throughout the Americas. I am responsible for the sale of full-service security system packages, which include customized system design, installation, and staff training.

As a result, I can deliver the experience, foresight, and personal contacts required to tap Asia’s corporate security market and to take full advantage of its potential for return.

I will contact you again shortly to see how we might proceed. I thank you again for your consideration and look forward to seeing you.

# Letter 6-11 Follow-Up Letter—Student

Thank you for speaking with me at the recent State Collegiate Career Fair. Our conversation made a striking impression on me, and I appreciate your interest and encouragement.

As we discussed, I have attached my resume as a follow-up to our discussion. Allow me to provide this brief overview of what I can offer your firm:

Leadership: Student Government Vice President, Sorority President, and Big Sister Volunteer while maintaining a 3.5 GPA.

Interpersonal Strengths: I am pleased to report that my colleagues describe me as a go-getter who is reliable, pleasant, encouraging, and loyal.

Drive: I will be available to begin work immediately upon receiving my BS in Business Administration this spring from State University.

I will be in the area again next month, and will call to set up an appointment. In the meantime, I thank you again for your time at the Career Fair, and look forward to meeting you again soon.

# Letter 6-12 Follow-Up Letter—Bookkeeper

Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the Bookkeeper position. Hearing you recount the growth your company has enjoyed, I am certain that your own hard work and commitment are the roots of your success.

As your bookkeeper, I will bring the same dedication to the fulfillment of your firm’s accounting responsibilities.

•	 I am adept at handling all aspects of your accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, and payroll taxes. My five years of experience in these areas means that you can rely on me for skill and accuracy.   
•	 Unlike others in my field, I am well versed in handling a payroll with diverse commissions and bonus structures. This reduces or eliminates the potential for problems that arise when payment errors aggravate your sales representatives.   
•	 Furthermore, my technological proficiency (Peachtree, MAS90, and QuickBooks for Mac) allows me to contribute immediately, without taking valuable company time for training.

I would very much like to join your firm. If you require any additional information before making your decision, please let me know. I would be pleased to visit your office again for another meeting or provide further references, if you wish.

In her interview, this candidate picked up on the importance her prospective boss placed on a single qualification: the ability to deal with difficult people. She focused on this here, even providing additional references to support her claim.

# Letter 6-13 Follow-Up Letter—Assistant Buyer

It was wonderful speaking with you last week. Thank you for spending so much time with me.

I am extremely interested in pursuing the Assistant Buyer opening at your firm because it represents the perfect match between your needs and my strengths.

My retailing background has familiarized me with an industry in which diplomacy and tact are of supreme importance. As we discussed, the ability to assess an individual quickly in order to respond appropriately and productively is more a personality trait than an acquired skill—it can rarely be taught.

I am pleased to report that my colleagues have repeatedly acknowledged my abilities in interpersonal communications. In fact, I invite you to check my LinkedIn profile to view recommendations from colleagues and clients on this very topic.

I hope it is evident that I would welcome the chance to work for Valentin Designs with you personally, Mr. Valentin. Please let me know if there is any further information you require.

Like its predecessor, Cover Letter 5-87, this letter is heartfelt and sincere, yet still informative—very effective.

# Letter 6-14 Follow-Up Letter—Teaching Artist

Thank you for taking an interest in me as a teaching artist for Lincoln Center. I enjoyed our conversation last week, and have received the information you forwarded to me.

This position represents an important opportunity for me to continue my productive association with the Lincoln Center Institute. As both a dancer and a dance captain with LCI, I meet regularly with the artists prior to our performances to explore the link between the classroom material and the postperformance open talk. Invariably, this preparation proves priceless to students, who benefit from a newfound familiarity with the elements of dance and the terminology introduced in class.

This, along with my current participation as a member of your affiliated New York City Baroque Dance Company, reinforces my teaching philosophy: to share with my students the great joy of movement. I have found that every student can experience the pleasures of dancing, and of learning about the many methods for expression through movement. Depending upon their age and level, I introduce my students to various technical challenges, dance forms, and elements of composition. With the advantage of live performance, which your program offers, a teacher can guide the students toward a better understanding and appreciation of the performing arts. Books, pictures, and video can enhance, but not replace, the experience of a live performance—and the students truly enjoy it!

As an artist, I believe we have an obligation to show society the ways in which art can be brought into the mainstream of education. As a mother, I understand that a child’s intellectual and emotional development must be well rounded. I feel strongly that we can allow neither politics nor family dysfunction to affect an entire new generation adversely. We owe it to future artists to help create a society that is supportive of the arts, one in which the arts may flourish.

Combined, my experience and commitment offer the advantages that only a dedicated artist and educator can offer. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you personally. I salute the wonderful LCI program, and thank you again for your consideration.

# Letter 6-15 Follow-Up Letter—Pharmaceuticals— Technical Writer

Congratulations on your promotion! It’s so gratifying to see women recognized for their skills.

I enjoyed speaking with you on the phone yesterday, and with this note, I am forwarding information on myself and my capabilities. As you’ll see, I’ve had a fair amount of experience within the financial services arena as well as a pseudo-medical education.

My particular expertise is in the pharmaceuticals industry, a field in which many writers are less fluent. I am well versed in the chemical and medical terminology that supports a vast range of pediatric, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and nutriceutical prescriptions and over-the-counter products, as well as the regulations governing their discussion in any public forum. This knowledge allows me to execute a greater number of projects at a far faster pace than other technical writers.

I would welcome the chance to show you samples of my work, at your convenience. When things settle down for both of us, let’s get together. I will call you again toward the end of this month.

In the meantime, I wish you the best in your new position.

# Letter 6-16 Follow-Up Letter—Medical Research—Job Loss

It was great to see you and reminisce about our days at Growth Systems. Seems like just yesterday—but I digress!

Although I am chagrined that Genebyte’s hiring freeze is still in place, I do appreciate your offer to recommend me after the thaw. As you know, our work at Growth Systems during the early days of stem cell research affords us a background that few can match. It would be a thrill to join forces with you again—especially on a project as exciting as your human genome initiative.

Hal, thanks again for seeing me and filling me in on Genebyte’s activities. Please give my regards to Jill.

I’ll keep in touch.

# Letter 6-17 Follow-Up Letter—Fund-Raising/Development

Thank you so much for your time today discussing the possibility of my joining the University development team. It is clear from our talking (and my learning) that the school is in a state of uneasy transition, and yet also, and more important, is prepared to raise significant funding to strengthen and support its primary mission to “prepare tomorrow’s leaders to shape a just and humane society.”

All that is needed now is the right person for the job—someone who is qualified to cultivate confidence and earn the trust of her colleagues and constituency, who is genuine in her support of the school and persuasive in generating substantial and ongoing financial support, with the drive to succeed in positioning the University to thrive in the years ahead.

Of course, I would like to think that I have those qualities! To the extent that I do not, however, I am certain that I could develop them under your able leadership. For these reasons, I remain both intrigued by and keenly interested in joining your development team.

In the interests of full disclosure, I want you to know that I do have two interviews lined up this week for other positions in the field, but I will look forward to hearing from you in the days and weeks ahead regarding next steps in the process. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

# The Thank You Letter

Note: Before you proceed any further into this chapter than this paragraph, be sure you are reading the appropriate material. The Thank You Letter and the Follow-Up Letter are entirely different from each other. Each is written and sent under completely different circumstances. If you have just concluded an interview and wish to send a letter to promote your candidacy further, turn back to Chapter 6 for instructions on how to compose a Follow-Up Letter. If you wish to send a brief, yet sincere, note of appreciation—and you have no hidden agenda—read on.

# When to Send a Thank You Letter

Thank you letters are honest and straightforward, with a simple, singular message. Your only reason for writing is to say “thank you,” and nothing else. You may be expressing your gratitude to someone for an introduction, advice, a referral, or serving as a reference for you. You may have interviewed for a job that you do not intend to pursue, but wish to thank your interviewer for seeing you.

These are the circumstances that occasion writing and sending a thank you letter, and effective jobhunters never overlook them. In fact, you should actively seek opportunities to send thank you notes. The reason is simple: people like to be appreciated. Doing something for someone else involves going out of our way, and we feel (rightly) that we deserve acknowledgment for it. If we give nothing more than our time, we’ve given a great deal, as time is, invariably, in short supply. When you satisfy this need to be appreciated, you help cement a positive image of yourself in your reader’s mind—one that will serve you well should you ever approach this person with another request. And in today’s complex, connected, interactive business environment, you will. Not only are you highly likely to have additional contact with your reader, but successful networking depends upon it. Do not miss an opportunity to send a thank you note—you may be repaid with unexpected surprises later on!

At its most basic, a thank you letter is an expression of feelings. These e-mails, letters, and notes should be short, and, contrary to popular belief, they are easy to write as long as you state your message simply. Your primary goal is to thank someone for her time, assistance, or support. You should have no secondary goal; if you do, it’s likely that the letter you should be writing is a Follow-up Letter (see Chapter 6) or a Make Something Happen Letter (see Chapter 8).

# Step 1: State the Occasion

Open your letter by referring to the occasion that inspired it. Tell the reader why you’re writing. Be clear, direct, and brief. A few examples follow; you’ll find plenty more in the sample letters in this chapter.

# Sample Openings

Thank you for your time and advice.   
Thank you for seeing me yesterday.   
Your time and advice are most appreciated, and I thank you for meeting with me.   
Knowing how busy you are at this time of year, I am grateful that you were able to make the time to meet with me.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Berate the Belated

Thank you letters should be short, direct, and easier to compose than other jobhunting letters—   
so there’s no excuse for delaying sending them. Always send your letter within one or two days of whatever occasion you’re acknowledging. If you can’t meet this deadline, send a letter whenever you can, even weeks after the fact.   
It’s never too late to thank someone for a kindness.

■ Thank you for fitting me into your busy schedule. I appreciate the suggestions you made regarding my search for work and have already begun to contact the organizations you recommended. I appreciate your willingness to help me in my job search and thank you for passing my name along to your associates. Thank you for serving as a reference for me in my job search. Your recommendation will prove most valuable, as your name is so highly regarded in our field. Thank you for introducing me to Dr. Beatty. I appreciate your assistance and the referral to such an outstanding professional.

# Step 2: Provide Information or State Your Feelings

The body of your letter is the place to provide a bit of detail. This is where you’ll tell your reader how his or her assistance was valuable to you.

Be specific about what you are thanking your readers for; if they don’t know you personally, they may have already forgotten you! Make your thanks meaningful to the person who helped you—if the results of that help were positive, mention them and the difference they made in your job search. Say, for example, that a colleague recommended that you contact a Ms. Farrell. You called her, scheduled a get-together, and gained important advice during the meeting. Because your colleague will want to know how you used the referral and how the meeting went, you might write:

Meeting Ms. Farrell was invaluable to me. She shared with me her view of the future of endocrine therapy research, which in turn, led me to refine my job search strategy. As a result of our meeting, I will be contacting Stan Whitmore, an acquaintance of Ms. Farrell’s, who directs product development for Pfizer Inc.’s pharmaceutical division.

Not only is it a courtesy to inform your colleague of the results of the referral, but it’s good networking. With the knowledge that you have handled the referral properly (and that Ms. Farrell found you impressive enough to refer you to one of her own colleagues), your friend is likely to be willing to provide additional assistance in the future. (It should go without saying that the next letter you write will be to Ms. Farrell.)

If you choose not to go into this level of detail—for example, if the results were less than you expected—state your feelings instead of providing information. In this case, the rule is always: say—don’t describe— how you feel. Whether you’re mildly grateful, very grateful, eternally grateful, or not at all grateful, this can be accomplished in very few words. Give the necessary information and stop.

Your thank you letters should always be brief, direct, and written with a positive tone of voice. Because they are short and easy to write, there’s no excuse for avoiding sending a thank you letter. So don’t pass up this chance to network! Use the sample letters provided on the following pages to guide you as you compose your own.

# Letter 7-1 Thank You for Time and Contact— Marketing/Advertising—Social Media

Gracias! Merci! Danke schoen! Thank you! In any language, my appreciation is genuine. You gave me your time and your expert advice this past Tuesday, and I am very grateful.

You reassured me that despite tough times in the ad business, opportunities do exist for those who are willing to create them—and social media seems to be THE place to start. Thanks to my experience in targeting niche markets, I am ideally equipped to tap new markets and build user engagement to build the kind of trust and familiarity that will ultimately drive sales, especially online and globally.

How it helped.

Your suggestion to contact Victor Morelli is much appreciated. I have just e-mailed him my resume; I hope to discuss with him Victory Advertising’s international plans, to which, I am certain, I can contribute fresh ideas, valuable experience, and strategic insight.

With sincerest thanks,

# Letter 7-2 Thank You for Contact—General

Thank you for forwarding my resume to William Ford.

Mr. Ford has contacted me, and we plan to meet on Tuesday, March 5. Our brief telephone conversation assures me that he will be a valuable resource in my job search.

I will call you next week to let you know the details of our meeting.

I appreciate your efforts on my behalf.

# Letter 7-3 Thank You for Referral—Legal

Thank you for referring me to Bill Hancock at Manhattan Legal Services.

Mr. Hancock contacted me today, and we have scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday, the 17th of April.

I couldn’t have been more pleased when he indicated that it was you who referred me to him. My sincerest thanks for thinking of me, and making the time for an introduction. You have become a valuable resource in my job search, and I am grateful for all you have done.

I will let you know the results of my meeting with Mr. Hancock.

With best regards,

# Letter 7-4 Thank You for Consideration

Thank you for your time and interest during our meeting last week. American Products’ planned expansion into South American and African markets is as fascinating as it is challenging.

While the opportunity to participate in this exciting new venture is extremely appealing, I must, unfortunately, withdraw my name from consideration. I had hoped to be able to accept an international assignment, but I have recently been offered additional responsibilities in my current position, which will also involve limited travel overseas.

Nonetheless, I want to thank you for allowing me to explore what promises to be a career-making opportunity for the executive fortunate enough to be selected.

Meeting you was a pleasure, and I will stay in touch. My best wishes for your continued success.

# Letter 7-5 Thank You for Reference

I have just returned from my second interview with Phyllis Anderson at Anderson, Wilton, and Slatsky. She was thrilled with your comments about my performance during my tenure with you at DPC International—and so am I!

As you know, I am anxious to further my career, and working with Ms. Anderson will supplement my experience in a meaningful and productive way.

I am so grateful to you for providing me with a positive recommendation. One day the opportunity will arise for me to repay your kindness, and you can be certain that I will do exactly that with great enthusiasm.

In the meantime, my deepest thanks.

This is a lovely thank you note that sets the stage should this student decide to contact the reader again later in the networking process.

# Letter 7-6 Thank You for Advice—Student

I cannot let another day pass without letting you know how very valuable I found your Jobhunting Seminar at North Carolina University last month. Your suggestions, ideas, and tips were very enlightening, and I have already put them to use in my job search.

Of greatest benefit for many of us was the motivation you sparked. Continuing the search can be especially daunting for students, who are competing with the hundreds of thousands of graduates flooding the market each spring, not to mention the many Americans already looking for work.

I shall remember your advice every day until I have successfully secured employment—when I hope to have the chance to pass it along to other students graduating in the years to come.

Best regards,

Before this contact, this jobhunter wrote her professor to ask whether he would serve as a reference. That letter appears in Chapter 9. (See Letter 9-1.)

# Letter 7-7 Thank You for Reference—Student

I owe you dual thanks: first, for serving as a reference for me to aid in my job search, and second, for your kind words.

I have just heard from John Brunswick at St. Louis Federal, and Leslie Rubin at the South County Credit Union. They both informed me that you offered high praise of my work and my attitude.

As a result of your recommendations, I have been invited to join South County’s training program. I should learn my status at St. Louis Federal shortly, and you can be certain that I will contact you as soon as I receive this decision.

So, for your dual role in my search, I thank you once, and I thank you again.

Friends and family deserve recognition just as much as business colleagues do. The only difference is that a thank you letter such as this one (which is written to the mother of a high school buddy) may be handwritten on personal notepaper, if you choose. An alternative is to use a more casual or script font in an e-mail.

# Letter 7-8 Thank You for Contact—General

Thank you for introducing me to your brother, Charles Armour. I spoke with his Administrative Assistant just this morning and have scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday at his Maple Shade plant!

Armour Development has such a fine reputation in our area. I am looking forward to touring your brother’s facilities and gaining the benefit of any advice he may offer in my job search.

Mrs. Gold, it was so kind of you to help me. I truly appreciate your interest. Just as when Tom and I were playing football for the high school, you’re still cheering us on! That support means a lot. Thank you.

Fondly,

# Letter 7-9 Thank You for Time and Contact—General

Just a note to thank you for a most enjoyable early Monday morning meeting. It was nice meeting you and then seeing you again later at the CPG outing!

Now that I know more about your organization’s objectives and opportunities, I am excited about the potential for reaching new segments of the market. I appreciate your willingness to have me meet your colleague, Frank Harley, a meeting I have arranged for next Wednesday.

Your offer to call with any questions that may arise is a kind one, and I will surely keep in touch. Thank you again for your interest.

# Letter 7-10 Thank You for Contact—General

It was a pleasure speaking with you on the phone last week.

I want to thank you for arranging for me to meet with Bill Stern on Monday, May 24, at 10:30 a.m. In preparation for this meeting, I have reviewed all the press releases posted on the website, and I am also reviewing the annual report that you kindly forwarded to me.

I am looking forward to meeting Mr. Stern and discovering more about Hyland, Kincaid, Stern.

Thank you again for your kind assistance.

# The Make Something Happen Letter

It never fails. You submit your resume, you ace the interview, and then you wait . . . and wait . . . and wait. W ho knows why? Most likely, the firm hired another candidate without informing you (rude, but common). However, there is also the chance that the hiring process was interrupted because of budget cuts, a hiring freeze, or downsizing, or even because the company was put up for sale. Perhaps the decision makers are having difficulty choosing from among a strong field of candidates. Or perhaps the person responsible for hiring has simply taken a three week vacation.

# How to Jump-Start a Stalled Candidacy

Whatever the reason for the unnerving quiet, you should consider yourself a viable candidate until you hear otherwise. If you haven’t heard anything, you haven’t heard “no,” so take advantage of the uncertainty. Return to the computer, and keep that motivation high. Try to get the hiring process moving in your direction. Writing and sending a wellplanned Make Something Happen Letter demonstrates your eagerness to work for the person or the firm and your ability to follow through on an endeavor to completion—both of which are impressive qualifications to most employers.

The Make Something Happen Letter is aptly named, as its purpose is, quite literally, to make something happen: to rev the hiring engines; to represent yourself as a sterling candidate for the open position; to sway the decision maker’s opinion away from your competitors and toward you. In writing this letter or e-mail, your primary goal is to promote yourself. Your secondary goal is to jump-start the hiring process. And with a little preparation, you can accomplish both simultaneously.

Before you begin to write, take a moment to reassess the situation. Be certain that you have not been rejected so graciously that you may have misunderstood. Be certain that you are a viable candidate, with relevant skills and experience; if you are irrefutably unqualified, there may be little point in pushing now. Most important, try to discern whether the person to whom you’re writing will be receptive to your assertiveness.

If you determine that you are a reasonable candidate and that an active, aggressive step is called for, the “make something happen” letter can often do the trick. If you’re unsure, but you figure that it’s worth a shot, lessen the risk by matching the tone of voice you use in your e-mail to that of your reader or the position you seek. Many of the samples that follow in this chapter involve sales positions, for which assertiveness is a desired quality; the e-mails reflect this trait in the tone the writers adopt.

# Step 1: Get to the Point

No two “make something happen” letters are the same. Each relates spe cifically to the position you’re after, the organization you’ll be a part of

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Resume Lost . . . and Found

Not hearing anything after sending your resume or after interviewing may, indeed, mean that you haven’t been selected.

Or, it could mean that the firm has: No system for responding. Actually lost your resume. Never received your resume. Added your resume to “the stack.” Not completed interviewing.

So write! Make selection an active—not a passive—choice on the firm’s part.

when you have been hired, the industry, the characters of those with whom you’re dealing, and your own personality. Weigh each of these elements in your effort to create an appropriate opening line.

A conservative industry, for example, might dictate the use of a reserved, understated tone. Or, a bolder approach might be effective in shaking things up a bit. Writing to an interviewer who appears to be all suit and wing tips, who would never dress casually on Friday, might call for a completely different opening from one that you would use with a colleague you’ve known for years or someone working in a more relaxed environment, as technology or entertainment settings can be. You’ll find examples of these and other openings in the samples that follow.

If your instinct has proved generally reliable in the past, you’ll probably conjure up an opening that is clever, yet appropriate. If you’re uncertain, adopt a more conservative approach. The bottom line, however, is to get to the point. Your opening should never require as much time to read as you have invested in planning it. Whether you’re thanking your reader for a meeting, reminding him of who you are, providing additional information or references, or asking for the job, get to the point. Then, move along to Step 2.

# Step 2: Make the Point

A quick opening will direct your reader to the body of your letter, in which you’ll make your central point (or points) clearly and concisely. In virtually every case, your “make something happen” letters will be brief.

Say something new in the body of your letter. There’s no justification for repeating points that you’ve already made during an interview or in a previous e-mail—evidently, they didn’t work the first time. Instead, provide new information that is meaningful and beneficial to the reader. If appropriate, furnish additional references that might support your candidacy. Offer to spend more time with your prospective employer, particularly if you suspect that the decision maker is having trouble selecting from a field of strong candidates. Send a link to an article or blog post that is germane to a topic that was discussed during your meeting. Inform your reader of a relevant event that has occurred since you met, such as a goal you achieved, an important sale you netted, an award you earned, or a project you successfully completed.

If you genuinely can’t come up with a single idea to add, try summarizing your qualifications in order to reinforce the fact that you meet all the employer’s requirements.

Whatever your reason for writing, state it succinctly. Remember that you’re writing to get the hiring process moving, not to bog it down further.

# Optional Step 3: The Killer Close

As you review the sample letters that follow, you’ll encounter a variety of different styles. The rule of thumb is this: the more forceful the letter, the more hard-hitting the close. From the direct, “Hire me,” to the warm, polite, “I hope all is well with you and look forward to seeing you soon,” each letter reflects the specifics of that writer’s situation and the players involved.

The assessment of your own situation that you make before beginning to write should carry you through to your close, if you choose to include one. Continue with the same tone of voice you’ve used throughout the letter. Changing your tone now will make you sound insincere.

# Recruiter’s Tip

# Who Says There’s No Free Lunch?

If you’re unemployed, you may need to get a bit creative.

If it’s appropriate for your industry, offer to do the job on a trial basis, part-time, for a special salary arrangement or for free (with a time limit, of course, and a promise—in writing—to hire you should you meet their conditions).

# Samples

# Letter 8-1 Make Something Happen—General

Our last discussion left me thoroughly convinced that I can produce dramatic results for your organization.

Count on my intelligence, experience, innate “people power,” topnotch positioning, negotiation, and follow-up skills to bring in the steady stream of business you seek.

Hire someone with the know-how, the guts, and the goods to succeed.   
Hire someone who’s as committed to performance as you are.   
Hire me.

Strong opening.

Equally strong close.

To keep her name in front of the decision maker, this writer sends additional recommendations supporting her candidacy. Notice her tone of voice: positive, yet polite.

# Letter 8-2 Make Something Happen—Teacher

I had the pleasure of meeting with Marie Hammer last month regarding the opening in the Math Department at Habingdon High School. Because she indicated that you are a member of the selection team, I thought I would forward to you my most recent recommendations, which are attached.

In May of 20XX, I received my MA in Math Education from the University of Vermont, where I was fortunate to have been selected to assist Dr. Michael Gutfreund with his research on the visual acquisition of math skills. Since then, I have been teaching at Prescott South, and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience there.

Thank you for your time. I would consider it a privilege to meet with you in person!

Envisioning a tough selection choice, this candidate offers to meet again with the decision makers, and suggests an additional course of action that even the employer may not have considered. Notice the creative visual approach.

# Letter 8-3 Make Something Happen—General

Now that we’ve met several times, you know more about me. For instance, you know that . . .

I am loyal and reliable.   
I am willing to take on any project.   
I see things through to completion.   
I help my coworkers whenever I can. I want very much to work for you!

Now that your hiring deadline is approaching, perhaps I can help make your selection easier. Please feel free to call me in at any time for another meeting. I would be happy to meet with others on your staff or to complete a sample assignment for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 8-4 Make Something Happen—Sales

Unusual opener grabs attention.

No, I could not be more eager to join forces with you! Yes, as the new leader of your sales team, I will use and foster effective sales skills like this: follow through until the deal is closed.

That’s why I’m writing to you again—to remind you of the uncommon benefits I will deliver as your Sales Manager:

•	 The advantage of existing profitable relationships with decision makers at top retailers in all major markets.   
•	 Unusual strength in perceiving industry trends and challenges, and translating them into sales opportunities—well before others do.   
•	 Proven ability to put these advantages to work for you from day one.

As you know, I am very eager to join your team. Please let me know if I can help you make your selection by providing any supplemental information or coming in for another interview. Feel free to call me at work or at home.

Instead of including them all on his resume, this jobhunter saved several additional accomplishments for just this purpose—to make something happen.

# Letter 8-5 Make Something Happen—Sales/Management

Since my eye-opening and mouth-watering visit to your headquarters (thank you again for your time!), during which my meeting with Paul Salamone was unexpectedly interrupted, I’ve been fortunate to have resumed that conversation yesterday.

As did the discussion that you and I had, my conversation with Mr. Salamone fanned my desire to be a strong and vital part of your sales team.

For evidence of the experience and maturity I can offer you, you have only to look at the outstanding results I’ve produced in a variety of marketplaces under a variety of market conditions. But should you seek greater confirmation, I have attached an overview of my accomplishments in both sales and management, which I also forwarded to Mr. Salamone.

I have no doubt that these successes are but a preview of what I can produce for you and your organization. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

# Letter 8-6 Make Something Happen—Travel—Sales

Good reason to write . . . nice tie-in.

It was a pleasure meeting with you yesterday morning, and I thank you for your time.

I thought you’d be interested in this article: http://blog.ted. com/20XX/06/13/post-2013-iran-election/, which I came across this morning, analyzing the public’s reaction to the election of moderate Hassan Rouhani as successor to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It’s the prospect of working with precisely this kind of challenge—where attitudes can change rapidly and dramatically—that is so tremendously exciting for me.

If you’re looking for proven results within both the traveling private and public sectors, success within and outside of New York, the innovation it takes literally to find money, and someone who can hit the ground running—look no further. My expertise, interest, desire, and track record will fit perfectly.

I have always succeeded by finding or creating opportunities where others thought none existed; it’s how I’ve become and remained top biller at Corporate Travel, Inc., and it’s what I will do for you.

Let’s make it happen!

The length of this letter is justified by the strong and in-depth support points the jobhunter has included to overcome her interviewer’s concerns.

# Letter 8-7 Make Something Happen—Broadcast Sales

My meeting last week with you and Carol Keller has left me even more eager to work with you both, and the Sky Cable team. I am convinced that your needs and my talents are an ideal match. I take the liberty of sharing the reason for my confidence in order to reinforce our discussions!

When I joined WDEN, my list was by no means the largest at the station. I built it to the top-billing list and keep it there through concentrated effort and exceptional organizational skills, and by finding new and better ways to serve the customer—as I will do for you.

I provide consistent, thorough service to my clients. When my clients invest in the station, it’s a direct result of the TRUST they have in me. Not only do I accurately book a large volume of orders, but I regularly monitor schedules to assure correct placement and rotations—which also limits discrepancies and ensures payment.

I serve as a valuable resource for my clients. Thanks to my strong research background, my sales technique goes well beyond selling numbers out of a rating book (at which I excel). To give clients and prospects more information and insight, I take advantage of qualitative marketing tools such as competitive data, online news, and trade sites.

Finally, clients get the benefit of my experience, which is broad and unique. Having been a Local Sales Manager, sold nationally, and worked for a major station group, I have sold a diverse range of products in diverse markets. This exposure has broadened my outlook and enables me to help my clients pinpoint target audiences by identifying appropriate vehicles on my station or through a combination of stations and cable networks to improve client efficiencies and our bottom line.

A cliché perhaps, but one I subscribe to, is that the key to success is to “work harder and be smarter”—both of which I want to do for you!

After meeting with the director of sales and the sales manager several times, this jobhunter wrote to both people to make something happen. Notice the link between this letter and the previous one.

# Letter 8-8 Make Something Happen—Broadcast Sales

I’ve attached a copy of a letter I sent to Anton Revinsky yesterday, which I want to make sure you see as well.

As I wrote to him, our meeting last week left me more convinced of the advantages that I can offer Sky Cable—and I wanted to reinforce these important benefits.

I am extremely eager to work with you, with the Sky Cable team, and in an environment where my talents can be applied to produce groundbreaking bottom-line results. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make this happen—or if you or Anton have any further questions or need additional information or references.

# Letter 8-9 Make Something Happen—Content Editor/Writer

In addition to my previously submitted resume, I thought this packet of writing samples, written for The Online Business Journal, would be useful.

Your job posting calls for a candidate who is experienced in transforming complex detail into engaging content. As my resume illustrates, I have in-depth experience in interpreting, organizing, and clearly conveying those essential elements that make a story sizzle. (In addition, I am skilled at ghostwriting, which is handy for composing speeches.) In the Journal’s “Insights” blog, I translate the technical jargon of business leaders into logical, straightforward content. Examples are attached.

Since our meeting last month, I have completed a short-term project working as editor and advocate for a foreign-born doctoral candidate. I framed his ideas into clear prose, and often clarified conceptual problems relating to his thesis.

I sincerely hope to hear from you soon.

Your make something happen letter can take unusual forms, as in this example.

# Letter 8-10 Make Something Happen—General

After her interview and after sending her follow-up e-mails, this executive knew that she was among the finalists for a job she very much wanted. To pivot the hiring decision in her direction, she sent her prospective employer this gift by messenger.

In Tiffany’s signature blue box with its white ribbon, she placed a walnut shell, which she had previously emptied of its fruit.

![](img/5591ff53ebe05f3de28d67e5b93461565f69150d856e1e4062133e684895098a.jpg)

Inside the shell, she put a small slip of paper, slightly bigger than the paper on which fortunes are printed in traditional fortune cookies. Along with her handwritten signature, the paper contained the following typewritten message:

In a nutshell, I would love to work for you. Ann Trip

She got the job!

Here is another unique take on the gutsy approach.

# Letter 8-11 Make Something Happen—Financial Services

A jobhunter who was seeking a high-level position at a leading financial services corporation knew that he was a finalist. To keep his name squarely in the decision maker’s mind, he sent an overnight express package containing a smaller box. In this box, he placed a length of adding machine tape. On the tape, he had typed the following message and signed it.

# Letter 8-12 Make Something Happen—Sales

With your hiring deadline fast approaching, perhaps I can simplify this difficult decision with a brief review of what I can accomplish for you.

New Business Development: Like the 40 new customers I’ve brought in during the last six months alone.

Growth: Like the $20 \%$ increase in sales I achieved last year.

Leadership: Like the respect my team members have for me, as demonstrated in the letters of reference I’ve provided for you, the recommendations on my LinkedIn profile, and the mentoring program I created.

I have not concealed my excitement at the prospect of working with you because it’s the same enthusiasm that I bring to my sales efforts, and to supporting my coworkers in their efforts.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to influence your decision in my favor.

# Letter 8-14 Make Something Happen—General—Phone Tag

Since you and I are in the midst of “phone tag,” I thought I would write you a quick note. It was a real pleasure meeting you several weeks ago, and discussing the exciting opportunities within Ladimor Worldwide.

You mentioned that it would make sense for me to speak with John Allen to learn more about the International Division. Given your busy schedule, I have taken the liberty of contacting him directly, and have scheduled an appointment for next week. I am looking forward to meeting him and will let you know the results of our session.

Thank you again for your time.

She makes it hard to argue with success.

Here is an excellent e-mail from a part-time worker who is anxious to transform her position into a full-time one.

# Letter 8-15 Make Something Happen—Consultant— Part-Time/Full-Time

Working with you and your exceptional team over the past 16 months has been exceedingly rewarding, and for this I thank you.

My status as a consultant notwithstanding, you and your colleagues have welcomed me as a regular, valuable member of your team. You have given me the authority to supervise coworkers, create budgets, and represent the objectives of senior management in the successful execution of projects of my own design.

I am gratified to report that my efforts have produced authentic results: 52 new clients, $\$ 3.2$ million in new sales, and a $9 \%$ reduction in overhead expenses. With the acquisition of such significant new business, the corporate culture is simultaneously rejuvenated, and the corporate image is reaffirmed.

Results such as these are precisely what I intended to achieve for you—and what I hope to continue bringing to the firm. I would welcome the opportunity to make my success a permanent contribution at the firm.

Let’s get together to discuss this promising partnership. I’ll call you shortly.

# Letter 8-16 Make Something Happen—General— Create an Opportunity

Three weeks ago, we had the opportunity to meet and discuss the possibility of providing additional office support for your agents.

Since you were just beginning to explore this prospect at that time, I realize that it may be a while before you are ready to make a decision. For this reason, I am writing to restate my interest and to recap my qualifications.

My present position was a start-up position—one that was also new to the company. In this role, I began by immediately assessing tasks that needed to be fulfilled. I then created the position and my role to meet the goals of the individual representatives, and the corporation as a whole, most effectively. This required initiative, the ability to organize people and tasks, and the confidence to work in a new environment and quickly achieve rapport with the executives and staff.

I can do the same for you.

I am excited by the challenge of creating a new position. Allow me to use my expertise to make this position a meaningful, productive part of your organization.

I am available to meet again to answer any additional questions you may have.

# Letter 8-17 Make Something Happen—Special Education

I am extremely honored to be among the finalists for the position of Assistant Special Education Chairperson in District 43. Our meetings have convinced me that it would be a genuine pleasure to work with you and the members of your staff.

To assist you with what may be a difficult selection process, let me summarize the expertise I have acquired during my 18-year career in Special Ed:

•	 Diagnostic and prescriptive evaluations   
•	 Case management   
•	 Team facilitation   
•	 Development of IEPs and individualized curricula   
•	 Mainstreaming   
•	 Staff training   
•	 Parent counseling   
•	 Child advocacy   
•	 Coordination of therapeutic ancillary services   
•	 Preparation of proposals for federal, state, and private grants

I gained this diverse experience working with developmentally disabled (including those at every level of the autism spectrum), emotionally handicapped, and multiply handicapped children from preschool age to age 21.

It would be a pleasure to bring to CSE-43 my familiarity and hands-on contributions in each of these vital areas. If there is any other information you require, please let me know. I would be happy to return for additional interviews at any time.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

# Letter 8-18 Make Something Happen—Education

Since you’ve seen my CV, you know that I have been an educator for more than 11 years.

Since we’ve met several times, you know that I still retain the drive, energy, and commitment it takes to excite students in a subject that they find dull, at best—and irrelevant, at worst.

Since we’ve discussed my good fortune in receiving the State of Connecticut’s “Outstanding Educator Award,” you know that my abilities are well recognized, for which I am grateful.

So, if there is any uncertainty at all, please be assured beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am extremely eager to bring my talents and experience to bear on behalf of the students, families, faculty, and administration of my new home in South Helena.

I thank you once again for your time and candor.

# Letter 8-19 Make Something Happen—General

You have been so generous with your time and attention during the past few weeks that I must express my gratitude.

Rarely have I enjoyed an interview process as thoroughly as I have yours. You and your staff have made me feel entirely welcome at American Home Services. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be able to fit into your organization and corporate culture at once—and begin contributing immediately to your reputation for service and your overall profitability.

“Parallel construction” adds strength to the writer’s message.

If there is anything else I can do to demonstrate how ideal the match is between your needs and my strengths, please let me know. The opportunity to work closely with you is tremendously exciting.

Thanks again for your time and consideration.

With best regards,

# Additional Jobhunting Letters

Effective networking pays off not only in your current job search, but in any searches you may undertake in the future, as well. For this reason, it’s imperative that you treat with respect anyone with whom you have had contact during the jobhunt. You never know who may provide your next lead or job offer! So it pays to take a few minutes to acknowledge your interactions with those you encounter. If you don’t, you can certainly predict who will not provide your next lead or job offer!

# The Reference Request

Always get permission to use someone as a reference. In many cases, this may be done by telephone. But when you choose to write, make your e-mail or letter straightforward and to the point. Supply the person who will be serving as your reference with information on anyone who might be contacting him or her to discuss your qualifications. If you know who will be contacting your reference, say so; provide names, titles, and companies, and state the position for which you are interviewing. If you can’t be specific, describe the types of positions for which you’ll be interviewing. Always send your resume to the person who is serving as your reference—either with your request or afterwards. You’ll find sample reference request letters later in this chapter.

# The Meeting Confirmation

On some occasions, you may wish to confirm a meeting or an interview in writing. Such letters are always short, polite, and to the point. Reconfirm all pertinent details: date, time, location, with whom you’ll be meeting, what you’ll bring, what they’ll bring, for what position you’re interviewing, and so on. By all means, reconfirm your interest in the position or the company by making your letter sound enthusiastic. Samples follow.

(Note: If you’re using your confirmation as an excuse to make a premeeting sales pitch to your interviewer or to provide additional information prior to a second meeting, you’re really writing an ad response and resume cover letter or a follow-up letter; refer to the chapters that focus on these types of letters.)

# The Job Acceptance

If you choose to write one, your acceptance letter should be short, precise, and to the point. In it, you can simply say yes to a job offer. Or you can confirm, in writing, the results of your jobhunting, interview, and negotiation efforts: the terms of your employment agreement. Remember that whatever you put in writing stays on the record, so be certain that your facts are accurate.

# The Negotiation of an Offer

Typically, negotiating a job offer is handled in person or by phone, and often by a recruiter or placement agent. If you find that you must negotiate in writing, be clear and to the point. Justify your requests with support points that are important to the reader. Above all, remember that whatever you put in writing is on the record forever. Don’t exaggerate, prefabricate, or make promises you can’t keep.

# The Offer Rejection

Whether or not you’ve turned down a job offer in person, you may wish to put it in writing as well. You may, for example, be asked to put your rejection in writing for the company’s records, or you may wish to do so for your own records. (If, however, you’re writing to maintain friendly relations so that you may be considered for future positions, this is a follow-up letter.) If the interview process was lengthy, you may wish to give a reason for your decision (“Although you had . . . , I chose to . . .”). Generally, there’s no need to say where you’ve accepted an alternative job, especially if you’ve switched industries. If the person to whom you’re writing has gone out of his or her way on your behalf, be sure to acknowledge his or her kindness.

# The Letter of Resignation

Congratulations! Your hard work paid off with a job offer that you’ve accepted. Now comes the fun part: quitting your current job!

You’ve heard the advice of the experts, “Don’t burn your bridges.” They counsel against composing a scathing, biting attack on your old boss, your mean-spirited coworkers, the associate who sabotaged you, and the negative corporate culture. And they’re right, because you never know where these people will land when they switch jobs—perhaps at the firm you’ve longed to work for all your life. Who knows? You might be asked to return and serve as their boss one day! (Isn’t revenge sweet?)

So now is the time to write a professional, positive letter of resignation. You simply state that you are relinquishing your position and when. That is all you are required to do, although few people stop at that. The following samples demonstrate several alternative methods for resigning: the happy camper, the disgruntled (but professional) employee, and the one who “plays it close to the vest.”

Choose your own style—just remember, whatever you put in writing remains on the record forever!

# Samples

This jobhunter maintained the pleasant tone of voice she used in this letter in her subsequent thank you letter (see Letter 7-7).

# Letter 9-1 Reference Request—Student

After all you’ve done for me—as professor, advisor, and friend—do I dare ask for more? Well, I must, so here goes. Would you be willing to serve as a reference for me in my job search?

As you know, I’d like to join the training program of a financial services organization in the St. Louis area. In fact, I have already interviewed with three firms, each of which has asked me to provide references. With your permission, I will have the following people contact you:

1. John Brunswick, Loan Officer St. Louis Federal Bank   
2. Muriel Howard, Vice President Credit Services Clayton Bank and Trust   
3. Leslie Rubin, President South County Credit Union

Knowing how busy your schedule is at this time of year, I will call your office next Wednesday during the late afternoon to see whether you’re able to speak with these people.

I thank you in advance for your time and help.

# Letter 9-2 Reference Request

I hope this letter finds you well and prosperous. During my tenure at Burke Enterprises, your insistence on premier product innovations was legendary. Since then, I have kept abreast of Burke’s impressive growth, so I know that your admonitions are still being heeded.

As you may recall, I left Burke when my wife’s firm sent her to California to open a West Coast division. After two years with the government, I am now in the process of continuing my career in product development, and would consider it an honor to add your name to the top of my list of references.

With your approval, I will authorize representatives of firms with which I am in the final stages of the selection process to contact you. I have enclosed an updated resume with this letter to remind you of my qualifications—and I will call you shortly to see whether you might be willing to assist me. If so, I will provide you, in advance, with the names of those who may be in touch with you.

I was grateful for your thoughtfulness and support when I was part of the Burke team, and I am equally grateful now for your help.

# Letter 9-3 Meeting Confirmation

I am looking forward to meeting you on January 12, 20XX, at 3:00 p.m. at the Pleasantville Hyatt to discuss the instructional design position in your East Coast office.

I feel certain that my training and experience will prove valuable to you, and I am eager to provide you with details on my background.

# Letter 9-4 Acceptance of Job Offer

It is with great pleasure that I accept your offer to serve as an Instructional Designer for your East Coast office. I look forward to joining HealthCom beginning on March 1, 20XX, with a starting salary of $\$ 65$ ,000 per year.

I am especially eager to work with Dawn Sinclair in your new Professional Development Unit.

Thank you for your assistance and consideration.

This letter and the one that follows differ only slightly—but on the rare occasions that job negotiations are put in writing, details like these are of key importance.

# Letter 9-5 Negotiation of Job Offer—Publishing

You’ve certainly built an exceptional editorial team over the years, and your offer to join it is enormously gratifying.

As you know, I am very eager to accept this honor. I look forward to bringing my contacts and authors to Brockridge Publishing. Because these relationships are ones that I’ve nurtured for more than 10 years, they’re naturally of great value to me—and to you. The profit potential that they represent is substantial. I feel it is reasonable and fair to adhere to my request for a $10 \%$ stake in the profits these properties generate.

Harold, in light of the many benefits of our joining forces, this detail seems minor. It is, however, of great importance to me. Let’s agree on this right away, and launch our promising partnership!

I look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 9-6 Negotiation of Job Offer—Publishing

You’ve certainly built an exceptional editorial team over the years, and your offer to join it is enormously gratifying.

As you know, I am very eager to accept this honor. I look forward to bringing my contacts and authors to Brockridge Publishing. Because these relationships are ones that I’ve nurtured for more than 10 years, they’re naturally of great value to me—and to you. The profit potential that they represent is substantial. I feel it is reasonable to request a share in the profits that these properties generate. Let’s agree on a specific percentage right away, and launch our promising partnership!

I look forward to hearing from you.

# Letter 9-7 Rejection of Job Offer

Thank you very much for offering me the position of Instructional Designer for your East Coast office. Unfortunately, I am unable to join HealthCom’s staff at this time because I have just accepted another firm’s offer.

I am very grateful to you for your assistance during the interview process, and I genuinely appreciate your consideration.

# Letter 9-8 Rejection of Job Offer

I am writing to withdraw my name from consideration for the position of Executive Administrative Assistant with your firm, as I have accepted an offer from another company.

However, I thank you sincerely for your time and candor in describing both the position and the corporate culture. You were most kind, and I appreciate the encouragement you offered me.

With best wishes for your continued success,

This letter is short, sweet, and to the point—very professional!

# Letter 9-9 Resignation Letter

With this letter, I hereby submit my resignation from Burger Products International, effective Friday, June 4, 20XX, to further my career in facilities management.

At your convenience, I will be glad to discuss the reassignment of my work to others.

I wish you good luck and continued success.

This writer reminds her boss of the productive changes she’s implemented. Nice touch!

# Letter 9-10 Resignation Letter

I am writing to inform you that I will be resigning my responsibilities as Comptroller effective March 1, 20XX.

I realize that selecting and introducing a new Comptroller may be difficult, and I will do whatever I can to make this transition a smooth one. In large part, the streamlined accounting and recordkeeping practices I developed during the last four years will help a new Comptroller master our systems, database, and payroll quickly.

I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Technix. I wish you continued success and growth.

The cleverly worded opening paragraph may leave the reader wondering what this writer’s opinion of the company really is—but its clever wording won’t endanger the writer’s reputation or future.

# Letter 9-11 Resignation Letter

Effective November 30, I am resigning from my job as Media Director at Mercury Advertising. My decision to leave is both personal and professional, and does not reflect a change in my opinion of the company.

Donna Frey has performed admirably as my assistant, and is well equipped to assume my responsibilities at once. If you prefer to look outside the company to replace me, I will be happy to assist in the search between now and the end of the month.

Thank you for your continued confidence in me throughout the past two years.

# Killer Resources

If you’ve made it this far, the hard part is done. You’ve identified your strengths, determined what benefits they offer your next employer, and fashioned them into sentences and paragraphs that you can use in your jobhunting letters, e-mails, and notes. You’ve written attention-grabbing openings and action-oriented closings. You’re ready to send your own killer cover letters. Before you hit Send, though, take a few minutes to be certain that you’ve thought of everything.

The following pages will help ensure that your letters are really as strong as they possibly can be.

First, scan the list of words and phrases to avoid. If your letter is replete with jargon, your message may not get through as clearly as it should.

Then, run down the Cover Letter Checklist to help ensure that you’ve included everything correctly and that you are, indeed, ready to send your Killer Cover Letters on their way.

The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.

—Thomas Jefferson

# The Online Jobhunter’s Checklist

Now you’re ready to begin the process that will ultimately lead to your landing the job you want! To help speed your search, this checklist will remind you of all the information and tips included in this book. Here is your step-by-step guide through the process of executing all the elements of an effective job search. Good luck!

■ Commit! Decide to spend a set amount of time each day focusing on your search. For some people, that may be two to three hours each day; for others, it could be two hours twice a day. If it helps, identify specific hours, such as 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. each weekday. Although it may not seem like much time, if you are disciplined about using it wisely and consistently, it can add up to a concerted effort and a significant investment on your part—precisely what is required to speed your search to an effective conclusion.

How will you spend your time? Refining your resume and cover letters. Networking online, on the phone, and in person at conferences, events, gatherings, and meetings. Expanding your knowledge and skills through coursework, professional development, and volunteer work. Remember to stay active. Sitting at the computer all day is not healthy either physically or emotionally, and it can be frustrating.

■ Explore! If you are new to the job search, investigate some of the many websites that offer advice—you can use this link to find more websites in the downloadable content that accompanies this book: http:// www.mhprofessional.com/mediacenter. You’re bound to discover promising new ideas and approaches, step-by-step instructions, guidance, and helpful hints—as well as pitfalls to avoid—that will help you conduct an effective search. As you navigate from site to site, it’s likely that you’ll be redirected quite a bit, making it tough to keep track of valuable sites to which you’d like to return. So try right-clicking on a link, which gives you the option of opening it in a new tab, keeping each site open for easy return. You can also bookmark or save as “Favorites” the sites that you find especially useful and want to revisit from time to time.

■ Search! Decide what type of positions you want to apply for, then make a note of the various job titles associated with the positions that interest you. This list will help you search for openings that appeal to you. If you find that you’re not getting the results you wish, experiment with different words or combinations. For example, you might begin with “Customer Service,” only to encounter an unmanageable number of openings. In that case, you can narrow your search by trying “Retail Customer Service,” “Online Customer Support,” “Bank Customer Service,” or even “Seattle Bank Customer Service.”

■ Prepare! Have your resumes and cover letters ready to upload for online applications. After writing, proofing, and spell-checking them, then proofing them again, be sure you have named each file accurately and appropriately. Not only will you want easy access to it, but the document titles should be useful to your readers, as well. A nurse might have one version of a resume for applying to hospitals titled “CDiaz Hospital R.N. Resume” and another tailored for schools, which might be named “CDiaz School Nurse Resume.” The same would hold true for the accompanying cover letters.

Reach out to References! Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare your professional references. They will surely be requested by a recruiter, hiring manager, or interviewer or as part of the online application process. Identify several people for whom or with whom you’ve worked; obviously you’ll want to choose those you can count on to speak well of you. Employers typically ask for three references, but you should identify more in case anyone declines or is unavailable at the moment his or her support is needed.

Then, write to each of these people, explaining what type of position you’re seeking and what your timing is; include a copy of your resume. (You’ll find sample letters in Chapter 9.) This will remind them of your accomplishments, reassure them that you are worth recommending, and facilitate access to it when they are contacted. Once you have heard back that they are willing to serve as references, an immediate thank you note is in order. Then, you should be in touch again when a connection is imminent; your references will appreciate knowing who will be calling or writing and what company or organization that individual represents. For the person who kindly agreed to serve as your reference, an unexpected call is not the ideal way to launch a discussion extolling your professionalism!

■ Sign Up! To take advantage of jobhunting, networking, and social websites that may provide assistance, you’ll need to register and/or open an account on those sites you determine to be of value. To register, you’ll need a professional e-mail address and a password, so be prepared. If you don’t already have one, secure an e-mail address with your name in some form and a password that includes an uppercase letter, a symbol, and a number in case the site requires it. Of course, you will need to make a note of these somewhere so you don’t forget them.

■ Go Social! Your online footprint is one source of information that recruiters and hiring managers will use to form an impression of you, so if you don’t have an online profile, create one. If you do, check that it’s current and professional. You should check regularly, and update if warranted, the sites on which recruiters can find you to be sure you’re pre senting an appropriate image. You can add to your profile any volunteer activities in which you’ve been engaged. Also remember to check and correct privacy settings on social media and networking sites, as they do change, often with little notice. (See “Manage Your Online Profile” in Chapter 1.)

■ Organize! To track applications, responses, interviews, conversations, contact info, connections, follow-up, correspondence, references, and more, you’ll need to be organized. So create, adopt, or sign up for a system that matches your personality and style. You can create an Excel spreadsheet on your computer or a binder for your bookshelf that you fill with printouts. Or, you can use an online search management tool like JibberJobber. Choose what works for you, and use it regularly. Don’t let a surprise call from a potential employer catch you unprepared!

■ Network! Now you’re ready to start alerting friends, family, and colleagues that you are in the market for a job. Since networking is essential to identifying openings and reaching key decision makers, you simply can’t afford to avoid this important step in your search. It is the number one most effective way to find the position you desire. Most jobhunters maintain an active presence on LinkedIn as well as on sites that target their specific industries or talents. Some employers even offer financial incentives for referred candidates who are hired, so you and your connections can both benefit. The amount and value of the information and contacts you’ll gain through networking are impossible to quantify, so get connected and stay connected. The more you network, the more quickly you’ll land the interviews that will lead to your next job. (Review the information on networking in Chapter 1 and all of Chapter 4.)

■ Apply! Now that you’ve created a solid foundation for your search, you’re ready to start applying for jobs. Start looking for appropriate positions on one or more of the major job boards like Monster, TheLadders, or CareerBuilder. (Use this link to find more websites in the downloadable content that accompanies this book: http://www.mhprofessional .com/mediacenter.) You might also look on aggregate boards such as Indeed.com as well as relevant niche sites such as bankjobs.com, idealist .org, or diversity.jobs.careercast.com. Try to resist the temptation to apply (because it’s so easy) for those jobs for which you truly are not qualified; after all, would you want your ideal qualifications overlooked because a hiring manager was inundated with too many applications to handle?

■ Target! If you know an industry or a company where you would like to work, then add that to your search and monitor that specific website for job opportunities. Find someone who works there (through your networking) who can act as a gatekeeper for you.

■ Follow Up! A jobhunter who plays on Facebook all day and uploads resumes for dozens of jobs is not likely to get very far, very fast. An effective search is about staying in touch with contacts, references, recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, decision makers, potential employers, and anyone else who is in a position to help you. The suggestions and sample letters and e-mails in this book make it incredibly easy to send thank you and follow-up notes, make something happen letters, and more. So there’s no excuse not to stay connected. (You’ll find plenty of samples in Chapters 6, 7, and 8.) The more you write, the more you’ll stay on people’s “radar” and the faster your search will end successfully.

■ Repeat! Going through most of these steps again and again will ensure that you are conducting a thorough search. Because you will, either soon or eventually . . . .

Celebrate! You’ve worked hard and landed the job you want, so now you’ve earned a celebration. Congratulations!

# Index of Letters That Address Specific Issues

Many of the letters in this book and in the downloadable content address specific issues that are of concern in today’s jobhunting environment. To help you locate ways in which you might handle such situations, many of the letters throughout the book are labeled according to the issue they address. Such letters are also listed below for quick reference. (Letter 3-3, for example, refers to Chapter 3, Letter 3.)

For example, if you are returning to work after an absence, check the letters listed under “Workforce Return.” If you are switching fields, refer to the letters listed under “Career Change.” Graduating seniors and recent MBAs, be sure to review those listed under “Entry Level” and “Student” for ideas to adapt and use in your own letters.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Chapter and Letter Number</td></tr><tr><td>Career Change</td><td>4-4, 4-7, 4-8, 4-12, 5-20, 5-24, 5-27, 5-37, 5-44, 5-59, 5-71, 5-88, 5-89, 5-109</td></tr><tr><td>Confidentiality</td><td>5-49, 5-52, 5-58, 5-82, 5-101, 5-114</td></tr><tr><td>Entry Level</td><td>5-9, 5-12, 5-13, 5-14, 5-15, 5-16, 5-17, 5-20, 5-21, 7-6, 7-7, 9-1</td></tr><tr><td>International</td><td>5-10, 5-61, 7-1</td></tr><tr><td>Jobhopper</td><td>5-11, 5-46</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Index of Letters by Industry and Job Title

All the letters and e-mails in this book and in the downloadable content are listed below by industry. (Letter 4-30, for example, refers to Chapter 4, Letter 30.) Jobs that fall under more than one category are listed under each grouping that may apply. For example, an Insurance Sales cover letter is listed under both “Financial Services” and “Sales.”

Most important, don’t limit yourself by reading only letters dealing with a specific job. Take the time to skim many of the letters in this book. Since your letters should not repeat what’s on your resume, cover letters written by jobhunters in fields unrelated to yours can contain ideas that you can easily adapt for use in your own letters.
