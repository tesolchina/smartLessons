Cohesion   
Rhetorical section Research article   
Applied linguistics

There is a dearth of research on cohesion in academic writing, specifically in research articles (RAs). In addition, there is little quantitative information on how cohesion is realized in different rhetorical sections of RAs. Thus, the present study investigated cohesion at sentence, paragraph, and the whole textual levels across the rhetorical sections of RAs of applied linguistics. To this end, 25 indices of local, global, and text cohesion were obtained from a corpus of 100 RAs in the field of applied linguistics divided into seven sections (abstract, introduction, literature review, method, results, discussion, and conclusion). The results of mixed-effects modeling showed that the measures of local and text cohesion were significantly affected by the rhetorical section. Moreover, random forest modeling revealed that the indices of global cohesion could predict the introduction, method, and results sections, while text cohesion was a classifier for abstract and conclusion sections. The findings are thoroughly discussed, offering insights into their theoretical and pedagogical implications.

# 1. Introduction

Cohesion is an important aspect of academic writing, extensively studied in L2 writing (Abdi & Johnson, 2023; Barabadi et al. 2021; Golparvar & bolhasani, 2022; Crossey et al., 2016a). However, there i far les cholarly attention to this linguistic feature in academic genres. The cohesion features examined i previous scholarship in this rea have been mostly limited to linking adverbials (e. g, Appel & Szeib, 2018; Gao, 2016; Lei, 2012; Liu, 208), demonstrative (e.g., Gray, 2010; Gray & Cortes, 2011; Lee t al., 2021), and metadiscourse nouns (e.g, Jiang & Hyland, 2017; Jiang & Wang, 2018) as well as in related linguistic phenomena such as reformu. lation (e.g, Barabadi et al., 2021; Murilo, 2012). On the other hand, this line of research has explored cohesion in different genres, including student esays (e.g., Abdi & Johnson, 2023; Barabadi e l., 2021; Leet al., 2021), doctoral disertations (Lei, 2012), RAs (Gao, 2016; Gray & Cortes, 2011), and specific sections of RAs (Jiang & Hyland, 2017).

Two important gaps can be observed in past research on cohesion in academic writing. First, these studies have mostly investigated a limited number of cohesive features, such as linking adverbials or demonstratives. Secondly, there is a noticeable lack of research on cohesion in each section of RAs. In other words, how cohesion is realized in the introduction or discussion section of RAs is yet to be explored. Therefore, the present corpus-based research examined cohesion in the rhetorical sections of RAs in applied linguistics. In order to adopt a comprehensive approach to cohesion, indices of local, global, and text cohesion capturing cohesion at the sentence, paragraph, and text levels respectively (Crossey et al., 2016b) were analyzed. Another methodological strength of this study is that two statistical tchniques were used to dig deeper into cohesion in applied linguistics RAs. First, mixed-effects modeling was used to investigate the impact of the rhetorical section on the cohesion indices. Second, the random forest classfier was run to examine the extent to which these cohesion layers and measures can be attributed to a specific section of the RA.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Cohesion

Halliday and Hassan (1976) introduced the concept of cohesion, which has become a crucial component of text analysis. According to their thery, atext has texture, which give it unity withi its context and distinguishes it from a collectio of unrlated sentenes. Texture is made up of two elements: structural and non-structural relations. Structural relations include information structure and thematic patterns, while non-structural relations refer to semantic relations, or cohesion, within a text. Cohesion can be categorized into diffrent types, including reference, conjunction, substitution, ellipsis, and lexical cohesion. While cohesion is not the sole requirement for creating a text, it i stil considered an essential element, serving a textual function that organizes information and binds the text together as a whole, which is one of the three metafunctions of language (Halliday, 1994; Halliday & Hasan, 1985).

According to Halliday and Hassan (1976), cohesion pertains to the explicit signals present or lacking within the text that help the reader establish connections between ideas. These signals may take the form of overlapping words and concepts between sentences, indicating that the same or similar ideas are being referenced. Additionally, explicit connectives such as "because", therefore, and "consequently" serve as cues that signify relations between ideas and their nature. On the other hand, coherence refers to the reader's comprehension of the text - that is, how coherent the text is perceived to be by the reader (McNamara et al., 1996; O'reilly & Mcnamara, 2007). A tex is considered coherent when it meets the reader's expectations and stays on topic. It should be noticed that the degree of coherence in a text depends on various factors, such as explicit cohesion cues, implicit cohesion cues (which are more strongly related to text coherence than explicit cues), and non-linguistic factors like the reader's prior knowledge and reading ability (McNamara et al., 2010; O'reilly & Mcnamara, 2007).

This research is grounded upon a more comprehensive conceptualization of cohesion, introducing local cohesion, global cohesion, and text coesion proposed by Crossly and colleaues (Crossley et al., 2016; ossley t al., 2016 ossey t al., 2019. Cohesion cues are usually focused on local aspects of a text, although they can also pertain to global or text cohesion. Local cohesion cues include overlapping words and concepts between sentences and explicit connectives such as "because", "therefore", and "consequently (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). On the other hand, global cohesion cues rfer to the semantic and lexical overlap between paragraphs in a text (Foltz, 2007), where words or ideas from one paragraph are repeated in subsequent paragraphs. Text cohesion can also be measured across an entire text through givenness, which i based on the number of new or given words (such as initial noun referents) throughout the text. While gloal and text cohesion cues tend to be more implicit, local cues are more explicit Crossey et a., 2016b)

Previous research on cohesion has established that cohesive features vary across text types and can be utilized to diferentiate between various text types. This means that ifferent text types may use cohesive device (Halliday & Hassan, 1976; McNamara et al. 2010; Tywoniw & Crossley, 2019). Crossley et al. (2012) demonstrated that authentic texts exhibit a greater presence of logical connectives, whereas simplified texts possess a higher abundance of cohesion features overall, specificall in the form of local lexical overlap and frequent use of common connectives. imilarly, Duran et al. (2010) showed that in comparison to truthful text, deceptive texts were found to exhibit elevated levels of cohesion in terms of semantic overlap between sentences and the amount of provided information. Last but not least, Graesser et al. (2007) observed that monologic texts (e.g., textbooks) had a higher occurrence of referential cohesion compared to dialogic texts (e.g, tutorial dialogue). Abdi and Johnson (2023) demonstrated that pronominal reference across paragraphs and lexical repetition significantly contributed to the qualit of argumentative essays, while narrative essays relied primarily on determiners and connectives to signal cohesion.

# 2.2. Cohesion in academic writing

A good number of studies have examined demonstratives in academic writing. According to Biber et al. (1999), both unattended and attended instances of \*this/these" have been identified as prevalent in academic writing. Similarly, Swales (2005) demonstrated that \*this" ranks as the 15th most frequently used word. Gray (2010) investigated the use of demonstrative pronouns and determiners as cohesive devices in RAs of education and sociology. It was revealed that when the words this" or "these" are used as pronouns, they are primarly referring to complete clauses as anteeent, rather than ler spans of discourse that cros sentence boundaries. f thee words are fllowed by a noun, they are most commonly paired with shell nouns or astract nouns. Specificlly, shell nouns tend to refer to antecedents that ae complete clauses or that span multiple sentences, which distinguishes them from other types of astract nouns suggesting the role of these structure i establishing cohesion in a text by limiting the scope ofattention and indicating the linguistic context that serves as the antecedent to the demonstrative structure. This function holds even when the structure refers to complex information in the preceding discourse. Moreover, these nouns provide a chance for writers to reformulate their information and present the reader with a broader perspective (Swales, 2005). In a follow-up study, Gray and Cortes (2011) explored the use of (un) attended \*this/these' in enginering and applied linguistics RAs in initial, medial, and final sentence positions. Both studies reported a higher proportion of attended \*this/these" and that and that \*this/these" plus shel nouns play a salient role in constructig cohesive relations and recontextualizing previous textual information. Recently, Lee et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of (un) attended \*this/these" in university students high- and low-rated argumentative esays. The findings showed that these two groups of writers employed pronominal anaphoric demonstrtives diffrently to construct arguments in their academic writing. Specificaly, it was found that both groups exhibited a tendency to utilize ths/these more frequently; however, the essays of low-rated students contained a considerably higher number of unattended "this/these".

Another cohesive device extensively studied in academic genres is linking adverbials, which is another term used for connectives (Liu, 2008). Comparing the use of linking adverbials between doctoral dssertations in applied linguistics written by Chinese students and RAs authored by professional writers, Lei)2012) showed that Chinese doctoral students used linking adverbials more often than professional writr. The study also identified 3 linking adverbials that were overused by the doctoral students, including "besides" and actually". Aditionally, 25 adverbials were found to be underused by the doctoral students, with adverative adverbials being he most problematic. In adition, it was revealed that doctoral students rlied on a smaller range of linking adverbials in their academic writing compared to professional writers. In a cross-disciplinary study, Gao (2016) examined the frequency and usage of linking adverbials in RAs authored by English and Chinese native speakers. The results showed that all four types of linking adverbials, ., additive, adversative, causal/resultative, and sequential, were more frequent in soft non-science disciplines (linguistics and man agement). However, it was found that the variation among the four examined disciplines was relatively smaller compared to the variation observed between the two groups of writers. This implies that the use of linking adverbials in English academic writing is influenced more by writers' cultural or linguistic backgrounds rather the writing conventions of diffrent disciplines. The use of connectives has also been explored in students' essays. Appel and Szeib (2018) examined linking adverbials in a corpus of argu. mentativesays written in an EAP course. It was found that 1 Arabic writer tend to use dditive linking aderbials excessiely, while L1 Chinese writers tend to overuse contrastive linking adverbials, and L1 French writers tend to overuse appositional linking ad. verbials, implying the challenges that L2 learners encounter in accurately and effctively utilizing linking adverbials in their English academic writing. In a recent study, Golparvar and Abolhasani (2022) found that temporal and contrastive connectives could significantly contribute to content, organization, and language use score of graph writing ability, one dimension of the construct of academic writing that i gaining increasing scholarlyattention. However, it has been assrted that the conribution of coheive features to graph writing is contingent on the type of information encoded in this type of academic writing task.

Past research on cohesion in academic writing has also paid attention to metadiscursive nouns. Jiang and Hyland (2017) examined the interactional (stance-taking) and interactive (cohesive functions of metadiscursive nouns (e.g., belief, act", and \*analysis) in the moves of abstracts in four disciplinary domains. Metadiscursive nouns, which are commonly used to preview or review textual content, establish connections between current information and other relevant sources, both within and outside the text (Jiang & Hyland, 2017). This practice assts writers in constructing more cohesive discourse and enables readers to enhance their under. standing of the text. They demonstrated that anaphoric uses of these nouns significantly outnumber their cataphoric uses in RA abstracts, which is relatively surprising in a sub-genre coming at the beinning of the RA to endorse it. It was also found that the highest frequency of cataphoric cases, mostly represented by noun $^ +$ be $^ +$ complement clause, were in the purpose move of the abstract. This structural pattrn aids in emphasizing the objective of the study, where the metadiscursive noun foregrounds the content in the complement, emphasizing the aim and significance of the reearch whil also creating a cohesive discourse. In a similar vein, Jiang and Wang (2018) found a lower proportion of unattended structure in RAs the antecedents of unattended and attended \*this" were mostly clausal and extended discourse.

# 2.3. The current study

Past scholarship on cohesion in academic writing exhibits two notable gaps. Firstly, these studies have primarily focused on a limited set of cohesive features, such as linking adverbials or demonstratives, thereby neglecting a broader exploration of cohesive elements. Secondly, there is a distinct lack of research examining cohesion within individual sections of RAs, leaving a significant knowledge gap concerning how cohesion manifests in specific sections of the RA. Consequently, this corpus-based research undertakes a comprehensive examination of cohesion in the rhetorical sections of RAs. To achieve a thorough analysis, this study explores indices of local, global, and text cohesion, encompassing cohesion at the sentence, paragraph, and overal text evels (Crossley et l., 016). Apart from the paucity of research on cohesion in RAs, this three-layer cohesion framework is under-researched in academic genres. The decision to focus our research exclusively on cohesion in applied linguistics academic writing was driven by two main reasons. Firstly, the reearchers familiarity with ths feld of study enabled us to engage deeply with the nuances f the subject matter and its existing literature. Moreover, cohesion is integral toeffective communication, language teaching, translation, and discourse analysis, which are important theoretical and practical domains in this discipline. In addition, the primary goal of this study i to gain detailed information on local, global, and text cohesion in each section of the RA rather than cross-disciplinary iferences. It should be noted that by exclusively focusing on applied linguistics RAs, our study gains a distinct advantage in providing a focused and detailed analysis of cohesion within a specific academic discipline. While broader or cross-disciplinary studies might provide a wider range of data, they often fail to delve deely into the intricacies and nuances of cohesion within a particular disciplinary domain, which possesses its own unique patterns and features of cohesion that may not be adequatel captured in studies with a broader scope. By centering our research exclusively on applied lingustics academic writing, we ensure a thorough exploration of cohesion within this specific context, offering valuable insights and contributing to a deeper understanding of cohesion within this field. Therefore, this work attempts to answer the following research questions.

1. To what extent do the rhetorical sections impact local, global, and text cohesion in RAs?   
2. What cohesion indices and types (local, global, and text cohesion) characterize each section of the RA?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Corpus

The corpus used for this research was 100 RAs, totaling 755,461 words. Allthe RAs were in the field of applied linguistics published from 2010 to 2020 and were chosen from top-tier journals in this major according to the Linguistics category of the Jounal Citatin Reports released in 2021. The RAs selected for ths study were from Appied Linguisic, Journal of Second Language Writing, Language Learning, Modern Language Jounal, and Language Teaching Research. Twenty RAs were selected at random from each journal. Following earlier work considering independent and distinct communicative purposes for the conclusion section (Liu & Xiao, 2022; Yang & Allison, 2003), only RAs with separate introduction, method, results/findings, discussion, and conclusion sections were considered for this corpus although alternative, but similar, headings, for the final section (e.g., Implications and Conclusion and Concluding remarks) were alsotaken into account. Moreover, the focus was specifically on RAs that employed an empirical methodology, whil the meta-analyses, reviews, and theoretical publications were excluded from the analysis. The manuscripts were saved as plain text files in UTF-8 format, and they underwent a cleaning process where journal tags parenthetical citation component, and page numbers were removed. Since this study was aimed at investigating cohesion in each sub-section of RAs, the corpus was divided into seven sections, representing the abstract, inroduction, litrature review, method, results, discussion, and conclusion. Table 1 summarizes the make-up of the corpus.

# 3.2. Cohesion measures

The Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion (TAAc0) (Crossley et al., 2016b) was used to examine cohesion in students essays. TAAcO provides thre types of cohesion indices, namely local cohesion, global cohesion, and text cohesion. TAAco would be preferred over Coh-Metrix (McNamara et al., 2014) because it offers a wider variety of global cohesion indices as wellas synonym overlap and part of speech (P0S) taged cohesion indices (Crossley et al., 2016b). Since some of the cohesion measures reported by TAACO are redundant (Crossley et al., 2016a), only indices that capture unique features of cohesion would be examined. Table 2 introduces the cohesion indices used in this research.

Local cohesion is cohesion at the level of sentences. The first group of local cohesion measures examined in this project are connectives based on their rhetorical us. Since connectives are used toconnect phrases, clauses, and sentences, they are considered as local measures of cohesion. The incidence of additive, causal, logical, and temporal connecties as well as all ositive and negative connectives are among the indices examined in this category. The second group of indices that capture local cohesion is related to lexical overlap between sentences, which is overlap between two adjacent sentences and between three adjacent sentences for all words (e.g., writes and wrote). These two measures are sentence-normed. Synonym overlap is the third type of local cohesion investigated in this corpus-based research, which is realized in synonym overlap in nouns and verbs (Crossey et al., 2016b).

Global cohesion cues indicate the existence of semantic and lexical similarity between paragraphs, as observed by Foltz (2007), which involves the recurrence of words or concepts from one paragraph to the subsequent ones, establishing a coherent link between them. Lexical overlap and synonym overlap between paragraphs would be checked to examine global cohesion in this project. Adjacent paragraph overlap for all lemmas, content lemmas, and function lemmas reflect lexical overlap between paragraphs. Moreover, synonym overlap in nouns and verbs capture synonym overlap between adjacent paragraphs. Similar to local cohesion, these two indices are paragraph-normed (Crossley et al., 2016b).

Text cohesion captures cohesion at the text level irrespective of sentence or paragraph distinctions. The indices of text cohesion calculate average scores across the text. Two types of text cohesion measures would be examined in ths research. The first aspect of text cohesion is givenness, which refers to the contextual information that i given or assumed to be known by the audience I is assumed that pronouns and demonstratives tend to be more frequent in a text with more given information (McNamara et al., 2014). TAACO calculates the ratio of nouns to pronouns and the frequency of demonstratives to measure givenness in a text. The second aspect of text cohesion is lexical diversity, which refers to the ratio of unique words in text (Malven et al., 2004). higher number of repeated words in a text, which is equivalent to lower lexical diversity, makes it more cohesive. TAAco offers some type-token ratio (TTR) indices such as TTR for all words, TTR for content words, and TTR for function words. This computational package also calculates repeated content lemmas to capture text cohesion (Crossley et al., 2016b).

# 3.3. Data analysis

Two statistical techniques were employed in this research. Firstly, linear mixed-effects modeling was utilized to examine the influence of rhetorica sections on cohesion indices, addressing research question 1. Secondly, random forest modeling was conducted to assess the predictive contribution of cohesion indices to each subsection of the RA, answering research question 2.

Linear fixed-ffects modeling would be used to investigate the impact of article part-genre on measures of cohesion. As opposed to general linear models, mixed-efects models deal with by-subject variabilit (Brown, 2021), so they can account for multiple data points for each writer and for each essy they write. In the present project, rhetorical section would be the fixed efect and by-subject variability would be the random effect. The random-efect model would adres the variability among the data points scified to each writer for each esay. It should be clarified that the models examined in this research solely included by-subject random intercepts. This statistical modeling would be run by R (R Core Team, 2020), with the help of Ime4 package (version 1.1-21) (Bates et al, 2015) The Satterthwaite method (Saterthwaite, 1941) implemented in the ImerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2017), was utilized for estimating the p-values. Additionall, thefect sizes of the fixed and random effcts were obtained using the Mun package (Barton, 2020), which provided marginal $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m } )$ and conditional $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \left( \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c } \right)$ values. Specifically, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m }$ represented the portion of variance explained by the fixed effects alone, while $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c }$ indicated the variance explained by both the fixed and random effects combined. After checking the distribution of the indices, eighteen mesures were included in the final analysis. Therfore, to counteralance the impact of multiple testing, an adjusted p-value with Bonferroni correction was calculated, yielding a threshold of 0.002 (0.05/18).

Mixed effects models rely on various distributional assumptions and require the data to meet specific requirements for parameter estimation. In contrast, random forests, which are non-parametric, are a more flexible tol that can include all potential predictor variables in the analysis simultaneously. This is possible even if the variables have severe interactions, highly unequal cell counts. empty cell, or are colinear. The linear modeling framework would be unable to hande these scenarios, resulting in computational problems and various eror messages. Random forest is a non-parametric method that does not assume any specific probability dis tribution for the data. Intead, it builds multiple decision trees on random subset of the data and combines them to make predictions. In other words, it does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. To llustrat the importance of each predictor, the variable importance plot would be consulted in this research. This visualization is ased on IncNodePurity (INP) which is a measure of variable importance in the context of random forest model. It measures the reduction in impurity or entropy of a node in the tree structure when a predictor variable is used to split the data. The higher the INP score of a predictor variable, the more important it is considered in predicting the response variable (Breiman, 2001).

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Mixed-effects modeling

To examine the impact of rhetorical section of RAs on cohesion, a series of mixed-effects models were fitted for each of the three types of cohesion. As Table 3 and Table 4 demonstrat, there were significant differences among RA sections with respect to the local cohesion measures. The largest proportion of variance explained by rhetorical section was in positive connectives $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m } =$ 0.12, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c } = 0 . 4 0 2 )$ . Significant variation was also found for most indices of local cohesion, such as logical connectives $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m }$ $= 0 . 0 8 7$ 3 $\operatorname { R } ^ { 2 } \mathbf { c } = 0 . 3 0 5 )$ and adjacent sentence overlap for verb synonyms $( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ 3 $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m } = 0 . 0 5 3$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c } = 0 . 2 5 2 )$ . This indicates that certain segments of RAs in applied linguistics vary significantly in their use of cohesion.

Unlike measures of local cohesion, there was no significant relationship between rhetorical section and any of the indice f global   
cohesion. Only the p-value for synonym overlap for nouns in adjacent paragraphs ${ \bf ( p = 0 . 0 0 3 }$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m } = 0 . 0 1 2$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c } = 0 . 1 2 4 )$ was close to   
the significance threshold; however, rhetorical section explained only one percent of the variance in this index, which is negligible. Table 5 renorts mean values for the measures of olohal cohesion acrnss the rhetorical sections.

There was a significant impact f rhetorical section found acrossall five measures of text cohesion. However, as shown in Table 8, for ll of thee indices, les than one percet of the variance was explained by the independent variable itelf For example, although only about $0 . 9 \%$ of the variability in the use of demonstratives can be accounted for by the rhetorical sections of RAs, about $8 2 \%$ of the variability in the use of demonstratives can be accounted for by the model $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m } = 0 . 0 0 9$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c } = 0 . 8 2 $

Table 7 offers mean values for the indices of text cohesion for each of the rhetorical sections.

For each type of cohesion (local, global, text), the mixed-effect models' $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { c }$ values were much greater than the $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { m }$ values, suggesting that the majorit of the variability in each model was explained by the random effct (participants). In other words, a larger proportion of the variability in each index was explained by individual variability among the writers than rhetorical section. It should be noticed that this individual variability was much greater in text cohesion indices (Table 8) and dramatically lower in global cohesion measures (Table 6). Fig. 1 illustrates this variability in random intercept plots for all connectives (local cohesion) and demonstratives (text cohesion).

# 4.2. Random forest modeling

In order to determine which rhetorical sections are characterized by local, global, and text cohesion, the predictive role of these cohesion measures in the classfication of rhetorical sections was investigated. This aproach involes determining the most important predictors of each section of the RA, using the variable importance features in the random forest algorithm. Since random forest modeling does not asume a normal distribution for the data, allthe indices were included in the analysis. Figs. 2-5 illustrat variable importance plots for the sections of the RA, indicating the relative importance of each of the cohesion indices in the dataset. In this study, 500 trees were generated using a bootstrapping method, which involved creating 500 unique random subsamples from the original dataset. The predictive ability of the model for the rhetorical section was high, as evidenced by its good performance The index of concordance C (measured by the area under the ROC curve) was 0.93, indicating relatively high accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative cases. The overall eror rate of the model was 0.29, which is considered acceptable.

The results of random forest modeling revealed some distinct cohesion features in each section of the RA. Fig. 2 shows the most important cohesion measures in the astract section. Logical connectives, demonstratives, and repeated content lemmas were the most powerful predictors of cohesion in this section. It should be reminded that global measures of cohesion were not included in this analysis because the abstract is almost always one single paragraph. Excerpt 1 illstrates the use of two logical connectives ("and) both indicating conjunction. Excerpt 2 shows the use of "these" in the closing sentences of an abstract. "Gains" and "findings" accompanied by these two demonstratives create overall textual links with previous discourse.

(1) The results suggest that strength of accent and familiarity do afect listening comprehension, and these factorsaffct comprehension even with quite light accents. (Abstract - 14)

Our analysis also revealed distinct associations between specific cohesion indices and the introduction and the literature review sections of RAs. As depicted in Fig. 3, the introduction section was most strongly associated with three cohesion measure: adjacent paragraph overlap for nouns all onnectives, and causal connectives. These cohesion measures were the most prominent features for predicting the introduction section. The most important cohesion features associated with the literature review were causal connectives, adjacent sentence overlap for verb synonyms, and logical connectives. xcerpt 3 demonstrates the adjacent sentence overlap verb synonyms ("'demonstrate" - "observe" and "develop" - "enhance'), creating lexical cohesion at the local level.

(2015) observed that the morphosyntactic awarenessof bilingual (Spanish-English and Chinese-English) learners aged 9-10 years was enhanced to the greatest extent by explicit focus on morphosyntactic knowledge.

The results and method sections of RAs were strongly impacted by the use of global and then local cohesion. Based on Fig. 4, adjacent two-paragraph overlap for content lemmas, i.e., the unique base words that cary meaning and used at least once in the next two paragraphs was the most salient clasifir of the method section. Positive connectives and al connectives were the second and third most important predictors of this section. On the other hand, the results section was firstly predicted by adjacent paragraph overlap for function lemmas, i.e, the number f function lemma types that ocr at least once in the next paragraph. This section also featured sigicant les f ajac sentenceoverlap for allemas, th is the number of lmma typs tha occur at east ocein the next sentence, as well s adjacent sentence overlap for noun synonyms, i.e, the number of noun lemma tyes that occur at least once in the next sentence.

Random forest modeling demonstrated that the discussion and conclusion sections were mostly associated with local cohesion. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the most powerful predictor of the discussion section was the number of al negative connective. Adjacent sentence overlap for all lemmas and the number of additive connectives were the other salient classfier of the discussion section. Finally, aditive connectives were the most salient predictor of the conclusion section, followed by adjacent sentence overlap for verb synonyms and function word TTR, which is the number of unique function word lemmas (types) divided by the number of totl function word lemmas (tokens). Excerpt 5 shows anegative connective signaling a contrast between the findings of ths study and those of past research. On the other hand, excerpt 6 ilustrates how noun synonyms in adjacent sentences create lexical cohesion at the sentence level.

For a more comprehensive picture of cohesion in the rhetorical sections of RAs in applied linguistics, the cohesion types (local, global and text cohesion) reflected by the firs, second and third most powerful predictor of each section are described in Table 9. Local cohesion was the most important cohesion type in applied inguistics RAs, global cohesion was only associated with method and results sections, and text cohesion was an important feature only in the abstract and conclusion.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. The impact of rhetorical section

The present study has investigated cohesion at sentence, paragraph, and the whole text levels across the rhetorical sections of applied linuistc RAs. The reuts of mixed-effets modeling reeled thatthe hetrical sction of Rs exerted a signficant mpacton local cohesion measures. It is widely recognized that different sections of RAs serve distinct rhetorical purposes. Each section requires different rhtoril strat and lingistic chce to fulfll is inndd urose efftively (wles, 1990. Lgill, his rhetorical variation can lead to difference inthe application of cohesive devices and consequentl influence the local measures of cohesion. For example, the primary goal of the introduction is to provide background information, establish the research gap, and present the research purpose and objectives. To achieve this, the introduction may employ connectives such as "however, nevertheless, or "despite" to contras or present counterpoints. Synonym overlap between sentences may also be utilized in this part-genre to reinforce key concepts or ideas, providing a smooth flow of information and maintaining cohesion. On the other hand, the method section focuses on describing the research design, data collction, and analytical procedures. Although cohesive devices such as listing (e., "first, "second", "finally") and cause-effct connectives (e.g., "because", "therefore") are employed to organize the procedural information coherently, guiding readers through the step-by-step description of the methodology typically focuses on providing a detailed description of the research design, data collction procedure, and analysis techniques. While some connectives may sill be used to ensure coherence and clarity within this section, their frequency and prominence may be relatively lower compared to other sections like the introduction or discussion. To put it diffrently, the emphasis in the method section i on providing accurate and detailed information rather than establishing complex relationships between ideas. It should be noticed that the use of connectives, such as conjunctions or transitional phrases, is assumed to be more prevalent in sections where the writer needs to establish logical connections, present arguments, or demonstrate relationships between ideas.

This research also showed that all measures of text cohesion were significantly affected by the impact of the rhetorical section. Lemma TTR (types-tokens ratio), one of the text cohesion indices, is an indicator of lexical diversity that indirectly contributes to text cohesion. A text with higher lexical diversity may have aces to a larger pool of words and expressions, which can be beneficial for achieving cohesion. A diverse vocabulary alows for more precise and varied ways to refer to ideas, establish connections between sentences and paragraphs, and avoid repetition. (Crossey, Kyle, & McNamara, 2016b). In this study, the abstract and conclusion were found to have higher TTR compared with other RA sections. Since these sections typicallyaim to provide aconcise overview and summary of the study, authors often condense the main findings, arguments, and implications into these sections (Martin, 2003; Yang & Allison, 2003). As a result, there might be a greater need for precise and varied word choices to efectively convey the key information within a limited word count. This higher information density can lead to a higher TTR as authorstrive to avoid repetition and provide a condensed yet comprehensive summary. The same patern was observed for content lemma TTR and function lemma TTR; higher levels were found in the abstract and conclusion.

As regards text cohesion, the findings of this study also revealed that repeated content lemmas (the ratio of repeated content lemmas to total number of words) was significantly different acos rhetoricl sections. This measure indicates the density of repetition of important words in the text (Crossey, Kyle, & McNamara, 2016b). A higher value suggests a greater level of textual cohesion, as more essntial words are repeated, reinforcing the central themes, ideas, or arguments. Interestingly, the lowest values of this index were reported in the abstract and conclusion, confirming that these two sections often prioritie conveying essential information with minimal repetition. On the other hand, the highest values of repeated content lemmas were found in the results section. Researchers employ consistent domain-specific and research-based terminology to ensure clarity and precision in their reporting (ang & Allison, 2003), which could lead to a higher occurrence of repeated content lemmas.

# 5.2. The predictive role of cohesion indices

The results of random forest modeling revealed that logical connectives were the most significant predictor of the abstract section. This suggests that the use of logical connectives is a key factor in determining the overall organization and structure of the abstract section. The abstract serves as a preliminary overview of the reearch article helping readers quickly asses its relevance and decide whether to read the full paper (Swales & Feak, 2012). Logical connectives could enhance reader understanding by providing logical links between different parts of the abstract, aiding comprehension and ensuring that the key information isconveyed clearly. The second most important predctor was demonstratives, the use of which can help authors refer to specific elements, findings, or concepts within the RA, summarizing and highlighting key aspects. In other words, the use of demonstratives can play a role in the dense and integrated packaging of iformation in the abstract section (Biber et al., 2002; Biber & Gray, 2010; Omidian et al., 2021) through summarizing and encapsulating important information in a concise manner (Martin, 2003). This heavy reliance also accords with the use of demonstratives with metadiscourse nouns across abstract moves, reflecting anaphoric and cataphoric cohesion shown in Jiang and Hyland (2017).

Random forest modeling also found that adjacent paragraph overlap noun lemmas was the most significant factor in determining the introduction section. This implies that the reuse or continuation of specific noun lemmas from one paragraph to the next contributes tocohesion within the inroduction section. One justfication for this finding is that the use of diverse lemmas alows athors to provide acomprehensive context for the reearch topic. Introducing different aspects, perspectives, or rlated concepts through varied word forms helps to situate the study within its broader context, which is crucial for readers to understand the significance and relevance of the reearch being conducte (Ozturk, 2007). In additio, it was found that the ccurrenceof allconnectives stood out as the second most significant predictor of this section of the RA.irstly, connectives such as"moreover and "furthermore can be used to add supporting evidence or arguments to strengthen the claims made in the introduction. These connectives establish a logical progression and demonstrate that the author has considered multiple perspectives or aspects of the topic (Louwerse, 2002; McNamara et al, 2010). Secondly, connectives such as "however', "on the other hand" or "in contrast" can be used to acknowledge and address counterarguments or alternative perspectives, helping researchers demonstrate their awareness of the complexit of the topic and build a stronger case for their own argument.

The findings of ths study indicated that causal connectives emerged as the most reliable predictor of the literature review section in RAs of applied linguistc. This suggests that cause-and-effct relationshis serve an important role in the literature review. One likely reason for this finding is that the use of causal connectives helps authors explicitly convey the relationships betwen different studies and their findings. They can allow authors to explain why certan research was conducted, how it relates to previous studie, and what implications can be drawn from the existing body of iterature. In addition, it was found that adjacent sentence overlap for verb synonyms, which is the number of verb lemma types that occur at least once in the next sentence, was the second most important predictor f th iere reie section. he occurrece f simiar or ra ver lemas in scesie entce indat thematic or conceptual link between the ideas expressed in adjacent sentences, contributing to a more comprehensive and interconnected presentation of information (Halliday & Mathiesen, 2014; McNamara et al., 2010) I should be noted that this is an index of local cohesion, suggesting that ideas and concepts in this section are mostly related at the sentence level rather than at the paragraph level.

An interesting finding of this research was that two measures of global cohesion were the strongest predictors of the method and results sections. Adjacent two-paragraph overlap for content lemas, which is the number of content lemmas occurring at least once in the next two paragraphs, was the best predictor of the method section. Similarl, adjacent paragraph overlap for function lemmas had the highest predictive capability for the results section of RAs. This indicates a strong presence of related concepts in the method section, representd b key terms, variables, or concets direcly asocitdwith the rerch dei and proceure. This considerable lexical overlap acros the paragraphs of the method section may facilitate the description of the proceduraldetals and specific of the research deig (Cotos t al., 2017). his could also ofer upport for the massive preencef lexical retition in the method ection of social science RAs (including applied linguistis) to provide a careful step-by-step description of thestudy (Swales, 1990). As regards the results section, presenting the research findings in an objective and precise manner i of prime importance. Function words, such as article, pronouns, and prepositions could help convey information with clarity and specificit. These words ssist in denoting specific entities and indicatig relationships between variables. In addition, these words can guide the reader in understanding the logical flow and connections between diffrent findings or statistical analyes. Prepositions and conjunctions, for example, can signal relationships between variables or experimental conditions.

It was also revealed that the number of all negative connectives was the strongest classfier for the discussion section. The dis cussion section of research articles ofen involves contrasting and critically evaluating the research findings in relation to existing literature or hypotheses (Liu & Buckingham, 2018). Negative connectives, such as "however', 'despite, 'nevertheles, and"although' play a significant role in signaling contrasts and introducing counterarguments (Louwerse, 2002). The use of such adverbial con junctions is also associated with evaluative and elaborated discourse in research writing frequently observed in the iscussion section (Omidian et al., 2021). The preence of negative connective suggests that the author i engaging in acritical analysis and considering altatie ties  itions, hch ae yl fre f th ssion ction. t t dffel,this tf ties can facilitate the exploration of different angles and enhance the depth of analysis by acknowledging diffring opinions or contra dictory findings. Moreover, it was found that adjaent sentence overlap all lemmas, which is the number of lemma types that appear at least once in the next sentence, was a strong predictor of the discussion section. Adjacent sentence overlap lemmas can indicate the continuity of thought between sentences (McNamara et al., 2010). When the lemmas from one sentence are repeated or expanded in the next sentence, i ugsts a smooth transition and deelopment of the discussion. In additin, the reoccurrence of lemmas from the previous sentence in the next sentence may facilitate acontinuation of the discussion on the same topic or theme. This repetition and reinforcement could provide opportunities for further explanation, examples, or supporting evidence, enhancing the depth and clarity of the discussion.

The conclusion section was found to strongly feature aditive connectives. This is not surprising as the function of the concluding section of the RA is where asummary of al findings as well as the mplications of the study are listed (Deng & Li, 2022; Sheldon, 2019; Yang & Allison, 203). These connecties help researchers organize and preent the findings as well as its implicatios and limitations in a structured manner. Secondly, adjacent sentence overlap for noun synonyms was the second most powerful clasifier of the conclusion section. he use of noun synonyms acros adjacent sentences can facilitate the constant referenceto information from other sections of the RA aimed at summarizing and evaluating the major findings in this section (Liu & Xiao, 2022). In addition, may signal a repetition or restatement of important terms or concepts related to the reearch. This repetition helps emphasize and reinforce the core elements of the study, ensuring that they are clearly understood by the reader.

Finally, this research befitted from two robust statistical modeling methods to investigate cohesion in RAs of applied linguistics. While linear mixed-efects modeling demonstrated the use of local, global, and text cohesion was significantly different across the rhetorical sections of RAs, random forest modeling investigated a diferent reearch question, i.., the predictive contribution of cohesion indices to each rhetorica section. While the post-hoc comparison conducted for mixed-efects modeling located the signif. icant differences among the rhetorical sections see Supplementary ile, random forest analys more efectively revealed the salient cohesive features asociated with each section of the RA. This could complement and validate the results of mixed-effects models. This is in line with few studies in academic writing scholarship using random forest modeling, as a non-parametric procedure, to validate the findings of parametric analysis (Rezaee & Golparvar, 2017; Nasseri, 2020).

# 6. Conclusion

The findings of this study could have noticeable implications for research and pedagogy in L2/academic writing. The indices of cohesion investigated in this research could significantly clasify the rhetorical sections of RAs, indicating their usefulness for researching cohesion in academic writing. Moreover, the application of these indice can facilitate a comprehensive analysis of cohesion in genre-based studies. Therefore, future research on cohesion in academic genres, such as RA and its part-genres as well as thesis and dissertation is recommended to examine these indices instead of focusing on specific aspects of cohesion.The results of this research provide students, researchers, and ESP instructors with a more in-depth understanding of cohesive paterns in academic writing. Considering the effectiveness of EAP instruction on developing a more academic reister in students (Crosthwaite, 2016), the cohesion patterns found in this study could be incorporated into EAP courses.

This study had some limitations, which should be acknowledged. First, our corpus only included RAs of applied linguistics. Further work on cohesion in academic writing could explore cohesion in RAs of other disciplines. Second, this study did not investigate the possible impact of the rhetorical moves and steps within each section of the RA on cohesion. Moreover, the corpus of ths study only included manuscripts reporting quantitative research. This limitation may also be addressed in future work. Nevertheles, despite the aforementioned limitations, this study remains significant i advancing our understanding of cohesion in the RA genre and provides a valuable starting point for future investigations to build upon.
