The advancement of digital technologies requires English for Academic Purposes (EAP) education to incorporate digital-multimodal approaches in curriculum development to prepare learners for academic communication in this digital era. One such effort is the integration of digital multimodal composition (DMC). While the existing studies have investigated pedagogical practice involving DMC, there is still a lack of a systematic identification of the multi-semiotic communicative patterns in students’ DMC performance. Using a systemic functional approach to multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) and social semiotics approach to multimodality, the study aims to explore the patterns and characteristics of student-generated knowledge dissemination videos, a kind of DMC specifically pertaining to disciplinary communication targeting nonspecialists. The analysis displays students’ discursive patterns in the creation of interpersonal, ideational, and textual meanings. It is found that students excel in creating interpersonal meaning through configuring embodied and filmic modes and using popular visuals. However, their performance in conveying ideational and textual meaning needs improvement. Some students rely on technical language with unclear visuals, while others use a limited range of semiotics. Textual meaning created in the videos shows intermodal and intramodal incoherence. These findings can inform EAP course development and enhance students’ digital multimodal proficiency in academic communication.

# 1. Introduction

Digital technologies have dramatically changed the knowledge production and dissemination processes. They provide communicators with rich digital-multimodal semiotic resources such as linguistic, audial and visuals resources. The dissemination of scientific knowledge relies on the configuration of various resources rather than language alone (Luzon, ´ 2013). Further, digital technologies create easy access to knowledge and information, making them available to the public. Even in academic communication which is customarily reliant on writing, academics, scientists, and specialists inevitably face the need to engage with a wide range of digitally mediated genres in order to communicate within and beyond the academic community (Luzon´ & P´erez-Llantada, 2022; P´erez-Llantada & Luzon, ´ 2022). These genres include, for example, TED talks (Xia, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c; Xia & Hafner, 2021), Google talks (Mattiello,

2020), and video methods articles (Hafner, 2018). These changes in the communicative context of academic communication urge educators to rethink the scope of English for Academic purposes (EAP) education, requiring them to include digital-multimodal elements in curriculum development in order to fit the “the specific communicative needs and practices of particular groups in academic contexts” (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002, p. 2).

One approach to achieve this end is to incorporate the approach of digital multimodal composition (DMC). DMC can be defined as “a textual practice that involves the use of digital tools to produce texts by combining multiple semiotic modes that include, but are not limited to, image, word, and soundtrack” (Jiang, 2017, p. 1). Integrating this approach into language teaching and learning can have technological, educational, social and cultural affordances (Jiang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2020). In addition, DMC may facilitate language acquisition. Unsworth and Mills (2020) found that integrating digital multimodal authoring pedagogy in year-five students’ language courses ably extended their linguistic repertoire of evaluative and attitudinal expressions. More importantly, empirical research has shown that DMC-integrated curriculum can promote more text generation compared to traditional writing in second language writing courses (Kim et al., 2023). In view of the benefits of DMC, numerous studies have been conducted on the practice of using the approach. One line of research focuses on teachers’ pedagogical choices, such as designing multimodal assignments of DMC-integrated courses (Lim & Polio, 2020), accommodating DMC to the expectations of multiple stakeholders (Zuo & He, 2023), and assessment methods (Hafner & Ho, 2020). Another line of research investigates students’ constructive process and product of DMC. Investigation have been conducted on learners’ consideration of multiple contexts to negotiate their authorial voices (Cimasko & Shin, 2017; Hafner, 2015), the creation of a translanguaging space (Ho, 2022) in DMC practice, as well as their orchestration of verbal-visual resources in meaning making (Shin et al., 2020). The existing studies reveal the significant potential of DMC in language and communication instruction. We can therefore reasonably infer that DMC is feasible for EAP education, which specifically emphasizes academic and disciplinary communication.

While previous studies have explored pedagogical practices involving digital-multimodal communication (DMC), there is still a need for a systematic identification of the multi-semiotic communicative patterns in students’ DMC performance. To address this gap, we consider students’ digital-multimodal creations as a distinct genre or text type. The primary purpose of this genre is to convey intended meaning through the utilization of various semiotic resources offered by digital technologies. The specific communicative needs of students may vary depending on different scenarios, ranging from knowledge dissemination (e.g., Hafner, 2014) to expressing identities (e.g., Cummins & Early, 2011). Adopting a genre-based perspective allows us to examine students’ DMC by analyzing multiple exemplars, instead of relying solely on case studies as most previous research has done.

Furthermore, the insights generated from the multimodal discourse analysis of a great many student-generated DMC can be useful for identifying the genuine needs for accommodating an EAP course for the current digitally mediated era. The focal step to develop an EAP course often involves an analysis of what learners need to operate in the target communicative situation (Woodrow, 2018). These necessities can be transformed into educational goals that serve as the basis for the subsequent design of teaching materials and pedagogical activities (Brown, 2016). To analyze the needs, it is necessary to observe how learners translate the communicative skills they have acquired in current EAP courses into practice. Such observation of participants’ actual communicative behaviors can provide information that may be overlooked at the outset of the course design (Jasso-Aguilar, 1999). Give this, if EAP practitioners intend to effectively incorporate DMC in curriculum design, it is crucial to firstly identify the patterns and features of students’ DMC performance, which can lay the foundation for further design of interventions of improvement. In view of the pedagogical needs, the present study aims to examine a specific form of student-generated DMC that focuses on communicating disciplinary knowledge, namely knowledge dissemination videos. The study addresses the following research questions: (1) What are the discursive features observed in student-generated knowledge dissemination videos? (2) What are the patterns evident in students’ multimodal meaning-making practices?

# 2. Knowledge dissemination videos

For the purpose of the present study, a knowledge dissemination video is defined as an audiovisual medium used to effectively communicate and distribute information, insights, or research findings in an academic or educational context, employing visual and auditory elements to convey complex concepts in an understandable and engaging manner. They are an outcome of the tendency in the knowledge dissemination landscape that the processes of conveying and dispersing knowledge are undergoing a notable transition from conventional print genres to novel modalities of communication facilitated by digital technologies (Bondi & Cacchiani, 2021). Such videos are novel cyber-genres – according to Shepherd and Watters’ (1998) taxonomy – namely, web-native cybergenres that fully utilize new media and are exclusively designed for online dissemination, leveraging their multimodal capabilities to the utmost extent.

One key characteristic of knowledge dissemination videos is their extensive employment of multimodality, involving the utilization of multiple semiotic resources to convey meaning. For instance, Valeiras-Jurado and Bernad-Mecho´ (2022) conducted a study examining the semiotic modes employed in a YouTube science video, comparing it with a TEDx video that was recorded and edited based on a live presentation. The findings revealed that the presenter in the YouTube science video employed a higher density of emphatic rhythm markers, such as gestures, head movements, and facial expressions, when addressing the online audience. In addition, the online video employed a medium shot with a frontal angle to directly engage viewers, while maintaining visual coherence through a relatively low rate of cuts. Another notable feature of knowledge dissemination videos is the implementation of discursive strategies to recontextualize disciplinary knowledge in a manner accessible to diverse audiences. Luzon´ (2019) analyzed the recontextualization strategies employed in online videos used by research groups to communicate their research. These strategies encompass establishing the credibility and authority of the research group, constructing persuasive arguments, adapting information to the presumed knowledge of potential viewers, and fostering a connection with the audience. The successful execution of these strategies relies on the coordination of multiple semiotic resources, rather than language alone.

The studies conducted on knowledge dissemination videos indicate that the utilization of digitally mediated genres to communicate disciplinary knowledge to a general audience has become a prevalent practice in academic communication during the digitally driven era. It is therefore imperative for educators to equip students with the skills necessary for engaging in this novel mode of communication. However, the existing research has primarily examined knowledge dissemination videos produced by experts and professionals and there are limited studies depicting discursive features of student-created educational videos. One student-authored knowledge dissemination genre that has been closely investigated is the scientific documentary (Hafner, 2014; 2015; Hafner & Miller, 2019). Learners were found to remix an array of cultural, generic, and semiotic modes to appeal to the audience and express their discoursal identities. Ho (2022) examined the students’ process of constructing an instructional video that introduces concepts related to multimodality to a lay audience. The study revealed that DMC created a translanguaging space where students could safely and creatively manipulate various types of knowledge. The present study aims to extend this line of research on student-authored knowledge dissemination videos by identifying discursive features present in students’ DMC products.

# 3. Theoretical framework

The theoretical framework of the present study draws upon the Systemic Functional Approach to Multimodal Discourse Analysis (SF-MDA) (O’Halloran & Lim, 2014) and a social semiotics approach to multimodality (Kress, 2010). While these two theories encompass various principles related to multimodal meaning-making practices, the examination of students’ multi-semiotic communicative practice specifically benefits from the following principles.

First, based on Halliday’s (1978) Systemic Functional Theory, SF-MDA seeks to comprehend how semiotic resources are combined to generate diverse forms of meaning in multimodal communication (O’Halloran & Lim, 2014). It posits that semiotic resources are configured to constitute ideational meaning (i.e., idea about the world), interpersonal meaning (i.e., the social relations, stance, and attitudes towards the world) and textual meaning (i.e., how information is organized). Following this line, Kress and van Leeuwen (2006) developed the theory on visual grammar, investigating how the three strands of meaning are visually created. According to them, ideational meaning is created through processes, participants, and circumstances. Interpersonal meaning can be achieved through gaze and distance of shots. For instance, a direct gaze can create a sense of engagement compared to an indirect gaze which creates a sense of detachment. A close shot creates a personal distance between a represented participant and viewers compared to a medium shot which creates comfortable social distance. Textual meaning is achieved through information value (referring to the degree of importance ascribed to conveyed information based on the positioning of elements within discrete “zones” of an image or screen), salience (which determines the level of attention given to certain elements through techniques like font size or color contrast), and framing devices (such as dividing lines or framing lines that indicate the inclusion and exclusion of specific elements). These theoretical underpinnings guide the present study in comprehensively examining students’ multi-semiotic communicative competence by deconstructing it into the creation of ideational, interpersonal, and textual meaning through multiple semiotic resources.

Another principle the present study draws upon is that multiple semiotic modes are configured to create intended meaning in multimodal communication. Mode can be defined as “a regularized organised set of resources for meaning-making, including, image, gesture, movement, music, speech and sound-effect” (Jewett & Kress, 2003, p. 1). Valeiras-Jurado and Bernad-Mecho´ (2022) pointed out two categories of modes in online dissemination videos: embodied modes that are controlled by the presenter (Sigrid, 2004) and filmic modes that enables meaning-making process between filmmakers and the viewers (Tseng & Bateman, 2010). Furthermore, a multimodal perspective examines the interrelationships among modes rather than individual modes alone, as the combination of modes allows for the creation of meanings that cannot be achieved by individual semiotic modes (Bateman, 2017). When semiotic modes are combined, an ideal situation would be modal coherence, referring to the situation when “the modes are being used in a consistent way and do not contradict each other” (Valeiras-Jurado, 2019, p. 95). In the present study, learners’ multi-semiotic communicative competence is primarily manifested by their ability to employ and configure multiple semiotic modes. Therefore, investigating students’ multi-semiotic design involves a close examination of configuration of multiple semiotic modes.

Additionally, a social semiotics approach to multimodality holds the view that the designers of multimodal ensembles and sign makers’ semiotic choices are motivated by their interest, namely, a need to respond to prompt in the social environment in which the sign is made (Kress, 2010). Particularly, in students’ DMC practice, their choices of multi-semiotic resources can be constrained by the educational context in which they are situated and the availability of resources available to them. This principle guides the present study to go beyond the formal description of students’ DMC products to consider the “subjectivity” involved in their semiotic choices in making the videos.

# 4. The study

# 4.1. Research context

This study draws on data from an English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP) course offered to second-year non-English majors at a government-funded university in China. The duration of the course is 16 weeks, consisting of sixteen 90-min sessions. Overall, the EGAP course aims to equip non-English majors with the necessary language skills, such as citation usage, summarization, and paraphrasing, and strategies to navigate academic contexts successfully. By the end of the course, students should be better prepared to engage in academic discourse, comprehend complex academic texts, and express their ideas effectively in spoken and written forms.

The main assessment project for the course involves students being grouped together based on their major background, with 4–5 students per group. The task assigned to each group is to create a video introducing the concept to a non-specialist audience. These videos are generated by the students themselves and shared publicly through a class WeChat video account. Students provided informed consent and uploaded their videos under the supervision of the course coordinator.

The process of producing these videos involves the utilization of various digital literacies, including the incorporation of soundtracks, audio narration, and the inclusion of additional visual or auditory effects. Throughout the course, students were exposed to several examples of knowledge dissemination videos created by experts on platforms like YouTube. Each group was granted a 1-h consultation with the course instructor to discuss their initial draft. However, they did not receive explicit instruction on modal interaction or systematic guidance on utilizing diverse semiotic resources, video design, and production techniques. At the end of the course, each group was required to outline the process they underwent while constructing their videos. They were encouraged to provide specific examples and evidence to support their descriptions of the experience.

The current study includes a total of 21 groups, comprising 81 s-year students (49 females and 32 males) in 2022. The student cohort represents various disciplines, encompassing natural sciences (biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics) as well as social sciences (economics, geography, history, and sociology). The disciplinary concepts introduced in the videos are relevant to these fields. Based on their reflective reports, the majority of groups (19 out of 21) indicated that they had very limited prior experience in creating multimedia projects before enrolling in the course.

# 4.2. Data collection

For this study, the primary data consists of 21 digital videos created by 21 groups of students for their course assessment project. The video data is complemented by 21 reflective reports, with a total word count of 25,508 words. Table 1 presents an overview of the key details pertaining to these videos. On average, the videos have a duration of ${ 3 2 0 s } .$ . The longest video lasts for $5 3 4 \ s _ { \mathrm { { i } } }$ , while the shortest video has a duration of 185 s. Each video, on average, contains approximately 809 words, with the longest video consisting of 1004 words and the shortest containing 273 words. Prior to the study, informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the research protocol received ethical approval from the relevant university. To protect the students’ identities, pseudonyms were used throughout the data analysis process.

# 4.3. Data analysis

Several procedures were undertaken to analyze the data (see Fig. 1). Firstly, the videos were extensively watched to achieve two objectives: to discern the general sections within each video, including the introduction (referred to as the lead-in part), body (where students explain disciplinary knowledge), and end/conclusion (if applicable); and to familiarize the researchers with the style and semiotic resources utilized in the videos.

Next, drawing upon Valeiras-Jurado and Bernad-Mecho´’s (2022) framework, multimodal transcription was conducted on all 21 videos (see Table 2). Each video was first divided into shots and for each shot, both embodied modes and filmic modes were transcribed. In terms of embodied modes, we transcribed the speech (what the presenter/narrator said), paralanguage, gestures (what did the presenter did), gaze (direct or indirect), head movements (nod, shake or tilt) and facial expression (frown, smile, or eyebrow raising). In terms of filmic modes, we annotated mise-en-scene, distance of shot (e.g., close-up, medium shot), angle of shot, visual prompts (image and/or text) and background music (if any). The multimodal transcription was facilitated by the software Multimodal Analysis Video (Multimodal Analysis Company Pte Ltd., 2018) (see Fig. 2). The software provides an interface where we can unfold the use of multiple semiotic resources and see the multimodal configuration at any specific moment.

Subsequently, we identified the segments involving the creation of interpersonal, ideational, and textual meaning. It is important to note that while the interpersonal and textual functions could be found in any section of the video, the ideational function predominantly manifested within the body section where the students introduce the disciplinary knowledge. To accomplish this task, one researcher watched five videos and annotated the corresponding time stamps for segments serving these functions. It is noteworthy that certain segments might encompass multiple functions. For example, in a segment where the presenter introduces disciplinary concepts, he or she may use a direct gaze and questions to invite the audience to think. Such a segment was identified twice, both for involving creation of ideational meaning and interpersonal meaning. Following this, the other researcher watched the same five videos and independently identified the segments associated with these functions. The two researchers then cross-checked their identifications, engaging in discussions to resolve any discrepancies. They proceeded to watch the identified segments and assigned names to the patterns of multimodal practice observed. This process was repeated for the initial five videos, resulting in the development of an initial coding system that aimed to capture the characteristics of multimodal semiotic resource used for all three functions. The coding system was then applied to the remaining 16 videos to identify additional segments and patterns. Any newly identified patterns were subsequently incorporated into the system.

After that, the patterns and their related segments were cross-verified against the multimodal transcription to examine the use of semiotic resources and multimodal configurations within the identified patterns. This step allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the relationships between the identified patterns and the underlying multimodal practices observed in the data. Lastly, to ensure the validity of the findings, a triangulation approach was employed by interpreting the patterns and characteristics identified in the videos alongside students’ reflective essays. The reflective essays underwent deductive thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006), wherein relevant segments elucidating the multimodal patterns were manually coded using MaxQDA. This analysis allowed for a comprehensive examination of the data, enhancing the credibility of the study’s conclusions.

# 5. Findings

This section reports the salient patterns identified in the student-generated knowledge dissemination videos in question. The patterns were categorized based on the three kinds of meaning-making practice. Two patterns were identified in the elements involving the creation of interpersonal meaning: configuring embodied and filmic modes (Pattern One) and embedding popular visuals (Pattern Two). In creating ideational meaning, students are found to configure jargonistic language and ambiguous visuals (Pattern Three) and use a limited variety of semiotic resources (Pattern Four). In terms of creating textual meaning, the analysis shows that the videos tend to contain intermodal incoherence (Pattern Five) and intra-modal incoherence (Pattern Six). Table 3 clearly displays these six patterns, including the definitions and examples for each.

# 5.1. Students’ practice in creating interpersonal meaning

.1. Pattern One: engaging viewers through configuring embodied and filmic modes The analysis of the videos shows that a few students tend to combine a range of semiotic resources to create interpersonal meaning, namely, relating to the viewers. These resources include both embodied modes including interpersonal language (such as questions and second person pronoun), direct gaze, head movement, facial expression, gestures, and filmic modes such as medium close shot distances and engaging background music. In the data set, $2 4 \%$ of videos (five out of 21) contain this pattern (see Table 4). Among the videos adopting Pattern One, the pattern tends to appear at the beginning or end of the video, indicating that students pay much attention to grasping the audience’s attention at the beginning and create a memorable end for them. An example of this pattern is illustrated in Fig. 3.

This extract illustrated in Fig. 3 is an introductory section of a video introducing the concept of repeated games in economics. In this extract, the speaker introduces the concept by talking about a popular mobile phone game that adopts this concept in its design. At the editing layer, we can see that that the mise-en-scene consists of an all-black background against which the represented participant dressing in white locates herself at the very center of the screen. The color contrast between the mise-en-scene and the presenter’s dressing and the highlighted information value achieved through the centralized position significantly increases the salience of the speaker. Furthermore, we can see that the represented participant is captured at medium close waist-up distance from a frontal angle. Such semiotic choices can create a sense of attachment and social personal distance between the represented participant and the audience, according to Kress and van Leeuwen (2006). The engaging filmic modes are accompanied by equally engaging embodied modes. Specifically, in Shot 1 Frame 1, the phatic expression (“Yo bro, what’s going on?“) is accompanied by a smiling facial expression to engage the audience directly. Subsequently, she draws upon her personal experience that she was unable to fall asleep due to being drawn to an attractive mobile game. In stating the personal experience, the prominence on the words “I” (“but I can’t”) is reinforced by the deictic gesture pointing to herself and direct gaze at the audience. At the end of the introductory section, the presenter asks questions “But why? How could it be so addictive to us like a drug?“, frowning with a confusing face, inviting the audience to think about the underlying reason for the game’s attractiveness. The extract illustrated in Fig. 3 is followed by the body of the video that introduces the key disciplinary knowledge. It can be seen from this example that the authors employ a wide range of semiotic resources to engage the audience before disseminating the knowledge. When explaining about the rationale behind engaging the audience at the beginning of the video, two groups (Group 4 and Group 5) both highlighted that the course instructor had previously emphasized the significance of capturing readers’ interest in the opening of an academic essay. Consequently, the students drew a parallel, expressing their belief that creating videos shares a similar principle. They felt compelled to employ various techniques to “magnetize” viewers right from the start, ensuring their sustained interest throughout the video. It can be seen that although the instructor did not provide explicit instructions on crafting video introductions, the students consciously applied their understanding of generic conventions from academic written genres to the construction of knowledge dissemination videos.

# 5.1.2. Pattern Two: engaging viewers through embedding popular visuals

Another pattern in the creation of interpersonal meaning is that some students choose to incorporate popular elements, mostly at the beginning of the video, to arouse the viewers’ interest. These popular elements include screenshots of social media, imagery of celebrities, scrolling screenshots, cinemograph, and video clips. $4 3 \%$ of all videos in question are found to involve this pattern (see Table 5). An example is illustrated in Fig. 4.

Unlike Pattern One where usually the presenter is the represented participant, videos using this strategy tend to foreground visuals and presenters tend to become the offstage narrator. In Shot 1, the narrator addresses the audience directly by asking the two questions (“Have you ever browsed Instagram, TikTok or Xiaohongshu […]”; “Do you feel confused and don’t understand what these letters are trying to say?“). The use of questions and second personal pronouns create a strong sense of engagement at the outset of the video. The verbalized questions are accompanied by concurrent visuals. In Shot 1, when the narrator utters three social media platforms, the icons representing these three platforms appear on the screen one after another simultaneously. Subsequently, in Shot 2 Frames 1 and 2, the utterances “someone’s work with a mirror shot, full body shot” are concurrent with visuals demonstrating the verbalized scenarios. It is important to note that the visuals in the two frames are not still images but strolling screenshots and cinemographs. Compared to still visuals, using dynamic visuals reminds the viewers of the familiar experiences of scrolling down the mobile phone screen. Through embedding the popular content in the video in a vivid manner, the authors engage the audience by integrating everyday entertainment they are familiar with before introducing the distant disciplinary content. This semiotic choice made by the students can primarily be attributed to the teacher’s guidance, as the instructor previously showcased expert dissemination videos during class. As Group 11 stated, “we analyzed the experts’ videos presented by the course instructor and noticed that many of them used rich popular elements, particularly dynamic visuals at the beginning. These elements can quickly catch the viewers’ eyes and make the whole video more vivid”. It is evident that the multimodal design of videos employed by teachers can serve as “models” for students, potentially motivating their semiotic choices.

# 5.2. Students’ practice in creating ideational meaning

5.2.1. Pattern Three: configuring jargonistic language and ambiguous visuals

A common observation in the student-generated knowledge dissemination videos is the use of specialized language accompanied by ambiguous visual symbols when explaining disciplinary knowledge to the intended audience. In simpler terms, students often choose to convey disciplinary content through speech. This choice may stem from the “functional specialization” of the linguistic mode that language is well-suited for communicating abstract and conceptual knowledge.

However, the language used in students’ verbal explanations tends to be technical and not easily accessible to a general audience. Moreover, although some students incorporate various visual symbols to supplement their verbal explanations, these visuals are not self-explanatory, thereby likely adding additional cognitive load for viewers trying to process the information. This Pattern Three was identified in 10 videos (out of 21), accounting for almost half of the total data set (see Table 6). An example showcasing this practice can be seen in the extract depicted in Fig. 5.

In the provided extract, students attempt to explain the concept of repeated games, an economics term. It is evident that speech plays a dominant role as the definition of the concept is conveyed through the verbal mode. However, the verbally communicated definition lacks explicit explanation of various related concepts, such as long-term behavior, the behavior that does not harm others and at the expense of others. Understanding these sub-concepts requires a basic knowledge of economics and game theory, making it challenging for a general audience without such background to follow along. Another issue in the verbal explanation is the lack of utilization of exemplification or analogy in explaining the term. Although the target concept is contextualized within customer-merchant bargaining, certain elements could have been exemplified using everyday knowledge. For instance, the generic terms “one-time consumption” and “long-term behaviors” could be replaced with more specific and relevant examples, such as a tourist’s visit to a sightseeing spot or frequent visits to a neighborhood grocery store.

What confuses viewers more is the use of visual symbols that does not effectively enhance the explanation. For instance, in Shot 2 Frame 1, when the narrator mentions “if it is only a one-time consumption,” an icon representing a lady shopping and the words “onetime consumption” appear simultaneously on the screen. However, this combination of visual image and written text does not facilitate the viewers’ understanding of the concept of “one-time consumption”; instead, viewers may need to question why a lady shopping represents one-time consumption. This example underscores that the unclear verbal explanation, coupled with ambiguous visual representation, hinders the effective explanation of disciplinary knowledge. It can be seen that the students assume a certain level of audience knowledge and fail to recontextualize the disciplinary knowledge in a manner that can be easily understood by a lay audience. One group whose work demonstrates this pattern explained that they opted to use the linguistic mode for explaining the term because they regarded language as “the best way to explain abstract concepts” (G13). They perceived the visual mode as less significant in conveying abstract ideas or theories, considering it to “play a supplementary role” (G12), as one student commented. This suggests that some students viewed the use of the visual mode as an additional element, even somewhat redundant, when it comes to explaining disciplinary terms. Regarding the use of specialized language, a few students mentioned that they deliberately chose to employ jargonistic terminology to define the terms. They believed that using their own wording might “change the original meaning and lower the accuracy of the disciplinary knowledge” (G13). What we observe here is a trade-off made by the students between the accuracy and accessibility of the target knowledge, where the former takes precedence over the latter. Furthermore, some students admitted that they did not consider the background of the lay audience, as they were “struggling with expressing the disciplinary term in English.” (G8)

# 5.2.2. Pattern Four: using a limited variety of semiotic resources

In the video segments involving the creation of ideational meaning, the other pattern observed is that students often rely on a limited range of semiotic modes when explaining disciplinary knowledge. For example, in some videos, in the main body of the video, a presenter remains the only participant represented in the video without any necessary visual prompts. In others, the same visual semiotics stay for a long time while the offstage narrator does the verbal explanation. This “monomodal” characteristic stands out, especially when compared to the highly multimodal introductory sections that students use to captivate the audience. This Pattern Four appears in $7 1 \%$ of all the videos in question (15 out of 21), indicating this is a common practice among the students (see Table 7). The extract depicted in Fig. 6 illustrates this practice.

The purpose of this video is to dispel a common misconception that the field of logistics is solely related to express delivery. The extract depicted in Fig. 6 utilizes SF Express, a renowned express delivery company in Asia, as an example to showcase the advanced technologies employed in logistics, such as code scanning, high-tech equipment, and automatic distribution solutions that benefit the company. The students chose to embed a video featuring the presenter delivering the speech in a park on a slide. On the right side of the slide, the title “Logistics $=$ Express Delivery? No!” is displayed. As we can see from the illustration, the visual representations accompanying the verbal explanation remain consistent throughout the 86-s segment. The presenter is captured from a frontal angle at a medium-close distance. The use of this waist-up distance limits the visibility of the presenter’s gestural resources. Additionally, the presenter maintains a frozen facial expression, reciting the words without employing vocal prominences such as pauses or emphasis. Furthermore, the utilization of filmic modes is limited. Important keywords, such as the statistic “nearly 4 billion items” could have been highlighted using visual prompts such as text or images. Consequently, the restricted use of embodied modes and filmic modes results in an unclear presentation of crucial information, making it challenging for viewers to grasp the disciplinary content.

# 5.3. Students’ practice in creating textual meaning

# 5.3.1. Pattern Five: visual-verbal incoherence

The students’ videos exhibit a notable lack of coherence between the verbal and visual modes, resulting in a discrepancy that undermines overall coherence. This pattern was identified in more than half of the videos $( 6 7 \%$ , as illustrated in Table 8). The discrepancy is manifested in multiple ways. In some videos, the visually represented content is displayed later or before the according verbal explanation is provided. In other samples, the visual semiotics contain an amount of information that exceeds the meaning effectively explained in the verbal mode. Both kinds of discrepancies cause cognitive burden on viewers in comprehending the idea. The extract depicted in Fig. 7 serves as an example of this observation.

This video serves as an introduction to the application and importance of Geographic Information System (GIS). In the extract depicted in Fig. 5, the presenter aims to convey to the audience that GIS is not only beneficial in everyday life but also crucial in addressing environmental crises such as hurricanes, wildfires, and deforestation. However, there is a lack of coherence between the verbal explanation and the visual mode. Specifically, in Shot 1 Frame 1, while the presenter mentions one of GIS’s functions as providing traffic navigation for drivers, the displayed images depict a hurricane, wildfire, and desert oasis individually, none of which are relevant to the verbal discussion of traffic navigation. Subsequently, in Shot 1 Frame 2, the row of images moves to the left, causing the image of the hurricane to disappear and the image of urban traffic to appear. However, these images do not align with the speech, which states that GIS can be used in other contexts such as “agriculture, forestry, military, environmental protection, and resource management”. By Frame 3, the moment when the presenter mentions the use of GIS in predicting hurricanes and earthquakes, the image of the hurricane has already moved out of the video, leaving the viewers with images of a desert oasis and urban traffic (See Shot 1 Frame 3). Similarly, in Shot 1 Frame 4, when the presenter finally discusses the use of GIS in combating wildfires, the image of the wildfire has disappeared. This extract clearly demonstrates a form of modal incoherence, which contradicts the concept of modal coherence, where “the modes are being used in a consistent way and do not contradict each other” (Valeiras-Jurado, 2019, p. 95). The semiotic decision observed in this pattern arises from the students’ neglect of the interplay between the visual and verbal modes. While the students acknowledge the role of rich semiotics in constructing meaning, they tend to overlook the dynamic interaction between the visual mode and verbal mode. As expressed by G7, the group responsible for the GIS video mentioned earlier, “we used a large number of images to support the interpretation of GIS functions. The presentation of moving images makes these explanations more vivid.” However, the overemphasis on the visual mode and the insufficient attention given to the accompanying verbal explanations often result in a disconnect between the visual representation and verbal elucidation.

# 5.3.2. Pattern Six: intra-modal incoherence

Another pattern identified in the students’ creation of textual meaning is intra-modal incoherence. This type of incoherence pertains to the inconsistency and abruptness in the chronological process of meaning-making within a single mode, such as speech, visuals, or audio. For instance, some videos adopt fast-paced background music at the beginning while in the middle slow-paced music is adopted without any transition. In others, the initial mise-en-scene is a bright tone while in the middle it suddenly changes into a dark and shady tone without any reason. This pattern appears in 9 videos, accounting for $4 3 \%$ of the sampled videos (see Table 9). The extract illustrated in Fig. 6 is an example.

Table 9 Proportion of videos containing Pattern Six.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Number of videos (n = 21)</td><td>Proportion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>43%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The extract depicted in Fig. 8 aims to introduce a set of psychological concepts, namely, ID, superego, and ego. This segment follows a script organized in a general-specific-general structure. It begins by introducing the general concept of personality structure, then proceeds to explain the three sub-concepts (ID, superego, and ego), and concludes with a summary. Five students were involved in the presentation: one introduced the main concept and provided an overview of the three sub-concepts, while three elaborated on each sub-concept, and one student delivered the summary. However, despite the coherence observed in the textual mode, the non-linguistic modes accompanying the presentation lack an equivalent level of coherence. Visually, this incoherence becomes apparent in the choices made regarding shot distances, placement of information, and screen orientation. Specifically, in terms of shot distances, the first presenter (Shot 1) is framed in a very close shot, capturing the head, and placed in the left corner of the screen. In contrast, the second presenter (Shot 2), framed in a medium close shot, is however centered at the bottom of the screen. The third presenter (Shot 3) is captured in a medium waist-up shot and positioned on the left side of the screen once again. Finally, the last presenter (Shot 5) is captured in a close-up shot but placed in a more prominent position on the screen. Furthermore, there is inconsistency in screen orientation. The first two shots are captured in portrait mode, where the height of the viewport is greater than its width. However, shots 3 to 5 are captured in landscape mode, where the width of the viewport is greater than its height. These inconsistent choices regarding shot distances, placement of information, and screen orientation within the video diminish its overall coherence, potentially distracting viewers from the intended knowledge dissemination. In addition, inconsistency exists audially both in terms of background music, and in the speaking paces of the presenters. Firstly, the background music style in the segment lacks consistency. In Shots 1 and 2, the background music is vibrant, but it suddenly switches to a melancholic tone in Shots 3 and 4. Secondly, the presenters also exhibit discrepancies in their speaking paces. In Shots 1, 2, and 4, the presenters speak at a moderate pace, while in Shots 3 and 5, the other two presenters speak much more quickly. This semiotic pattern arises due to a fragmented approach to meaning-making. Team members make semiotic decisions independently, lacking effective communication among themselves. As described by one group whose video exemplifies this pattern, “each of us prepared our part carefully and completed all the tasks for that part, including scripts, PowerPoint, recording(shooting), subtitling, and so on”. With such fragmented division of labor, the video, which was intended to be a cohesive multimodal ensemble, ends up as a patchwork of disconnected multimodal units.

# 6. Discussion

The findings provide new insights into the design of EAP courses intending to involve digital-multimodal elements. Therefore, this study can be regarded as a needs analysis, the focal step analyzing what learners need in order to operate in the target academic communication in the development of an EAP course (Woodrow, 2018). While numerous studies have showcased the use of the surveys and interviews in finding out stakeholders’ perceptions of EAP course (see e.g., Youn, 2018; Zohoorian, 2015) and class observations in revealing learners’ academic communicative needs (see e.g., Atai & Nazari, 2011; Atai & Shoja, 2011), the present study offers detailed multimodal discourse analysis of student-generated multimodal practice and therefore fill the blind spots in addressing students’ multimodal performance in academic communication. Furthermore, while numerous studies have proven the efficacy and benefits of DMC, what needs to be found out is the strengths and weaknesses of students’ DMC practice so that the current EAP course can be enhanced to fit the learners’ needs. Based on the identified multimodal discursive patterns in students’ DMC practice, this study proposes a theoretical model (see Fig. 9) to theorize the types of multimodal communicative competences that educators can consider when incorporating DMC in EAP pedagogy.

The present study suggests that an EAP pedagogy that incorporates DMC should emphasize the enhancement of students’ multimodal competence in generating interpersonal, ideational, and textual meaning. In the context of knowledge dissemination videos, these competences manifest as the capacity to engage the audience, to explain the knowledge and to present message coherently. More specifically, educators can specifically pay attention to foster learner’s abilities in terms of modal configuration, visual enticement, mode discernment, knowledge customization, inter-modal alignment and intra-modal concordance. It is worth mentioning that while the six dimensions are derived from our investigation of students’ creation of one specific meaning, some of the dimensions are relevant to the other two kinds of meaning-making practice as well.

Modal discernment involves understanding the distinct modes of communication and their unique characteristics. This competence dimension arises from the observation that certain students predominantly rely on spoken communication while neglecting the use of other semiotic modes when explaining disciplinary knowledge (Pattern Four). One possible explanation for this practice is students’ lack of awareness of the “functional specialization” of different modes, namely, “the meaning-making potentials of the resources of the visual, actional and linguistic modes each perform a special and differently significant role” (Kress et al., 2014, p. 21). Students may lack the understanding, for example, that the mode of image can visualize an object compared to the verbal mode while the mode of speech can be a better choice when explaining an abstract concept. A good understanding of the constraints and affordances of various semiotic modes is important for learners as it “helps them think about what modes (or combinations of modes) to employ in their disciplinary communications, and which are best suited to most effectively achieve their communicative purposes” (Hafner & Miller, 2019, p. 159). Therefore, it is important to teach the functional specialization of various modes and facilitate students’ application of such knowledge into academic communication.

A related competence is modal configuration, namely the ability to combine multiple semiotic resources in meaning-making practice. Based on our analysis, certain students demonstrate a tendency to utilize multiple semiotic modes effectively when engaging the audience (Pattern One). However, they exhibit a reluctance to employ the same approach when explaining disciplinary content. The ethnographic data suggests that this behavior may stem from instructors explicitly emphasizing the significance of grabbing the audience’s attention at the beginning of communication. As a result, students are motivated to explore the full potential of available semiotic modes to achieve their objectives. However, the instructors did not provide equally clear instructions on how to effectively utilize semiotic resources for explaining disciplinary knowledge. A similar aspect is visual enticement, which involves utilizing visual semiotics to engage the audience. Our study reveals while some students excel in incorporating visuals to create interpersonal meaning (Pattern Two), they demonstrate less proficiency in doing so for ideational meaning. This highlights the importance of informing students about the utilization of multiple semiotic modes and the incorporation of popular visuals, both at the start and throughout the body of the videos. One effective approach is to provide students with explicit instruction and hands-on practice in leveraging different semiotic modes to communicate disciplinary knowledge. For instance, in an EAP lesson on cellular biology, the educator could have students first describe cellular structures verbally, then create labeled diagrams, and finally demonstrate mitosis through gesture. This guides learners to reflect on how each mode’s distinct affordances allow them to articulate disciplinary concepts in unique ways. By directly experiencing the strengths and limitations of verbal, visual, and actional modes, students develop the ability to strategically select and integrate semiotic resources to effectively convey their understanding.

Knowledge customization refers to the competence of tailoring knowledge to the audience’s knowledge level in knowledge dissemination. We propose attention to this competence because we noticed students’ use of technical in creating ideational meaning in knowledge dissemination videos (Pattern Three), making it challenging for the lay audience to understand the disciplinary knowledge. This practice displays learners’ lack of audience awareness and subsequently limited recontextualization practice in DMC. The observation suggests that when incorporating DMC in EAP courses, it is crucial for educators to remind learners that digital technologies afford a heterogeneous scope of audience and that it is unwise to assume a high knowledge level of the audience when addressing such a broad audience. Learners’ lack of recontextualization practice also poses a sharp contrast between learners’ recontextualization practice and experts’. In Luzon´ ’s (2019) observation of experts’ online research dissemination videos, it is found that a wide range of strategies are used to customize the knowledge to the needs of the interested public, such as non-technical representation and demonstration of concepts and verbal non-technical explanation. It is therefore necessary for educators to incorporate such strategies in the course design to enhance learners’ recontextualization ability.

The remaining two types of competence relate to learners’ ability to coordinate semiotic modes cohesively. Inter-modal alignment refers to the coherent integration among multiple semiotic modes. Our emphasis on this competence stems from the observed lack of coherence in the relationship among modes in students’ work (Pattern Five). For example, the verbal explanation does not accompany the visual representation contemptuously. Such intermodal inconsistencies suggest the lack of visual-verbal configurations in students’ DMC practice. In expert dissemination videos such as TED talk videos, verbal explanations usually complement, enhance or extend visual representations (Xia, 2023a). It is therefore necessary for educators to draw the learners’ attention to the coherence between visual and verbal mode in DMC practice. EAP educators, for example, can have students analyze exemplary multimodal compositions, such as TED Talks, to examine how verbal and visual modes coherently integrate, and then provide opportunities for students to create their own multimodal work, guiding them to deliberately craft connections between the modes. By modeling well-integrated multimodal compositions and scaffolding students’ own multimodal production, educators can develop learners’ critical capacity to align visual, verbal, and other semiotic resources to enhance disciplinary communication.

In addition, DMC-integrated EAP pedagogy should also emphasize the ability to coordinate within a specific semiotic mode, known as intra-modal concordance. This suggestion is based on the observation of a lack of coherence within a single semiotic mode such as shot sizes, placement of elements, screen orientation, background music and speaking paces in students’ work (Pattern Six). Such incoherent visual designs are likely caused by the labor division in making a video. The teamwork-based DMC project in the present study uses the model of student teams-achievement divisions (STAD, Slavin, 1995), where students are offered the opportunities to learn in and after class with a cooperative learning strategy in small groups in order to accomplish a shared learning goal, and thus inevitably involves collaborative authorship that involves students engaging, interacting, and collectively making decisions throughout the writing process to produce a jointly owned and responsible text (Storch, 2013). In traditional collaborative writing, learners collaborate to create written text for communication purposes. However, in DMC practice, team members are required to collaborate across various semiotic resources, which presents challenges in task division. Unlike expert videos where experts focus on embodied modes and professional production crews handle filmic modes (Xia, 2023a), in student-generated videos, student authors tend to divide the work based on segments, resulting in one member being responsible for all semiotic modes within that specific segment, including both embodied and filmic modes. If the team fails to establish clear guidelines on visual design and style beforehand, the collaborative authoring process may lead to visual inconsistencies. In view of this, it is necessary for educators to introduce the collaborative nature of digital composition and provide well-structured student training (Li, 2018) on topics such as collaborative multimedia writing process, individual accountability and coherence. If a team can collaborate well with guidance and support during the learning process, their language learning succeeds in receiving comprehensible input, producing “comprehensible output” (Beckett, 2006, p. 4) and creating meaningful texts with digital resources (Warschauer et al., 2000), more than the basic communicative skills.

# 7. Conclusion

The present study aims to complement the existing literature on DMC by investigating characteristics and patterns in students’ DMC performance in the English for Academic Purposes context. Focusing on a kind of DMC aiming to disseminate disciplinary knowledge to a general audience, the study reveals students’ discursive patterns in the creation of interpersonal, ideational, and textual meanings. When creating interpersonal meaning, students are found to configure a wide array of filmic and embodied modes to engage the audience and some videos appeal to the audience through popular visuals that the audience are familiar with. In making ideational meaning, namely, explaining about the disciplinary knowledge, some students tend to employ technical language accompanied by unclear visual semiotics. Others use a limited range of semiotics when making explanations. Additionally, the creation of textual meaning in the videos in question involves two kinds of incoherence – incoherence between the visual and verbal modes and one within a single mode. The study proposes a theoretical model for a DMC-integrated EAP pedagogy, which can guide educators in incorporating digital-multimodal elements into EAP courses. With this modal, six dimensions of multimodal competence identified by this research (modal configuration, visual enticement, modal discernment, knowledge customization, inter-modal alignment, and intra-modal concordance) can be developed during EAP teaching. Grounding EAP curriculum and instruction in these competencies can better equip students with the critical digital-multimodal communication skills needed for success in academic and professional contexts in the digital era.

The findings of the present study must be interpreted with caution due to the limitations. One limitation of this study relates to the size and representativeness of the research data. The sample size comprised only 21 videos, all sourced from a single university in China. Consequently, the use of digital multimodal resources in the videos are likely to be influenced by the social and cultural environment in which the learners are situated. Therefore, some characteristics identified may not be representative of students’ performance in other contexts. Besides, as the sampling consists of 21 videos, it may not be considered large-scale. However, these numbers are deemed sufficient for this initial, exploratory multimodal study. Future studies can expand the sample size and diversify the sources of data to enhance the representativeness of the findings. Including videos from multiple universities or educational institutions across different cultural and social contexts can provide a broader understanding of students’ utilization of digital multimodal resources in academic communication. In addition, conducting comparative studies across different contexts can help identify potential variations in students’ performance and shed light on the influence of social and cultural factors on their use of multimodal resources. This would require collecting data from various educational settings and considering factors such as language proficiency, ethnic and disciplinary backgrounds.
