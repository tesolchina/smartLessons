# Abstract

This paper describes the work done with first year students doing a course in English for Academic Purposes at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. It is concerned with encouraging students to develop meta-cognitive reflective skills as a means to enhancing learning and developing higher order thinking. This work emphasizes the value of promoting reflection in relation to particular and situated learning tasks. By using their own voices in their reflections, students remain grounded in their existing identities and thus more easily make the transition from their everyday language use to the academic languages required at the University. The research also suggests that reflexivity is a developable capacity—the ability to self-reflect is not separate from the process of coming to know and understand.

Optimal learning occurs once the phenomenon of learning itself has become an object of reflection.something that can be explicitly talked about and discussed and can be the object of conscious planning and analysis. (Saljo in Candy, 1991: 446)

# 1. Introduction

The importance of promoting reflective thinking in students as a route to optimal learning has become a matter of conventional wisdom among many educators.

However, we find both a lack of clarity in much of the terminology and few examples of reflection put into practice. This paper, which is based on classroom research, examines this issue in our particular situation as teachers of first year ESL students doing a ‘foundation’ course in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) in the Humanities Faculty at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg. It is based on the collaborative work of two researchers: Stella Granville, co-ordinator of the abovementioned foundation course, is responsible for matters of pedagogy, assessment and course development; Laura Dison is responsible for promoting teaching and learning in the Faculty of Humanities as a whole and her role is to advise staff members of the Faculty on issues of curriculum and pedagogy.

We argue in this paper that encouraging meta-cognitive reflection can enable the acquisition of academic social languages (Gee, 2001), encourage higher order thinking and promote more effective learning. By reflecting on classroom tasks using their own voices, students can more easily make the transition from their everyday vernacular languages to the specialist languages required by the University. We also suggest that different types of learning situations produce different orders of reflection. In one situation, where students had to reflect and comment in a very generalized way about the course materials, students produced low-level responses; in another, where students were immersed in a more engaging task, relating to a term-long research project, students produced rich and complex responses. The quality and the level of reflection changed according to the context and extent to which students were invested in a particular learning experience. In certain situations the researchers noticed that students were able to construct an accurate perception of themselves and to think strategically on how to address their difficulties.

# 2. Reflection, meta-cognition and learning

According to a number of taxonomies (Biggs, 1999; Perkins, 1992) that categorize levels of understanding in an academic discipline, the ability to think meta-cognitively is regarded as essential for undertaking higher-order tasks within the discourses and conventions of the different disciplines. Tishman, Perkins and Jay (1995: 67) contend that meta-cognition is the activity of reflecting on and evaluating one’s own thinking processes:

Not only can we engage in high-level cognitive activities like making decisions, solving problems and making plans, we can also stand back and oversee our thinking as we do these things.

Reflection becomes meta-cognitive when it involves evaluating one’s own thinking processes. According to Kitchener (1983) meta-cognitive reflection goes beyond mere information processing; it concerns awareness of the thinking and the learning; it is learning to learn, evaluate and correct the information processing. This involves asking questions about how to deepen understanding, for example, What is this about? Why do we need it? What does mean? What are the implications?, etc.

Brockbank and McGill (1998: 41) challenge the emphasis in higher education on cognition, knowledge and content. They propose an adjustment which includes a more “person-centred approach which emphasises emotion and seeks to tap the energy available there”. Personal reflection frees the student to make use of the feelings evoked by a learning situation. Gardner (1999) in his exploration of our different ‘intelligences’ also emphasizes self-reflexivity, which involves what he refers to as ‘intra-personal intelligence’—the ability to understand our own understandings and emotional responses. Bateson (1973) in Brockbank and McGill (1998: 41) describes a reflective level of learning which “involves discovering the ability to doubt the validity of previously held perceptions [by taking a] meta-view not only of the content but also of the learning process”.

According to our observations, ordinary thinking becomes ‘reflective’ when students move beyond thinking about the actual object of the learning and ask the kinds of questions mentioned above in order to deepen understanding. Students move to ‘selfreflection’ when they are aware of their own engagement and strategies that relate to the object of learning. Higher levels of reflection are more articulated, elaborated and creative—they go beyond the task itself to the wider implications of the work at hand. The challenge for us as teaching and learning specialists is to develop learning activities in the foundation course that will nurture a well-developed and accurate sense of self by giving the students the tools to control their own learning experiences (Campbell, Campbell, & Dickenson, 2004).

# 3. Foundation courses at the University of the Witwatersrand

Before the first democratic election in 1994, South African universities were race-based institutions and the University’s student population was largely white and English speaking. Foundation courses in the Faculty of Humanities at the University of the Witwatersrand were established in the mid 1990s to provide redress for students who, under apartheid, were denied access to adequate standards of education at primary and secondary schools. These courses emerged from the co-operation between subject specialists and teaching and learning specialists who were attempting to integrate language and learning skills into the content areas. They reflected the perception in the field of academic development in South African universities that “linguistic competence cannot be separated from the cognitive demands of the task.and that an explicit focus on language needed to be embedded in the teaching of mainstream courses” (Moore, Paxton, Scott, & Thesen, 1998: 11). Theorists such as Shih (1986) and Ballard and Clancy (1988) influenced the view that academic development should take place in discipline-specific situations. Starfield (1994: 18) a South African researcher, documents the change from teaching English language and study skills in isolation from the disciplines, to a model which integrates academic skills with subject content.

At present, students who do not meet the normal entry requirements of the University write a special selection test which judges them on the basis of their motivation and ability to succeed academically. If they are selected, they are placed in one of the five foundation courses. These have a duration of one year, are subject-based and focus on EAP in their respective disciplines. The students are expected to master conventional ‘Western’ academic discourses and write their assignments in fluent English. The foundation courses give additional learning support to the selected students in order to help them deal with the demands of mainstream courses. In their first year, these students do two disciplinespecific foundation courses and one mainstream course. After that, they proceed to complete the degree along with the other ‘mainstream’ students in subjects such as Sociology, Psychology, International Relations, Drama and Fine Arts. This structure is known as ‘the extended curriculum’ as these students will need an extra year to complete the degree and are given financial support.

# 4. The students

Most of the students in foundation courses arrive at university as soon as they have completed their secondary school education although a number have had a few years of work experience. Many have taken longer than others to complete the normal 12 years of schooling because of adverse social, educational and financial circumstances. Some students come from rural areas where teachers are under-qualified and where schools are under-resourced; others, usually from urban communities, have benefited from better educational circumstances.

The primary languages of the students range across all 11 of South Africa’s official languages and most have a command of two or more of the South Africa’s indigenous languages. English is a second language for all of the students on the foundation programmes and is currently the only language of instruction. The students are fluent in spoken English, but may not have the kind of language needed for developing conceptual understanding at the university level. The distinction Cummins (1996) makes between Basic Interpersonal Communicative Strategies (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) has helped us understand the challenge we face in this regard. Fluent writing is highly valued in all university courses and those students who succeed in gaining control of academic discourse are much more likely to be successful at university.

# 5. The foundation course in academic literacy

In 1994 the Department of Applied English Language Studies, in the Humanities Faculty developed a one-year foundation course. The course was initially designed to teach conventional EAP skills in order to ‘service’ the requirements of students’ other first year courses. In more recent years, like many other EAP courses, it is has become geared to equipping students to deal with the communicative skills arising from “the cognitive, social and linguistic demands of specific academic disciplines” (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002: 2).

Since the inception of this course, the course developers have engaged with debates and adapted conceptual frameworks from those described in the EAP/ESL literature emanating from the UK, USA and Australia. Our students constitute a majority population who have only recently been accorded improved better educational opportunities although there are still enormous backlogs and inequalities. This situation has provided educationists with strong imperatives to succeed in making a difference to the development of the country as a whole through improved and appropriate pedagogies. As a result, the research in the field of EAP in South Africa is very rich and much work was done in the 1980s and 1990s (Moore et al., 1998). The shape that our foundation course currently takes is an eclectic mix of a variety of theories, both local and international.

We have been influenced by a number of different strands of thought and practice in the design of our course. The well-known paper by Lea and Street (1998) refers to three approaches to learning in higher education: skills, socialization and academic literacies. These models have helped us to understand and shape thinking about EAP in South Africa. We believe that our course encapsulates elements from all three models. We have been particularly influenced by the literature which conceptualizes writing and academic discourse as connected to social practice, identities and communities of practice (Clark & Ivanic, 1997; Gee, 1990; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Lea & Street, 1998).

We refer to a selection of EAP specialists and learning theorists whose work has helped us to conceptualize and develop approaches to course design: Cottrell (2001) and Ballard and Clancy (1998) have provided useful frameworks for developing students’ academic and study skills; the work of Hamp-Lyons and Heesley (1987), Nightingale (1988), Zamel (1992, 1993) and Lea (Lea & Street, 1998; Lea & Stierer, 2000) on reading and writing has influenced our thinking and our practice; the theories of Perry (1970), Ramsden (1992), Perkins (1992) and Biggs (1999) have helped us develop approaches to promoting student learning.

Because of our history in South Africa, the department of Applied English Language Studies, has long been interested in the relationship between language and power: issues of access to powerful discourses, English as a global language, critical language awareness, are all infused into the work we do. The work of Freire (1972), Kress (1985), Fairclough (1989), Starfield (1990), Janks and Ivanic (1998), Pennycook (1996) and Benesch (2001) have all contributed directly or indirectly to our thinking and practice.

The course consists of two 6-month modules and each year approximately 250 students register for it. The students are divided into eight tutorial classes of about 30 students with a balance of male and female students as well as students studying a range of different disciplines in the humanities. Each class has its own tutor for the whole year. There are five contact hours a week and the classes meet with their own tutor for these sessions. These arrangements facilitate the ‘bonding’ of each class into a small community by the end of the year.

# 6. Module 1: introduction to academic literacy

The first module takes as its content the students’ experiences regarding their transition from school to university and is characterized by three phases. The first is an autobiographical phase. This phase attempts to affirm, as a starting point, the students’ values, histories and identities—however the imperative exists as the course proceeds, for them to locate themselves in a different space and invest in a ‘new’ language and with it a new identity (Clark & Ivanic, 1997). As they proceed through the year they must learn to ‘use their own words’, avoid plagiarism, control the formal impersonal language of academia with its embedded clauses, passive voice, etc. (Kress, 1985). When students arrive at the beginning of the academic year, they write an autobiography relating to their earlier learning experiences—their ‘pathway to university’. They read other autobiographies including material from prominent South Africans as well as those of other students. Early basic ‘skills’ are taught such as brain-storming, mindmapping and paragraphing. This phase enables students to reflect on themselves as learners, as potential university graduates, as members of their own home communities and on their impending membership of a new academic community.

The second phase leads to the writing of a comparative essay. Material is carefully scaffolded to help students learn to write comparisons. They begin by writing short pieces comparing taxis with buses and school with university. We have to work hard to help students through the comparative process—the construction of categories and subcategories, the need to compare like with like, the use of comparative markers (similarly, in contrast, however, etc.). Basic EAP-type reading and writing skills are taught in the context of particular tasks: paragraphing, topic sentences, introductions, conclusions and textual annotation.

After this preparatory work is done, students prepare for their first ‘academic’ essay in which they are required to compare the first year experiences of fellow students at Wits with those described in other studies done in Southern Africa concerning the first year in higher education (Agar, 1990; Moyo, 1995). Students are required to interview their fellow first year students and compare their findings with those described in the readings. The project is designed to enable students to enter academic discourse, while exploring issues of immediate relevance to their current situations and identities as first year students.

The third phase leads to the writing of an academic argument essay. Students are introduced to the rules of evidence, referencing, plagiarism, argument construction and other aspects of academic literacy. The topic chosen as the basis for this work is related to the immediate concerns of young South Africans: the relationship between AIDS, poverty and gender discrimination. The key EAP reading, writing, language and thinking skills taught in the first two phases are ‘recycled’ and reinforced in the teaching of the third phase.

# 7. Module 2: language and research practices

The second module, which takes place in the second half of the academic year, requires students to select a topic for a research project on multilingualism in South Africa. The course continues to develop various aspects of academic literacy ‘skills’ but focuses on aspects of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Students, working in selfselected small groups choose their own topic, formulate a research question, collect, analyse and interpret data and finally attempt to reach an understanding of the questions and issues raised by the research. This module, like the first, is grounded in an exploration of issues close to students’ understandings and experience as multilingualism is a normal part of our students’ everyday knowledge (Granville, 2002). Examples of topics chosen by students for their research projects include investigations into language attitudes to English, Zulu, Afrikaans and other South African languages; the literacy practices of street hawkers, students living in the university residences, rural women living in shacks, domestic workers; language use in specific workplace sites (e.g., factories, supermarkets, jails) and naming practices in traditional African, ‘Coloured’ and Indian communities. Many students are able to make a real ‘contribution to knowledge’ as they have access to communities and language not available to some of their monolingual, English-speaking lecturers and tutors. This work accords with Spack’s (1988: 99) argument that research projects are valuable because they “can ask students to evaluate and synthesize material from a number of sources in order to establish a perspective on a given subject or area of controversy”.

# 8. A situated learning experience

There is an assumption amongst Faculty of Humanities subject specialists that the EAP course is solely designed to do language repair work. However, we believe that the course conforms to a broader conception of academic literacy which prepares students to join the multiple activities of the academic community. We also contend that this course can be described as deeply ‘situated’ in the students’ past and current experiences. The students are immersed in the ‘new life’ of the university and the EAP course is designed to engage them in immediate concerns and also with the structural situation in which they find themselves. The course is designed to foster a ‘community of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) in which students can flourish in an environment of collaboration and support. Rogoff’s (2003) term ‘guided participation’ aptly describes the mediation process in the course which uses a varied number of approaches and pedagogies to optimize student interaction and participation.

Theories of situated learning, according to Wenger (1998: 13), “mostly address the interactive relations of people with their environment. They focus on the experience and the local construction of individual or interpersonal events such as activities and conversations”. According to Rogoff (2003) learning through participation in such activities is a key to changed understandings and perceptions.

Wenger (1998: 149) asserts that the changed understandings acquired by students’ participation in “these activities and conversations” may also give rise to shifts in students’ identities. Wenger says that “we define who we are by where we have been, and where we are going”. The changes facilitate students’ entry into the academic community through the activities in the EAP classroom. Unlike the average high school classroom where students learn, for example, ‘about’ history or mathematics, students are ‘embedded’ in the very institutional practices required by the university community. In addition, a number of structural factors in the course design such as having one course tutor, writing about and comparing the experiences of fellow first year students, the frequency of contact with tutor and classmates, all lend themselves to students’ integration. The research project in the second semester particularly encourages community building. Through the special knowledge that our students have regarding multilingual and cultural practices in South Africa, many students can make an authentic ‘contribution to knowledge’ in a research project and thus to the life of the University community.

# 9. The research process

This paper describes work in progress. It is not a completed project but is intended to be the beginning of ongoing research to improve teaching and learning in the academic literacy foundation course. The research group is a class of 35 students taught by Granville. Dison is at times a non-participant observer and at other times a participant in that she sometimes sits with groups of students engaged in class activity.

Our general research plan, rather loosely conceived at first, was to investigate our mediation strategies on the course—the materials, pedagogy, assessment and other aspects of the course. The data which follows represents selected responses from two questionnaires (Appendices A and B) administered over the course of one academic year. The first set was given to students near the end of the first module of the course. The second set is a small selection drawn from an extensive questionnaire given to the same students near to the end of the second module (the research project). The second questionnaire was intended to elicit student responses to different aspects of the research module as whole and included a range of questions, some of which required meta-level responses. The results emanating from the second set has encouraged us to pursue our work with a specific focus on meta-level questions and reflective thinking. The discussion below describes our initial responses to this work and argues for the potential value of promoting meta-reflective thinking as a valuable tool in the EAP classroom.

# 10. Responses to meta-level questions

Below are examples of some of the first questionnaire we set near to the end of the first module. We informed students that we were doing research on student learning on the course and that we would value their input. They were asked to respond to the questions at home and to hand them in together with other work.

What new insights and new learning have you experienced in the course so far? What confusions or difficulties have you had? What has interested you and not interested you so far? Give reasons. Have you learnt anything that has been useful or relevant to you in your other courses?

This exercise was a notable failure. As can be seen below, students’ voices were bland and meaningless. Their comments were flat, formulaic and unanalytic. They showed no particular engagement with important issues raised in the course or any depth of understanding or commitment to the learning process.

We learnt about comparisons—it was interesting.   
It links with what we do and what we are going to do in the future in our lectures.   
The relevance of the lectures to our course was good and well prepared.

At that stage we were puzzled as to why the responses were so unsatisfactory. Was it the lack of an immediate context for the exercise? Were the students experiencing the course as uninteresting or unstimulating? Should the questions themselves be reformulated in some way?

About 4 months later at the end of the second module, we gave students an extensive questionnaire (mentioned above). The questions were answered in class immediately on completion of their research project. As with the first questionnaire, we simply requested that students assist us by giving us their responses to the questions in as much or little detail as they wished; students were not explicitly taught how to perform reflective activities. At that stage the questions we asked were based on more specific contextualized tasks and class activities relating to the final stages of the research project that students had worked on for a whole term. The students completed the questionnaires in class. Some of the questions we asked the students were as follows:

Do you think the qualitative and quantitative methods helped you to organize your data? What could you have done better?   
How hard or easy was it for you and your group to come to a conclusion based on the findings of your research?

In contrast with the previous experience, these questions yielded interesting and surprising responses. The data provided rich insights into students’ experiences of their learning processes—what they had found to be easy and what they had found difficult.

We sorted out the responses into three groups roughly using Biggs’ (1999) SOLO taxonomy. Biggs identified five levels of understanding: ‘prestructural, unistructural, multi-structural, relational and extended abstract’. This five tier hierarchical framework of learning outcomes assumes that understanding develops gradually and becomes more structured and articulated during the course of mastering academic tasks. The highest level used by our students was ‘relational’. We found the notion of ‘relational’ to be the most useful in helping us evaluate the data. Those students who were able to see connections and relationships between the project as a whole and their conclusions were placed in this category of relatively higher order responses.

Out of the class of 27 students in Granville’s tutorial class, we identified 10 examples of what we defined as higher order. Seven students produced ‘middle order’ responses and 10 produced ‘lower order’ responses. Out of the group as a whole, 10 students reflected on the experience of working in collaborative groups. Some members of this group operated at a higher level and we were able to detect a relationship between the functioning of the group and the success of the project and their ability to form effective conclusions. These are not intended to be neat categorizations but helped us to distinguish between weaker and stronger student reflections.

# 11. Examples from the data

Student responses to the question: ‘How hard or easy was it for you and your group to come to a conclusion based on the findings of your research?’ are presented below. This question may be defined as ‘meta-level’ in that it requires students to ‘oversee their own thinking’.

Below are the responses we defined as ‘higher order’:

# Karabo

Fairly difficult because you have to come up with categories that relate to your main research question and therefore try to see whether the findings lead to your research question and aim.

# Nandipa

Fairly difficult because of the contradiction of results and we struggle to combine our findings to make a clear answer.

# Tebogo

It was easy to make conclusions because we all had similar findings, the sample of counter patterns were not making it difficult for us to come to a conclusion.

# Sophie

It was fairly difficult because the sample or number of people we interviewed wasn’t enough to make a claim for our conclusion. Who knows? If we had interviewed more than what we did we might have find a different answer.

# Siphiwe

Easy, because we collected our data effectively which I think is the first step that is taken for an effective research project without it nothing will happen. After that from the data its easy to deduce graphs which will lead to qualitative and interpretations.

# 12. Impressions from the data

In our view, this data show that these responses were more interesting and challenging than were the previous set described above. It had become apparent that the meta-level questions may in themselves have helped to promote students’ thinking, learning and the acquisition of an academic language. The responses suggested to us that this direction of study could be taken further.

The data shows students fully engaged in reflecting on the difficulties and challenges involved in their learning and understanding of one small but crucial aspect of their research projects—the formulation of conclusions.

Generally there was evidence of analytic thinking—of students making connections and starting to see the ‘big picture’ in relation to the purposes and outcomes of the research project. For example, Karabo, in the first response above, recognizes that the categories identified in his group’s findings are connected to the broad purpose of their project enabling them to reach conclusions. These responses reveal awareness of the need to make choices and selections in the process of concluding the project. Nandipa’s group struggle with contradictions; they recognize the lack of congruence and the obstacles encountered in the making of connections between their findings and their conclusions. The reflective process appears to have generated awareness and evaluative thinking.

Other observations we made are set out below:

† The responses arose out of a highly contextualized learning environment—a ‘situated’ environment. The students were able to draw meaning from their data because they were “rooted in embodied experiences” (Gee, 2001: 8). Not only had our students been deeply involved in their projects for a few months, but they were also being asked to reflect on that experience while situated or immersed in making their final conclusions. Sophie’s group can reflect backwards on the research experience and re-evaluate inadequacies in their project—in their case, the inadequate sampling process.

† Students’ ‘voices’ and personal investment are evident in these responses. This can be seen in their use of ordinary, colloquial language—what Gee (2001: 4) terms the “social language of the lifeworld where we speak and act as ‘ordinary’, ‘everyday’, ‘non-specialist’ people”. This lifeworld colloquial language can be seen in Sophie’s use of phrases such as ‘Who knows! If we had interviewed more than what we did.’ and ‘we had so many things we wanted to include’. While the spoken English of most of the students is fluent (although it includes much code switching and mixing), their written language typically includes many colloquialisms and grammatical errors. These can be seen in much of the data presented in this paper. Elbow (1991) suggests that the “best test of whether a student understands something is if she can translate it out of the discourse of the textbook and the discipline into everyday, experiential, anecdotal terms.”

† The reflective process allows students to grapple with the new ideas without demanding from them a control of academic language. They clearly struggle to use English to express the new and difficult concepts. Nandipa’s comment in Fairly difficult because of the contradiction of results and we struggle to combine our findings to make a clear answer shows a ‘willingness’ (Gee, 2001: 6) to risk using what is a rather awkward and ungrammatical sentence in order to make her point. This supports Flower’s findings in Elbow (1991: 162) that ‘everybody does better at metacognition and metadiscourse if he or she can use ordinary language’.

Over and above the struggle to use the second language, students seem to be at the beginning stages of acquiring the new ‘academic social language’ (Gee, 2001). They write about making claims (Sophie), using categories (Karabo), qualitative data (Siphiwe), samples, counter patterns (Tebogo), etc. It seemed that in our efforts to make students ‘think about their thinking’ and communicating this to us in writing through their reflections, we were facilitating or giving them permission to use their ‘lifeworld’ language as a stepping stone into the new language and discourse. This data, we believe shows students moving between two social languages. According to Gee (2001: 6);

It (the acquisition of a new social language) is tied to the learner’s willingness to trust and leave (for a time and place) the lifeworld and participate in another identity.

† What we see here are students in transition—in what could be seen as Vygotsky’s ‘Zone of Proximal Development’ (ZPD). For Vygotsky, the development to higher states of learning is not automatic and needs to be supported by a mentor or teacher. The ZPD is the distance between the actual developmental level and the potential developmental level through problem solving under adult guidance. The ZPD is described by Cottrell (2001: 18) as a potential for a ‘next stage’ of learning which can only be achieved with support. The pedagogic/research tool of reflection had become a means of mediating the combined development of higher order thinking and a specialist language. By being able to reflect using their own voices, students can remain anchored in their secure identities while they reach out towards new understandings and new identities. We now provide some examples of student responses which illustrate lower and middle order performances.

Below are the responses we defined as ‘lower order’:

# Leshego

[It was easy to come to a conclusion] because we collected enough information from our research subject[s]

# Thandi

[It was easy to come to a conclusion], it was not difficult at all, because we combined our thoughts and came to a conclusion

# Joseph

Easy—the categorization always makes thing easy

We found that most students who provided the lower order responses found it ‘easy’ to come to a conclusion; it seemed that the complexities of the research process eluded these students. The responses reflect a formulaic, generalized answer to the question and provide no insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the group process in meeting the demands of the task. The responses lacked the ‘relational’ aspect and tended to have a onedimensional quality to them. For example, the students focused on the amount of information used (Leshego) or the use of categories (Joseph). However, they do not know how to relate these to their conclusions.

Below are the responses we defined as ‘middle order’:

# Thembi

It was easy because the information we found gave us a clear and straight forward answer, so we can make a conclusion.

# Irene

It was clear what the information suggested but it is fairly difficult to make a conclusion.

# Monga

Difficult—we were supposed to meet in our free time [so] as to finish the analysing of the data. We [agreed] to look at each response given by our 80 [respondents], take out the main points and make conclusions out of it. Interpretation of the findings was always the worst part.

The above responses show some understanding of the connections between the information gathered and the conclusions reached but are one-dimensional, insufficiently elaborated and poorly articulated.

In the next section we present examples of students who reflected on how group dynamics affected the ability of the students to focus on substantive aspects of the research project itself. In the cases where the groups collaborated effectively, students were able to reflect on the issues and the connections. In other cases the groups functioned very inadequately, paralysing their thinking processes.

Examples of successful collaboration are presented below:

# Bongi

.everyone was involved and interested in the research. We had problems but we managed to overcome them because of good group work. We came up with many ideas which really helped us to be critical when coming to what [we had] to write.

# Thabo

Yes [it was difficult] because there were some of the things that as a group we thought they were important, but by conducting a research using [the] qualitative methods we discovered that people think differently.

# Zanele

Easy it was not difficult at all because we combined our thoughts and came to a conclusion.

# Judy

No difficulties because we were working [as] a close, neat bunch.

All four of the above responses express conviction and commitment to their projects and to the value of the collaborative process. Bongi’s and Thabo’s groups present more elaborated responses; both admit difficulties that were overcome but both learn from the experience. Bongi’s group values the fact that they have become ‘critical’; Thabo’s group recognizes that the evidence that was collected in the form of qualitative data enabled them to discern the range of opinions found in their data. By reflecting on and articulating the experience of working effectively in a group and on the learning itself, they make their first tentative entry as novice researchers into the new ‘community of practice’.

The following examples show failure of co-operation:

# Matakga

[Reaching a conclusion was] difficult because we did not do it in the group. The person who was [selected from the group] to do the conclusion is the one who worked it out.

# Petunia

For me it was difficult because in a group I was always having no say. Everytime my ideas were objected [to] by some of the members. And that put me to miss the project because we had different perspectives.

# Patience

Fairly difficult. It’s not easy to explain certain aspects of research especially [regarding graphs and quantitative data] to people who have no clue as to what [our] research was about.

The group work has been a negative experience for these students. Unlike the confidence and assurance expressed by the groups who worked effectively, these students feel disappointment and frustration. However, while some students may become disaffected, others may regard the failure as an added incentive to ensure success in the future. From a teacher’s point of view, awareness of negative aspects of students’ experience is of significant value; the reflective process, has exposed the interpersonal, intrapersonal and emotional aspects of the learning experience. Gardner (1999:77) asserts that “any portrait of human nature that ignores motivation and emotion proves of limited use in facilitating human learning and pedagogy.” Similarly, Brockbank and Mcgill (1998: 4) say that,

The learner is able to be critical in relation to the domains of knowledge, self and the world, where the learner is able, not only to embrace knowledge, but also to bring self, including emotion and action into the learning process.

Students’ own awareness may also help them to learn and understand more from their experience. The three respondents above, however, do realize that the failure of cooperation was linked to their failure to complete the project successfully.

This data emphasizes the importance of seeing learning not only as a cognitive, but also as a social process. It was through reflection on the individual and group tasks that students became conscious of their new and changed understandings. Hammond (2001: 10) draws attention to the way the ZPD is constructed in and through activities in which “learners and teachers jointly participate.” New ways of thinking can be constructed through students’ collaborative participation in scaffolded activities.

# 13. Reflections on the data

On reflection ourselves, we surmised that the differences between the first more generalized reflection and the second arose out of different situations and learning contexts. Each produced a different order of response. The first general reflection on the course, early in the year, was produced while the students were still new to the institution and its ways. Clearly students were at that stage still having to cope on a number of different levels, not only academic but also social, emotional and financial adjustments were still being made. The questions we asked, What was interesting? Difficult?, etc. may not have seemed relevant or meaningful. Early in the year students are confused, are not yet able to evaluate experiences while having so many different issues to deal with at once. At that stage the goals and interests of the course itself and its particular goals and interests were most likely unclear and confusing as well. Students were perhaps still embedded in their own lifeworlds and high school experiences. As outsiders they were unable to absorb and integrate their experiences sufficiently in order to evaluate their learning.

Lave and Wenger (1991: 53) contend that learning implies the construction of new identities for ‘newcomers’ attempting to enter a different ‘community of practice’.

.learning involves the whole person; it implies not only a relation to specific activities, but a relation to social communities—it implies becoming a full participant, a member, a kind of person.learning thus implies becoming a different person with respect to the possibilities enabled by these systems of relation. To ignore this aspect of learning is to overlook the fact that learning involves the construction of identities.

The second more successful intervention took place in very different circumstances and the reflective task described took place at the end of the year. The semester-long research project was self-chosen, requiring involvement and investment of time and energy. The lived experience of the shared project on multilingualism meant greater engagement with the issues and challenges involved. We believe that this experience enabled them to react and reflect more meaningfully. Even those students who failed to co-operate produced meaningful reflections even if it was only to express pain or disappointment. Such students may become disillusioned and then fail to change and become participant members of the community. Nevertheless, the fact of having made these feelings explicit could create an opening for the tutor to intervene. Others may overcome the difficulties and proceed to grow and develop after the initial failure.

# 14. Beyond skills: wider implications of this study

In the light of the above observations, it seemed that we needed further to investigate the nature of what had been done—how the meta-level questions had elicited the responses we got and what these responses were telling us about what students had understood of the concepts they had been taught and what they had misunderstood. Perkins (1992: 102) believes that the ability to think metacognitively is a developable skill. He provides a valuable set of ideas about how meta-cognition may be developed through what he terms ‘the meta-curriculum’. It does not have its own class periods but is “infused into the usual teaching of subject matters, enriching and amplifying them.” Perkins suggests that teachers should ‘create learning dispositions’ by ‘cultivating attitudes of reflective thought’. These dispositions do not happen by themselves but they can be developed by ‘building the metacurriculum’ and integrating reflective experiences into course programmes along with other forms of mediation.

According to Laurillard (1993: 18), “it is not easy to penetrate the private world of someone coming to an understanding of an idea.” Originally the questionnaire was intended to be a research tool for helping us think about the effectiveness of our mediation process. However, what was almost more interesting was the extent to which we were able to get a very small glimpse into the learning experience of our students in that particular learning context. On looking at the responses we thought that we may have partially tapped into that private world of their sense-making.

If reflection on smaller contextualized skills-based tasks is effective, then such awareness may open up the possibility that students begin to extend their conceptions beyond ‘skills’ to wider horizons of thought and understanding. While we cannot at this early stage of the project make large claims, we can speculate on the basis of these initial findings, that once the habit of reflection is refined and developed, it has the potential to build a range of more complex understandings required in academia. This is more especially urgent in EAP contexts where many non-native speakers of English need to succeed in learning their subjects through the medium of English, using ‘the right English’ (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002: 2). Meta-reflection could facilitate the transfer of ‘skills’ to other tasks and disciplines, help students develop epistemological understanding of the nature and purposes of different disciplines, facilitate the development of ‘a new social language’ and could engender critical awareness of how power relations operate within institutions (Benesch, 2001). All of these possibilities still need to be researched.

We reiterate the idea mentioned above that if students are able to reflect using their own voices, they can remain anchored in their secure identities while they reach out towards new understandings and new identities. One way of doing this is to instil in them, from the earliest learning of the most basic tasks, a habit of reflection as described above. By encouraging habits of reflection in the early stages of an academic career, we nurture the kind of learning dispositions needed to be successful at university. The reflective approach starts with the students themselves—their own cultures, knowledges and direct experiences of learning; from there they grow outwards, as they begin to make the connections they need in order to integrate their meanings with those of the classroom and the institutions of academia.
