# English as a Medium of Instruction on the Arabian Peninsula, Mark Wyatt, Glenda El Gamal (Eds.). Routledge, Abingdon, New York (2023). p. 256 pp 96.00, ISBN 9781032024936

English, for historical, economic and socio-political reasons, is the world's ingle most dominant language. Formerly the language of colonialism, English has established itelf as the unchallenged lingua franca (Crystal, 1997; Kachru, 1992) in politics, diplomacy, business and education. The dominance of English has generated widespread scholarly interest from various angles, giving rise to interrelated lines of research including English as a lingua franca, world Englishes, English for specific purposes, and English as the medium of intruction. The use of English is widely associated with modernit, progress and development, represents good taste and can afford individuals different kinds of capital. English has a particularly important place on the Arabian Peninsula, a dynamic, (super)diverse and rapidly developing region often with foreign workers (e.g. from the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia) outnumbering Arabic-speaking natives (e.g. in Qatar and the UAE). Indeed, because of (colonial) influences from Western powers, the inexorable trend of globalisation, the pursuit of a neoliberal ideology and a knowledge-based economy, and the demographic situation on the ground, English has a vital rle as the de facto ingua franca in various spheres and is widely seen in the broader region's lin. guistic landscapes (Gu & Almanna, 2023). More extremely, even what appears to be Arabic may be transliterated English disguised in the Arabic script (Gu & Almanna, 2023). Influenced variously by British colonialism, most of the middle eastern countres are outer-circle and expanding-circle countries as far as World Englishes (WE) is concerned (Kachru, 1992). Notably, there has been a tension between preserving the local Arabic linguistic and cultural identities and embracing globalisation, modernity and diversity. There is consequently increasing anxiety on the Peninsula that the all-powerful and omnipresent English is threatening and sidelining the place of Arabic.

Against such a historical and sociolinguistic backdrop, this volume edited by Mark Wyatt and Glenda El Gamal is first attempt to focus on English as aMedium of Instructio (EMI) in the Gulf region. EMI is incrasingly common in different parts of the world, which is often branded as a seling point in schoos and universitie. Focusing on the status quo, complexitie, identitie, ideologies, peda gogical isses, andthe implications ofthe practice in the rion, this volume fes reeachrs and practitioners contributions rom different perspectives. The book contains 14 well-written chapters, which are further divided into five parts. The five parts respectively cover (1) EMI policy and practice (2 stakeholder perspectives of EMI, (3) the institutional implications for EMI pedagogy, (4) EMI and teacher professional development, and (5) an epilogue. In chapter 1 by Mark Wyat, atention is focused on English's role as a medium of instruction on the Arabian Peninsula overal. This more geeric chapter sets the scene for the book, pemitting readersto understand the different chapters in a contextualied way. In Part 1 (chapters 2-5), the overarching theme i the policy and practce aspects of EMI. In chapter 2, Kay Gallagher and Wayne Jones highlight the relationship between English-medium instruction and governmental goals inthe Arab gulf. The authors specifically pellout the strategie needed to facilitate the realisation of govenmental visions for 2030 and beyond. In the UAE context, the -12 education system i in place which includes primary schols, middle or preparatory schools and secondary schools. These schools may be public and private chools and Arabic and English are used in teaching in public schools. Against such a backdrop, Glenda El Gamal's chapter (chapter 3) zooms in on the rich promise of bilingual education in the UAE, focusing specifically on the country's K-12 government schools. In chapter 4, Sara Hillman explores language policies, language attitudes and ideologies in Qatar. According to the author, English has ben taught in Qatar as a subject fr around 70 years. However, there was a sinificant expansion f EMl in the country for schools and universties in the early 200s as part of a proces of establishing a knowledge-based economy. More recently, there was n abrupt shift back to AMI (Arabic as medium of instruction). This reflects he attitudinal and ideological tensions and policy shift in the country vis-a-vis the role of English. This points towards the concern that English constitutes a genuine threat to the citizens inguisti, cultural and national identities in Qatar and also in the broader region. Exploring higher education in the UAE, Sarah Hopkyns in chapter 5 examines the country's English-medium instruction, focusing on the importance of choice and agency. Having presented the general context, the complexities and challenges of EMI, and the efects of EMI on local linguistic and cultural identities, etc., the author discusses how teachers and students in the UAE's higher education contexts can use agency to critically engage with the discourses of EMI.

Attention in Part 2 (chapter 6 and 7) is focused on EMI from the perspectives of stakeholders. Chapter 6 by Wafa Zoghbor investigates the negotiation of the Arabic and English space in the UAE, with a special focus on issues of ownership of English in English-medium instruction. Melanie van den Hoven and Muneer Al Qahtani in chapter 7take a more forward-loking approach and discuss the pathways to achieving interculturality and accomplishing Saudi Arabia's 2030 vision. Under the theme institutional implications for EMI pedagogy, part thre consists of three chapters (chapters 8-10). Part 3 opens with Marta Maria Tryzna's chapter (chapter 8). Focusing on Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, chapter 8 provides some insights into how intercultural content is embedded in EFL teaching materials in general at secondary schools. The introduction of EMI undoubtedly poses various linguisic challenges for learners. gainst such a background, also focusing on pedagogical issues, Melanie Gobert's chapter chapter 9) is highly practical and it looks at the ways in which educators can help Gulf Arab learners negotiate the lingustic challenges posed by EMI. In chapter 10, Simon Green reflect on the pertinent issue of academic literacies in EMI on the Arabian Peninsula,calling for the need to re-think about the scaffolding of academic literacies..

In Part 4 (chapters 11-13), atention i focused on EMI and teacher professional development. Martina Dickson and David Litz in chapter 11 explore how EMI might be utlised in the teaching of STEM subjects (e.science, technology, engineering and mathematics) tosupport Arabic-speaking leaners in the broader region. The teaching in STM subjects also forms the main focus in chapter 12. Curtis Bradley, Jessica Midraj and Asli Hassn in chapter 12 highlight the complex nature of leaners' needs in the Arab gulf pointing towards the necesst for STEM instructors to receive more targeted and systematic professional development in order to help better met learners' genuine learning needs. As the last chapter of part 4, chapter 13 by Christina Gitsaki and Wafa Zoghbor takes a more reflective approach. Drawing on a few useful case studies taken from an EMI institution in the UAE, the authors expand on and highlight the importance of professional laning for faculty members to guarantee more efective teaching and to help students better achieve their learning outcomes. Last but not least, Part 5 of the book is n epilogue (chapter 14 by Peter De Costa), which wraps up the volume and provides the future directions going forward.

Overall, this edited volume is clearly organised and different aspects relating to EMI have been covered. That is, the authors have not only considered the historical, political, sociolingustic and pedagogical dimensions but aso examined the practical implications of EMI in the rin, x suc an is listic caes, linstic nd idtte, coe  gy, iseso ownership, professional development support for teachers, and the scafflding of academic literacies. Benefitting from different theoretical and methodological perspectives, this eclectic volume showcases how EMI-related scholarship might be explored in an interdisciplinary way and contribute to knowledge in related areas. Also, it i commendable tha all the chapters in the book are written by experts who have extensive experience working and living in the broader region. This volume also sets a good example for other region-specific discussons relatedto I in the future e. the Far East, Southest Asia, and Africa). Despite the strong points, t sem that most chapters are about more high-profile and well-researched countries such as the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In comparison, places such as Yemen are rarely discussed, if at ll. This however is understandable, given the current situation in the war-ridden and poverty-tricken country. Also, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major watershed event, which has revolutionised and posed massive challenges to teaching and learning in many aspects. The book would have benefitte from slightly more focused discssions about the pandemic to bettr rflect the realitie of EMI-relate teaching and learning, where changes and disruptions brought about by the pandemic have been a main hallmark.

Overall, this book is a welcome addition to EMI scholarship in the Middle East and beyond. Given the interdisciplinary nature and the different perspectives presented, this book should be of interest to students and scholars working not just in EMI but also in language policy and planning, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, pedagogy, middle east studies, and multilingualism. It should equally be beneficial to language teachers at the forefront of the teaching profession.
