# ABSTRACT

This article presents the development and validation of the Pre-Service EFL Teachers’ Motivational Beliefs about Instructional Use of Technology scale (PTMB-EFL) using a randomly split sample. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a 23-item six-factor structure of the PTMB-EFL generated from exploratory factor analysis. Significant correlations between the PTMB-EFL factors and teachers’ perceived actual classroom technology use practices supported the concurrent validity of the PTMB-EFL. A second-order confirmatory factor analysis further provided empirical evidence to consider motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology as a unitary construct with six correlated but distinct motivational belief factors. In addition, unlike previous technology acceptance studies, this study revealed that among the six types of motivational beliefs, growth mindset was the strongest predictor of perceived actual classroom technology use practices. The PTMB-EFL can be used as an evaluation tool to appraise pre-service EFL or ESL teacher technology-based English teaching experience during their practicum, and as a research tool to investigate more associations between instructional use of technology and other contextual and teacher factors.

# 1.  Introduction

Teachers’ beliefs are often regarded as explanatory principles that act as a filter, guide or frame to curricular intentions, which in turn guides individual teachers and classroom practices (Kagan, 1992; Pajares, 1992). Arguably, years of research on teachers’ beliefs has not yielded a well-defined construct that is consistently defined or easily measured, and as a result teachers’ beliefs are often regarded as a messy construct. Drawing on Rokeach’s (1972) belief classification framework, a distinction was often made in subsequent research between affect-based beliefs that are intimately connected to our personal identities and reside in the central position in our belief systems, and knowledge-based beliefs that tend to be less personal and exist somewhere on the periphery (Ertmer, 2005). Nespor (1987) also argued that beliefs have a stronger affective component than a cognitive component representing knowledge because affect typically operates independently of the cognition associated with knowledge (Pajares, 1992). This suggests that affect-based beliefs are more central to other beliefs (Rokeach, 1972), and are more resistant to change (Albion & Ertmer, 2002). Being intrinsic to teachers, these aspects of teacher beliefs have been considered as teacher personal beliefs that may hinder the implementation of technology integration in classrooms (Tsai & Chai, 2012).

While technology serves as a valuable and well-functioning instructional tool, high-level technology use is still surprisingly low (Ertmer, 2005). Although the importance of technological practices has been widely emphasized in language education (Penner & Grodek, 2014), teachers’ technology adoption in real classrooms was reported to be limited and peripheral, particularly in second or foreign language contexts (Liu et  al., 2017). Some researchers suggested that the gap between the penetration of technological devices and language teachers’ limited adoption in real classrooms is attributable to teachers’ lack of knowledge regarding how to effectively integrate technology into their classrooms (Alrasheedi & Capretz, 2015; Gan et  al., 2021). However, as suggested by Rokeach (1972) and Albion and Ertmer (2002) above, even if teachers have sufficient knowledge, competence and school support, genuine classroom technology integration practices do not necessarily follow (Hong, 2010; Tsai & Chai, 2012).

In keeping with the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) (Davis et  al., 1989), an increasingly large body of teacher technology acceptance research (e.g. Huang et  al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Teo, 2010, 2011) suggested that teacher beliefs impact on their intention to use technology, which, in turn, likely impacts on their technology integration in instruction. For example, studies (Mei, 2019; Scherer et  al., 2019; Sun &Mei, 2020; Teo et  al., 2017) based on the TAM have consistently confirmed the role of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use in predicting technology use intention. Nevertheless, these studies have generally focused on teachers’ intentions to use technology rather than teachers’ actual technology practices in their classrooms as the dependent variable (Liu et  al., 2018). Another shortcoming of the previous research is that important teacher motivational belief factors such as anxiety and growth mindset have usually not been included in technology acceptance models such as TAM (Bai et  al., 2019). For example, while growth mindset has gained popularity within education research, little attention has been directed towards understanding the role of growth mindset in determining teachers’ technology use practices (Stout & Blaney, 2017). It is posited that individuals with a growth mindset are likely to embrace and seek challenges in learning (Seaton, 2018). Research into teachers adopting technology in instruction has also demonstrated that those with a growth mindset are likely to persevere when faced with challenges or adversity (e.g. Cowie & Sakui, 2014). Consequently, how different types of motivational beliefs may function in the same context to influence teacher classroom technology integration remains unanswered. Given the strength of motivational beliefs that they tend to be intrinsic to teachers as discussed above, and may enable teachers to sustain their implementation of technology integration in classrooms after some failures or in the face of challenges, there is an imperative need to systematically explore the influence of motivational beliefs on classroom technological practices (Bai et  al., 2019; Lai et  al., 2018; Liaw & Huang, 2013).

In the area of language education, understanding pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about technology integration in teaching is particularly important as knowledge of these pre-service teachers’ beliefs about technology in language teaching and learning can assist educators in designing and implementing pedagogic interventions that aim at developing future teachers’ skills in incorporating technology in the language classroom. Given a lack of measurement instrument that can be used to systematically assess pre-service teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology, an important step in initiating more research on teacher technology adoption should be creation of a theoretically supported and empirically evaluated measurement instrument of motivational beliefs in technology integration in language teachers. Consequently, this paper aims to describe the development and validation of the Pre-Service EFL Teachers’ Motivational Beliefs about Instructional Use of Technology scale (PTMB-EFL) which was designed to assess what motivates pre-service EFL teachers’ technological use practices in the classroom during their practicum. We believe that the knowledge derived from this investigation will inform the design of educational interventions that are intended to incorporate technology-enhanced teacher training into university teacher preparation programs.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Theoretical framework

Established frameworks used to identify teachers’ motivational beliefs regarding technology use include the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)

and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) (Ajzen, 1991; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). The TPB which is widely acclaimed for predicting and explaining individual behavioral intentions and practices is concerned with three key notions, i.e. attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (Ajzen, 1991). Within this TPB theoretical framework, attitude towards the behavior refers to an individual’s personal orientation towards performing a given behavior, and the evaluations of the outcomes of performing the behavior. Subjective norm is defined as perceived social pressure to perform a given behavior. Finally, perceived behavioral control is regarded as an individual’s perception of the ability of and control over performing the behavior in question. A number of empirical studies and technology acceptance models (e.g. TAM, Davis et  al., 1989 and UTAUT, Venkatesh et  al., 2003) have adopted the TPB as a theoretical structure to investigate factors that impact language teachers’ and students’ intention to use technology in teaching and learning (e.g. Bai et  al., 2019; Liu et  al., 2018; Mei, 2019; Sun & Mei, 2020; Teo et  al., 2017). For example, Liu et  al. (2018) found that constructivist-oriented pedagogical beliefs significantly impacted teachers’ attitudes towards technology adoption, although they did not explore why teachers with differing pedagogical beliefs perceived technology use differently and to different degrees.

In educational research, the EVT is considered to be an important theoretical lens to examine and understand individuals’ beliefs about their competence in a given domain, representing a broader area than a specific task (Østerlie et  al., 2019). From the EVT perspective, people’s expectancies for success and their subjective values are assumed to influence directly their educational and behavioral choices (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). Expectancy concerns learners’ specific beliefs about how well they will accomplish an academic task (self-efficacy). Values concern the incentives or reasons for doing a particular activity and include three components: attainment value (importance), intrinsic value (interest), utility value (usefulness), and cost (negative psychological experiences such as anxiety). Research studies examining individuals’ educational and behavioral choices from the perspective of EVT have provided empirical support for the theory (e.g. Wu et  al., 2020).

As discussed above, while the TPB considers attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived ability to control the implementation of a behavior as antecedents of learners’ intentions and behaviors (Ajzen, 1991), the EVT includes expectancies and task values as precursors for investing effort into learning (Dietrich et  al., 2017). As teacher integration of technology in instruction is a volitional behaviour over which teachers have control, EVT and TPB each appear an appropriate theoretical framework to investigate its predictors. Clearly, both theories serve as a useful lens to explain peoples’ behaviours around a phenomenon. They can thus be drawn together to analyze teacher motivational beliefs about application of technology in instruction. In addition to EVT and TPB, Dweck and her colleagues argued that people embrace different mindsets about their intelligence that may serve as a framework for interpreting human actions (e.g. Dweck, 2012; Dweck & Yeager, 2019; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). In their view, people who endorse a fixed mindset tend to believe that their level of ability or competence is immutable. In contrast, people with a growth mindset tend to believe that ability or competence can be developed through sustained practice and effective strategies, and are therefore more likely to learn new things. Consequently, in the current study, based on the theoretical perspectives discussed above, the following factors are theorized to have a motivational effect on foreign language teachers’ instructional use of technology in the classroom.

# 2.1.1.  Subjective norms

Teachers’ beliefs about social norms, that is, what is perceived as socially acceptable, can influence their decision to undertake an action, according to Ajzen (1991). Research on teachers’ beliefs that is based on the TPB, which seeks to understand and measure the influence subjective norms have on teachers’ use of technology, has yielded mixed results. Liu et  al. (2018) research reported subjective norms as a significant predictor of individuals’ intention to use technology. In contrast, Salleh (2016) found that subjective norms had a weak influence on intention. Another study on digital literacy integration, which was underscored by TPB, found that normative beliefs, i.e. expectations by the schools’ administrators, had a great influence on teachers’ intention to integrate digital technologies (Sadaf $\&$ Johnson, 2017). The three aforementioned studies took place in different cultural contexts and this may be an aspect of the findings to consider in further research studies.

# 2.1.2.  Perceived usefulness

The notion that the perceived usefulness of technology is a factor that may influence its uptake and adoption has been the basis for numerous studies of teachers and their digital technology practices (Barrette, 2015; Ma et  al., 2005; Yuen & Ma, 2002). Recent findings from a study on pre-service foreign language teachers found that perceived usefulness, that is, the belief about the degree to which technology will enhance one’s performance (Sun & Mei, 2020), had a strong, positive effect. Perceived usefulness is seen as a factor that has a direct influence on teachers’ intentions to use technology (Baydas & Goktas, 2017). However, recent studies point to a need to distinguish the technologies and contexts in which those technologies are used (Sánchez‐Prieto et  al., 2019). With mobile technologies commonplace, pre-service teachers may be skilled in using mobile computers for daily activities but lack understanding of how to apply mobile computers to educational environments (e.g. Liu et  al., 2017; Li & Walsh, 2011; Mei, 2019).

# 2.1.3.  Technology self-efficacy

Research on language teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs has been recognized as especially important as foreign language teachers may be measured against native norms, such as native speakers’ pronunciation or fluency (Kissau & Algozzine, 2015; Wu et  al., 2012; Wyatt, 2018). Teachers’ self-efficacy, that is teachers’ beliefs in their ability to complete courses of actions related to their professional activities, can influence academic outcomes (Barni et  al., 2019). The strength of teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs has been shown to predict instructional quality (Berg & Smith, 2016; Burić & Kim, 2020). One aspect particular to language teachers, which is corroborated in studies of foreign language teachers, is a correlation between English language proficiency and teacher efficacy (Ghasemboland & Hashim, 2013). Another aspect to consider, which relates to teachers’ self-efficacy towards technology, is knowledge of using technology and opportunities to learn about teaching applications with technology (Kwon et  al., 2019). Developing positive teacher self-efficacy beliefs during the education of formative, pre-service teachers is an optimal time to instill in beliefs on how to best support learning (Berg & Smith, 2016). Studies have indicated that high self-efficacy and intentions will lead pre-service teachers to more use of technology if external factors or barriers are removed (Han et al., 2017).

# 2.1.4.  Interest

Foreign language teachers’ interest in technology- or internet-based communication activities has been shown to relate to aspects of their teaching practices (Bråten & Strømsø, 2006; Peiser & Jones, 2013). In a study of teachers that was not domain specific, factors such as interest in using computers were shown to be one that correlated with teachers’ technology integration practices (ChanLin, 2005). In a similar study by Teo (2011), one explanation for why peers’ expectations did not significantly influence teachers’ intentions to use technology was that teachers’ personal interest was a more significant factor. Still, evidence suggests that pre-service teachers need help in developing a greater interest and deeper understanding of utility values of technologies for future practices if interest in integrating technologies for learning activities is to be sustained (Kale & Akcaoglu, 2018).

# 2.1.5.  Importance

In expectancy-value theory, the importance of doing well on a given task is labelled as attainment value. According to this theory, people’s beliefs concerning the degree to which they believe that a task is important have direct influence on achievement choices, effort and persistence (Liem et  al., 2008). For example, if a teacher thinks that scaffolding feedback constitutes good teaching, and that an important component of his or her teacher identity is that he or she desires to be a good teacher, then he or she will believe it important to implement scaffolding feedback to confirm important aspects of him or herself (Boström & Palm, 2020). It is recognized in research that when students perceive a subject as being of importance in relation to their future goals, the students are not only willing to study hard to master and develop competence in the subject, but also likely to outperform their peers on the subject (Greene et  al., 2004).

It should be noted that while importance and usefulness are considered to be essential reasons for students to engage in a task, previous research suggests that importance and usefulness can be considered a merged construct because students may perceive a learning task to be both important and useful for their future goals, which means that these two value factors are not separable as two different constructs. The body of literature has also documented combination of these two types of values into one construct (e.g. Jacobs et  al., 2002; Pintrich et  al., 1993; Teng et  al., 2018).

# 2.1.6.  Anxiety

Anxiety is an unpleasant emotion which tends to occur in an individual in a situation in which the individual has a low capability to control the situation (Frenzel et  al., 2016). In studies of teachers, anxiety has been considered an emotional cost that has a negative relationship to one’s intention to complete an action (Ranellucci et  al., 2020). As such, negative experiences with technology can manifest in individuals as anxiety, which has been captured in terms such as computer anxiety, computerphobic, ICT anxiety, technostress, and more commonly as technology anxiety (Farjon et  al., 2019; Mac Callum et  al., 2014; Saadé & Kira, 2007; Tacy, 2016), and may contribute to educators resisting technology enhanced pedagogies and practices (Johnson et  al., 2012). For instance, an individual may experience strong feelings of anxiety when they believe that they will be unable to successfully complete an activity which makes use of technology (Park & Son, 2020). In a study of 200 pre-service language, mathematics and science teachers, Aslan and Zhu (2016) found that computer anxiety and perceived ICT competence and other variables significantly predicted the teachers’ integration of ICT into their teaching practices. Mac Callum et  al. (2014) noted that feelings of anxiety among teachers using mobile technologies have been associated with decreased usage of technological resources. Most recently, Bai et  al. (2019) study of English as a second language (ESL) teachers’ ICT adoption showed that anxiety had both direct and indirect effect on ESL teachers’ continuance intention to use technology in teaching.

# 2.1.7.  Growth mindset

The construct of growth mindset emerged from research that started with the conceptualisation of implicit beliefs about intelligence as either entity beliefs, or incremental beliefs that are recently referred to as the growth mindset. Existent research on growth mindset has largely focused on student mindsets as they are related to academic achievement (Seaton, 2018). For example, one line of research has investigated relations between implicit beliefs and other motivation constructs, and suggests that implicit beliefs tend to be related in predictable ways to self-regulation and academic achievement. Another line of research focused on interventions aimed at changing students’ mindsets and perspectives on learning with positive results (e.g. Blackwell et  al., 2007).

As an individual’s mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges confronting their work, it is therefore posited that differing mindsets that teachers possess about themselves play a significant role in determining their own expectations and teaching practices (Dweck, 2012; Seaton, 2017). Frondozo et  al. (2020) thus argue that although past studies on growth mindset focus primarily on students, a study of teachers’ mindsets can indicate and predict teachers’ engagement in their work. As such, one aspect of teachers’ beliefs that may relate to their adoption of technology might be related to the degree to which they hold a growth mindset, that is, the degree to which one believes that they can acquire a given skill or ability in use of technology provided they make an adequate effort (Dweck, 2012). Within the limited empirical research on growth mindset focusing on teachers, it has been noted that middle school teachers face challenges in adopting technology-enhanced pedagogy particularly when a new mindset is required (Cowie & Sakui, 2014; Nariman & Chrispeels, 2015). Most recently, Bai et  al. (2019) noted that growth mindset predicted the teachers’ learning of ICT use and indirectly predicted technology continuance intention.

# 3.  Research questions

Drawing on the TPB and EVT, the current study was aimed at developing and evaluating a questionnaire that was designed to capture the dimensions of the pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology during their practicum. A secondary purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which different types of motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology predict pre-service EFL teachers’ perceived actual classroom technology use practices. Specifically, this study addressed the following two research questions:

1. Does the pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology scale (PTMB-EFL) developed in this study demonstrate an appropriate level of reliability and validity?   
2. How do different types of motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology contribute to pre-service EFL teachers’ perceived actual classroom technology use practices?

# 4.  Method

# 4.1.  Participants and context

Two-hundred and twenty-seven pre-service teachers enrolled in an English language education program at two teacher-training universities in southern China participated in the present study. At the time of this study, the participants were in the midst of a teaching practicum in local secondary schools. The sample consisted of 29 male $( 1 2 . 8 \% )$ and 198 female $( 8 7 . 2 \% )$ pre-service EFL teachers in the final year of their studies. The average age of the participants ranged from 20 to 24 years old with $M _ { \mathrm { a g e } } = 2 1 . 7 8$ years, $S D _ { \mathrm { a g e } } = . 7 7$ .

This study is part of a large research project concerning both in-service and pre-service EFL teachers’ technology use experience in the English classroom. The study reported in this paper focuses on determining what motivates pre-service teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology during their practicum. It is thus worth giving a brief description of the nature of the one-semester component of the BEd English Education program the participants were attending. The teaching practicum is intended to engage the pre-service teachers in actual teaching practice, where they have the opportunity to carry out independent teaching in the assigned classes (Gan, 2014; Gan et  al., 2018). The participants in the present study carried out their practicum in the first semester of their fourth year in the program. They were assigned to different local secondary or primary schools to take up the role and responsibilities of an EFL teacher under the guidance of a supporting school teacher and were supervised by a staff member of the BEd program.

# 4.2.  Instruments

# 4.2.1.  Pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology scale (PTMB-EFL)

Based on the TPB and EVT and TAM/UTAUT that have been discussed in a preceding section, we developed PTMB-EFL containing seven subscales, i.e. (1) Technology self-efficacy; (2) Perceived importance; (3) Perceived usefulness; (4) Interest; (5) Anxiety; (6) Subjective norms; (7) Growth mindset. The PTMB-EFL scale items were adapted from existent instruments in the literature to fit the specific context of EFL teaching (e.g. Bai et  al., 2019; Braak et  al., 2004; Lai, 2013; Teo, 2011). The items were scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me). Initially, a pool of 30 items generated from the literature was subjected to judgment of two experienced scholars in technology-assisted language instruction to examine the face and content validity of the items generated. This process of experienced scholar evaluation resulted in elimination of a number of items that were deemed inappropriate for measuring pre-service EFL teacher motivational beliefs about technology use in the Chinese school context. As a result of this validation process, four items were excluded due to low face validity or irrelevance to the pre-service EFL teacher population. In addition, a few items that included ambiguous content were revised to improve clarity. Finally, a total of 26 items were retained, and the updated PTMB-EFL was evaluated with a total of 227 pre-service EFL teachers.

# 4.2.2.  Classroom technology use practices questionnaire (CTUPQ)

In this study, the correlations of the pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology with their perceived actual classroom technology use practices were examined to evaluate the concurrent validity of the PTMB-EFL. The eight items in the CTUPQ were adapted from existent teacher technology behavior questionnaires in the literature (e.g. Braak, 2001; Lai, 2015) to suit the foreign language classroom circumstances. These items were also scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all true of me) to 7 (very true of me). Confirmatory factory analysis confirmed that these eight CTUPQ items belonged to a single factor of perceived actual classroom technology use practices (Cronbach’s alpha is .95).

# 4.3.  Procedure

We contacted some English course instructors about their willingness to include their students in this survey. Interested instructors were then invited to help distribute the online survey weblink to their students by any mechanism (e.g. email or any other social media) that they normally used to contact their students (Kuo et  al., 2014). All participants were informed that their participation in this study was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time. Participants completed the online survey without a time limit.

# 4.4.  Data analyses

We randomly divided the total sample into two halves with one half being used for exploratory factor analysis (EFA; $n = 1 1 0 .$ ) and the other half for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; $n = 1 1 7 \ .$ ) (Wang $\&$ Gan, 2021) . Also like Wang and Gan (2021), we performed EFA by using principal c o m p o n e n t a n a l y s i s a n d P r o m a x r o t a t i o n ; K a i s e r ’s eigenvalues-greater-than-one criterion (Kaiser, 1960) and the scree plot (Raubenheimer, 2004) were adopted to determine the number of factors. Following DeVellis (2003) and Krishnan (2011), we excluded items showing loadings less than 0.4 and/or cross-loading on two or more factors with loadings of 0.4 or greater. In line with previous research (e.g. Bandalos & Finney, 2018; Wang & Gan, 2021), factors with fewer than three items were also excluded in the current study.

We then conducted CFA by using AMOS 24.0 with the other half sample to confirm the factor structure derived from EFA. In light of Tabachnick et  al. (2007) and Hu and Bentler (1999), we used the following criteria to assess the model fit: chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio $( \boldsymbol { x ^ { 2 } } / d f$ , a value less than 2 is considered to be good); the Comparative Fit Index (CFI, a value greater than .90 is considered to be good), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI, a value greater than .90 is considered to be good), the Root Mean Square Error of the Approximation (RMSEA, a value less than .06 is considered to be good), and the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR, a value less than .08 is considered to be good) (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Wang & Gan, 2021).

Next, we assessed convergent validity of the PTMB-EFL by means of standard factor loading, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE) (Hair et  al., 2010). We further assessed the discriminant validity of the PTMB-EFL through using Heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlations (Henseler et  al., 2015) to evaluate how a particular construct’s items may differ from their indicators (Sekaran & Rani, 2010; Wang & Gan, 2021).

A second-order CFA was then conducted to test whether the PTMB-EFL factors belonged to a single broader latent factor of motivational beliefs in technology use. We also conducted Pearson correlation analyses to examine correlations of the PTMB-EFL factors with actual classroom technology use practices for assessing concurrent validity of the PTMB-EFL. Finally, regression analyses were conducted to examine which type of motivational beliefs has the most predictive power for actual classroom technology use practices.

# 5.  Results

We developed and validated the PTMB-EFL by means of a three-step approach: (1) EFA was carried out on one half of the data to identify the factor structure of PTMB-EFL; (2) the factorial structure was cross-validated on the other half of the data through CFA; (3) correlation analyses as well as regression were performed using the whole sample to provide additional validity evidence including concurrent validity

# 5.1.  Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)

Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity showed a significant chi-square value of 2230.85 $( p \textless . 0 0 1 )$ , and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test showed a value of .93, exceeding the threshold value of .50. These results suggest that the sample was appropriate for EFA. The underlying factor structure of the 26-item PTMB-EFL was examined by EFA using the principal component extraction method. Three items were excluded due to their low factor loadings or cross-loadings, and a six-factor model with 23 items was obtained, accounting for $8 1 . 1 7 \%$ of the total variance. From the items within each of the six factors, we labeled them as Interest, Anxiety, Technology self-efficacy, Growth mindset, Importance and usefulness, and Subjective norms. The Cronbach’s alphas of these six PTMB-EFL factors are: .93 for Interest, .91 for Anxiety, .92 for Technology self-efficacy, .88 for Growth mindset, .92 for Importance and usefulness, and .86 for Subjective norms, which suggested good internal reliability of each scale (Table 1).

# 5.2.  Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)

To cross-validate the 23-item six-factor structure of the PTMB-EFL generated from EFA, we performed CFA by using the remaining half sample ${ \mathrm { ' } n = 1 1 7 \mathrm { ) } }$ ), and the results indicated satisfying model fit with $x ^ { 2 } / d f = 1 . 9 0$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 3 $ , $\mathrm { T L I } = . 9 1 $ , $\operatorname { S R M R } = . 0 5$ . As can be seen in Figure  1, all standardized factor loadings were strong (ranging from .66 to .95) and significant at $p < . 0 0 1$ level. Cronbach’s alphas of the subscales ranged from .86 to .93, and Cronbach’s alpha of the scale was .96 (Table 2).

# 5.3.  Convergent and discriminant validity

In this study, we assessed the convergent validity of the PTMB-EFL using three methods, namely, standard factor loadings, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE) (Wang & Gan, 2021). As shown in Figure 1, the standard factor loadings were all higher than 0.5 indicating strong factor loadings. As shown in Table 2, the CR for the six PTMB-EFL factors were .93, .92, .94, .90, .94, and .88 respectively; the AVE values for the factors were .78, .82, .82, .78, .69, and .60 respectively. Both CR and AVE were almost all higher than .60, indicating adequate convergent validity of the PTMB-EFL.

In the case of discriminant validity, HTMT ratio of correlations (values $< . 8 5$ indicating the good validity, Henseler et  al., 2015) was used to assess discriminant validity of the PTMB-EFL. As shown in Table 2, except for the pairs ‘Interest-Importance and usefulness’ and ‘Growth mindset-Subjective norms’, which slightly exceed .85, all other values range from .20 to .81, demonstrating acceptable discriminant validity.

# 5.4.  A second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)

In order to assess whether the six PTMB-EFL factors belonged to a single broader latent factor of motivational beliefs in technology use, we conducted a second-order CFA (Figure 2) on the data. The results suggested a good model fit: $x ^ { 2 } / d f = 1 . 9 9$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = . 9 2 $ , $\mathrm { T L I } = . 9 0$ , SRMR $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ .068. The standardized regression weights between the second-order factor and the six first-order factors were .92, −.32, .72, .89, .88, .87 respectively, and were all statistically significant at the alpha level of .001. The second-order CFA thus provided empirical evidence to consider motivational beliefs in technology use as a unitary construct with six correlated but distinct motivational belief factors.

# 5.5.  Concurrent validity

As shown in Table 3, five PTMB-EFL factors were significantly and positively correlated with classroom technology use practices ( $\dot { \boldsymbol { r } }$ ranged from .66 to .82, $p \ < \ . 0 1 \rangle$ . The remaining PTMB-EFL factor, Anxiety, was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with classroom technology use practices $\mathbf { \vec { r } } = - . 3 0$ , $p < . 0 1 )$ . All these correlations supported the concurrent validity of the PTMB-EFL.

# 5.6.  The role of motivational beliefs in predicting actual classroom technology use

Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relative strength of different types of teacher motivational beliefs in predicting pre-service EFL teachers’ actual classroom technology use practices. As can be seen in Table 4, Model 1 A, Model 1B, Model 1 C, Model 1 D, Model 1E, and Model 1 F show that all the six types of motivational beliefs were significant predictors of technology use practices. Technology self-efficacy ( $\mathrm { ~ B ~ } = \mathrm { ~ } . 6 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ : = \ : . 4 4 )$ , importance and usefulness $\mathrm { \Delta \cdot \beta = \ . 7 8 }$ , $\textit { p } <$ .001, $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = . 6 0 $ , interest $\mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } .$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = . 5 1 \mathrm { \dot { 2 } }$ , subjective norms $\mathrm { ( \beta = . 7 8 }$ , $p \textless . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = . 6 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , and growth mindset $( \beta = . 8 2$ , $p \ : < \ : . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ = \ . 6 8 )$ all positively predicted technology use practices, whereas anxiety $( \beta = - . 3 0$ , $p \ : < \ : . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ : = \ : . 0 9 $ negatively predicted technology use practices. However, when all the six motivational beliefs entered the equation simultaneously, the result showed that only technology self-efficacy ( $\{ \beta \ : = \ : . 1 7$ , $p ~ < ~ . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ = \ . 7 8 $ ), importance and usefulness $( \beta \ : = \ : . 2 8 , \ : p \ : < \ : . 0 0 1 , \ : \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } \ : = \ : . 7 8 $ ), subjective norms $( \beta ^ { } = . 2 9 , \ p < . 0 0 1 , \ \mathrm { R } ^ { 2 }$ $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \nabla } . 7 8 )$ , and growth mindset $\mathrm { ~ \AA ~ } . \mathrm { ~ \beta ~ } = \mathrm { ~ . ~ } 3 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { R } ^ { 2 } = \mathrm { } . 7 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), significantly predicted actual classroom technology use practices, with growth mindset being the most powerful predictor (see model 2 in Table 4).

# 6.  Discussion

This study described the development and validation of a scale for measuring pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about technology integration in teaching, and examined the extent to which different types of motivational beliefs predict teachers’ perceived actual classroom technological practices. In the following, we summarize and interpret the findings, address some limitations and offer directions for future research.

The study provided empirical evidence for the PTMB-EFL’s reliability and validity. The uniqueness of this scale is that its development builds on a synthesis of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1991) and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT, Wigfield & Eccles, 2000), the technology acceptance model (TAM, Davis et  al., 1989)), and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT, Venkatesh et  al., 2003). Meanwhile, the CFA results rendered empirical support to the determination of a six-factor structure of the PTMB-EFL: Interest, Anxiety, Technology self-efficacy, Growth mindset, Importance and usefulness, and Subjective norms. The 23 PTMB-EFL items loaded significantly on their relevant sub-scales (Wang & Gan, 2021), and these sub-scales all loaded significantly on a common factor as a single underlying construct, confirming that PTMB-EFL is multidimensional, consisting of the different six subscales. The results of this study thus point to the good internal construct validity of the PTMB-EFL among pre-service EFL teachers, and enable us to conclude that PTMB-EFL is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology.

Of the six PTMB-EFL factors elicited in this study, Interest plays the largest role in characterizing pre-service EFL teacher motivational beliefs in technology use in this study. Interest accounts for $5 2 . 5 1 3 \%$ of the variance explained by the six PTMB-EFL factors altogether. This finding supports the importance of intrinsically-oriented constructs in clarifying the nature of teacher technology use beliefs suggested in the EVT theory (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). In this study, example items used to measure this factor include $^ { \mathfrak { c } } I$ enjoy using technology in the classroom’; ‘I am interested in using technology in the classroom’. In some technology acceptance studies, interest in technology use was categorized as hedonic motivation that was found to be a strong predictor of intention to use technology for language learning among university students (e.g. Lai et  al., 2016). Interest was also noted to have a significant direct and positive effect on teacher continuance intention to use ICT in teaching after attending a teacher professional development program (Bai et  al., 2019). Results of this study suggested that the sampled pre-service EFL teachers displayed a generally high level of interest in technology use in the classroom. These results are encouraging as the extent to which technology is perceived as making classes more enjoyable and interesting is essential to teachers’ intention to integrate technology in teaching.

The second strongest factor that characterizes pre-service EFL teacher motivational beliefs associated with technology use is Anxiety, accounting for $6 . 8 3 9 \%$ of the variance explained by the six PTMB-EFL factors altogether. Anxiety is related to unpleasant experience (Celik & Yesilyurt, 2013), such as ‘Using technology in the classroom makes me feel anxious’; ‘Using technology in the classroom makes me feel uncomfortable’. The emergence of anxiety as the second strongest factor in this study further provides empirical evidence for the importance of the affective component of teacher beliefs that operates independently of the cognition associated with knowledge (Nespor, 1987; Pajares, 1992), echoing Bai et  al. (2019) confirmation of anxiety displaying negative influence on teacher adoption of technology. The existence of this factor also suggests that for some pre-service EFL teachers in the current study, technology might be felt to be somewhat challenging, given that technology integration in instruction is, by its nature, a personal endeavour that requires volitional effort and commitment (Albion & Ertmer, 2002; Rokeach, 1972). This result is consistent with Liu et  al.’s study (2018) in which Chinese language teachers enrolled in a university certification program in the Midwestern United States were found to perceive technology adoption as a challenge technically and pedagogically.

Compared to Interest and Anxiety, contributions of the remaining four factors (i.e. Technology self-efficacy, Growth mindset, Importance and usefulness, Subjective norms) to the pre-service EFL teacher motivational beliefs associated with technology use in the classroom are relatively smaller. Nevertheless, all six motivational dimensions constitute important constructs in explaining what motivated these pre-service teachers to adopt technology in teaching, and the importance of these motivational dimensions has been emphasized not only in recent teacher technology adoption intention studies (e.g. Bai et  al., 2019, Liu et  al., 2017) but also in earlier studies of learner technology acceptance (e.g. Lai et  al., 2016; Teo, 2011).

With respect to the concurrent validity, five of the six PTMB-EFL factors were found to be significantly and positively related to the reported actual classroom technology use practices. Growth mindset was most associated with classroom technology use practices, followed by Subjective norms, Importance and usefulness, interest, and technology self-efficacy. Anxiety was negatively related to classroom technology use practices. These results are in line with previous studies that suggest that when the pre-service EFL teachers believe ability is incremental, or when they perceive their own technology use behavior to be highly affected by their important referents, they are likely to integrate technology in the instructional process. Similarly, when the pre-service EFL teachers perceived technology as useful, important and enjoyable in relation to their teaching, or when they think they are capable of performing a teaching task by using technology, they are more likely to engage with information and communication technology for teaching. These results can be interpreted with reference to the EVT (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and TPB framework (Ajzen, 1991) which suggest that those with favourable attitudes, positive subjective norms, and high levels of perceived behavioural control (e.g. self-efficacy) will be more likely to exhibit an intention to perform a particular behavior.

The second research question of this study concerns the extent to which different types of motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology predict pre-service EFL teachers’ actual classroom technology use practices. Regression analyses showed that among the six types of motivational beliefs, growth mindset was the strongest predictor of teacher actual classroom technology use practices. Consistent with the implicit theory of intelligence (Blackwell et  al., 2007; Yeager & Dweck, 2012), this finding suggests that pre-service EFL teachers who believed that they could improve technology integration ability through sustained efforts were more likely to integrate technological resources in instruction. Although growth mindset has been rarely examined as a motivational belief variable in previous teacher technology use intention studies, our finding echoes Bai et  al. (2019) in which growth mindset had a direct influence on teachers’ learning of ICT use. In the present study, the result that growth mindset emerged as the strongest predictor could be attributable to the fact that the study participants were learning to teach during practicum as young novice pre-service EFL teachers, and were thus relatively more likely to hold the belief that capacities are not fixed but can be developed over time (Dweck & Yeager, 2019) in comparison with in-service teachers.

Regression analyses also showed that subjective norms, importance and usefulness, and technology self-efficacy significantly predicted student teachers’ perceived classroom technology use practices. These results confirmed the role of subjective norms, perceived usefulness, positive attitudes towards technology integration, and technology self-efficacy as significant predictors of teachers’ intention to use technology in the literature (Liu et  al., 2018, 2017; Scherer et  al., 2019; Sun & Mei, 2020). These findings also confirmed that TAM and UTAUT can be effectively used to investigate EFL student teachers’ motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology in the teaching practicum context.

Contrary to some previous teacher technology use intention studies (e.g. Bai et  al., 2019), interest did not predict actual classroom technology use practices in this study. However, this lack of predictive effect of interest is consistent with Teo et  al. (2017) who found that teachers’ fondness of technology did not significantly predict their intention to use technology. One possible reason for the lack of a predictive effect of interest in the present study is the controlling of shared variance with the other variables, such as growth mindset, subjective norms, importance and usefulness, and technology self-efficacy. As can be seen in Table 3, correlation analysis showed that interest and classroom technology use practices were relatively highly associated $\mathbf { \Phi } ( \mathbf { r } \ = \ . 7 1 )$ . When interest and the other motivational belief factors entered into the equation together, the correlation decreased. Another possibility for lack a predictive effect of interest is that the teacher classroom technology use practices operationalized in this study require teachers to be pedagogically innovative in integrating technology use into the teaching of the subject content. This may constitute a great challenge to those teachers who are only interested in knowing how to operate hardware or software but lack a growth mindset for designing instructional tasks that relate technology effectively to the academic content of what is going to be taught in class.

# 7.  Conclusion

While the pivotal role of technology use has been emphasized in language education, prior research has largely examined technology use in teaching and learning from the students’ perspective. Given a lack of a systematic investigation of motivational beliefs about instructional use of technology in pre-service EFL teachers during practicum in the literature, this study has made a theoretical contribution by conceptualizing pre-service EFL teachers’ motivational beliefs in relation to technology use as having six discrete dimensions and by empirically testing this theoretical assumption. Of these six types of motivational beliefs, growth mindset stood out as the most significant predictor of teacher classroom technology use. This result points to promise of potential interventions for generating an incremental view of ability to learn new things in teachers and for optimizing pre-service EFL teacher motivation for technology integration. By using the PTMB-EFL as a useful tool to assess pre-service teachers’ motivation for technology integration into instruction, educators can gain insights into pre-service teachers’ patterns of motivational beliefs, which, in turn, allow them to map out guidance for adequately modelling appropriate technology integration in teacher preparation courses. Secondly, while prior research focused on teachers’ attitudes towards and intentions in technology use in general, the present study adds to the limited research linking motivational beliefs about technology use and pre-service EFL teachers’ perceived actual classroom technology use practices in the practicum.

While this study contributes to a better understanding of pre-service EFL teachers’ use of technology, two limitations of this study necessitate mention and should be considered in future research studies. First, although the current study solicited six types of motivational beliefs associated with teacher technology adoption, there might be some other motivational variables that were not included. Further endeavor for continued and fine-grained inclusion of other motivational factors is needed to improve the PTMB-EFL. Second, as is usually the case with other studies in the literature, the participants in our study were recruited from only two universities in China, so the results may not be generalisable to account for all universities in China. Further investigation is therefore needed to cross-validate the PTMB-EFL with other samples from different institutions.
