# Cross-Linguistic Transfer Of Writing Strategies: Interactions Between Foreign Language And First Language Classrooms, Karen Forbes. Multilingual Matters (2020). 208pp, ISBN: 9781788929745

This volume is largely based on data that emerged as part of the Cros-Linguistic Strategy Transfer study (X-LiST study), which was a longitudinal, quasi-experimental research project conducted by Karen Forbes in a secondary chool in England. To date, we know a lot about how the first language (L1) can transfer to or interfere with learning an additional language, but empirical studies of the potential positive effects of learning a second language (L2) or a foreign language (FL) on L1 are much less common. With regard to learning strategie for an 2, reent reearch has shifted attention to the efectivenes of language larning stragy intruction (LLSI). Findings of studies on this topic uggest that there is a positie relationship between strategy use and attainment in language learning and that such trategies are indee teachable" and learnable (e.g., Plonsky, 2019, p. 3-21). The current volume is concerned with writing instruction that focuses on the transfer of strategies in various language contexts.

The volume comprises ten chapters. In addition to an introductory first chapter, there are nine chapters divided into five sections. Part I (Chapters 2-3) provides an overview of the X-LiST study, reviewing L1 and FL learning from dfferent perspectives with examples from some thoretical and empirical studies on strategy research. Part I (Chapters 4-5) focuses on research design and the roles of L1 and FL teachers in LSI. Part  Chapters 6-7 is concrnd wth qualitative and quantitative analys f the data collected for Forbes study exploring patterns of strategy development and the multidirectional nature of the construct of transfer. Part IV (Chapters 8-9) shifts atention to individual peformances and examines factors that influence individual strategy development. The volume wraps up with a concluding chapter (Part V Chapter 10) in which Forbes reflects on the key ssues proposed at the beginning of the X-LiST study.

The volume begins with an exploration of the ways in which the L1 and FLs are positioned in schools. Current research and scholarship draws few explicit inks between the two, and the onus seems to be solely on FL teachers to make connections to their learners' L1, with littl recognition of potential links that could be made by L1 teachers to the sils and strategies developed by students i other languages. L1 teachers often take a subconscious, synthetic, top-down approach in their teaching, while FL teachers tend to adopt a more conscious, analytical bottom-up approach (Kecskes and Papp 200). The study reported in this volume aimed to explore how cross-curricular thinking can be done in a more \*bottom-up", analytic way to encourage collaboration between L1 and FL teachers so they will make specific connections between their subjects.

The study comprised three data collection points and two intervention phases during a course of instruction in which the inter. vention was the LLSI and key variables were students strategy use and the written work they produced. At Point 1 of data collection When no intervention occurred students were found to usea wider range of strategies in planning and evaluating their writing in L1 than in FLs. Forbes highlights the importance of awareness-raising as metacognitive reflection, which has been identified as a key factor in developing and transferring stratgies. That being so, students need to be encouragdto identify their strategies in the writing process to facilitate transfer.

The cross-linguisic intervention of LLSI aimed to establish some shared visions and practices among L1 and FL teachers and build explicit connections between strategies used by the participants. Forbes (Chapter 6) found that intervention group students improved the effectiveness of thir strategy use over the course of LLsI intervention and were also more likely to use resources available by themselves. The study also provided L1 and FL teachers with an opportunity to understand how their colleagues approached the teaching of writing and to be aware of the sills and strategies that students developed in other areas of the curriculum. Forbes emphasizes that a multilingual and cros-linguistic approach to the teaching of writing is crucial, and needs to permeates theentireschool curriculum.

The study brought t light the isue of the multiple directionalitie of transfer; namely, the transfer of existing writing strategies from the L1 to the FL, between the two FLs, or from the FL to the L1. Although FL to FL transfer was prevalent in the study, transfer of pre-existing 1 strategie to an FL task was limited at the begining of the study. There were also instances of reverse transfer from the FL to the 1. This difference can beatributed to the mechanism of transfer: low-road transfer is likely to occur where contexts are similar, while high-road transfer involves deliberate, reflective thought in abstracting skils and eeking connections with ther. n an FL classroom, learners are more consciously and actively engaged in thinking about language, which provides a key context for high.

road transfer to happen. Therefore, Forbes argues that FL teachers have the opportunity to focus explicitly on language learning strategies and develop metacognitive reflection, and are in astrong position to contribut to the improvement of writing standards in both the FL and the L1.

The learning trajectories of four students throughout the LLSI intervention were examined. Each represented a distinct writer profile: tategic writer experimenter,struggling writr and multilingual witer. Forbes was able to identify th fctors that influence individual strategy development and transfer, including leaners proficiency level in each of the languages, level of metacognitive engagement with the task, atitude towards writing, and strategic use f other languages in their repertoires. Using her experience as a language teacher and a language learner, Forbes explored FL's influence on the acquisition of L1. Previous research suggests that explicit strategy instruction with metacognitive reflection can facilitat transfer between different languages or contexts. Findings from the X-LisT study echoed previous findings in that students were more explicitly aware of and engaged in thir thinking about language (compared to students in L1 classrooms). This demonstrates that an FL classroom constitutes an ideal place for students to develop valuable metacognitive skill related to a language in its broader sense, and the efects of LLI are most powerful when there is collaboration between L1 and FL teachers. Therefore, L1 and FL teacher nd to take a cross-inguistic aproach to teaching, so their shared aims and practies can support students strategy development acos the curriculum. At this juncture it is also reasonable to call for more attention to pedagogy in the FL classrom, given the decline in FL learning i schools across the Anglophone world as discussed in Chapter 2.

It is generally acknowledged that writing is a complex undertaking, with many variables operating simultaneously and interac tively (Pang, Chen, & Cheng, 2021). The detailed analysis of the four distinct types of writers is a case in point, as Forbes was able to identify the strategie that these students used during the different stages of writig. Stratey-based instruction (BI) would certainly prove useful in future studies to analyze factors that may facilitate or hinder the writing process. For students, SBI can help them to cultivate a better sense of strategy use in their writing practice. However, the X-LisT study is not without flaws. Owing to the mentalistic nature of metacognition, data about strategy use were colected mainly through questionnaires, stimulated recall in. terviews or think-aloud protocols and were therefore limited to learners perceptions of their strategy use. However, this shortcoming does not obscure the high quality of the work.

In terms of organization, the overallstructure of the volume istransparent and user-friendly. The chapters follow a clear organizational template (introduction, theory and approach, data analysis, discussion). The findings of the X-LisT are inspiring and wil encourage more joined-up, cross-currcular, cross-inguistic studies in writing strategy intruction while the methodological framework, quetionires and ask sheets will mak able source for fure stde. val, the vl r as nxcellent reference for students, teachers, researchers and policy makers who take an interest in L2 writing research, language transfer, and second language acquisition (SLA ) more generally.
