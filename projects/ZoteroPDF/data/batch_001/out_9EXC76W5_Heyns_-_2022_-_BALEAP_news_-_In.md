# BALEAP news - Introduction to SIGs – Creative Disciplines

We have invited individual SIGs to showcase their activities in this and upcoming instalments of BALEAP news – our second is: BALEAP Creative Disciplines SIG:

The Creative Disciplines SIG was in the first wave of SIGs and set up early in 2020 with the goal of sharing knowledge, experience, expertise, research and resources related to the learning and teaching of creative disciplines at higher education institutions. Our shared understanding of creative disciplines is broad and inclusive of, but not limited to, creative and cultural industries as conceptualised by O’Connor (2010) as ‘core arts fields’ such as visual arts (e.g. crafts, painting, sculpture, photography), performing arts and heritage, ‘cultural industries’ such as film, TV, radio, video, gaming, music, books and press (e.g. recorded/live, book/magazine publishing) and ‘creative industries and activities’ such as design, architecture and advertising (e.g. fashion/graphic/interior/product design). The multidisciplinary nature of design can also result in learning from and collaborating with other disciplines such as business and economics, engineering, computing and manufacturing, science, psychology and sociology and as of course art/arts in all previously-mentioned forms (Bremner & Rodgers, 2013). The SIG warmly welcomes EAP practitioners with background, experience and/or interest in the Creative Disciplines.

We thoroughly agree with the TNE SIG that EAP practitioners shouldn’t feel they need to be ‘exclusive’ in terms of SIGs as many share similar interests and concerns and even events. Those who do not currently work with students from creative disciplines might wonder whether it merits a SIG of its own. With 190,180 Design, Creative, and Performing Arts students studying in the UK in 2020/21, it is the fourth-biggest subject area in UK higher education (HESA, 2022). This increase alongside differing and specific communication methods within the Creative Disciplines, we believe warrants investigation and exploration as a SIG.

In the Creative Disciplines, there is often a heavy reliance on verbal communication and reflection in research methodology, a process of reflection, dialogue, and development, which forms a significant element of communication. Student engagement and progression is not only dependent on the ability to perform in written assessment, but to continually engage in verbal reflection and dialogue. There is a synergy between the verbal (tutorial) and the written (essay). What's more, texts from creative disciplines are often multimodal. Appropriate spoken and/or written texts are selected for comment on and sit alongside music manuscripts, live perfor mances, images and/or design realizations to effectively communicate the creative design process to specialist and non-specialist audiences for various purposes.

In designing effective pedagogic approaches for the Creative Disciplines, the work of this SIG, therefore, places a strong emphasis on academic communication more broadly conceived, which opens up opportunities for exploring integrational approaches to lan guage and communication in which verbal language is viewed as just one (albeit significant) mode of meaning-making which interacts, or is integrated, with others.

To date, we have held regular friendly and informal speakeasies and also held more formal workshops and online events on various topics such as:

Spotlight on EAP in the Performing Arts: What can we learn from other disciplines (and each other)? $\bullet$ Backstage Pass: Talks and Q&A from VIPs (Lecturers from Graphic Design, Fashion, Music & Performing Arts) BALEAP conference workshop on ambiguity, agency, enquiry & reflection in creative disciplines $\bullet$ Creative Juice: EAP practitioners sharing their creative practices and ideas

We have also recently expanded and updated our committee with new committee members. (see our website at https:// baleapcreativesig.wordpress.com).

We hope to continue with our informal speakeasies and Regular Mid-Month Musings blog from EAP practitioners showcasing expertise and experience on a variety of topics including: virtual learning spaces, collaborative glossaires, and language support within a studio.

In the future, through the BALEAP Creative Disciplines SIG, we intend to continue to foster and cultivate an environment that brings together and supports contributions to learning, teaching, scholarship, and research around creative subject areas. We welcome the opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration with those working in other areas whose practices overlap with those in the creative disciplines, such as reflective practices and sharing work/research with non-specialist audiences, often via multimodal and audio-visual methods.

We would like to continue to expand our global membership, welcoming student voices and continuing to seek opportunities to work more closely with creative disciplines subject experts so we can continue to learn from each other. We are also looking forward to working with EAP practitioners at upcoming BALEAP events such as the BALEAP conference as well as upcoming SIG events!
