In clinical research, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered to be \*the gold standard" for evaluating treatments. Accordingly, RCT reporting in top English-medium medical journals is specifically regulated by The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (cOnsoRT) Statement. However, although the CONsORT Statement prescribes the content items that are to be included in a report, little guidance is offered on how the content can be communicated effectively. This paper explores a linguistic construction of a research gap in the introductory sections of medical research articles that report on RCTs (i.e., RCT reports), which has been identified as crucial in the process of RCT justification. In this study, a sample of Introduction sections extracted form recently published RCT reports was analysed using a systemic functional linguistic (SFL) approach to genre and evaluation. The findings indicate that RCT report writers tend to create a research gap by embedding the rhetorical structures of three arguing genres - expositions, discussions, and challenges - into their research warrants. The results of this study carry pedagogical implications for RCT report writing training.

# 1. Introduction

In clinical research, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) represent \*the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of ther ability to minimise or avoid bias" (Moher et al., 2010, p. 1). Due to the high standing of RCTs in the medical scientific community, RCT reporting in top English-medium medical ournals i speficll regulated by The Consoldated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) Statement (www.consort-statement.org).

Originally created to address the community's concerns about the quality of RCT reporting in the 1990s, the latest CONsoRT 2010 Statement provides clinicians with a checklist consisting of 25 items that need to be included in an RCT report. This checklist is accompanied by an explanation and elaboration paper that provides a rationale behind each item from a medical perspective (see Moher et al., 2010). However, the consoRr 2010 Statement offrslittle guidance on how to communicate an item efectively. Arguably, a lac of specific writing guidlines is most pronounced in the elaboration of Item 2: Scientific background and explanation f rationale, stating that report's introduction should consis of"fee flowing text that rlies on athorough knowledge of the scientific literature' to justify a trial as  is unethical to expose umans uneesrily to the risks freearch (Moher t al., 2010, p. 4). In other words, the above elaboration provides a medical view on the content and importance of Item 2a while being rather vague on how its goal - namely, the creation of a research gap - is to be achieved through text.

Thus, this study aims to complement a medical perspective on trial justification by investigating a linguistic construction of a research gap in clinical psychology RCT reports published in top medical journals. The presented research has been conducted asa part of a larger project that employs a systemic functional linguistic (SFL) approach to genre (Ho0d, 2010; Martin & Rose, 2008) and discourse semantics (Ha0, 2020; Martin & Rose, 2007; Martin & White, 2005) to explore language use in RCT reports (see Stosic, 2021a). While the entire project investigates the generic and discourse semantic features of RCT report Introduction and Method sections, this paper focuses on the results of the genre and Apas analyses of RCT report Inroductionsto explore the roles f arguing genres and evaluation in convincing the readership of a research gap.

# 2. Background

Academic writing has been explored from three diffrent genre perspectives: New Rhetoric (Bazerman, 1988; Miller, 1984), English for Specific Purposes (Swales, 1990, 2004), and SFL (Martin, 1984; Martin & Rose, 2008). Arguably, a key advantage of adopting an SFL approach to genre in thi study i the possilit for the rlationship between meaning and language (.) [to be] thorised rather than intuited' (Hood, 2010, p. 31). To contextualise the current study on RCT report Introductions, this section reviews the relevant literature within the SFL tradition.

In SFL, genre represents \*a staged, goal-oriented, purposeful activity" in which language performs an essential role (Martin, 1984, p. 25). Since the 1980s, academic literacy scholars specialising in SFL have contributed greatly to understanding primary and secondary school genres, especially in the Australian context (eg., Christie & Martin, 197; Cofin, 2004; Cope & Kalantis, 1993; Martin & Painter, 1986; Rose & Martin, 2012; Rothery, 1994). More recently, they have also become increasingly involved in the exploration of higher education research genres (.g., Dreyfus et al., 2015; Ha0, 2020; Ho0d, 2010; Humphrey & Dreyfus, 2012; Humphrey & Hao, 2013; Nesi & Gardner, 2012). Of particular interes to this study is the investigation of research warrants, which were found to be embedded into the research article (RA) and research report genres to function as the Introduction stage (Hood, 2010; Humphrey & Hao, 2013). Here, the concept of genre embedding (see Martin, 1996; Szenes, 2017, 2021a) is comparable to that f an embedded clause in lexicorammar (i.., a unit functioning as part of another unit a th ame or lower rank; s Halliday & Matthiesen, 2014). Put simply, it is argued that a genre (i.e., a staged generic structure) can function as a stage within another genre.

# 2.1. Exploring the structure of research warrants

In a research warrant, the proces of research justification unfolds rhetorically through two lines of persuasion, each being concened with theentties and occurrences that construe one of the two fields found in inroductory section Hood, 2010). To show that a topic is worthy of investigation, writers need to describe and evaluate \*etities and/or activities that constitute the object of study' (p. 121, emphasis added). To demonstrat a need for further research, the writers also review the field of reearch, which refers to the entities and activities to do with the process of enquiry and knowledge building" (p.121).1

Based on the shifts in field, Hood's (2010) crossdisciplinary study of research artices (RAs) and Humphrey and Hao's (2013) study of undergraduate biology research reports have identified several constituent \*sub-genres" embedded into the research warrant structure. In Humphrey and Hao (2013), the research warrant stages that these embedded genres perform are also explicitl laelled (e.g., the Significance of Phenomenon or Research Justification stage). According to these studies research warrants open with a descriptie report on the objec of study to establish topic sigficance. This i followed by another genre -a descriptive report in Hood (2010) and an explanation in Humphrey and Hao (2013) - which, although still concerned with the object of study, shifts focus to building the general field of rearch with view to creating a research gap. Textuall, the field shift is indicated by a change in the ntities and actvities that occupy clause-ntial positions (i.., there is a move from the ones that construe the object f tudy to those that expres the field of research). To conclude their research warrant, writers then move on to a description of their study as the specific field of research.

In this paper, I draw on the concepts of a research warrant and genre embedding to explore the rhetorical structure of RCT report Introductions, focusing on the role of genre mbedding in creating aresearch gap. This s explained in more detail i Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1.

# 2.2. Exploring the language of research warrants

To describe an interdependent relation between social context and language, SFL employs the concept of realisation. Specifiall, geres are realied through a patte of thre contextual register variables: field (i.., social activity), tenor (i.., social relationships) and mode (i., the role of language) (Martin & Rose, 2008). For instance, Section 2.1 introduced two fields that are involved in the construal of aresearch warrant the object of study and th feld f reearch. In tems of teor, the reearch warrant writer aims to forge solidarity with their peers by providing research justification. In terms of mode, a research warrant has a monologic constitutive texture (see, e.g., Martin & Rose, 2008, p. 15). At the level of discourse, registerial variables are further realised through language meanings organised into discourse semantic systems. Field is construed through ideational resources (Dearon and coxon systems) tenor is enacted via interpersonal resources (APRasl and corro systems); and mode is reflected in the use of textual resources (PERODcrr system) (Ha0, 2020; Martin & Rose, 2007; Martin & White, 2005). Therefore, genres, including research warrants, can also be observed through patterns of ideational, interpersonal, and textual discourse semantic meanings.

In the studies on research warrants, the exploration of evaluative language through the lens f ppasAl patterns has shown to be a fruitful line of enquiry into the proces of research ustification (Stosi, 2021b; H0 & Humphrey, 2012; Ho0d, 2010; Ho0d & Martin, 2005; Humphrey & Hao, 2013). According to this body of research, evaluative strategies tend to vary depending on whether the appraised ideational content realises: (a) the object of study; or (b) the field of reearch. In the first case, attitudinal expressions were found to be more explicit and often amplified (e.g., a debilitating disorder) to make the topic more compelling (Stoic, 2021b; Hood, 2010). In the later case, however, it was found that writers usuall graduate non-atitdinal meanings (eg, a lot of/litlerrch to simply \*flag" an atitdinal reading of what appears to be an objective representation of the field of research (Hood, 2010; Hood & Martin, 2005). In Humphrey and Hao (2013), the positive and negative asessments of the field of research have also been glossed as burnishing and tarnishing phases.

In this paper, the APsl system, which will be inrouced in detil in ection 3.2.2i usd to investigat the valuatie trategies for creating a research gap in RCT report Introductions.

# 3. Dataset and method

# 3.1. Dataset

An SFL approach to genre and discourse semantics entails a fine-grained and labour-intensive study of linguistic features. Accordingly, the quantity and quality of data needs to be chosen carefully and trategically to alance the productivity and labour in the qualitative and systemic exploration' (Hao, 2020, p. 49).

To ensure the representativenes, qualit, and comparability of data, this research project only considered research articles that.

- were published between 2016 and 2018 in one the four highest ranked medical journals (2017 rankings, www jcr.clarivate.om): o NEJM - New England Journal of Medicine (impact factor: 79.26) o The Lancet (impact factor: 53.25) $\circ$ JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association (impact factor: 47.66) $\circ$ BMJ - British Medical Journal (impact factor: 23.56)   
- are classified as RCT reports on the effectiveness of treatments for depression, anxiety, or related psychological disorders such as   
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTsD) or body dysmorphic disorder (BDD); and   
- contain the Introduction-Methods-Result-Discussion structure, adhering to the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement (Moher et al., 2010).

The decision to focus on the issues of depression and anxiety was informed by the fact that mental health has oten been identified as one of the largest health issues worldwide (Vigo et al., 2016; Whiteford et al., 2013).

In total, 15 RCT reports were identified and given unique codes combining the journal name - NEJM, LANCET, JAMA, BMJ - and a number (see Appendix A). The entire dataset was used in the preliminary analysis, which was oriented towards identifying the tages of RCT report Introductions and Methods. To make an in-depth study of additional layers of genre embedding and discourse semantic features manageable, a decision was made to narrow down the dataset to eight RCT reports. To allow for abalanced representation, each jounal ccounts for two RCT reports in the narrowed dataset. More precisely, the narrowed dataset comprises al the RCT reports extracted from NEJM and BMJ (i.e, NEJM-1/2. BMJ-1/2) as well as four randomly elected RCT reports from LANCET and JAMA i., LANCET-1/2, JAMA-1/2).

Because of the relatively small size of the dataset, some concerns regarding the generalisabilit of the findings may be voiced by quantitative researchers. Be that as it may, it should be emphasised that this project has adopted a qualitative methodology which focuses on the depth rather than the breadth of the performed analysis. In other words, is aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic practices used by published RCT report writers.

3.1.1. The 'Evidence' stage in a research warrant functioning as RCT report introduction

As mentioned in Section 1, the research presented in this paper only constitutes a part of the project whose dataset was introduced in the previous section. Specificall, this study focuses on the rol of arguing gres and ealuation in constructing areearch gap in the introductory section of an RCT report. Therefore, to identify the scope of data used in this paper, it is also necessary to provide an overview of the identified generic structure of RCT report Introductions. During the preliminary phase of project, RCT report

Introductions were found to be realised by research warrants that include three distinct stages: Topic significance, Evidence, and Response (Stosic, 2021a). The boundaries between these tages are sinalled by shifts in field, which is in line with the existing studies on research warrants (Hood, 2010; Humphrey & Hao, 2013; also see Section 2.1).

The purpose of the Topic significancestage is to build the objec of study by focusing on the evaluation of the ideational content that is pertinent to depression and/or anxiet. To accomplish this goal,the in-depth analysis of the narrowed daset found that RCT writers embed a descriptive report that clasifies and describes the disorder (cf. Ho0d, 2010; Humphrey & Ha0, 2013). Textually, thematic prominence (i.., clause-initial positioning) is given to disorder-related entities and occurrences (e.g., postraumati stressyndrome, symptoms, treatment).

While continuing to build the object of study, the Evidence stage shifts the focus to the field of research by giving thematic prominence to the existing literature (e.g., trials, surveys, systematic reviews). The aim of this stage is to create a research gap by reviewing the strengths and/or weaknesses of the existing research and current medical practice. Contrary to the findings in Hood (2010) and Humphrey and Hao (2013) it was revealed that RCT writers do not typically embed descriptive reports or explanations to achieve this goal. As a matter of fact, the narrow dataset only includes one instance f each genre. In NEJM-2, a descriptive report functioning as Evidence identifies the relevant research on a disorder treatment and then elaborates on it scope, size, and findings. In LANCET-2, an explanation functioning as Evidence reviews the literature that explains the physiological causes of a disorder. In the majority of RCT research warrants (i out of eght), however, the Evidence tages are realised by embedded arguing genres, with the research warrants that aim to justify a non-pharmacological treatment each containing two evidential stages (as discussed in Section 4.3). Therefore, the findings show that RCT writers tend to create a research gap by strategically selecting the evidence that argues for/against the established disorder treatment guidelines.

The concluding Response stage ultimately hifts the focus to the specific filed of rearch by giving thematic prominence to entities and occurrences that reer to the reorted R ., investigaors, gols, hpothes. The goal f this stage is to intoduce the reported RCT as a logical course of action given the established topic significance and the identified research gap. Within the narrowed dataset, the in-depth analysis has not identified any embedded genres (i.e., highly predictable staged structures) functioning as Response.

Given the paper's focus on a linguistic construction of a research gap in RCT reports, the data used in this study comprises the Evidence stages realised by arguing genres. The decision to zoom in on arguing genres was influenced by the fact that ths realisation has been found to be by far the most common within the dataset. Accordingly, Fig. 1 highlights the scope of this paper by locating the position of it data within the RCT report Inroduction structure outlined in this section, with double square rackets (.) used to indicate embedding.

# 3.2. Analysis

As stated in Section 1, this paper investigates the role of arguing genres and evaluation in persuading the readership of a research gap. To identify and differentiate among different types of arguing genres, the study draws on a family of argumentative genres identified in Martin and Rose's work on primary and secondary scho0l genres (Martin & Rose, 2008; Rose & Martin 2012 aso see Section 3.2.1). To investigate the language of evaluation, it employs Martin and White's (2005) system of APRAsAl, with Hood and Martin's (2005) modifications that account for the specificities of the RA discourse (see Section 3.2.2).

# 3.2.1. The analysis of arguing genres

If n interpretation of a phenomenon or event i perceived as contestable, arguing genres can be employed to substantiate a claim or critique. In this case, a writer may opt to use one-sided expositions/challenges or multi-sided discussions (Martin & Rose, 2008, pp. 118-124). To build an effective line of argumentation, writer organise their expositions, challenges, or discussions via rhetorical structuring. In other words, arguments or perspectives are introduced with a view to aligning the readership with the writer's conclusions.

Prototypical expositions open with a Thesis stage, which is ollowed by one or more Argument stages and an optional Reiteration o! thesis. In expositions, al Argument stages are aimed at promoting the opening position without itroducing alternative positions.

Similarly, challenges (i.e., anti-expositions) start with a Position stage, which is then neutralised through one-sided Rebutal ar guments. In a challenge, Rebuttl arguments provide justificatio for an altenative position presented in the subsequent Anti-thesi. stage.

On the other hand, discussions give space to competing positions, with the opening Issue stage being followed by several

Fig. 1. Locating the study data within the structure of research warrants functioning as RCT report Introductions.

Perspectives/Sides. However, although discussions appear to be more balanced, writers tend to make APrasal choices that promote a single position while undermining all the others, which can be explicitly stated through an optional Resolution stage.

Following Martin and Rose (2008), this paper explores how the embedded rhetorical staging of arguing genres contributes to the construction of a research gap in research warrants functioning as RCT report Introductions. For this study, however, two minor adjustments have ben made regarding Martin and Rose's stage labels. As willbe shown in Section 4, RCT report writers use existing medical research to advance or question a position, regardes of the chosen gere. Consequently, the terms thesis' and issue have been replaced with position Furthermore, the label reutal argments' has en replaced with counter-rguments, which rflects the fact that the analysed challenge are not aimed at discrediting the existing medical guidelines. Instead, the evidence is used to oppose the universality of the proposed solutions, justfying a trial of altenative treatments. Thus, the stage nomenclature used in this paper is as follows:

- exposition: Position, Arguments, (optional) Reiteration of position - challenge: Position, Counter-arguments, Counter-position - discussion: Position, Perspectives, (optional) Resolution

At the level of discourse semantics, the distinctions among expositions, discussions, and challenges were observed through the different patterns of ApprAisAl choices, which are the focus of the next section.

# 3.2.2. The analysis of evaluation

The investigation of evaluative pattrns within the identified arguing genres was performed manually. Drawing on Martin and White (2005), the qualitative analysis involved coding for the three interconnected aspects of evaluation: mruDe, GADuanon, and ENGAGEMENT.

Within the ArrrruDe system, a distinction can be made among positive $( \ ' + \ ' ) .$ /negative (-') affect, judgement, and appreciation. Accordingly, Fig. 2 shows the scheme used for coding attitudinal expressions.

As exemplified in Fig.2, affect accounts for the expressions of feelings; judgement' refers to assessments of people and their behaviours; and appreciation' comprises evaluations of non-human entities and experiences. In the cases of judgement' and appreciation, evaluation entail the existence of an Appraiser, which can be the writer or an extrnal entity. As this paper investigates the creation of a research gap through evaluations of treatments, guidelines, and evidence, the findings presented in Section 4 primarily focus on $ / -$ appreciation'. In the numbered examples, bold font is used to indicate the appraising expressions that inscribe attitude, while italicised font is used to label the appraised ideational content (see Fig. 2).

Using GrADuanon resources (underlined in this paper),all inscribed atitudes can be up-scaled or down-scaled. Additionally, the same resource can be useto gradate non-valuatie lexi  ittl rearch) in order to flag" an attituina redig within a given co(n)text. Thus, the analysis of GRADuATon choices is of great importance to this study as GRADUAnoN acounts for more implicit eval. uative resources that are characteristic f research communication (se Hood & Martin, 2005). Fig. 3 shows the scheme used for coding graduating expressions.

As outlined in Fig. 3, graduating resource are organised into two sub-systems: rorce and rocus. When it comes to rorce, graduating expressions can be used for either intensification' or quantification In the frt case, the writer can gauge the intensity of qualities, processe, and modality. In the later case, the writer may graduate the quantity of entities with reference to their amount, spatiotemporal distribution', or spatio-temporal proximity' When it comes to rocus, which is concerned with blurring the experiential boundaries of entities and occurrences, Hood and Martin (2005) have found the RA discourseto be primarily interested in the degrees of 'specificity' and knowledge fulfilment' as they can flag $^ { \circ } + / -$ -appreciation' of the field of research.

To engage with the medical scientific community, the RCT report writer can use language that indicates their stance (i.e., dis/ alignment) on the value propositions presented in the discourse. These resources are organised into the ENGAGEMenr system, which comprises two features: monogloss' and 'heterogloss. While 'monogloss represents propositions as undisputed assrtions, heteroglossic options acknowledge altenative postions (or \*voices") within the discourse. As this paper focuses on the writers arguing for/ against diffeent lines of qury, sevral hetrolossc fetures are of particular interest here. As exmplified in Fig.4, this paper uses shading to highlight the relevant heteroglossic expressions.

When using heteroglossia, a choice can be made to either contract or expand' the dialogic space (see Fig. 4) If contracting the space, the writer may disclaim' the altenative voices by denying their proposition via negation and/or countering it via concessive conjunctions. Alternatively, they can proclaim' a proposition (ie., limit the scope of potential disagreement) by 'endorsing the findings of an external source through verbal proceses such as show/find or by using a conjunction that signals justification' If expanding the space, the writer can use modalit to entertain a proposition as only one of the posibleviewpoints. Altenatively, they can attribute a proposition to an external source ia verbal processes such as suggest or argue As both endorsement and attribution' involve exra-vocalistion (i.., an external source of the proposition) it should be emphasised that endorsement positions the writer as aligned with the propositional value while 'attribution' expresses the writer's stance as neutral.

As evaluation entail expressig \*interpersonal attitudes to ideational experience (Martin, 2004, p.337),atitudinal meanings i. e., appraising and graduating features) are invariably \*coupled" with ideational meanings (i.e., Targets). Following Hood (2010), Szenes (2017, 2021b), and Stoic (2021a, 2021b), this paper uses yin/yang symbols to visualise the emerging patterns of evaluative couplings (i.e., interactions between interpersonal and ideational meanings). This is exemplified in Fig. 5.

This section has introduced the APprasAl features that were used to conduct a highly principled analysis of evaluative language (for coding and subjectivity in APRassl analysis see Ho0d, 2010, pp. 74-75). According to Ho0d (2010), the analyst's reading position should also be stated because it may influence coding decisions. Thus, it hould be noted that the entire pprasAl analysis was positioned in relation to the meanings likely to be decoded by members of the medical scientific discourse community. For instance, the phrase few trials' is lkely to be read as invoking a negative evaluation of the existing research. Approximately three months afer the initial coding, the entire dataset was re-coded by the author. Due to the rlatively smal sample size and a qualitative nature of this research, this decision was not motivated by the intent to perform a statistical analysis typical of larger corpus-ased enquiries. Insted this facilitated a comparison between the first and second rounds of coding ( $8 8 \%$ instances in agreement) with a view to revisiting and confirming the identified patterns.

# 4. Results and discussion

As briefl mentioned in Section 3.1.1 this study has found that six out of ight research warrants (BMJ-1/2, JAMA-1/2, LANCET-1, and NEJM-1) contain Evidence stages that are construed by an embedded arguing genre - exposition, discussion, or challenge. These genres are aimed at using the existing evidence to promote or oppose treatment guidelines, ultimately creating a research gap for the reported RCT to fill.

Invariably, arguing genres start with a Position stage that identifies the preferred medical practice and establishes a dominating positive evaluative prosody of an intervention. Ideationally, thematic prominence is given to entities that name either institutions/ institutional guidelines (e.g., the NICE in (1)) or interventions (e.g., a shorter course of exposure therapy in (2).

(1) The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises ... (BMJ-2) (2) A shorter course of exposure therapy could ... (JAMA-2)

If the former case, an institution entity acts as an external Appraiser of an intervention. As ilustrated in (3), these instances 'attribute' an inscribed +appreciation' of an intervention to the official view of a regulatory body (e.g., NICE recommends).

(3) The National Instute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that adults should be offered the choice of either a course of a selective serotonin response inhibitor or specialised CBT that deals with the key features of the disorder. (BMJ-1)

If an intervention occupies a clause-initial position, its $^ \bullet +$ appreciation can be flagged in two ways. Specifically, the writer may :hoose to entertain' and gauge the force of the intervention's positive effects (e.g., could hasten amelioration in (4).

(4) A shorter course of exposure therapy could hasten amelioration of PTsD. (JAMA-2)

Alternatively, the writer can up-scale the 'amount' of the supporting evidence (e.g., the most clinical evidence in (5), implicitly outsourcing the intervention's positive assessment to the general field of research.

(5) Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have the most clinical evidence. (LANCET-1)

Having set the dominating positive evaluative prosody of atreatment in the opening stage, the writers can use evidence to:

- argue for the position one-sidedly via an embedded exposition genre; - discuss the position from different perspectives via an embedded discussion genre; or - challenge the position via an embedded challenge genre.

The following sections discus the embedded expositions and discussions as means or promoting a position, whereas the embedded challenges are discussed as a means for opposing it.

# 4.1. Creating a research gap through exposition

This study identifie four instances of embedded expositions functioning as Evidence stages i research warrants (MJ-1, JAMA-1/ 2, and NEJM-1). To ilustrate linguistic construction of a research gap via one-sided promotion, this section starts with the embedded exposition functioning as Evidence in JAMA-1's research warrant, which is concerned with resistant depression outcomes (see Table 1).

As shown in Table 1, the Position stage of the embedded exposition is fllowed by two Argument stages, both introducing evidence that supports the intial recommendation. In the argumentative stages, adistinction can be made between the two types of evaluative couplings with reference to their Targets - the object of study and the field of research (cf. Hood, 2010).

Table 1 The embedded exposition functioning as the Evidence stage in JAMA-1's research warrant.

a Within the daset, RT reports use a footnote referncing style. Inthis paper, the footnote refreces have been removed from the analysed texts to avoid confusion.

As far as the object of study is concerned, (6) and (7) show that both argumentative stages 'endorse' the research that inscribes '+appreciation' of bupropion and aripiprazole strategies.

(6) Argument 1: STAR $^ { * } \mathbf { D }$ trial showed that bupropion was at least as effective as other switching and augmenting agents. (7) Argument 2: Several studies have shown efficacy of aripiprazole as an antidepressant augmentation strategy

Further saturating the positive prosody, Argument 2 also attributes' $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of aripiprazole augmentation to a recent study (see (8)).

(8) Argument 2: a recent study suggested aripiprazole augmentation is more beneficial than antidepressant switching and has comparable tolerability.

In (6) and (8), the inscribed atitudes are further intensified through comparison, which underlines the writers alignment with the treatment asessments. Finall, it should be highlighted that JAMA-1's line of argumentation contains no instances of negative evaluation targeted at either treatment strategy (i.e., the object of study).

To evaluate the field of research and create a research gap, both argumentativestages utilise burnishing and tarnishing phases (following Humphrey & Hao, 2013). I other words, heteroglossc choices and graduating expresons are employed to switch between the positive and negative assessments of the existing research.

Each Argument stage begins with a burnishing phase, as indicated in (9-10).

(9) Argument 1: STAR\*D trial showed . (10) Argument 2: Several studies have shown ... a recent study suggested .

In addition to ignalling endorsement, the verb show in (9-10) symbolises a higher degree of knowledge fulfilment'. This in turn flags $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of the field of research ( $S T A R ^ { * } D$ trial in (9); studies in (10). In the Argument 2 stage, research reliability is further amplified by using the quantifie several to up-scale the amount of stdes. Similarly, although th verb sugst i (10) indicate lower degree of 'knowledge fulfilment', the writer flags $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of the study by highlighting its temporal 'proximity' (recent).

To justify JAMA-1's trial, however, the burnishing phases are succeeded by those that tarnish the field of research (see (11-12).

(11) Argument 1: ... However, ${ \bf S T A R ^ { * } D }$ was not powered ... and atypical antipsychotics were not included.   
(12) Argument 2: .. However, adequately powered and well-controlled clinical trials have yet to compare ..

As shown in (11-12), both stages use the concessve however to counter' the initial propositions that highlight knowledge fulfilment'. This is followed by negation that denies' certain knowledge (not powered, not included, yet to compare), flagging '-appreciation' (i.e., limitations) of $S T A R ^ { * } D$ trial and studies. As a result, the writer manages to simultaneously tarnish the general field of research and promote JAMA-1's trial as the specific field of research that address the identified research gap (see (13))

(13) [foreshadowing the JAMA-1 trial] an adequately powered and well-controlled [ $^ { \cdot } +$ appreciation'] trial that compares bupropion switching and augmentation strategies and includes an atypical antipsychotic (aripiprazole)

Importantly, neither countering' nor 'denying' are aimed at questioning the findings that inscribe $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of the recommended treatment strategies (i.e., what has been shown/suggested). Instead, the purpose of tarnishing is to maintain the positive prosody of the object of study while opening a research space for the reported trial. In addition to using countering/denying, the general feld of research can be tanished by down-scaling its quantity. For instance, the exposition functioning as Evidence in BMJ-1's research warrant 'endorses a pilot study, indicating a study of limited sample size with promising yet preliminary findings (se (14))

(14) In a pilot study, BDD-NET was found to be safe, highly acceptable to patients, and potentiall efficacious. (BMJ-1)

The generic and evaluative features of the embedded exposition serving as JAMA-1's Evidence stage are characteristic of the other expositions identified in the study. In each case, the Position stage is followed by several Argument stages. By using expositions as Evidence in their research warrants, RCT report writers aim to create a research gap by:

- focusing on the general field of research (i.., studies/trials that promotes the object f study through (often) intensifid inscribed   
'+appreciation'; and   
- burnishing and tarnishing the abovementioned field of research through $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' and '-appreciation', both predominantly flagged using ENGAGEMENT and GRADUATION resources.

As shown in Fig.6 the construction of a research gap via expositions can be visualised through the yin/yang representations of the identified evaluative couplings.

In addition to the obligatory Position and Argument stages, the in-depth genre analysis has found one instance of Restatement of position as the final stage in the exposition functioning as Evidence in JAMA-2's research warrant (see (15)).

(15) Restatement of position: Thus, massed therapy was expected to be noninferior to typical spaced prolonged exposure therapy.

The aim of Restatement of position appears to be the reinforcement of a positive evaluative prosody of the object of study. As highlighted in (15), the concluding stage is linked to the previous stages using the conjunction thus, which offrs a heteroglossic 'justification' for the inscribed $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of the treatment being promoted (namely, massed therapy). Be that as it may, a positive assessment of the treatment is merely 'entertained', reiterating the need for further research.

# 4.2. Creating a research gap through discussion

A decision to construe an Evidence stage via a discussion genre instead of an exposition was found to indicate a more balanced approach to promoting a treatment strategy. As a representative example, this section showcases the analysis of the embedded discussion functioning as the Evidence stage in BMJ-2s research warrnt (see Table 2). Fortuitously, BMJ-2's Evidence focuses on the same object of study (i., resistant depression outcomes) as JAMA-1's Evidence, which was discussed in the previous section. This should facilitate a comparison between one-sided and multi-sided promotion tactics for creating a research gap.

Unlike the previously analysed exposition, BMJ-2 discussion follows its Position with two Perspective stages, which discuss the proposed intervention strategies by introducing both opposing and supporting evidence.

As can ben seen in Table 2, Perspective 1i amed t rviewing theevidence that questions the initial advice, shifting thealuative prosody from positive to negative. To begin with, the down-scaled amount of availabl evidenceis used to inscribe -appreciation of the general field of research (see (16)).

(16) Limited evidence is currently available to guide doctors ...

To further criticise the advice, the stage goes on to review the research on BMJ-2's specific object of study - namely, antidepressant combinations. Through an endorsement f systematic review, the writer opposes the NICE guidelines by using phases that tarnishthe general field of rearch as wel as phases that dispute the effctivenes of the object of study (see (17-18). As indicated in (17), the endorsed findings deny' knowledge fulfilment', correlating a down-scaled amount' of trials and '-appreciation' of methodology with '-appreciation' of conclusions about effectiveness.

(17) the small number of trials and methodological drawbacks of those trials precluded definitie conclusions about ffectiveness

Similarly, treatment efectivenessi disputed through a denial of is approriatenessin primary care, which is preceded by sever. instances of inscribed -appreciation' (see (18)).

18) some of the [drug] combinations carry a substantial risk of adverse efects and are not appropriat fr initiation in primary care

Nevertheles, it should be noted that the amount of negatively evaluated drug combinations is not maximised. That is, i is implied that there are some drug combinations that could be positively evaluated. Ultimately, this is what enables BMJ-2s writer to move on to

![](img/fbbc5d24e0302901170fb9ac7821c0772384d2c8327b3436831d4f6f78be398f.jpg)

Perspective 2.

While Perspective 1 aims to stop the positive evaluative prosody of a treatment strategy established in the Position stage, Perspective 2 is used to resume it. To offset the previously inscribed -appreciation' of some drug combinations, BMJ-2 writer sharpens the 'specificity' of the added antidepressant (see (19)).

(19) a second antidepressant with a different and complementary mode of action to SSRIs or SNRIs

To ultimately re-establish $^ \bullet +$ appreciation' of the object of study, this is followed by multiple instances of the inscribed attitude targeted at the combination of mirtazapine and SsRI/SNRI drugs (see (20)).

(20) Mirtazapine has the potential for an additive and perhaps synergistic action with sRIs and SNRIs and could enhance clinical response

As indicated in (20), however, the positive evaluative propositions are only entertained in order to justify the BMJ-2 trial on the effectivenes of such drug combinations. Furthermore, a negative assesment of the existig trials i afforded by negatively assesing the consistency of their results (see (21)).

(21) Four trials have been carried out ... and they had mixed results.

In the dataset, the in-depth analysis has identified two instances of the discussion genre realising the Evidence stage - BMJ-2's Evidence (analysed above) and LANCET-1's Evidence B. In both cases, the Position stage i followed by two Perspectives: one supporting the initial view and the other one opposing it. Therefore, the role of adiscussion genre in creating  reearch gap is to identify the strengths and weakneses of the field of research as wel as the object of study. This again can be visualised using the yin/yang representations of the identified evaluative couplings (see Fig. 7).

When compared to embedded expositions (se Section 4.1) a decision to introduce evidence that negatively evaluates a treatment strategy suggests a lower degree of asertivenessin warranting new research. Relative to the evaluation identifie in expositions t is also interesing to not that the naive asssments of the general field of reearch tend to be more explict e ig. 7). However, this paper argues that the embedded discussions represent another means of reserved treatment promotion because the purpose of negative assessment is to justify the need for further research rather than discredit a potential remedy.

# 4.3. Creating a research gap through challenge

Among the analysed research warrants, those that aim to justify a trial of non-pharmacological interventions (BMJ-1, JAMA-2, NEJM-1, and LANCET-1) were found to incorporate two Evidence stages:

1. Evidence A, which opposes a positive view on a treatment strategy; and   
2. Evidence B, which promotes a positive view on an alternative treatment strategy.

While the latter stage can be performed by an embedded exposition (BMJ-1, JAMA-2, NEJM-1) or discussion (LANCET-1), the former stage is always realised by an embedded challenge genre. To explore how and why RCT report writers choose to oppose a particular view on disorder management, ths section uses the Evidence A stage in BMJ-1's research warrant as a starting point (see Table 3). In this instance, the writer wishes to justify their trial of an online therapy for treating body dysmorphic disorder (BD).

As shown in Table 3 the Position in a challenge i followed by the Counter-arguments stage, whose aim is to dispute the opening view by focusing on the general field of research that highlights the drawbacks of the recommended strategies (SRI and CBT). In the Counter-argument, the evaluative couplings involving the field of research (e.g., surveys) are fairly backgrounded as the evaluation is primarily oriented towards establishing and saturating a negative evaluative prosody of an intervention as the object of study. As indicated in (22, BMJ-1 writer initiates -appreciation' of CBT implementation by identifying a supply-demand gap before employing causality to support their attitudinal stance.

(22) a gap between supply and demand of CBT because of lack of trained therapists,direct and indirect costs associated wit. treatment, and geographical barriers

Additionally, the established inaccessbilit of the recommended treatments is furthered through a down-scaled amount of the affected population benefiting from CBT and SSRI (see (23).

(23) only $1 0 { - } 1 7 \%$ of people with body dysmorphic concerns reported that they had received an empirically supported psychotherapy (such as CBT), and $1 9 { - } 3 4 \%$ reported that they had received an SSRI.

As the final stage of the challenge, the Counter-position stage serves to reinforce and disil the negative asessment of CB (i.e, the object of study) as inaccessble and expensive, providing a heteroglossc justification' for opposing the initial recommendation (see (24)).

(24) Thus, one of NICE's key prioritie for implementation is currently fr from reality. The growth in demand for mental healthcare exceeds available NHS resources in the UK and this gap is likely to increase up to 2020. Cost pressures require that providers find innovative ways to deliver services.

As shown in (24), this stage also hints at delivery innovation as a possible solution, which foreshadows the promotion of online treatments in the subsequent Evidence B stage of the BMJ-1's research warrant.

The generic and evaluative features of BMJ-1's challenge were found across the dataset of non-pharmacological research warrants. As shown in this section, the embedded challenges, which function as the Evidence A stages, do not rect the recommended guidelines in their entirt. Insted, they fous on the littions of tretment strateies by using a st f evaluative criteri ., aces and cost in BMJ-1). Therefore, the purpose of the challenge genre is t create a new research space by identifing the issues with an object of study, as illustrated in Fig. 8.

Based on the analysis of evaluative couplings, the identified issues appear to be carefully selected to match the strengths of a treatment strategy that is promoted in the Evidence B stage. As summarised in Table 4, the criteria used to negatively evaluate the interventions in the embedded challenges correspond to those selected to positively evaluate the alternative interventions in the

subsequent expositions/discussions.

Therefore, in the overall research warrant structure, embedding the challenge genre as one of the Evidence stages only represents the first step in creating a research gap. More precisely, Evidence A uses a challenge to focus on one or more issues regarding an intervention's: (a) high cost/complexity/duration; and/or (b) low acces/safety. In tun, this justifies the writer's shifing to another field of research in Evidence B, which reles on an embedded exposition/discussion to promote an alternative intervention with a potential to address the identified issues.

# 5. Conclusion and pedagogical implications

To create a research gap, the genre analysis presented in this paper has shown that research warrants functioning as RCT report Introductions draw on the rhetorical structures of embedded arguing genres that promote or oppose the established positions on disorder treatments. The APrasAl analysis has also demonstrated that different arguing gere - expositions, discussions, and chal. lenges - are realised through discenible patterns of evaluative couplings concening the object of study (i.., disorder treatments) and the field of research (i.e., studies/trials) (cf. Hood, 2010).

Across the dataset, embedded expositions and discussions were found to construe a research gap through one-sided and multi-sided promotions, respectively. In both cases, heteroglossa and graduating expressons are used to burnish and tarnish the general field of research (cf. Humphrey & Hao, 2013). However, while expository Argument stages only review research that positively evaluates a treatment strategy (ie., the object of study), discursive Perspective stages introduce literature that has identified the treatment's benefits as wellas drawbacks. Thus, a decision to embed a discussion rather than an exposition leads to a more balanced promotion within the process of research justification.

On the other hand, embedded challenges were found to oppose a treatment strategy, representing th firs step in the construalof a research gap in all non-pharmacological RCT research warrants within the dataset. Specificaly, heteroglossia and the negative as. sessments of a treatment in the Counter-arguments and Counter-position stages are used to counter' the universal benefits of a treatment, justifying' the need for researching alternative non-pharmacological treatments. In the following step, the proposed alternatives were then found to be promoted through either embedded expositions or discussions. Given that medication and psychotherapy originat from different fields - medicine and psychology - the preference for a two-step process when creating a gap may suggest avariation in warranting multidisciplinary research depending on whether it favours a medical or a psychological approach. However, a corpus-based study would need to be conducted to validate or disprove this assumption.

The conclusions of this study have some important pedagogical implications. To construct a research gap in an RCT Introduction, the study has shown that published RCT report writers rely on arguing genres that are typically encountered much earlier in education (see Martin & Rose, 2008; Rose & Martin, 2012). Therefore, in (post-)tertiary academic contexts, it is recommended that literacy educators draw on the clinicians pre-terty science literacy ucation to scaffld RT rort wriig. t i ao uggestd that teachers who assist with research writing jointly deconstruct model authentic texts with novice researchers, drawing the researchers' attention to the linguistic pattns identified i this stud (se, g., \*teaching leanng cycle" inMartin, 2006; Rose, 2015; Rse & Martin, 2012;
