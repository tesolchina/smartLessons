Disciplinary academic writing

Ph.D. thesis writers' abilities to effectively use interpersonal language and engage with disciplinary communities are recognized as key features of successful thesis writing (Hyland, 2006). As a high-stakes part-genre in Ph.D. theses, the limitations' section often contains caveats about writers' findings/methods/claims as realized through negation, functioning to convince disciplinary expert examiners to view any shortcomings more favorably (Paltridge & Starfield, 2020). Negation, as a disclaim marker within Martin and White's (2005) appraisal framework, combines with other interpersonal resources to construct writer-reader relationships. Nevertheless, discipline-specific forms/functions of negation in theses' 'limitations' sections remain underexplored. Accordingly, this study investigated negation using the appraisal framework within the limitations' sections of $1 2 0 \mathrm { P h . D }$ . theses across disciplines (hard-applied, hard-pure, soft-applied, soft-pure). Results showed common as well as discipline-specific properties of negation devices alongside their co-articulations with other relevant appraisal resources. The corpus-informed results are expected to shed light on the nature and practice of each discipline that educators may take into account during thesis writing instruction.

# 1. Introduction

With the rapid development of English for Academic Purposes (EAP), Ph.D. theses and their disciplinary linguistic features have received extensive cholarly attention (Paltridge & Starfield, 2020). Ph.D. theses are viewed as dialogic in nature, where language is used to represent real-world realities while acknowledging, negotiating and constructing social relations within academic fields (Hyland, 2007). As such, thesis writers' abilites to effectively use interpersonal language, introduce authorial voices, engage with alternative views and establish solidarity with discilinary communitie are generally peceived as a key feature of sucesful thesis writing (Loghmani et al. 2020). Interpersonal discourse stratgies are particularl vital for thesis limitations sections, where writers not only address caveats about thir findings, methods or claims, but also counterbalance potential deficiencies by justifying their choices and indicating that certain precautions have already been taken to abate the impact of any limitations on the thesis' validity (Koutsantoni, 2006).

Appraisal (Martin & White, 2005) is an important methodological approach to the analysis f interpersonal discourse, and has been widely used in EAP reearch. In appraisal terms, writers' objectives within thesis limitations sections are commonly realized through the use of negation, e.g. the findings might not be generalizable, with the aim of convincing disciplinary expert examiners to view any shortcomings more favorably (Paltridge & Starfield, 2020). Negation, as a disclaim marker within the wider appraisal framework. combines with other interpersonal language resources to help construct writer-reader relationships at the discourse-semantic tratum (Hood, 2006). Nevertheles, the iscipline-specfic roles of negation in theses limitations sections remain underexplored, despitethe fact that negation functions as the key element in the thrust f sentence particularly when writers have to critique their own research inthe limitations section. To minimize the isk of losing validit, writers may adopt negation alongside a range of pprail resources (e.g. "not.but, \*bause .not). Inestiging sucho-artclations canreveal rhtrical statgis of conveying imtations, throw light on how disciplinary writers display knowledge, serve as evidence to demonstrate how knowledge i constructed and negotiated within each discipline, and furthermore contribute to developing EAP course/workshop material to help novice thesis writers to become aware of interpersonal strategies for academic writing.

Therefore, this study examined the use of negation in the limitations section of Ph.D. theses across four main disciplinary groups: hard-applied, hard-pure, soft-applied, soft-pure (Becher, 1989). The researchers probed into negation at lexical and co-articulating levels, and explored how different categories of negationco-occur alongside other relevant appraial resources. The aim is o offer new insights into the ways appraisal resources are co-articulated, whilealso revealing disciplinary negation features so as to better inform disciplinary thesis writing practice for EAP instruction.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Ph.D. Theses

The past few decades have witnessed a remarkable upsurge f scholarly interest in Ph.D. theses and their language features (e.g. Loghmani et al., 2020; Xiao and Sun, 2020). In order to be admitted to a disciplinary academic community, thesis writers need to exhibit the competence to conduct riginal research and the ability to produce high-quality pieces of writing (Paltridge & Starfield 2020). The value of Ph.D. theses therefore lies not only in the truth and evidence being supported, but also their appropriate employment of linguistic and social conventions that the disciplinary community finds convincing (Loghmani et al. 2020). According to Hyland (2012), thesis writers need to boost persuasivenes by communicating credibilit and a relationship with their disciplinary audience and subject matters, though actall many doctoral students face immense challenge (e.. finding the appropriate academic voice, arguing logicl and coherently the meaning of the research results) in conforming to genre- and discipline-specific conventions (Paltridge & Starfeld, 2020). As agued by Loghmani e al. (2020), understanding how sucessul thes writers project themselves into their writing in light of disciplinary conventions is therefore important for the pedagogy and practice of thesis writing within EAP.

Textual analyses of Ph.D. theses have mainly concentrated on their structural and/or language features (Bunton, 2002). Inspired by the Introduction-Method-Results-Discussion (IMRD) model (Swales, 1990), tructural research into Ph.D. theses has overwhelmingly examined prominent \*part-genres" (Swales & Feak, 2012, p. 8), e.g. introduction (Bunton, 2002), literature review (Kwan, 2006), discussion (Geng & Wharton, 2016). Findings have cumulatively demonstrated that within each part-genre certain communicative purposes are shared across isciplines, such as the general functions of theses' discussion chapters as summarized by Paltridge and Starfield (2020), alongside sigficant discipline-specific variation regarding lexcal richness (ia0 & Sun, 2020) as well as the ways to present argument and produce knowledge (Jiang, 2022).

Among the abovementioned part-genres, the discusson section is considered particularly challenging given the potential identity conflict thesis writers face between being a student and an apprentice scholar (Shen et al., 2019; Swale, 2004). This challenge is intensified inthe limitations' section, where writer typically pose problems to appear self-critical or humble while at the same time demonstrating scientific rigor and credentials as disciplinary elites (Greener, 2018; Swales & Feak, 2012). The limitations' section is therefore arguably a high-stakes part-genre (Cotos et al. 2015; Rudestam & Newton, 2001), where writers need to addres caveats about their indings, methods or clams while counterbalancing any problems by justifying their choices and minimizing any impact of the limitations on the validity of the findings (Koutsantoni, 2006). Composing a quality limitations' section requires skilful deployment of both accomplished specialized knowledge and a proper stance which is to negotiate authorial voice in the context of research community so as to persuade audience/examiners to view any deficiency more favorably.

To this end, a range of interpersonal strategies (incl. hedges, contrastive connectors, authorial reference) are commonly adopted in limitations sections. Flowerdew (2015) has pointed out the vital rol of would' in the felds of applied sciences and social ciences, e g.our design would be more objectiv f the exact final outcome analyses werefull specfied, but this would be a very dfficult task in the context of ." (p. 64). Would' is used to signal limitations while counterbalancing them by presenting a hypothetical case. Wallwork (2016, p. 160) argued that strategicall using contrastive connectors can manipulate readers' reactions, e.g.:

Example (1). The limitation of this paper is that the two surveys were unfortunately not conducted in the same period. This wil affect our results in terms of ..

Example (2). Although the two surveys were not conducted in the same period, this willonly affect our results in terms of...

Example (1) reports the limitation in a more subjective, neutral way, but in reality, the les negative" (p. 160) statement in Example (2) is more powerful in persuading examiners to accet the claim. Wallwork further presented instances (e.g. \*it might be speculated that') to illstrate appropriate ways of clarifying limitations without losing credibility. Koutsantoni (2006) found thesis writers employ more hedges compared with research article authors, and that their percentage i electronic and electrical engineering theses ishigher than that in chemical theses. Interpersonal resources are thus employed to phrase limitations in a way that disciplinary gatekeeper (in the form of examiners or Ph.D. theses find persuasive, and meet their expectations. This view is suported by Hyland (2002) who clamed writing a Ph.. thesis requires sophisticated use of intrpersonal resources especiall authorial refrence, eg. , "we') to successfully negotiate writers' propositions.

Nevertheles, interpersonal strategies are usuall not explicitly explained to novice writers because \*supervisors themselves tend to have tacit rather than explicit knowledge of the features of the thesis in their own disciplines" (Bitchener & Basturkmen, 2006, p. 6). Previous research on interpersonal language in academic texts has also tended to concentrate on students writing at earlier stages of education or on research articles (Geng & Wharton, 2016), leaving the use of interpersonal language in Ph.D. theses (especialy in the limitations' sections) under-researched. In addition, the limitations section has usually been addressed from a structural view to explore how it functions as a constituent of macro part-genres, withlittl research on the language used within limitations' sections themselves. More work needs to be done to understand the choices writers make within this space.

# 2.2. Negation within the appraisal system

To date, an extensive body of research on negation is available in the field of pragmatics, focusing mainly on metalinguistic negation (Davis, 2011) and semantic ambiguity of natural language negation (Pits, 2011). indings confirm the significant contribution of negation acrosstexual, contextual, interpersonal, and ideational perspectives (Pagano, 2002). I comparison, in the field of Systemic Functional Linguistics (Hallday, 1994), negation is ess well-developed with respect to the iscourse semantic functions it performs (Don, 2017). Therefore, negation in this study is analyzed within the appraisal framework (Martin & White, 2005), which evolved within SFL to become a systematic extension of the interpersonal meta-function, and is \*the most systematic analyzing tool' (p. 174) for studying interpersonal language (Hyland, 2005). Analyzing negation within a thorough framework such as appraisal is important because from a prosodic view the scope of negation is not confined categorically/egmentally, but is realized through interpersonal meanings "accumulating, reinforcing, or resonating with each other' (p. 38) across clauses and sentence boundaries (Hood, 2006).

Within the appraisal framework, negation is a dialogic contraction resource for introducing alternative positions into dialogue so as to deny or rect them (Martin & White, 2005). In SFL, negation has in most cases been addresed as one of several components within the engagement/appraisal system to explore how rhetorical effcts and/or moves are achieved in academic discourse. For example, u and Nesi (2019) found a range of high-frequency co-occurrences of negation and other engagement items (e.g. entertain $^ +$ negation) in applied inguisti rearch articles, proviing eidence for the combnation f egagment dvice as an effetie peruasiestrate to introduce debatable opposing views. Loghmani et al. (2020) identified negation as the third most frequent engagement resource in TEFL? Ph.D. theses' discussion sections. In this case, negation is conveyed via correlative conjunction neither A nor $\mathbf { B } ^ { \ast }$ to introduce and then reject the equally important factors (i.e. A and B) that might be unexpected or ignored by putative readers. These studies have demonstrated the key role of negation in problematizing arguments and negotiating potential challenges from readers.

By comparison, a tiny minority of research has focused primarily on negation to examine the functions of negation's co-articulations with other appraisal resources. For example, Don (2017) identified three main types and argued that each type operates to manage a distinctive evaluative position in written academic discourse. Although Don attempted to explain mistaken idea as the denials when writers assume readers entertain a mistaken idea and interpret disambiguation as the counterstatement when writer assume readers could get wrong ideas from the co-text, this sort of distinction is unfortunately not made clear due to the microscopic variation (if any). Webber (2014) categorized the uses of negation into eight categories and investigated how each category was realized in academic papers. However, as acknowledged by Webber, there are sill unsolved overlapping ssues among the categories (e.g. overlap between unfulfille expectation and dissatisfaction), and the classfication is fa from adequate (p. 195). Based on Webber's (2014) categori. zation, Sun and Crosthwaite (2022) explored Move 2 'establishing a niche' sections of Ph.D. theses drawing on three subtypes of negation. As the only study probing into the use of ngation in Ph.D. thees so far, their findings have indeed enriched ur understanding of the disclaim marker and offered new insights into the ways apprasal resource are co-articulated in the reearch genre. However, the authors were limited to only three types of functions while there might be others (e.g. justify $^ +$ negation) that could co-articulate a new function different from the exiting three categories.

Taken together, previous studies have displayed the value of exploring negation from an SFL perspective. However, generally speaking, neation in FL has scarcely been addressed as a focal poin f study, rather i has been discussed, by and large, merely as a spin-off to depict upper-layer resources (e.g. egagement). lthough a few scholars endeavored to primarily investigate (the taxonomy of) negation based on its co-articulations, there are sill ambiguous, overlapping and incomplete isues surrounding the categorization. Accordingly, this study investgates negation in the limitations' section of Ph.D. theses across hard-applied, hard-pure, sof-applied, and soft-pure disciplines through the linguistic lens of the appraisal system (Martin & White, 2005) alongside the incorporation of corpus-based discourse analysis (Flowerdew, 2012), with the ltter enriching the quantitative evidence collcted under the former. Our research questions include:

(1) What features of negation are employed in the 'limitations' sections of Ph.D. theses? (2) What is the extent of disciplinary variation in the forms and functions of negation within limitations' sections?

# 3. Data and methods

# 3.1. Corpus construction

A total of 120 Ph.D. theses were collcted, representing 4 disciplinary groups: hard-applied, hard-pure,soft-applied, and oft-pure. The broad distinctions ie hard vs. soft, applied vs. pure are conventionall ccted as representative of their respective discilinary groupings due to the discipline-specific epistemological characteristics (Becher, 1989; Neumann et al, 2010) and are commonly adopted in recent genre studies and cros-disciplinary research, providing useful practical insights for EAP teachers and equipping novice apprentice writers with appropriate language skils (Hu & Liu, 2018; Jiang & Hyland, 2017). Within each disciplinary group, specifi fields of research were sampled in accordance with Laird et al's (2008) categorization, which is an established disciplinary taxonomy built upon exemplary studies of disciplinary subject matter.

Following the above guidelines for disciplinary grouping, 30 Ph.D. theses were selected to represent each broad discipline (summarized in Table 1) using an institutional search engine chosen because of its unified taxonomy of research fields, comparable academic ranking across disciplines, and the practicality of obtaining the full texts of PhD theses on a large scale.

On the basis of the fundamental principles for selecting corpus texts (Sinclair, 2005), each thesis had to mee the fllowing criteria:

(a) they were written by doctoral students enrolled at the institution;   
(b) they were submitted to the university from 2013 to 2020, and;   
(c) there was a separate 'limitations' section which could be identified in each thesis.

These criteria were to ensure comparability across disciplines, while the representativeness and sampling of the specialized corpus were designed to answer the specific research questions of ths study. Then the selected theses were converted into plain texts using AntFileConverter (Anthony, 2017). The limitations'sections were manuall separated from the main thesis and stored in 120 separate text files. The descriptive corpus statistics are presented in Table 2.

# 3.2. Identification of negation alongside other appraisal resources

Considering the extensivenes of the appraisal framework (Martin & White, 2005), the researchers adopted the approach proposed by Lam and Crosthwaite (2018) to make acompromise between the comprehensiveness of the original ppraisal system and the practicalities of manual corpus-based annotation. This framework is shown in Fig. 1.

The atiude domain deals with linguistic reources for onstruing emotional reactions. t differentiates three tyes: fect, judgment, appreciation, which respectively address expressing emotions, judging behavior, and evaluating entities. Among them, affect is con cerned with expressing emotions, g. un/happines (sadnes/appiness), is/satisfaction (ennui/satisfaction), i/ecurity (anxiety/ confidence), disinlintion (dire/fear). Judgemen is diided int social estem including norlity (usul), capacit (capable), tenacty (resolute), and soci anction inluding vcity (truthful), propriey (ethical). Apprcition is dividd int rction (attention-cachin), composition (balanced/easy to follow) and valuatin (worthwhile). All (sub-categories of atitude have positie, negative, neutral/ ambiguous polarites. As for mode of expression, atitde can be either incribed explicitly vialexico-grammatical constructs, or invoked implicitly cued by combined resources in the co-text.

The engagement domain is concerned with linguistic resources of intersubjective positioning and is divided into monoglossc (bare assertation) or hterglosic (authorial voicing engaged with alternative positions. Heteroglosic resources are divided into expand and contract. Expand allows alternative voices by opening up dialogic space using entertin or atribute. Modal words/phrases creating dialogic space for various possbilitie are noted as enterin I the sub-cateory f ribute, acknowlege occurs when writer xplicitly acknowledge other sources, while writers may distance themselves from other viewpoints through reporting verbs. In the area of contract, dialogic alternatives are challenged, overwhelmed or otherwise excluded through authorial intervention using proclaim. Proclaim is further split into concur, justif, pronounce, and endorse. Concur involves locutions to overtly anounce agrement with a viewpoint via afirm or concede. Writers may also use conjunctions (e.g. because') to give reasons in order to justify a proposition. Expressions which state authorial propositions explicitly are labelled pronounce while those sourced to external sources but are construed by the authorial voice as warrntable are labelled endorse. Disclaim limits the space for dialogic altenatives to be considered, and disclaim markers include counter and negation. Counter occurs when writersupplant and thereby oppose to another viewpoint with a counterargument typically conveyed using conjunctions such as although'. Negation happens when writers show disalignmen with an alternative position.

Graduation focuses on resources which vary the strength of evaluation in terms of force and focus. Force covers resources to upscale or downscale the degree f intensification operated over qualities, proceses and modalities, which are typically viewed as scalable from an experimental perspective. By contrast, focus functions to sharpen or soften the degree of unscalable meaning.

# 3.3. Corpus annotation

To ensure reliability and consistency of corpus annotation, we first incorporated the coding scheme (Fig. 1) into UAM (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid) CorpusTool (version 3.3, O'Donnell, 2019). UAM CorpusToolallows for annotating texts at multile levels, and is particularly suitable for the often-overlapping categories of the appraisal system.

A common concen regarding annotation is the subjectivity involved in the proces, since diferent researchers might interpret the same item from different positions (Coffin & O'Halloran, 2006). To minimize potentia ubjective judgements, this study adopted the step-wise method proposed by Fuoli (2018) to first randomly select 12 samples ( $1 0 \%$ of the data, 3 samples from each discipline). The authors then read carefully each text, manually selected the pans of the text that flfilled the conditions of an appraisal function as elaborated in Section 3.2), and assigned the corresponding category label.7 UAM CorpusTool enabled a quick retrieval of any coded item, making it convenent to xamine any ite wth its co-ext when nessary, and therfore heled us arie t a consistent serie of annotations.

After that, the samples were checked for accuracy by two raters (both native English speakers with over five-year teaching experience) to ensure reliabilit. The two independent raters went over each coded segment to decide whether they agreed (yes) or disagreed (no) A total of 304 annotated segments were covered. The Itraclas Correlation Cofficient (ICC) for the analysis (2 way random, general consistency, $\mathbf { k } = 2 \mathbf { \dot { \Omega } }$ ) was 0.799, which is regarded as an 'excellent' standard of agreement (Cicchetti, 1994). After the authors guaranteed there was no inconsistency in coding the samples, the rest of the corpus was annotated.

# 4.1. Overall use of negation resources across disciplines

A total of 34 negation items were witnessed in the corpus. As calculated by UAM CorpusTool, the normalized frequency i. instances per 1000 words) of negation is 7.54. The negation resources account for approximately $1 4 . 5 0 \%$ of engagement items and make

up $7 . 7 2 \%$ of appraisal items.

Table 3 presents the disciplinary use and cros-disciplinary comparisons of negation resources.Following significant Shapiro-Wilks tests $( p s < . 0 5 )$ , the disciplinary corpora were considered to be non-normally disributed. Thus, non-parametric Kruskal-Walli test was adopted to compare the four independent disciplinary groups, while post-hoc pairwise comparisons corrected with Dunn's ests were to ascertain variance among variables8.

As shown in Table 3, the Kruskal-Wallis result uggests a significant eect of discipline on the overal use of negation resources (H $( 3 ) = 1 2 . 7 1 8$ $p < . 0 1$ , eta squared $= 0 . 1 0 7 ) ^ { 9 }$ . Pairwise comparisons further show cross-disciplinary variation is especially noteworthy between soft-pure and soft-applied disciplines $( \mathrm { t } ( 2 ) = 3 0 . 5 1 7$ $p < . 0 1$ , Cohen's $\mathsf { d } = 0 . 5 2 $ .10 The normalized median frequency of negation is the highest in limitations' of soft-applied Ph.D. theses $( \mathrm { M d } = 8 . 7 8$ $\mathbf { M A D } = 3 . 0 6$ , while it is relatively lower in hard-pure disciplines $[ \mathbf { M } \mathbf { d } = 6 . 5 6$ $\mathbf { M A D } = 3 . 3 2$ ) and in hard-applied disciplines $\mathrm { [ M d } = 5 . 4 2$ $\mathbf { M A D } = 3 . 3 0$ ). In comparison, the normalized median frequency of negation is the lowest in the limitations' sections of soft-pure Ph.D. theses $( \mathbf { M d } = 5 . 0 4$ $\mathbf { M A D } = 1 . 8 7 $

Table 4 shows the items of negation and their frequencies. The items "not, "no" and "cannot" are commonly and more frequently used by all the disciplines, while the item \*nort is adopted by hard-pure and soft-applied disciplines. As relatively uncommon negation indicators, "neither" and \*none" are only witnessed in the soft-applied disciplines. It should be noted that soft-applied disciplinary writers adopt the most diverse range of negation items, incorporating all of the five indicators.

To determine whether the use of each negation item varies enormously across disciplines, the items were further compared using Log-likelihood (LL) as the measure of significance drawing on the loglikelihood calculator (Rayson, 2016) with the purpose of identifying (if any) statistical difference regarding the frequency of each wording across disciplines, with $\%$ DIFF used as the effect size measure11.

As summarized in Table 5, there are significant cross-disciplinary differences regarding the use of "not, \*no" and \*cannot", and all the three negation items are most frequently adopted by writers from soft-pplied disciplines. More specificll, the frequency of "not" in soft-applied disciplines varies significantly from those in the fields of hard-applied $( p < . 0 5 )$ and soft-pure $( p < . 0 1 )$ . Counterintuitively, soft-applied disciplines also noticeably prefer "no' in contrast with soft-pure disciplines $( p \ < \ . 0 1 )$ . Regarding the deployment of "cannot, it is les common in hard-applied and hard-pure disciplines compared with soft-applied ones $( p s < . 0 1 )$ . In addition, no significant variatio is witnesed among hard-applied, hard-pure and soft-pure fieds with resect to the use of "not, "no and "cannot" $\left( p s > . 0 5 \right)$

4.2. Co-articulation of negation with other relevant appraisal resources

# 4.2.1. Co-articulations with attitude

As illustrated in Table 6, across all the discilines,negation most often occurs alongside (especially precedes) atitude when rhetoricall constructing the limitations sections. Negation would also follow attitde or be surrounded by attitude device, though these two cases are relatively less common.

In the most common pattern "negation $^ +$ attitude", attitude is usually disposed immediately adjacent to negation (e.g. "not clear", "not successful"), functioning to give a straightforward description of limitations. The atitde resources tend to be expresed in an inscribed and positive way, suggesting how capable/dependable thesis writers/findings are, whereas the stance is denied by negation devices "not'/\*no' to denote shortcomings on the contrary (Excerpts 1-3).

(1) On the other hand, the research results may (entertain) not (negation) be appropriate (valuation inscribed positive) to be generalized for other case study areas. [hard-applied]   
(2) Another geometric property that is not (negation) exact (tenacity inscribed positive) is the analogous Ryu-Takayanagi formula. [hard-pure]   
(3) Teachers planned a numeracy-focused task for the observed lesson, but (counter) sometimes (downscale) the cheduling of scool visits meant that there was no (negation) clear (composition inscribed positive) subject-related purpose for the task. [soft-applied]

By comparison, the attitude resource within "attitude $^ +$ negation' tends to be conveyed in the negative polarity (Excerpts 4-5). The negative atitde devices explain why certain deficiecies would xis, thus preparing the ground for the following limitations projected by the use of negation.

(4) The potential (entertain) factors affcting donor milk variability is unclear (composition incribed negative) and were not (nega tion) investigated in the study. [hard-applied]

For the co-articulation \*attitude $^ +$ negation $^ +$ attitude", the attitude resource preceding negation usually conveys a positive evaluative meaning and sugests that certain methods conform to a favorable standard. Then the proposition is denied by negation and thus elicits the succeding atitde resource which functions tother wth negation toclarity that the method i stil not perfect nough (Excerpts 6-7).

# 4.2.2. Co-articulations with engagement

4.2.2.1. Co-articulations with entertain. Table 7 presents co-occurrences of negation and entertain resources. In most cases, entertin precedes ntion in the limtations sction tis als likely for enin devices to follow negationor go both efore and after nation, though thee two case (espeialy the later) are relatively les frequent. Beide, we dd nt identif oted cross-dcilinry variation in this type of co-articulations.

Hedging strategies are adopted to indicate careful authorial detachment, e.g. \*might/may not', in which the hedges function to reduce epistemic commitment t claims or limit the scope of propositional content (see Excerpts 8-9). In this way, the co-occurrences of negation and entertain markers subtly open up discursive space for altenative views while projecting qualities of equanimity/ cautiousness to mitigate the degree of denial.

(8) This has the limitation that the surveyed patients may (entertain) not (negation) represent patients at other sites. [hard-applied] (9) Participants might (entertin) not (negation) hear l (upscale) the messages present to them, instead (counter) they chose to hear those that support their existing frames. [soft-pure]

As shown in Excerpts 10-11, entertain as a dialogically expansive device indicates that the so-called weak point' is no more than a ossilit. Accordingly, the pattern entertains dialogic altenatives by making space for ther possilitie, reducing the likelihood f Jeing condemned by expert audience.

(10) We did not (neation) discuss stratification strategies that could entertain) reult in further reductions in variance. hard-pure] (11) However (counter), no (negation) consideration was given to the possible (entertain) sound-symbolic relevance of feature combinations. [soft-pure]

Entertain devices might both precede and follow negation at times (Excerpts 12-13), where the first entertin functions together with negation to co-construct limitations, while the second entertain indicates either the value of tackling the limitation or writer's hope to address the limitation in future studies.

(12) Finll, it i possible (ntrtain) that some covariates that were not (negation) mesured or included in this study may (entertain) explain the associations between depression and diabetes, and anxiety and diabetes. [hard-applied]   
(13) Thes issues might (enertin) not (negation) be fully (upscale) addressed within the constraints of the present study but (counter) could (entertain) be attended to in further research. [soft-applied]

4.2.2.2. Co-articulations with counter. As shown in Table 8, negation tends to follow counter, which is commonly witnessed acrossall the disciplines. Negation might also precede counter or be surrounded by counter resources, while these ircumstances (especiall the latter case) are relatively rare.

As witnessed in our corpora, it s very likely for negation to go after counter. hesis writers generall prefer mphasizing the research value in the first place due to the need to highlight the research significance and thus persuade examiners to view caveats more favorably. As shown in Excerpts 14-15, the connective \*however'/but" enables writers to step back from positively justifying the value, and then negation item "not' signals that certain shortcomings are somehow counter-expectational.

(14) However (counter), the mechanism of these effects has not (negation) been investigated. [hard-applied] (15) Details of employment would (enertain) be useful (valuation inscribed positie), but (counter) were not (negation) included in the questionnaire. [soft-applied]

"negation $^ +$ counter' opens dialogical potential by expressing writer's dissatisfaction rather than outright criticism, which is typicall realized via emphatic discontinuous phrases incorporating adversative conjunctions as co-textual signals. For example, in Excerpt 16, limitations are refuted by the author with but' and then identified as a positive "forward step'. Similarly, the writer in Excerpt 17 anticipates audience's potential expectation/criticism and contradicts the view by stressing research aim.

(16) No (negation) attempt has been made to compute Wilson loops, but (counter) given (justify) the results with anyonic models, this is a clear (composition_inscribed positive) forward step. [hard-pure]   
(17) It is necessary (pronounce) to understand that the study was not (negation) intended to generalize the practices found within different contexts, but (counter provided an analysis of the curcula and practices of two schools enacting GCE. [soft-applied]

By comparison, negation is rarely surrounded by more than one counter items. This is probably because the overuse of counter (however', \*yet) emphasizes the degre of denial and therefore may have a disadvantageous effect, such as magnifying rearch limitations (see Excerpt 18).

Table 8 Co-occurrences of negation and counter.

(18) However (counter), we find that there is a small (downscale) residual error between our pseudostate and semi-analytical calculation, which I have not (negation) yet (counter) been able (capacity inscribed positive) to resolve. [hard-pure]

It should be noted that counter markers (e.g. however', but) could lead to slightly ifferent rhetorical effect from the marker "although'. As demonstrated by Excerpts 6-7, when "although" operates in conjunction with "not, it could convey a denying proposition in direct contradistinction with positive evaluation, though writers wouldattempt to build a favorable impression in the first place. The way of employing although' differ from the cases where however' is used at the beginning of a sentence to, by and large, incorporate limitations as facts (Excerpt 14). It also varies slightly from the instances of "not/no $^ +$ but' where writers first present deficiencies and then counterbalance the drawbacks by identifying them as promising future research potentials or by re emphasizing research aims (Excerpts 16-17).

4.2.2.3. Co-articulations with justify. Table 9 shows the co-occurrences of negation and justify along with their cross-disciplinary comparisons. In hard disciplines, writers tend to employ \*negation $^ +$ justify', whereas writers from soft disciplines prefer \*justify $^ +$ negation'. By contrast, "justify $^ +$ negation $^ +$ justify' is merely witnessed in soft-applied disciplines and accounts for the lowest proportion.

Hard-applied and hard-pure disciplines are frequently witnessed to first present/legitimize limitations drawing on negation and then justify why the limitations would exist or cannot be avoided (Excerpts 19-20).

(19) The analytical method was not (negation) able (capability inscribed positiv) to quantify chromium and cobalt owing to justif) low (downscale) concentration in samples. [hard-applied]   
(20) However counter), this wil not (negation) impact the findings of this dissrtation since justify) the analyses and models are based on the driving simulator data. [hard-pure]

By comparison, soft-applied and soft-pure disciplines tend to give reasons ahead of putting forward any limitations (Excerpts 21-22).

In soft-applied disciplines, co-articulations of negation and justify may encompas more than one justify resources both preceding and following the nation device (xcerpt 23). Gnerally, the first ustif device ives justifications for rearch limtations, while the second justify resource incorporates another round of reasoning/inferring to further validate (any effct of) the above limitation.

(23) Because (justify) the questionnaire asked for the name of previous qualifications rather than (counter) the major, many (upscale) respondents did not (negation) specify the major in generic-type degrees, so (justify) those records also had to be eliminated. [soft-applied]

negation in the limitations' section in most cases It is also possibl for gaduation resourcesto precede negation or go both before and after negation, though these two cases (especially the latter one) are relatively less frequent.

It should be noted that gaduation resources occurring alongside negation typically consist of only upscaleand/or downscal devices as witnessed in our corpus. The main function of "negation $^ +$ graduation' is to depict those deficiencies particularly associated with limited degree of thesis writers capability or the research findings' generalizability (see Excerpts 24-27). As such, negation usually goes before upscale devices (e.g. \*always) to imply that although the research findings have not met the maximum degree of authorial/ professional satisfaction, they have at least met a good level of satisfaction.

(24) It is not (negation) entirely (upscal) clear (composition inscried positive) how this question can be answered. hard-applied]   
(25) Therefore justify), the results of computational modelling are not (negation) always (upscal) accurate (tenacity inscribedpositive). [hard-pure]

(27) However (counter), it i also possble (entertain) that not (negation) all (upscale) expectations elicited by the concepts were addressed. [soft-pure]

The pattern "graduation $^ +$ negation' is generally used to first present a view which is disposed towards the external facts and then articulate any relevant limitation. As shown in Excerpts 28-29, graduation resources ("a wide range of, "most) function to assert neutral/objective propositions, and thesis writers would construct limitations based on such factual propositions to enhance authorial credibility.

(28) It was possible (entertain) to adjust the statistical model for a wide range of (upscale) possible (entertain) confounders; however (counter), in this study I did not (negation) examine the efects of drugs used by participants for chronic conditions. [hard applied]   
(29) Most (upscale) research studies have their own limitation and this thesis is not (negation) an exception. [soft-applied]

As a somewhat uncommon pattern, "graduation $^ +$ negation $^ +$ graduation' is adopted to construct quantity-related limitations. For example, in Excerpt 30, the writer proposes a deficiency caused by the comparatively smaller sample size. Likewise, the author in Excerpt 31 assumes there could be limitations regarding the numerous people's inadequate perception.

(30) While conter the trai roram ws fetie (ationincried positive) for th rech parers, the mall downsal) sample size enabled intensity in training, which might (entertain) not (negation) be found in studies with a larger (upscale) sample size. [soft-applied]   
(31) There may (entertain) be a large (upscale) number of people who donot (negation) volunteer to participate as (justify) they do not (negation) fully (upscale) understand how the issue affects them. [soft-pure]

In summary, the above results suggest common as well as discipline-specific deployment of overall negation resources, commonly adopted negation items, as well as the co-articulations of negation alongside other appraisal resources.

# 5. Discussion

This study has explored the use of negation in the limitations' sections of Ph.D. theses across hard-applied, hard-pure soft-applied and soft-pure isciplines. To the best of our knowledge, this i th firs study that has drawn on Martin and Whit's (2005) appraisel framework to explore qualities of negation in Ph.D. thees acros disciplines.y probing into co-occurrences ofnegation alongide other relevant opraisal resources in written academic iscourse the study has demonstrated intriguing rhetorical potentials of negation resources and offered new insights into the ways appraisal resources are co-articulated in the limitations sections of Ph.D. theses.

Overall, it has been found that thesis writers from all disciplines commonly employ negation resources. According to SWwales and Feak (2012), the language for stating limitations generally leans towards a negative trend, though the main purpose is not to convey harsh self-citicism but to show that writers understand how evidence is evaluated in a particular feld. This is further supported by Martin and White's (2005) finding that the frequency of negation is much higher in argumentative and editorial piees of writing than in news reporting. Thus, argumentation in the limitations sections inevitably involves a great deal of negation resources, which are denoted as \*features of persuasive writing where contesting positions need to be addresed and set aside (Martin & Rose, 2003, p. 49.

The findings also show that "not" and "no' are frequent negation indicators in the limitations' sections. Based on the empiric findings, it can be concluded that these two triggers have great potential in introducing dialogic space and negating alternative propositions in written academic communication. More specifically, our results show that \*not" is most typically adopted by allthe disciplines. This i in line with previous corpus-based findings f egation patterns in which not-negations account for a large proportion within forl we acdic re e. ier et al, 1998; ottie 991). In dtion, our ruls shw hat " s aationriger is also frequent within almost alldiciplines. This i probably because no-negations can be more emphatic than not-negations, whil also expressing judgements (Biber et al., 198). According to Cheshire (199, the nature of no-negations rresents asolutes at the end of implicatures of usuality and quantity. Thus, in our corpora, no-negations create an "overstatement" (Cheshire, 1999, p. 39) and persuade the disciplinary audience to take on the authorial scope. Both not-negations and no-negations play the role of effectie intensifying devices and are vital for securing interpersonal involvement in written communication.

For co-articulations, negation would occur alongside appraisal resources to co-construct limitations and engage with disciplinary communities. The most common pattrn incorporates negation and atitde, functioning to (prepare the ground to) convey shortcomings. As discussed by Paltridge and Starfield (2020, thesis writers ofte adopt atitde and engagement reources to show positions related to thir own research outcomes in the discussion section. Another frequent pattrn involves negation and entertain to indicate Iimitations while mitigating the degre of denial o as to reduce the possbilit of being condemned by expert examiners. The strategy, labelled by Webber (2014) as \*expression of cautious stance" (p. 195) is in contrast to the introduction section where thesis writers Create a Research Space' (CARSs) with negation resources to establish a niche while more explicitly criticizing the limitations in previous studies (Paltridge & Starfield, 2020). Besides, i is common for negation to occur alongside counter, and the phenomenon is also typical in research articles (Webber, 2014), probably due to the asymmetric writer-reader power in research genres (Koutsantoni 2006). Thesis writers have to present their claims while satsfying the requirements of disciplinary audience who posses both learned and institutional authority. As shown in our results, counter is often used to connect limitations (triggered by negation) with a positive claim (e.g. highlighting research significance/potential), revealing writers attempt to persuade examiners to view any shortcoming more favorably. In addition, negation might occur together with graduation as well functioning to depict deficiencies related to the limited degree of capability/generalizability and quantit-related facts. The phenomenon is actually prevalent in Ph.D. theses (Pal. tridge & Starfield, 2020), which could be attibuted to the grading nature of graduation resources. Thesis writers adopt graduation resources to adjust the degree of denial (.g. "ot always accurate"), argue for the relatively positive aspect of the study and therefore guide the audience to form more positive perceptions.

At the same time, our study revealed noted cross-disciplinary diffrences. At the lexical level, soft-applied disciplines most frequently adopt negation, employ a diverse range of negation indicators and particularly prefer "not", "no" and \*cannot'. Counter. intuitively, there is significant variation between soft-applied and soft-pure disciplines regarding the uses of negation, while hard disciplines seem to position themselves mid-way between soft-applied and soft-pure disciplines and no significant variation lies be. tween hard-applied and hard-pure disciplines. The findings could be attributed to the fact that diffrent disciplines have embedded distinctive properties as to methodology, epistemology, and practice. As supported by Loghmani et al. (2020), thesis writers from soft-applied disciplines prefer using dialogistically contractive engagement resources, restricting the scope of alternative propositions, and thus enhancing writer-reader solidarity. Different from the discursive and dialogic trat f sft-applied disciplines, knowledge in hard disciplines is regarded as a plain matter of fact, and the procedures of uncovering knowledge depend on the accumulation of empirical enquiry (Kuteeva & Airey, 2014). By comparison, knowledge in soft-pure disciplines is regarded as constructed interpre tation due to the complicated nature of society, culture and humanities, resulting in an emphasis on interpretation over facts. Acording to Webber (2014), in such les dialogic academic texts, fewer amounts of negation resources would be expected.

Furthermore, at the co-articulating level, our findings showed intriguing differences regarding the patterns of negation and justify devices across hard and soft isciplines. Hard disciplines tend to first present limitations with negation and then justify why the limitations may exist, whil soft disciplines would give reasons ahead of puting forward any imitation. The co-articulation has been largely ignored in previous studies (e.g. Don, 2017; Webber, 2014), though i actually manifest some fundamental cros-disciplinary distinctions. As proposed by Kuteeva and Airey (2014), discipline-specifi forms of discourse are a product of different knowledge structures, where hard disciplines are endowed with hierarchical knowledge structures which is accumulated through empiricl enquiry and thus their writers would state (though unsatisying) facts with negation in the first place. By contrast, oft disciplines are built on horizontal knowledge structures which rest upon more complicated interpretations and rhetorical embellishments, therefore leaning towards verbal justification over limitation statement.

# 6. Closing comments

Our corpus-informed results have shed light on common and disciplinary nature and practice regarding limitations' sections of Ph. D. theses that educators may take into account when guiding students into awarenessof the conventions and characteristics during thesis writing instruction.

Nevertheles, considering the present study represents only a preliminary attempt to investigate negation drawing on the appraisdl framework, there is sill potential for investigating the use of negation in broader academic genres (e.g. research articles) from a pragmatic perspective. In addition, it would be interesting to look beyond three co-articulated appraisal markers and explore how certain rhetorical effects are realized via more complicated patterns, such as the use of counter followed by \*attitude $^ +$ negation $^ +$ attitde' in Excerpts 6-7. Furthermore, the validity and reliability of the present findings could be improved in a number of ways, e.g. an expanded sample would normall achieve more valid results, though a sample of 30 texts per disciplinary group hasaready met the minimum requirement for sample size (Roever & Phakiti, 2017).

Furthermore, previous literature has also suggested that the L1 background and the local institional culture might affct writers employment of interpersonal language strategies (Dahl, 2004). In line with Hu and Liu (2018) the present study did not take language background as acriterion for thre resons  such information was rather complicated especially in the English as a Second Language (ESL) tertiary educational context, (b) the information was not available publicy, and (c) the selected Ph.D. theses in our corpora showed no aparent language difficulties and their authors were ll awarded  Ph.. degre at the institution. Besides, considering the influence of ocal institutional context on writers language choices (Li & Wharton, 2012) the present study had intentionally elected theses from a single institution to avoid the potential complication caused by different intitutional contexts. Neverthles, this might in turn affect the generalizabilit of our findings since they might not be able to be generalized to other institutions. It might be interesting to compare negation resources in Ph.D. theses written by authors from different 1 backgrounds or from different in. stittions, in order to explore whether their 1/instittional provenance truly sems to be an influencing factor in the choice f negation devices.

However, despite the limitations, this study can bettr inform scholars who are interested in disciplinary academic writing and corpus-based discourse analysis. Our close and systematic examination of negation alongside ther relevant oprail resources not only occupied the nicheregarding the disciline-specific use of interperonal stratgies in the limttions stions of Ph.. thees, but has also provided new evidence in relation to negation devices which were largely overlooked in the prior SFL literature.

More specificall, findings of this study have methodological, theoretical and pedagogical implications. From the methodological perspective, this study differ from previous ones (Don, 2017; Webber, 2014) in the ways that it drew on the apprasal system to both quantitatively and qualitatively scrutinize negation based on larger-scale disciplinary academic corpora. The improved approach has increased the statistical soundnessof results and enabled us to more thoroughly look intonegation from an inovative SFL perspective.

From the theoretical perspective, our findings corroborate previous research (e.g. Geng and Wharton, 2016; Webber, 2014) from two main aspects: (1) thesis writing generally incorporates strategic employment of a diverse range of co-articulating interpersonal patterns; (2) negation would co-occur with varied appraial resource to realize diffrent rhetorical effcts. In particular, it is noteworthy that exploring negation within the apprais framework captures a more detaied picture of how negation co-occurs with various appraisalresources, as opposed to the incomplete issue caused by the limited relevant interpersonal strategies being observed (Don, 2017; Webber, 2014). In addition, as the first study comparing the uses of negation across disciplines, our findings on individual negation resources and their co-articulating patterns confirm the position that academic texts are shaped by distinctive disciplinary epistemology, methodology and practice, which are in turn reflected in the texts via linguistic and rhetorical means (Xiao & Sun, 2020).

As for pedagogical implications, results of this study, alongside explanations based on negation devices and co-articulating strategies, can be used as an educational tool by EAP scholars who are to explore how the limitations section can be articulated by thesis writers from different disciplinary backgrounds, and by teachers who are interested in developing EAP course/workshop material for graduate students.1 Considering the dificulties involved in proceing negative sentences (Jiang & Hyland, 2022), adanced students and novice academic writers may thus benefit from an awareness of the roles that negation can play in disciplinary writing. It would be helpful to teach students not only how to recognize the different functions of negation in their reading of academic texts, but also how they can use them to create effective and persuasive texts of their own.
