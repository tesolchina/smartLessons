# ABSTRACT

The current replication study aims to examine the effects of learners’ attention to lexical and grammatical forms on meaning comprehension while listening to a passage in Spanish. The registered protocol and materials in the aural mode from Morgan-Short et al.’s (2018) multisite replication study were used, with first language (L1) Chinese–second language (L2) English participants $( N { = } 1 2 2 )$ ) learning Spanish as the third language (L3). The results partially reproduced the previous findings that there was no effect of attending to a lexical item $( s o l )$ on meaning comprehension. However, a small to medium effect was found on comprehension scores for simultaneously attending to a grammatical form $( l a )$ . This finding reveals a sitespecific effect with learners from different L1 backgrounds, suggesting that learners’ attending to a grammatical form absent in their L1 is detrimental to their meaning comprehension even if this form exists in their earlier learned L2.

# 1. Introduction

The role of attention has long been an issue of great interest in second language (L2) learning, as it has been shown to be beneficial in L2 processing and advantageous for deriving intake from input by several studies (e.g., Leow, 1993, 1997; Long, 1991; Mackey, 2006; Shook, 1994; VanPatten & Cadierno, 1993; White, 1998). One focus of the attention research is the allocation of attentional resources to certain aspects of input, i.e., form (linguistic or grammatical form) and meaning (the content of the input). The input processing model (VanPatten, 1996, 2015) proposes the relation between the form and meaning aspects of processing L2 input with an overarching strategy, the primacy of meaning principle (PMP). The PMP explains that L2 learners tend to process meaning first for communication, for which grammatical forms are redundant and to which they are less attended. If learners are required to attend to form and meaning simultaneously during L2 input processing, their meaning comprehension will be inhibited. The basic assumption is that information processing is effortful due to humans’ limited capacity (Kahneman, 1973; McLaughlin, 1987; McLaughlin et al., 1983). Learners’ attentional resources are limited or constrained in processing L2 input; hence the attentional resources they can devote to meaningful cues and grammatical forms are in tension with one another.

VanPatten (1990) provided seminal empirical evidence for the hypothesis that L2 learners’ attending to a syntactic or a morphological form is detrimental to the simultaneous meaning comprehension but attending to a lexical form is not. A stream of independent replication research (e.g., Greenslade et al., 1999; Wong, 2001; Leow et al., 2008; Morgan-Short et al., 2012) and a recent multisite replication by MorganShort et al. (2018) tested the plausibility of this hypothesis. The results from the single-site replications did not yield conclusive findings in support of the hypothesis. The multisite replication concluded that there was no overall effect of attending to form on learners’ meaning comprehension in either aural or written modes. However, the results were not entirely uniform among the different sites, suggesting limits to its generalizability and providing clues for further investigation. For instance, attending to the grammatical form may have had a tentative trend of effect at one of the aural sites on learners’ comprehension in comparison with attending to meaning only.

The inconclusive findings of these studies suggest a remaining necessity of verifying the plausibility of the general claim that attending to forms is detrimental to simultaneous meaning comprehension. More importantly, the site-specific anomalies in the results yielded by Morgan-Short et al. (2018), hereafter the initial study1, need to be investigated and explained. This is because in this study, learners at the different sites were from different language backgrounds, and the target language, Spanish, was not the L2 for all of the learners. For those learners who learn Spanish as an additional language after they have learnt an L2, the cross-linguistic influence of their L1 and L2 may exhibit different effects of attending to form in the L3 on meaning comprehension, especially when the target form has different structural proximities with that in their L1 and/or L2 (Puig-Mayenco, González Alonso & Rothman, 2020). To advance the understanding of the form–meaning relation, it could be helpful to closely replicate2 the initial study with one major variable modification, i.e., learners’

prior language backgrounds.

This desire motivates the current study to revisit the effect of attending to form on meaning comprehension in a different learner population, i.e., L1 Chinese learners who learn the target language Spanish as an additional foreign language after they have learned English as an L2. This population has a different L1 background from that in the sites in the initial study but shares the same L2 English background with that in the Poland site. In this way, we aimed to provide further evidence by aggregating the result to that of the Poland site in the initial study. We followed the registered protocol and used the adapted materials in the initial study to revisit whether attending simultaneously to a lexical and a grammatical form would have detrimental effects on L3 Spanish learners’ listening comprehension3.

# 2. Background

The research interest in learners’ attention to linguistic input can be traced back to Krashen’s Monitor Model (Krashen, 1981, 1985), in which learners’ attention to some but not all input is elaborated as the concept of intake. Given that learners must deal with processing constraints on their available attention and effort, what becomes eligible for intake is an important aspect of L2 learning. During input processing, attention can be directed to form once meaning is accessed automatically. This is because of a processing strategy based on the primary importance of communicative value during language development (VanPatten, 1985).

# 2.1 Seminal study on the form–meaning relation in comprehension

VanPatten (1990) conducted an experiment to test this proposal by investigating whether simultaneous attention to meaning and form is possible in L2 comprehension. The participants in this study were college students who learned Spanish. They were grouped separately to perform one of four tasks while listening to an L2 passage: (1) a comprehending content-only group; (2) a lexical form group, i.e., comprehending content and simultaneously marking each time the key lexical item inflación (inflation) was heard; (3) a grammatical form group, i.e., comprehending content and simultaneously marking each time the feminine definite article la (the) was heard; and (4) a morphological form group, i.e., comprehending content and simultaneously marking each time the verb morpheme -n was heard. As the measure of their attention to meaning, the participants were asked to recall whatever they could remember and to write the items down in their L1 English after listening to the L2 passage. VanPatten found that the content-only and lexical form groups produced the highest recall scores and were not significantly different in terms of the results. However, a significant decrease in recall scores was found in the grammatical and morphological form groups when the participants were asked to simultaneously attend to content plus the morphosyntactic forms. The comparisons of these two groups to the content-only group yielded significant differences. Thus, the results from this study showed that attending to morphosyntactic forms rather than important lexical items in the input negatively affected meaning comprehension. The study concluded that L2 learners of Spanish, especially those at lower proficiency levels, had difficulty simultaneously attending to meaning and grammatical forms not essentially related to the content of the passage. Based on these findings as empirical evidence, the PMP proposes that

“learners process input for meaning before they process it for form” (VanPatten, 2004, p. 7).

# 2.2 Independent replications of VanPatten (1990)

The seminal study of VanPatten (1990) has had an important impact on the research agenda for understanding learners’ attention to form and meaning while processing L2 input for comprehension, given its more than 1,000 citations and a stream of follow-up replication studies. Table 1 presents the seminal study and its replications (e.g., Greenslade et al., 1999; Wong, 2001; Leow et al., 2008; MorganShort et al., 2012) that directly motivated the multisite replication Morgan-Short et al. (2018), which we review in the next section, to verify the plausibility of the general claim on the form–meaning relation in L2 comprehension. The results of these replications have varied and have provided no conclusive demonstration of the plausibility of the PMP. In summary, the results have partially supported VanPatten’s (1990) finding that the lexical form and content-only groups exhibited no statistically significant difference in meaning comprehension in either aural or written modes. However, the results varied when the morphosyntactic form groups were compared to the content-only group. Specifically, Greenslade et al. (1999) reproduced the results in VanPatten (1990) in the written mode that attending to the form la or -n was detrimental to meaning comprehension. This result was reproduced in Wong (2001) in the aural but not in the written mode. The studies using refined forms in a new Spanish passage and multiple-choice comprehension tests, i.e., Leow et al. (2008) and Morgan-Short et al. (2012), were administered in the written mode only, and they did not reproduce the findings in VanPatten (1990).

The inconclusive results of these replications may largely be due to the methodological alterations they made. The first alteration was an attempt to expand the research design to the written modality. These studies (Greenslade et al., 1999; Wong, 2001; Leow et al., 2008; Morgan-Short et al., 2012) designed experiments in the written mode, while Wong (2001) investigated form–meaning connections with English target forms in both the aural and written modes. In fact, none of the studies replicated VanPatten (1990) in the aural mode using the same forms in Spanish, which suggests less adequate empirical evidence from the aural than from the written mode. Another important methodological change was the testing instruments used in Leow et al. (2008) and then replicated in Morgan-Short et al. (2012). Specifically, these two studies included a new passage in which a monosyllabic word sol (sun) was used as was a new grammatical form, $l o$ , a direct object clitic pronoun meaning “it”. In addition, the post-recall protocol was replaced with a multiple-choice comprehension test to address the low number of recalls produced in VanPatten (1990). Morgan-Short et al. also adapted think-aloud protocols to elicit concurrent data on learners’ attentional allocation during the comprehension process. These changes aimed to address methodological challenges such as the differential salience of the targeted forms, the uneven distribution of the targeted forms in the passage, and the low reliability of using the recall protocol to assess comprehension. However, these changes in the research design were recently argued to have completely changed the meaning variable the seminal study focused (Sanz & McCormick, 2021).

# 2.3 Multisite replication of Morgan-Short et al. (2018): Initial study

Given the high replication value of VanPatten (1990) and the mixed results yielded by the above-reviewed independent replications, the initial study revisited the issue of whether attending to L2 lexical and morphosyntactic forms negatively influenced L2 meaning comprehension. They adapted the experimental materials used in Leow et al. (2008) and Morgan-Short et al. (2012) but excluded the grammatical form lo and extended the replication to both the aural and written modes. A more important objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of using a multisite replication approach in the second language acquisition (SLA) field. The study was conducted at seven sites across three countries—the US, the UK and Poland—with four sites using the aural mode and three using a timed written mode. It also used a registered set of methodological protocols including all the materials, testing procedures, and planned analyses.

The findings of the initial study, summarized in Table 2, are thought-provoking. In general, the initial study in both the aural and written modes reproduced the findings in Leow et al. (2008) and Morgan-Short et al. (2012) and concluded that attending to forms has no effect on meaning comprehension. The conclusion of the initial study, based on the results from multisite endeavors and more than one analytic approach, is a prudent and reliable generalization because it avoids overly interpreting site-specific results as the population effect. However, consistent evidence for the general conclusion needs further investigation, especially for sites using the aural mode, for several reasons. First, the site-specific results in the aural mode need to be explained and investigated. For example, the UK2 site showed a tentatively small effect on comprehension of attending to la from the relatively small sample sizes. The results of the Poland site were also gathered from small sample sizes. In addition, the testing

instructional language, English, was the L1 to some participants and the L2 to other participants across the sites. More importantly, the initial study extended the research to populations learning Spanish as an L3 with different L1 and L2 backgrounds at the Poland site. Learners’ prior language configurations implied cross-linguistic influences in explaining the inconsistent results, suggesting that further investigation was needed from this aspect.

# 2.4 Cross-linguistic influence in explaining form–meaning relations

Learners at the Poland site of the initial study were uniformly L3 Spanish learners who had more than one prior language system available as the source of the influence on learning the L3. Therefore, the cross-linguistic influence may provide optional explanations for the inconsistent site-specific results in the initial study.

Cross-linguistic influence, interchangeably used with language transfer (Odlin, 2005), refers to the influence of an individual’s sequentially acquired first language on L2 processing and representation. When learners are required to process input when learning an L3, the two L1 and L2 systems are available as influence sources on the acquisition of the target feature in the L3. Similarity overall or at the level of specific properties between the languages is considered one of the substantial variables for addressing the question of the morphosyntactic transfer in learning additional languages (Ln) (Puig-Mayenco, González Alonso & Rothman, 2020). In terms of which prior language is the source of transfer, the Typological Primacy Model (Rothman, 2011, 2015), for example, proposes that previously acquired languages are all available for transfer at the initial level of L3 learning. The linguistic parser selects which of these language sources has the higher degree of typological (structural) proximity, i.e., underlying grammatical similarity, after enough linguistic information has been accumulated. In this account, for L3 Spanish learners, if their prior learned

L2 has a grammatical form, e.g., the definite article, their L2 knowledge may be available for transfer when learning the article in L3 Spanish, even if their L1 has no such form. When these learners are required to attend to the grammatical form in meaning comprehension, the processing may be less effortful because they have established the L2 knowledge of this form; hence, the processing of the form may not be in tension with the simultaneous processing of meaning cues.

However, research applying the Unified Competition Model (MacWhinney, 2005, 2012), which predicts a general performance advantage when processing a similar L1 feature in an L2, has provided different empirical evidence to account for multilingual learning. For example, in Sanz et al.’s (2015) longitudinal study, ab initio L3 Latin learners were L1 English speakers grouped by their two typologically different L2s (i.e., Japanese and Spanish). The study found that learners’ processing of cues (i.e., subject–verb–object word order, subject–verb agreement, and nominal case assignment) for thematic role assignments in L3 Latin were largely and continuously modulated by their L1 English, a language that uses word order as the preferred cue. This was true even though their different L2 knowledge, either Japanese or Spanish, relied on case and agreement cues, respectively. The study evidenced that the L1 cue was the most valid source of transfer in the L3 processing despite the closer typological relationship between the L2 and L3. Thus, L3 Spanish learners with an L1 lacking article use, e.g., L1 Chinese, may experience problems in learning the article form in L3 Spanish after learning English (e.g., the L2). Even though these learners have learned a similar grammatical form in the L2, their attending to the article may still be effortful and would constrain their meaning comprehension when they are required to attend to form while processing meaning.

# 2.5 Current study

The current study aims to replicate the initial study in the aural mode in a population of L3 Spanish learners with L1 Chinese and L2 English backgrounds. This learner population had the same L2, i.e., English, but a different L1 than that of the L3 Spanish learning site, i.e., Poland site, in the initial study. Therefore, this study may provide further evidence to test the plausibility of the PMP and the generalizability of the conclusions from the initial study in a broader Spanish-learning context.

Furthermore, following the registered protocol and using the materials available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) page of the initial multisite study (https://osf.io/tvuer), the current study provided data clustered with that from the initial study to synthesize the results. Benefiting from the data-sharing practice in the initial study, we used a larger sample size to overcome the major problem of the small sample size of the Poland site in the initial study, a frequently observed problem in the SLA field (Plonsky, 2013). This practice echoed the call to use a multisite replication paradigm to solve the small dataset problem (Moranski & Ziegler, 2020) and to use data from the initial studies in the new analyses (Marsden et al., 2018).

In light of the above rationale, the current study replicated the aural mode of the initial study and revisited the form–meaning relation with the following research questions:

1) To what extent does learners’ attending to form have an effect on their simultaneous listening comprehension of the L3 Spanish input in the current study? 2) To what extent does the initial finding change if the results from the two L3 Spanish sites, i.e., the current study and the Poland site from the initial study, are computed to the statistical clustering effect?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1 Participants

From a foreign language university in China, 138 Spanish majors were recruited in years 1, 2, and 3. They all started learning Spanish in their first year of college (Mlength of instruction $= 1 . 7 2$ years, $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 9$ , Range: 1-3 years). Before learning Spanish, all the participants had at least three years of English instructional learning experience (Mlength of instruction $= 8 . 6 1$ years, $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 7 7$ , Range: 3-15 years). According to their reports of their scores on English proficiency exams—e.g., the College Entrance Exam and College English Test Bands 4 and 6 authorized by the Chinese Educational Ministry—the participants’ English proficiency level in the current study could be interpreted as low to medium, equivalent to Grade 4-5 according to China’s Standards of English Language Ability (National Education Examinations Authority of China 2018). We followed the registered protocol to exclude seven participants who did not complete the study as instructed (three participants for not making any check marks or answering questions in the experimental conditions, and four participants for taking notes while listening). Nine participants who made fewer than six check marks in the experimental conditions were also excluded from the analysis. After removing these outliers, we included the data of 122 participants (females $= 9 8$ ; $\mathrm { M _ { a g e } } = 2 0 . 0 6$ ; $\mathrm { S D } =$ 0.87) for the final analysis. The sample size in the current study was larger than that at most of the aural sites in the initial study except one site in the US.

# 3.2 Materials

The registered aural packet of the initial study included (a) a biodata form to collect the participants’ language background information; (b) an audio file for the aural test consisting of 358 words in 23 sentences (Each target form (the lexical item sol and the grammatical definite article la) appeared ten times and was distributed evenly across four paragraphs.); (c) the condition-specific instructions, the

comprehension paper test, and the proficiency paper test. The comprehension test was a 10-item multiple choice test that focused on comprehending the content of the passage. Except for the audio file and the proficiency test items in Spanish, the other materials—including the biodata form, comprehension test items and all conditionspecific instructions—were in English. For site-specific use purposes, we translated the English materials into Chinese, the L1 of our participants. This was done to ensure that the instructional language in the testing procedure aligned with that in the leading US and UK sites, i.e., that the participants received testing instructions in their L1. The reliability coefficient of our test was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson 20 formula, and the alpha level was .236, which was higher than the two US sites $\mathrm { ( U S l = }$ -.119, $\mathrm { U S } 3 = . 1 5 3$ ) but lower than the UK $( \mathrm { U K } 2 = . 2 9 8 )$ and Poland site $\mathrm { \Delta P O L = }$ .596) in the initial study. The adapted materials and the dataset of the current study can be freely downloaded in the IRIS Database (http://www.iris-database.org).

# 3.3 Procedure

The participants in this study were randomly grouped into three testing conditions. Condition 1, as the control group, consisted of listening to the passage for content comprehension only. Condition 2 consisted of listening to the passage for content and simultaneously noting the key lexical item sol. Condition 3 consisted of listening to the passage for content and simultaneously noting the definite article la. Then, strictly following the procedure in the registered protocol, all of the participants provided informed consent and completed the biodata form. Next, they received their condition-specific packet and completed a short practice test. After that, the participants listened to the comprehension passage and made check marks according to the instructions for their respective condition. Once they had finished listening to the passage, they completed the paper-and-pencil comprehension and Spanish

proficiency tests at their own pace.

# 3.4 Data coding and analysis

An Excel template file included in the registered protocol was used, and it contained the participants’ language background information, the number of check marks each participant made, and manually entered scores on the comprehension and proficiency tests. In both tests, one point (zero) was given for a correct (incorrect) answer. The initial study datasets were also used and compared with the results of the current study.

To answer RQ1 about whether attending to form had an effect on meaning comprehension, an analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was conducted to examine whether there were differences between conditions. Assumptions (normality of distribution and equal variances for ANOVAs) were tested before conducting these tests. The alpha level was set at 0.05. Second, a Cohen’s $d$ with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval (CI) was calculated to measure the standardized effect size of each experimental condition compared to the control condition. The benchmarks suggested by Plonsky and Oswald (2014) were adopted for interpreting the magnitude of the effect sizes in the between-group comparisons in the L2 research, with . $. 4 0 < d < . 7 0$ suggesting a small effect; . $. 7 0 < d < 1 . 0 0$ , a medium effect; and $d \ge 1 . 0 0$ , a large effect.

To answer RQ2 about the clustering statistical effect of the current study and the Poland site in the initial study, we aggregated the effect sizes across the conditions in both studies. Using a web application (Mizumoto, 2015), random-effects metaanalyses were run to synthesize the effect sizes from these two L3 Spanish sites.

# 4. Results

# 4.1 Participants’ Spanish proficiency

The Spanish proficiency test scores by percentage averaged .72 $9 5 \%$ CI [.70, .74],

$S D = . 1 8$ , $N = 1 2 2$ ) in the current study. The result was compared with the participants’ scores from the Poland site (see Table 3). Independent samples $t { \cdot }$ -tests did not reveal statistically significant differences $( t ( 1 6 3 ) = 1 . 5 1$ , two-tailed $p = . 1 4 )$ between the results from these two sites.

# 4.2 Variance and effect sizes between conditions

To answer RQ1, following the analysis protocol in the aural paradigm, we ran a one-way ANOVA with one between-subjects variable (condition) for all of the participants’ comprehension scores in the control condition and those with at least six check marks in the experimental conditions (see the descriptive results of the current study in Table 4). The results yielded a statistical effect of the condition $( F ( 2 , 1 1 9 ) =$ $3 . 6 8 , p = . 0 3 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 )$ , which showed statistically significant differences in comprehension scores resulting from attending to a lexical or a grammatical form compared to attending to meaning only. The post hoc Games-Howell test in the current replication showed that the comprehension accuracy score was significantly different $( p = . 0 2 )$ at the level of .05 when the la condition was compared to the control condition.

The Cohen’s $d$ with a $9 5 \%$ CI was also calculated to obtain the effect size of each experimental condition compared to the control condition in the current study. The results in Table 5 indicate that only the effect size of attending to the grammatical form la compared to the control condition $\zeta d = - . 6 1$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [-1.06, -.16]) was above the benchmark value of .40 for a small effect, and its $9 5 \%$ CI did not include zero. This result indicated that attending to la had a notably negative effect on meaning comprehension in comparison with attending to meaning only, and the magnitude of the effect size was small to medium. This effect was also consistent with the result of the post hoc Games-Howell test.

# 4.3 Clustering the effect sizes of the results at the L3 Spanish sites

To answer RQ2, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to synthesize the effect sizes (in Table 5) for attending to the sol and la conditions compared to the control condition across the current study and Poland site. The forest plot in Figure 1 provides a visual summary of the clustering effect size $\cdot d = - . 0 8$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [- .68, .52]) for the sol vs. the control condition, which was close to zero and did not show a notable effect. However, in Figure 2, the meta-analytical effect size for the la vs. the control condition $\left[ d ( a - . 5 1 \right.$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [-.89, -.13]) demonstrated a reliable small to medium effect size, with a Cohen’s $d$ value over the .40 benchmark for a small effect. The clustering results from these two studies indicated that attending to la had a small-tomedium effect that negatively influenced meaning comprehension in comparison with attending to meaning only, while attending to sol had a negligible effect on meaning comprehension.

# 5. Discussion

The present study intended to determine whether learners’ attending to a lexical or grammatical form interferes with listening comprehension. The results supported that learners’ attending to the lexical form sol did not inhibit their simultaneous meaning comprehension, which was in line with the finding in the initial study. However, the current study provided evidence that overall, the participants in the two experimental conditions and those in the control group exhibited a statistically countable variance in comprehension, which did not support the general conclusion of the initial study. The results cast specific doubt on the generalizability of the finding in the initial study that attending to the unbound grammatical form la is not detrimental to listening comprehension.

Interestingly, the results in the current study were consistent with the findings in the seminal study of VanPatten (1990), although in the current study, the passages and comprehension measures used were different from those in that study. Our results seemed to offer support for the plausibility of the PMP, which proposes that meaning comes before form in L2 input processing (VanPatten, 2004). Furthermore, the current study provided counterevidence to question the generalizability of the findings yielded by the stream of replications using the materials and measures refined since Leow et al. (2008). We argued that the inconclusive findings may not only result from the methodological challenges in the replications that may leave learners with vital limited resources to focus on form or the less-reliable measure of comprehension, as asserted in Sanz & McCormick (2021). Instead, other additional factors, such as cross-linguistic influences of the prior acquired language may be worth consideration in scrutinizing the plausibility of VanPatten’s theoretical framework on form–meaning relations.

# 5.2 Cross-linguistic Influence in Attending to the Definite Article

The initial study offered methodological explanations that the findings may not be generalizable to learners (a) with an L1 other than English, (b) who have learned other L2s, or (c) who are not reading the comprehension questions in their L1. The current study used the same registered materials as the initial study except for one change: we translated the comprehension test items and all the testing instructions into the participants’ L1 Chinese. This change responded to the proposed condition in (c). We aggregated the results of the current study and those of the Poland site, which responded to the learner populations in (a) and (b). The pairwise comparison results in the current study and the clustering effect size of both L3 Spanish sites support that the findings of the initial study may not be generalizable to the L3 learner population.

A possible explanation for the results of the current study could be the difficulty of processing articles in Spanish for the L1 Chinese participants because their L1 does not have a functional article system. From the view of cross-linguistic influence in L3 learning, knowledge of the typologically similar form of the definite article in learners’ L2 English seemed not to have helped them attend to an article in their Spanish learning in the current study given that the participants’ L2 English proficiency was at the low-to-medium level. These learners’ L1 Chinese, a language lacking an article system, might still have impeded learners’ attending to an article in the later learned Spanish, making it difficult for them to process definite articles while attending to meaning. This explanation is supported by research on cross-linguistic influence in L3 acquisition. For example, the ab initio learners in Sanz et al. (2015) demonstrated a continuous reliance on their L1-based strategies, even though their L2-based strategy was more reliable in terms of yielding successful form–meaning connections in learning the L3.

# 5.3 Limitations

Some limitations should be addressed in future studies and in multisite research using registered paradigms to test form–meaning processing models.

First, the low reliability coefficient level $( \mathrm { K R } 2 0 = . 2 4 )$ in the current study is much lower than the aggregated reliability coefficients of the instrument of listening skill (.77) in Plonsky & Derrick’s (2016) meta-analysis of reliability coefficients, as reported in the published L2 research. The particularly low comprehension score in the current study, consistent with the generally low comprehension scores across all the sites in the initial study, suggests the high difficulty level of the test and the possibility that guessing may have negatively impacted reliability (Bush, 2015). This issue raises a methodological concern for the general claim regarding whether

attending to form affects comprehension, hence suggesting the necessity of fully piloting comprehension assessment to ensure the acceptable reliability of the comprehension test. Future studies may wish to use other fine-grained psycholinguistic or neuroimaging paradigms to reveal learners’ attention patterns. Methodological evaluations are needed to establish the inference of the attention to meaning and/or form before the measurement of its effect on meaning comprehension, as suggested in Leow et al. (2008) and in Sanz & McCormick (202

Second, the instructions and reading comprehension questions were presented in learners’ L1 in the current study, which was not consistent with the language used in the Poland site in the initial study. We did not control the L2 English proficiency to the consistent level of the Poland site, which may confound the results. In addition, owing to the exploratory nature of the current replication, the post hoc interpretation remains speculative of the effect of learners’ prior language(s) knowledge in explaining the site-specific differences.

Finally, the present study was a partial replication that did not include the investigation of attending to the verb morpheme -n condition in the initial study. It was conducted only aurally without a chance to further explore the issue in both aural and written modalities. Since modalities differ not only in the way information is delivered but also in the speed of presentation, time of exposure, and opportunity for backtracking (Morgan-Short et al., 2018), future studies should incorporate both modalities into one complete research design with a single participant population.

# 5.4 Implications

The current study practically addresses several methodological concerns in replications. A larger sample size $( N { = } 1 2 2 )$ ) than the initial study was recruited, and doing so helped to eliminate low power as a potential explanation of the resulting anomalies. The lack of overlap in authorship between the initial and the current study can avoid the potential bias toward finding a particular outcome in the replication, which has been pointed out in the replication syntheses in SLA (e.g., Marsden et al., 2018).

The pedagogical implications of the current replication relate to the evolution of the theory of the form–meaning relations that is essential to fuel teaching practice. This line of research provides empirical evidence to enrich the understanding of form–meaning relations and inform the rationale of pedagogical solutions, such as the necessity of instructional intervention to learners’ attention and its effectiveness and cost as related to learning outcomes. By closely replicating the previous research with participants with diverse language backgrounds, the current study may have a better chance of informing the instructional design that foregrounds the role learners’ attention plays in a wider language learning context.

# 6. Conclusion

The present study partially replicated Morgan-Short et al. (2018) with a new population of Chinese L1 learners learning Spanish as an additional foreign language after they learned English. It revisited the question of whether the comprehension of Spanish input is negatively affected if learners are required to simultaneously attend to form and meaning while listening to the input. The results supported the finding in the initial study that simultaneously attending to a lexical form and meaning would not inhibit meaning comprehension. However, a small-to-medium effect size was found when the participants attended simultaneously to meaning and a grammatical form as compared to when the participants attended to meaning alone. This finding supported the conclusion of VanPatten’s (1990) seminal study that attending to a grammatical form has a negative effect on meaning comprehension. In addition to the explanation that limited attentional resources can be directed to meaning when learners are required to attend to grammatical form, this result can be explained from the perspective of cross-linguistic influence. Specifically, when a learner from an L1 that lacks a grammatical form, i.e., the definite article, attempts to learn an L3 that has the form, i.e., Spanish, it may negatively affect the learner’s simultaneous meaning comprehension. This relationship holds true even when a previously learned L2, i.e., English, uses the article and shares a typological similarity with this targeted form in the L3.

As a partial replication of a registered multisite replication study, the current investigation to some degree tests the generalizability of the previous findings and provides partial evidence in a different foreign language learning context. The lower reliability coefficient of the comprehension test in the present study, however, poses a methodological challenge to the construct validity in line with research examining the form–meaning connections in L2 input processing. Further investigation is needed to conduct research with a single participant population in both aural and written modalities. Planned analyses are greatly needed of cross-linguistic influence in form– meaning relations in L3 learning with controlled L1 and L2 configurations and proficiency levels.

# Notes:

1. A close replication is opposed to an approximate or a conceptual replication and is described in detail in Porte & McManus (2019). 2. We followed the suggestion in Marsden et al. (2018) and used “initial study” to describe the to-be-replicated study of Morgan-Short et al. (2018), rather than “original study”, which may be misunderstood as referring to the seminal study of VanPatten

3. The initial study investigated the effects of simultaneously attending to a lexical item $( s o l )$ , a syntactic item $( l a )$ and a morphological verbal ending $( - n )$ in meaning comprehension. In the current study, the data in the -n condition were excluded because a translation mistake in the testing instructions was found after the data were collected, which may have mistakenly caused more check marks. This exclusion did not allow the current study to completely investigate the research question posed in the initial study. The investigation was therefore refocused on the effect of attending to the lexical and syntactic item in comparison with meaning comprehension only. The data in the $- n$ condition in the initial study were excluded to form a comparable data analysis in the current study.
