EAP writing research and pedagogy

This study explores the possibility of integrating pattern grammar and local grammar into construction grammar research and the value of such research for EAP writing pedagogy. Using data taken from a corpus compiled from Linguistics research articles, our study shows that local grammar analyses of grammar patterns help to identify 'pattern-meaning' combinations. We further describe the functions of such combinations in academic contexts and argue that they can be interpreted as constructions at the mid-level of specificity. We also demonstrate the organisation of these constructions into a constructicon for pedagogical purposes. The implications and applications are subsequently discussed, highlighting in particular that the constructicon not only offers an inventory of pattern-meaning pairings available to express meanings, but also provides quantitative information about the association between verbs and constructions. Overall, our study indicates that the integration of pattern grammar, local grammar and construction grammar could be of immense potential value for EAP writing research and pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

This paper reports on an exploratory study that explores the possibility of integrating pattrn grammar (Hunston & Francis, 2000), local grammar (Hunston, 2002; Hunston & Su, 2019) and construction grammar (Goldberg, 1995, 2006) into the development of a pedagogical onstructicon, i., a listor network of constructions (Lyngfelt et al., 2018), in EAP context. It aims to show that the local grammar analyses of grammar patterns can facilitate the identification of constructions and the subsequent development of constructicon. It willalsodiscuss the implications and applications of this line of research for EAP writing pedagogy. The study partly aligns with those EAP writing studies which have revealed lists of lexicogrammatical resources such as academic formulas (Simp. son-Vlach & Ellis 2010), academic colocations (Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Lei & Liu, 2018), phrase frames (Cunningham, 2017; Lu et a., 2018) and mult-word units (Rogers et a., 2021). More mportantly, the study aligns with existing research that has agued for an applied or pedagogical construction grammar (e.g., Boas, 2022; De Knop & Gilquin, 2016; Holme, 2010) and moves much further to develop a pedagogical constructicon (Patten & Perek, 2022).

The rationale of doing so relates to the basic argument made in construction grammar that the knowledge of a language is the knowledge of constructions (Goldberg, 1995, 2006). Accordingly, constructions should be the focus of language teaching and learning (Ellis et a., 2016, p. 45). I neds to be pointed out however, that onstruction grammar has only described in detail a relatively smal number of constructions. As Hunston (2019: 324) notes f construction grammar \*is to be made of use by the language pedagogy community, then a way of extending those descriptions to be equivalent to the coverage of more standard grammars of English [.. must be found'. To that end, Hunston's (2019: 334) proposal is toalign patten grammar with construction grammar, noting that \*the pattern-meaning combination can be used as the basis for identifying candidate constructions'. For instance, Hunston's (2019) analyses of the pattern V n of n identified three candidate constructions, as shown in Table 1.

An important notion here is pattern-meaning combination', which involves the maping of meaning elements onto pattern ele. ments, as ilustrated in Table1. We agre that such meaning elements ae useful for analysing grammar patterns, which can i turn lead to the establishment of pattern-meaning combination. However, it is unclear how such meaning elements can be proposed or identified; or in Hunston's (2019: 336) own words, \*the choice of meaning element labels [..] may be controversial'. In consequence, one potential problem that needs to be further addressed relates to the identification of meaning elements for analysing grammar patterns. To address this ssue, we argue that the currently emerging local grammar research would be useful for identifying such meaning elements and that analysing grammar patterns from a local grammar perspective could help to identify pattern-meaning combinations, i.e., candidate constructions, in a more principled and finer-grained manner. In fact, Hunston (2019) does mention that the identification of semantic elements is influenced by work on local grammar, in addition to others such as frame semantics (Fillmore et al, 2003) and corpus patten analysis (Hanks, 2013). More notably, Hunston and Su (2019) have already applied local grammars into the analyses of adjective complementation patterns, which shows that such analyses can contribute to identifying evaluative constructions.

Therefore, in this study we draw on and extend Hunston and Su's (2019) and Hunston's (2019) discussion to identify constructions that are contxt-pcific,.., constructions that are useful for languag teching and lenng in spific context. Sificall, we take the grammar patern V that (e.g., argue that, sugest that, note that) as the starting point and analyse instances of V that from the local grammar perspective, aiming to identify constructions and develop a constructicon that are useful for academic writing teaching. Generall speaking, verbs occurring in this pattern are roughly regarded as reporting verbs; hence the reason for focusing on this particular grammar pattern is partly because reporting has been shown to be an important convention and strategy for making an academic text accessible and convincing (Batchelor, 2023; Thompson & Ye, 1991). In particular, Hyland (2002) noted the importance of appropriate uses of reporting verbs in academic writing,

The selection of a particular reporting verb is a delicate choice as it is acrucial means of both situating one's work appropriately and communicating with one's pr effectively, a way of engaging with colleagues and of appealing to the epistemological and interactive understandings of one's community.

(Hyland, 2002, p. 130)

In addition, research has revealed that V that occurs quite frequently in academic discourse (e.g., Charles, 2006a, b). As such, focusing onthat could greatly help showcase how the local grammar analyes of grammar pattes can facilitate h identificationof constructions and the subsequent development of constructicon. It could also help explore the pedagogical value of the kind of constructicon developed for EAP writing pedagogy.

The remainder of the paper is organised into five further sections. In Section 2 we introduce pattern grammar,construction grammar and local grammar, and discuss their similarities and differences, aiming to provide the theoretical background for the current investigation. Section 3 reviews previous studies that have explored the pedagogical value of either pattern grammar, construction grammar or local grammar in EAP context. Section 4 discusses the data and methodology used in the current investigation. Section 5 presents the local grammar analyse of the V that pattern and discusses how the analyses can help to identify constructions and the subsequent development of constructicon. In addition, the implications and applications of the current research will be dis cussed in detail, highlighting in particular its value for both construction grammar research and EAP writing pedagogy. Section 6 concludes the study and points out directions for future studies.

# 2. Pattern grammar, construction grammar and local grammar

This section discusses briely pattern grammar,construction grammar, and local grammar (see also Su & Wei, 2023). Pattern grammar was built on earlier works such as Sinclair (1991), Francis (1993) and Hunston and Francis (1998). It was later on systematically described in Hunston and Francis (2000) and was established as an approach to English language description that pri. oritises the behaviour of individual words. According to Hunston and Francis,

The patterns of a word can be defined as al the words and structures which are regularly associated with the word and which contribute to its meaning. A pattern can be identified if a combination of words occurs relatively frequently, if it i dependent on a particular word choice, and if there is a clear meaning associated with it.

(Hunston & Francis, 2000, p. 37)

This indicates clearly the criteria for pattern identification: frequency, co-selection of word choices, and meaning dependency, which provides the basis for excluding those instances which look similar i terms of surface structure but are not real instances of a given pattern (see Section 4 for more discussion).

Two major observations made in pattern grammar are the inseparabilit between lexis and grammar and the association between pattern and meaning, which are iscussed in turn. One example that Hunston and Francis (2000) used t illustrate the first observation is the phrase want to. They noticed that want often co-occurs with atoinfinitie clause; however it is unclear \*whether this i a fact about lexi (the collocation of want and to) or a fact about grammar (ibid: 251). Much evidence has been presented to illstrate the second observation. Most notably, Francis e al. (1996, 1998) have shown that words occurring in each pattern can be divided into a limited number of meaning groups.

Despite the innovation for describing English language offred by, and notable observations (especially the pattern-meaning association) made in, pattern grammar, one of the criticisms that pattern grammar faces is that the proposed meaning groups for each pattern were not guided by any semantic information (Teubert, 2007). Hunston similarly notes that,

One of the issues in pattern grammar research is the relationship between pattern and semantic classfication. Francis et al. (1996, 1998) somewhat naively group words into ad hoc 'meaning groups'. This has led to criticism [.] that the groupings are misleading because they appear to propagate the mistaken assumption that meaning belongs to single words and that groups of words can 'mean the same thing', as well as ignoring aspects of semantic and grammatical theory that might more usefully inform the description.

(Hunston, 2011, p. 123)

This points to the ned to integrate semantic analysis into the proposal of meaning groups associated with each grammar pattern. We argue that local grammars can offer such semantic analysis that can usefully guide the proposal of meaning groups for each pattern, based on the assumption that words sharing a given local grammar pattern can be grouped into the same meaning group, as wil be discussed in greater detail in Section 5.

The second notion that needs to be made clear is construction grammar. On the one hand, pattern grammar and construction grammar are in many ways similar to each other. For example, they both reject the traditional distinction made between lexis and grammar and emphasize the connection between form/pattern and meaning. On the other hand, the two are diferent, in that patten grammar is more concerned with language patternings that are observable in actual language use, whereas construction grammar is more concerned with the mental representation of such patternings (see also Hunston, 2014).

The theoretical origin of construction grammar can be traced back to the work of Fillmore, in particular case grammar (Fillmore, 1968) and frame semantics (Fillmore et al., 2003), as well as Langacker's (1987, 1991) cognitie grammar see more discussion in Ungerer & Hartmann, 2023). It must also be pointed out that there are many approaches to construction grammar (see Hoffmann & Trousdale [2013] for more discussion) and the approach that we draw on is that of Goldberg (1995, 2006). Simply put, constructions are form-meaning pairings (Goldberg, 1995), defining criteria of which are further elaborated:

Any linguistic pattern is recognized as a construction as long as some aspects of it form or function is not strictly predictable from its component part or from other constructions recognized to exist. In addition, patterns are stored as constructions even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with sufficient frequency.

(Goldberg, 2006, p. 5)

Like pattern grammar, the definition of construction also points to the criteria for identifying constructions, i.e, form-meaning pairing, unpredictability of meaning, and frequency of occurrence. In particular, Goldberg's (2006) observation that frequently occurring paterns can also be stored as constructions lends support to our proposal of taking grammar patterns as the starting point to identify constructions. As will be shown below, we rely on these criteria for identifying constructions.

Constructions can occur at different levels of complexity, ranging from morphemes and words to phrases and abstract syntactic patterns, and even to texts or genres; or in Goldberg's (2006: 18) words, \*its constructions al the way down'. onstructions that hae been examined include those specific ones such as 'accident waiting to happen' as well s those general ones such as the ditransitive?

construction (e., Goldberg, 2006). Hunston and Su (2019) commented on this multi-level aproach of construction grammar, noting that this i both an advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is that all of lexis and grammar can be described in a single model. without the need for an elaborate system of grammatical levels or ranks", whereas the drawbackis that \*the number of potential constructions is vast, and a listing of them all sems an impossible task" (ibid: 570). In other words, this constructions-include-all approach inevitably raises the question of how tosystematicall identify constructions. This paper will ddress this isue and argue that the kind of pattern-meaning combination offered by local grammar analysis can help us to identify constructions at a mid-level of speficity,.., thse constuctions whch ar ethr ogeral  daitive onstrction nr oo scific ., contrtions at the morpheme or word level).

In construction grammar, language is seen as an inventory of constructions, defined as form-meaning/function pairings, and language learning is i esence a piecemeal, frequency-biased proces of accumulating these constructions (Liu & Lu, 2020, p. 1). If language is seen as an inventory of onstructions, then identifying constructions and developing pedagogical constructicon would be essential for language teaching and learning. It is then not surprising that much efort has been made to develop constructicons e., Lyngfelt et al., 2018). In theenterprise of developing constructicon in English, reearchers have either relied upon FrameNet (Filmore et al., 2012) or combined frames with grammar patterns (Perek & Patten, 2019). In the present study we propose an alternative approach to identify constructions and apply it to develop constructicon in academic context. Our proposed approach starts from the selection of grammar patterns, then the local grammar analyses of the selected pattern, subsequently the re-interpretation of pattern-meaning combination as constructions, and finally to organise the identified constructions into a constructicon, as willbe demonstrated in Section 5.

The third notion that the present study draws upon i local grammar. Briefly, local grammar is an alternative approach, as opposed to traditional or general grammars, to describing language use that seeks to account for one meaning or function only (Hunston, 2002). In other words, unlike general grammars which seek to generalise rules that govern language use in various contexts, each local grammar aims to describe a subset of language usethat is assciated with a specific meaning or function. The most notable difference between the two lies in the analysis. Specificall, general grammars use terms such as Subject, Predicate and Object to linguistic analysis and description, whereas local grammars use context-specific functional terms to analyse language use associated with a specific meaning or function. Compared with general grammar analysis, the advantage of local grammar analysis pertains to the revelation of the discourse function of the utterance under examination. For instance.

(1) I'm sorry that our time is up. (KRL 4562) (2) I'm pleased that that's been clarified. (JAC 417)

The general grammar analysis and the alternative local grammar analysis of the two examples are presented in Table 2.

There are two points worth noting here. First, although Table 2(a) is only a simplistic rendering of general grammar analysis it shows that general grammar offers a way to describe language uses that may have different functions or meanings; such that the Subject - Predicate - Complement sequence can not only be used to describe expressions that are related to emotion-reporting, but also to expressions that are rlated to apology-making. The shortcoming, however, of the general grammar analysis is that such an analysis cannot reveal the distinction between the discourse function of expressions that look structurall similar. In contrast the kind of analysis offred by local grammars can more easily reveal the discourse function of the two instances although it is more restricted or specialised. Second, the kind of local grammar analysis leads to the establishment of pattern-meaning combination, or local grammar paterns, which connects closely form with functin. As construction is primarily defined as form-meaning/function pairing, it can thus be argued that this kind of pattern-meaning combination can be recognised as constructions (se also Hunston, 2019; Hunston & Su, 2019). This is the main argument of the present study, and in Section 5 we demonstrate how local grammar analyses of grammar patterns can help to establish patten-meaning combinations, which in turn leads to the identification of constructions and the development of constructicon.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that local grammar analysis is consistent with the thematic role analysis used in construction grammar.? For instance, construction grammar uses thematic roles such as Agent, Recipient, Beneficiary etc. to analyse argument structure constructions (Goldberg, 1995, 2006). The difference between the kind of functional analysis in local grammar and that in construction grammar lies in the functional terms used in each. Basiall, local grammar uses functionally more transparent but less general, context-specific terminologies, whereas construction grammar uses more general but functionall es transparent ones. Nevertheless, the fact that both involve functional analysis indicates the compatibility between local grammar and construction grammar research.

In this section we have briefly introduced the three approaches and discussed the similarities and differences between them, providing the theoretical background for the subsequent discussion. To recapitulate, pattern grammar and construction grammar share the viewpoints that lexis and grammar are inseparable and that form/pattern and meaning are associated, whereas they diffr from each other with regard to the kind of pattenings each focuses on, i.e. patten grammar focuses on patternings that are observable in actual language use whereas construction grammar on the mental representation of such pattenings. Local grammar and construction grammar are similar in that each involves the use of functional terms to analyse language use, though differing in the degree of transparency and generalisability of the functional terms used in each.

# 3. Pattern grammar, construction grammar and local grammar in EAP context

There have already been a few studies which explored the value of either pattern grammar, construction grammar, or local grammar in EAP writing research and pedagogy. For example, Green (2019) offered a systematic description of the grammatical patterns of those academic vocabularies identified in the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 200) and Secondary Vocabulary List (Green & Lambert, 2018), and further translated the grammatical description into a pedagogical resource for vocabulary teaching and learning. In another study, Ma and Qian (2020) proposed a method for extracting grammar pattrns and applied it tocreate alist of grammar patterns for verbs that frequently occur in academic writing. Liu and Lu (2020) moved even further. They presented an attempt that combined pattern grammar and construction grammar to the analyses of N1 of N2 construction in disciplinary academic writing. Their analyses lead to the identification of five functional categories, including Event, Support, Focus, Proper nouns and Quantfication/lassfication. What is partcularl worth nting is that thr study offeed "support for theefectivens of the patten grammar pproach to phraseology and to the development of pedagogicall useful onstructions of academic English (Liu & Lu, 2020, p. 10). In the present study we further explore how pattern grammar can contribute to identfying constructions in a more systematic and principled manner.

In addition to those studies which explored the pedagogical application of pattern grammar and construction grammar, there have also been few studies which have either attempted to assess second language (L2) writing quality by examining constructional complexity or to develop profiles of English verb argument constructions (VACs) in academic contexts. For instance, Mostafa and Crossley (2020) used VAC-based indices to measure writing quality and found that the rlationship between VAC-based predictors and L2 writing quality is rgly task-deendent. Casal e al. (2022) examind gnre anddiscipline ffets on the use f11 ACs in research articles across four disciplines. Their investigation revealed that vers occurring in each VAC differ considerably across general and specialised corpora and that there is a strong disciplinary effect on the use of VACs across disciplines, such as the frequency of VACs vary across disciplines, and VACs ocur more frequently in social science RAs. Based on the pervasiveness and productivity of VACs, Casal et al. argue that VACs have significant pedagogical value and the VAC list provided in Francis et al. (1996) i highly beneficial.

As discussed in Section 2, the present study also draws on insights from local grammar which has been increasingly applied in EAP writing reearch. Existing studies that used local grammar in academic discourse studies maily focused on the description of discourse acts, i.e, rhetorical function such as giving examples, defining terms, making comparison and contrat, etc. For instance, Su and Zhang (2020) used the local grammar approach to describe how academic writers give examples to illsrate or support an argument/proposition or to specify abstract superordinate categories. Similarly, Zhang and Su (2022) employed the local grammar approach to describe the lingustic realisations of definition in Linguistics reearch articles. Another line of research that applied local grammar to academic discourse studies focused on investigating the similaritie and differences between EFL learners and expert writers use of discourse acts in academic writing. For instance, Su et al. (2022) explored the ways in which Chinese EFL learners and expert writers provide examples and found that, although the two groups of writers used exemplification at similar frequency, Chinese EFL learners appear to be not as familiar as expert writers with the strategy of exemplifying by citing relevant studie. In contrast, Zhang and Su's (2023) investigation into Chinese EFL learners' and expert writrs use of definition revealed a diffrent picture, that Chinese EFL learners performed definition much more frequently than expert writers did, which is likely due to that EFL learners may consider definition \*a general writing strategy - a filler' strategy - to meet the size requirements of the writig task (Adel, 206, p. 110).

What these studies have shown is that, first, local grammars are useful for documenting and describing the linguistic realisations of a given discourse act, and the resulting local grammars make available to EFL learners an inventory of the lexicogrammatical real. isations assciated with that discourse act, thereby enriching EFL learners' repertoire to perform that discourse act. Second, such investigation offer important insights into the phraslogical tendency f language use, in paticular that i shft our undrstanding f phraseology from lexicogrammatical patterning towards discourse-semantic pattening. Third, the investigation into EFL learners and expert writers use of discourse acts alows one to diagnose what problems or difficulties EFL learners may have in performing such discourse acts and therefore to further offr pedagogical implications for academic writing teaching (especiall in EFL contexts).

Although studies have discussed the respective pedagogical value of pattern grammar, construction grammar, and local grammar in EAP context, few attempts have yet been made to adequately explore their applications for EAP writing teaching. In the case of construction grammar, Caal et al. (202) similarly note that, although constructions, especially VACs, have been the focus of recent research adopting a usage-based approach to language teaching and leaning, limited attention has been paid to VACs in academic writing pedagogy. Furthermore, it also appears that there have been even fewer studies that explored how patterns and constructions can be incorporated into EAP teaching and measured the teaching outcomes, indicating that more lasroom intervention is needed. Therefore, in the present study we combine the three approaches and explore their value in EAP writing research and pedagogy. We take the V that patte as the starting point and showcase how local grammar analyes of the patten can facilitatethidentification of constructions and the subsequent development of constructicon. The pedagogical implications and applications of this kind of research in EAP writing pedagogy will also be discussed.

# 4. Corpus and data retrieval

For the current investigation, we complied a corpus by collecting Linguisics reearch articles published between 2010 and 2019 in ten leading international journals. These journals cover wide range of subfieds of Linguisics, such as applied linguistics, semantics, pragmatics, cognitive linguistics etc. (see Table 3). Briely, we decided to select Linguistics research articles as the academic gnre of focus because they primarily function to construct and disseminate new knowledge or findings (Bazerman, 1988). This means that academic writers need to frequently use the reporting pattern V that to either report observations or findings made in existing studies or those drawn in their own research, which leads to Hyland's (2002) argument that reporting is an important convention of academic writing. Indeed, other studies such as Charles (2006a) also found that reporting clauses are considerably more frequent in social science disciplines than in disciplines of natural sciences, and Gray (2015) observed higher use of verb complement clauses in hu. manities and social ciences but lower use in hard sciences. Furthermore, we selected research articles published in these ten leading journals because of their high impact in their respective subfields. These properties ensure that research articles sampled in the study are highly representative of aademic writing in the field of Linguistics. At this point, it should be mentioned that the L1 backgrounds of the authors of these sampled articles were not considered in the process of data collection, because all published article in these top-ranking journals have been rigorously peer reviewed and carefully edited after acceptance, and as such language use in these articles is acceptable to the academic community. The metainformation of the corpus is given in Table 3.

We then uploaded the corpus to Sketch Engine (ilgarrff e al., 2004) for data processing. We searched for the V that pattern and. for the sake of manageability, analysed those verbs which occurred more than ten times in our corpus. This procesleft us 57 verbs, amounting to 4343 instances. Table 4 provides the basic information of these verbs.

Three ssues concerning data retrieval need to be further clarified. The first relates to the decision to omit cases of that omission. This is partly because research has shown that retention of that is the norm in academic writing (Charles, 2006a; Hyland & Tse, 2005), although omissinof that complementiser is possbl. Ationally, this is also due to technical problems, as it i quit challenging for computerise search to exhaustively identify instances of V that (especiall in a relatively large corpus such as the one used in the present study) if the that-indicator is absent In our future research we will explore if parsers like the Stanford NLP or SPACY could help overcome this problem.

The second issue is concerned with the identification of instances genuinely realises theV that pattern. In Section 2 we discussed the criteriafor pattern identificatin: frequency, co-selection of word choices, and meaning deendency (Hunston & Francis, 200). In other words, the identification of a pattern does not only rely upon the frequency of the co-occurrence between a verb and the that-clause, but more importantly the meaning has to be dependent upon the co-occurrence between the verb and the that-clause. Indeed, a manual scan of our data confirms that although some verbs frequently co-occur with a that-clause, they do not qualify as instances of the that ptte Take v that as an xample. In the instance This s of partir inteest iven that the signers come from backgrounds that usediffeent scripts, the verb given was not used to project an idea or argument and that was not used to introduce a complement clause. This is also true for other cases such as seem that and 'rovDe that, which are not considered as instances instantiating the V that pattern in the present study.

The final issue has to do with the pattern it be V-ed that. Basically, this pattern means that the verb (V) is preceded by an intrctry t anderb i s te and is fw y ahatcse as in t hs b gtth m stt of rise rise from a conast between the expectation . While this patten has been analysed as the pasive form of V that in studes such as Charles (2006a, 2006), westrictl followed Francis et al's (1996: 526-528) description and considered it as a istinct paen. In other words instances of it be V-ed that were excluded out of the present study.

# 5.1. Local grammar analyses of V that

As discussed in Section 2, the peculiarity of local grammar research is that it uses context-specific and functionally transparent terms to analyse the corresponding syntactic units. It must be noted that such terms were first identified based on preliminary sample analyses, and further revised throughout the whole process of data analyses. evetheles, when we intily attempted to perform the local grammar analyses of V that, we drew on insights from the terms used in Charles's (2006a, 2006b) analyses of reporting clauses and frame elements in FrameNet (https://framenet.icsi. berkeley.du/about) lthough we also observed that in most cases the kind of frame elements used in frame semantics does not apply to our local grammar analyses of those verbs co-occurring with the V that pattern in the genre of academic writing).

With regard to the analyses, we divided instances of theV that pattern into thre components: the nominal group on the left of the node pattern, the verb, and the that-clause. For the nominal group ocurring on the let of the node pattern, we identified six types of functional categories, three of which indicate the source of a given information (e.g., argument, statment). Specifially, based on Charles (2006b) observation that reporting clauses can be used to either report other researchers work or the writer's own work, we made the distinction between Source-external' and 'Source-internal', as illustrated in examples (3)-(5).

(3) Scheurich (1995: 241) argues that we need to take more acount of complexity, uniqueness, and the indeterminateness of..   
(4) This article argues that this is achieved through interviewer turns that are predominantly assessment oriented.   
(5) We argue that such meanings need to be taken seriously.

In Example 3, the write attributes the argument to Scheurich, whereas in Examples (4) and (5), the argument was attributed to This article and We, i.e, the writer him/herself, which were thus labelled 'Sourceexternal' and Source-internal respectively. Ths also means that Source-external' was roughly indicated by the presence of citation and that Source-internal was normally realised by wordings such as I, we, this article, this study, the current research etc.

In addition to the above two types of sources, we also observe a third type, namely, research-participant. For example.

(6) When interviewed, the teachers in Duff& Polio's study (1990) suggested that they were more likely to use the learners own language ...

In Example (6), the source of the suggestion is the teachers being interviewed, who served as the research participants involved in Duff & Polio's study. Hence, we analysed the teachers as 'Research-participant'.

In addition to these animate subjects, the nominal group occurring on the left of the node patterV that may also refer to inanimate ones, such as table, data, analysis, requirement, criteria etc, as illustrated in examples (7)-(9).

(7) The data shows that speakers switch to SA for eight main reasons.   
(8) These results suggest that pronunciation during interaction warrants more investigation.   
(9) The linguistic selection criteria ensured that the four participants had no language in common at the beginning of the research period.

In example (7), the data is a kind ofeidence that causes the writer to make interpretation. We thus lablle it as Evidence, which was typicy ali  rerh ouns , the dt, th yis) nd texl nuns ., th tble, th fige). In conrst, in Example (8) the writer is not making any interpretation about evidence, but about results, which was thus labelld Finding. Example (9) is different in that the subject The linguisic selection criteria is kind of something that makes sure something else happen or causes something else to happen, which was thus labelled 'Causer'.

In above we have discussed the semantics of the subject of instances intantiating the that pattern. The remaining is the semantics of the verb and the that-clause, which is relatively simpler to analyse. Our local grammar analyses suggest that these verbs can be grouped in sen semanic catrie (cf. Chare, 2006a, 2006b, rancis e al., 196): GE, FIND, CASE--ERR, csE--APPEN, THINK, HTHESE an sTA and, crrpnigy, the tht-clase intNT, FINDNG, ERRION, ECr, OUGHT, YTHESIs and STATEmeNr. Based on the above discussion, we can summarise the analytic framework for a local grammar analysis f V that i Fig. 1. Using the analytic framework, we then performed the local grammar analyses of the V that pattern and presented the results in Table 5.

# 5.2. Patterns, local grammars, constructions, and constructicor

As shown in Table 5, the analyses led to 18 local grammars patterns. These local grammar patterns bring together form (i.e, the V that pattn), meaning elements (eg, EvDENCE, cAsE-roRPRr, RIoN) and fuction (e.g., rorting finding, interpreting evidence), representing form-meaning-function pairings. Our argument here is thus that the kind of form-meaning-function comb. nation or, more simply pattern-meaning combination, offered by local grammars can be recognised as candidate constructions (see also Hunston, 2019; Hunston & Su, 2019). Specifially, pattrns 1, 17 and 18 can be interpreted asCause-to-interpret construction, in which research evidence was presented and causes one to interpret it Patterns 2, 4 and 13 can be interpreted as Finding-reporting construction, which was used to either report the writer's own finding or findings drawn by other research(ers). Patterns 3 and 5 can be interpreted as Argument-making construction, in which the writer either report his/her own argument or the argument made in other studies. The remaining patterns can be similarly interpreted: Pattern 6 as Finding-interpreting constructin, patterns 7, 15 and 16 as 'Statement-making' construction; patterns 8, 10 and 14 as Mental-state-recounting construction; patterns 9 and 12 as 'Hypothesis-making' construction; and pattern 12 as 'Cause-to-happen' construction.

As our aim is not only to identify constructions, but also to develop constructicon, we follow Hunston and Su's (2019) and Hunston's (2019) discussion and propose a way to describe these constructions so that they can be organised as a network of constructicon. Take the Cause-to-interpret construction as an example. One form associated with his construction is the grammar pattern V that it function is to report how one interprets some sort f research evidence; and at the discourse-semantic level, its meaning elements include VIDENCE', AusE-ro-NERPREr, ERPRETAnION' and soURcE'. Our corpus analysis also allows us to provide quantitative information, ie, frequency, for each verb occurring in this construction. Bringing together the above discussion, the constructicon description of this construction is illustrated in Table 6.

To further illustrate, in Table 7 we present the constructicon description of the 'Argument-making' construction.

Because of space constraints, we cannot present the constructicon description for all constructions identified in the present study. Nevertheless each construction can be described in the same way as shown in Table 6 and 7 Drawing on the concept of hierarchy of constructicon (e.g., Wible & Tsao, 2020), we can further group these constructions into three broad categories, i., communication (communicating information), action indicating acts or actions) and cognition (reporting mental state). Fig 2 shows the construction network, i.e., the constructicon, developed in the present study.

# 5.3. Implications and applications

Fig. 2 presents thesystem network of the that pattern, its local grammar patterns and the constructions identified I also provides lists of verbs and their frequency of occurrence in each construction. These would have important theoretical implications for construction research and pedagogical applications for EAP writing pedagogy. The theoretical implications relate to the identification of constructions and development of constructicon. As mentioned earlier, construction grammar holds that language is not a system of grammatical rules, but a network of constructions at various levels of schematicty/abstraction and of varying size and complexity. However, as constructions range from morpheme and word to structures and discourses or even genres, current research on construction grammar has not adequately adressed the question as to how constructions can be comprehensively identified. Whil the study reported in this paper cannot entirely olve this problem either, i offers one possible solution to identify one particular type of construction, i.e., mid-level constructions, by which Hunston and Su (2019) refer to those constructions which are neither to general nor too specific as discussed in Section 1. Examples of mid-lel construction include Goldberg's (2006) caused-motion' construction (e.g, shesnezed the napkin off the table), 'causativeinto' construction (eg, they trapped him into a confession), or the Argu. ment-making construction identified in the present study. Our study shows that local grammar analyses of grammar patterns help to identify patten-meaning combination that can be subsequently interpreted as constructions, thereby efectively facilitating the identification of such mid-level constructions in a systematic and principled manner.

Furthermore, the analyses show that local grammar research involves more than equating a syntactic structure with a semantic

pattern, rather, it helps to reeal thedifferent functions or readings aiven gramatic sttre can ave (ee aso Teubert, 2007). In other words, local grammar analysis allows one to distinguish expressions that lok structurall alike but have diffrent semantic readings. In the case f that, for example, the lol gammar analyses alow us to identif 18 pattens at the discourse-semanc lel. which were in turn interpreted as seven constructions. Based on their semantic association, these constructions are further organised into a network, showing how constructions identified by analysing grammar patterns from a local grammar perspective can contribute to the development of constructicon. I is in these respects that we argue that combining pattern grammar and local grammar can be useful for construction grammar research.

More importantly, the constructions identified and the constructicon developed could have useful pedagogical applications for EAP writing pedagogy (se also Hunston, 2019; Hunston & Su, 2019). In fact, existing studies have discussed comprehensively the pedagogical value of patern grammar, construction grammar, and local grammar. For istance, Hunston and Francis (2000) argued that pattern grammar can be a useful resource to enrich vocabulary learning and increase accuracy and fluency of language production. Recent research in construction grammar has similarly emphasised the applied or pedagogical value of constructions (e.g., Boas, 2022; De Knop & Gilquin, 2016). For instance, Holme (2010: 117) argues that

"our notion of the construction should shape both the 'what' and the how' of teaching. The what' consists of the language content that our notion of a construction identified. It also means deciding whether to treat it as a productive grammatical pattern or a closely specified lexical form. The how' originates in the principle of the embodied cognition from which the form and meaning of the symbolic complex have been fashioned and through which they will be learnt".

using local grammar patterns to develop a thesaurus-like constructicon, and Su (2020) discussed how findings of local grammar research can be used to develop pedagogical materials for English language teaching.

The present study has further explored the pedagogical applications of this line of research. We argue that the kind of constructicon developed in the preent study can be applied into academic writing teaching at least i the following ways.First it ofers an inventory of form-meaning-function pairings, i., a constructicon, available to express meanings or to perform functions. For instance, the local grammar analyses sugest that V that can be associated with seven functions, with each has its own discourse-semantic patterns and variations. This provides much richer information for the paterns or phraseologies learners may encounter, because learners need to know what functions they are likely to need to express what forms most apropriately fulfil those functions, and what variation those forms permit when they are fitted into specific contexts" (Durrant & Mathews-Aydinh, 2011, p. 61). Moreover, the construction network also ofers frequency information about each verb when used to expres a specific meaning, as shown in Fig.2. In other words, the constructicon can help to enrich students' lexicogrammatical choices such as verbs and constructions, in particular highlighting "which meanings are most typically construed by which construction and, what the most common lexical items are in each construction' (Ellis et al., 2016, p. 273).

Following the above discussion, the second pedagogical application of the constructicon developed relates to academic vocabulary teaching and learning. In fact, Green (2019: 2) already noted that "Ip]attern grammar and construction grammar, in particular the notion of mid-level constructions, provide a meaningful framework from which to study academic vocabulary'. Unlike Gren (2019) who focused primarily on describing the grammatical patterns associated with academic vocabularie, the present study has brought this further by, on the one hand, providing the frequency ofa given verb in a given construction, thereby raising leners awareness of the assciation between verbs and constructions. On the other hand, the study offers pairings of verbs and local grammar pattern. s/constructions, thereby adding a discourse-semantic dimension to the uses of academic vocabularies. We argue that these can deepen learners' understanding of target vocabularies and therefore substantially contribute to learning academic vocabularies.

Third, the constructicon developed can be usefully incorporated into the design and development of academic writing teaching materials. Herbst (2016) proposed several principles for pedagogical construction grammar. Particularly relevant to the present study is that language learning consists of the learning of constructions" and therefore language teaching should consist of the teaching of constructions", and that "since constructions are form-meaning parings, they should be presented as such' (Herbst, 2016, p. 41). He further suggests that teaching materials \*be based on the analysis of corpora or on reference works based on corpus analysis and the frequency of constructions should be reflected in the design of teaching materials" (Herbst, 2016, p. 41). In a similar vein, Elli et al. (2016: 272) noted that \*It)eaching materials should focus more on typical associations of lexical items and constructions and emphasize patterns in form-meaning relations'. As shown in Fig. 2, the kind of constructicon developed in the present study not only adequately documents and describes the form-meaning-function pairings, but also ffers quantitative information of each construction and each verb occurrng in a given construction, thereby providing information that is fundamentalfr designing and developing academic writing teaching materials.

Overal, our study corroborates with the argument that language teaching and learning should \*acknowledge the pervasivenes of constructions more than it currently does" (Romer et al., 2014: 967), which in turn points to the need to find ways in which con. structions can be systematiclly identifid and described. In the present study we propose that the integration of pattern grammar, local grammar and construction grammar represents one possible way to do so. Our study offers a nuanced description of the V that pattern, its associated local grammar paterns and the constructions, which not only has theoretical implications for construction grammar research but, more notably, pedagogical applications for academic writing teaching, as discussed above. The present study, then, demonstrates the feasibility and value of our proposed approach for EAP writing research and pedagogy.

# 6. Conclusion

The study has explored the possibility and feasbility of integrating pattern grammar, local grammar and construction grammar into EAP writing research and pedagogy It proposes that local grammar analyse of grammar patterns could facilitate the identification of constructions and the subsequent development of constructicon, which in turn has important theoretical implications for construction grammar research and, more notably, pedagogical applications for academic writing teaching. In particular we noted that the construction network developed in the present study offers an inventory of form-meaning-function pairings availableto expres meanings, which can be incorporated into the development of academic writing teaching materials. We also pointed out that the construction network provides quantitative information about verbs occurring in each construction, which helps to raise leaners awareness of the association between verbs and constructions. These would indicate that our proposed approach can be regarded as an alternative methodology to EAP writing research and pedagogy.

The study reported in this paper can beextended in many ways. For instance, the study has only analysed the V that patten and let other frequently occurring patterns (e.g., N that, itv-link ADJ that/to-inf.) in academic discourse unexplored. One direction for future research is thus to perform local grammar analyses of other highly frequent pattrns and to systematise the constructions that can be identified threby. Moreover, the study focused on the discipline of Linguistics. As studies have shown that language use varies according to disciplines (e.., Chares, 2006a; Hyland, 2002), another important direction for future reearch is to extend the proposed approach to exploreV that (and other frequent patterns) in other disciplines and, furthermore, disciplinary variations with regard to the uses of patterns and constructions. This would be of great value for disciplinary academic writing teaching. Third, future study can employ the proposed approach to explore learner writing and compare learners use of patterns and constructions with that f expert writers, so as to diagnose the problem or difficulty learners may encounter in academic writing practice. Finall, it would also be worthwhil to explore how findings of the kind of research reported in this paper can be incorporated into the development of EAP teaching materials and the efectivenes of such materials in EAP teaching practice. Arguably, all these lines of research can signifi cantly contribute to EAP writing research and pedagogy.
